00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,480
Hi everyone, Ben Thany St. Tano here, the worst procrastinator. Welcome to episode 221.

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,680
We're coming up on a 222, we're coming up on a milestone. Anyway, with me today, finally,

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not lonely this time. I've been saved. I've been saved from a shallow grave, Gibbontake.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,120
Hey guys, I could have been on last week's episode, but I thought, I thought, uh, better

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,720
or not. I saw Ben Saint there and I was like, you know what, I'll let him dig his own grave this

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,760
time. I added everyone and you were like, no, I don't have anything to say, so I'm not gonna be on

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,040
The Pro Crastinators Podcast this week. And I was like, that's never stopped me. I know.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
And then we got Tom Oliver. The Pro Crastinators Podcast Incorporated would like to issue a

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,040
formal apology for having such an embarrassing show last week. Not all of the Pro Crastinators,

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,160
like we're not a unified front on that. Once you know under capitalism, corporations are people,

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,240
so the corporate entity is speaking right now, disconnected from all of us.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,320
I would like to apologize for taking so long to give the people what they've been waiting

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,800
for with the solo Ben cast, baby. Um, oh God, this, I just realized we haven't recorded a bonus

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,280
episode this month, have we? No. Are we gonna? I guess. Nate's been MIA and everything's falling

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,200
apart. We gotta do it. Are you guys robotting out or is that me? That's you. Shit, yeah, you guys

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,360
sound like crap. Okay, but we can make do. Uh, uh, so, uh, we should, I guess maybe after the episode,

17
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,280
we should talk about a bonus episode, but, but, but, but okay, but okay, we don't have to talk

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,960
about that right now. That's inside baseball. How's your guys week been? How's everything going?

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,880
How are you, how are you feeling? I'm feeling emotions. Um, yeah. Uh, all right, here's, here's

20
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,760
my one big announcement, and it's not an announcement. It's just sort of like a thing that's been on

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,920
my mind. A while ago I said, I'm going to do the Tezuka manga submission thing. And I still am.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm still trucking along, trying my best. Um, but I think all of July and June has been

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,880
like, like snails pace slower than the slowest, slow guy that could ever be considered someone

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,600
who is trying to do art is me. Uh, play, play the Gibbs stupid fucking idiot corner, uh, jingle

25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:57,120
again. While I said that this is the stupid idiot corner. Are you stupid idiot dude? Is that a

26
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,240
re, is that a real jingle? It is. I assume it is. Do we have a real jingle for that? I think we honestly

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,880
do. Yeah. Good. Okay. I think we do. I don't, I don't listen to the show. So I don't know what,

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,080
what, what goes on here. No sane person should. And yet we are, he is, and yet we're not sane people.

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,760
So you think we would listen to it. Um, but uh, fucking I, I've been dragging my feet. I listen

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,560
to the show in the extent that I get in the call, I wait for everyone else to stop talking so that

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,840
it's my turn. And then I start talking until I can't say anymore. And then I, and then I tune

32
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,720
out and listen for another silence to fill. That's, that's the extent of my engagement.

33
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm a very good listener. Clearly. Shut up, shut up.

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
I was dragging my feet. I was, I was getting all anxious because like the closer it gets to the

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,520
deadline, the, the more likely it is that I'm not going to be finished in time. And over, hanging

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,280
over my head was the fact that I had said publicly, I'm going to, I'm going to make it. I'm going to

37
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:14,880
do it. And, and that like singular thing, I think was like dragging me down more than anything

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,680
else was this idea that I had said publicly that I'm going to do this thing. And if I fail,

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,160
if I don't reach the deadline, um, then, uh, everything will be like terrible and I will be

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,400
a laughing stock and people will kick me out and onto the streets and they will say, give you shit,

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,720
you suck. And I was like, Oh no, that can't possibly be the way this goes. Uh, and so that

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,440
seized me up. And I was just sort of depressed for two months because as soon as I had one problem

43
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,040
that sort of hampered my, you know, creative flow, I didn't get in, I didn't, I didn't think

44
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,600
right. Uh, the anxiety of not getting it done forced me to just get worse and worse until I was

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,880
just not, I was catatonic. My, my headphones cut out for a minute there. What was the hurdle? What

46
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,320
was the, the problem that you were? The, the hurdle was that I, uh, well, I mean, literally I, I just

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,680
hadn't been, I've been trying to write a story and I just wasn't happy with it for a long time.

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,200
And I just also, you know, wasn't doing any of the, the writing like sitting down with a pencil

49
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,720
and paper and trying to write something, just nothing was coming. And so as the time ticked on

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,480
became more and more like anxious, like if I fail, it's, it would be, it will look bad. It would be

51
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,280
a bad look. And the, the fear of a bad look got me even more anxious and made it harder to come up

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,800
with stuff. But finally, I think I've come up with a story that I like, um, that has like a,

53
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,120
an structure and it's good. It's just, how long, how long is it? How long is it?

54
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,440
I don't know how long it will be. Um, I'm not, I've never really been good with like translating

55
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:11,280
story to comic page count. Gameplay. Okay. But, uh, I'm, I mean, I, I, I think if it's the 55 maximum

56
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,480
page count, um, I probably won't be able to get it done within the next month, unless I draw

57
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,800
constantly and hurt my hand. 55 pages in a month would be, you would, I mean,

58
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,000
uh, that's a lot. That's, that's, that's just preparing you for the, uh, the show and jump

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,480
life. You know, that's just what your life becomes at that point. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you gotta,

60
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,880
you gotta get, uh, you gotta give, um, you gotta hire an assistant. You gotta hire an

61
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,080
assistant is what you gotta do. Yeah. The thing really was that, uh, I was going downer and downer,

62
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,040
getting more and more depressed and anxious about the fact that I would be labeled a failure by my,

63
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,600
I don't know who, I guess, like the, the, the amorphous blood that is the public

64
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,200
and, and that would kill me inside. And then one day I was just like,

65
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:15,280
like, you know, why am I sad? I'm not dead. Everything's kind of all right. It's, it's just,

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,640
it doesn't matter. And then, then after that, like two days after that, I came up with a story. So it

67
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,120
really was entirely like the deadline that was killing me, the, the, the fear of failing the

68
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:36,400
deadline. And that's my story. Don't ever put a deadline on yourself. Ever. Ever. It's always bad.

69
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:46,960
Yeah, I absolutely agree with that dog. Uh, um, I, I mean, I, I think I've, I, I can relate

70
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,720
a bit recently, um, for a while. I just, I just couldn't muster up the motivation to, or not

71
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
the motivation, just couldn't, or just like the focus, like couldn't generate the focus

72
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,560
to like make, to make the slime and punishment finale. I don't know. And then I, uh, I don't

73
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,640
know, at some point I was just, and then like the longer I went without sitting and doing it,

74
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,400
the more I felt like, Oh, I hate it. I hate thinking about it. I don't want to think about it

75
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
because it makes me feel bad to remember that I should have done this a week ago or a month ago

76
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,840
or whatever. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I still haven't like sketched like any of the pages. I've still

77
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,880
have sketches from way back when it was a different story. And, uh, that could use, I could reuse

78
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,320
some of those, but like in terms of like what I can show nothing, I have nothing to show yet,

79
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,000
which seems bad, but I, um, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of over it. I'm just going to make what I make

80
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,160
when I come up with you and it will be whatever it is. Maybe you already do this. And if so,

81
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:58,720
I apologize for mansplaining. Um, but, uh, you should consider trying like make like

82
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,480
consciously making the effort to draw as little as possible. Do you do that already?

83
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you know what I mean? I've talked about this before. Like in the comics, like as few

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,040
backgrounds as possible, include as little of the character as possible. Oh no, my, my philosophy

85
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,160
ever since, uh, uni where I learned this from a specific animator that I can't remember the name

86
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,600
of, but he like, I think he is like the creator of like rhubarb and custard, this old TV show.

87
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,720
Rhubarb and custard sounds delicious. It's just like a dog and a kid. I don't remember.

88
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,680
Um, but like the animation style, I think was the guy, that was the guy, um, was like

89
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:46,000
so minimalist and yet worked so perfectly. Um, and his, his philosophy, which is I, what I adopted

90
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,840
for, for all of my films that I made during uni was, uh, to just try to like the best thing you

91
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,440
could do as an animator is get away with drawing as little as possible and, uh, you know, making

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,240
doing as little as work as possible to get the maximum effect because you don't need

93
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
robbery. Like if you're, if you're drawing a background, why are you doing that? You don't

94
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,280
need to, it doesn't exist. You don't have to draw the background if you, if it's not relevant to

95
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,920
what's being shown, if you only draw the things that actually need to be there. And I'm like,

96
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,560
yeah, I really enjoy that frame of mind. One, because it's easier and two, because when it comes

97
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,440
to like slogging away at a background and I'm drawing trees with leaves on them, I'm like,

98
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,960
I don't give a fuck about this tree. Why am I drawing all of these leaves on it?

99
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,640
I don't care about this tree. I care about the guy in the foreground saying,

100
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,640
fuck the world. Like that's the part of the story that's important.

101
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,680
It's based, it's based because yeah, it's, it's easier and it's more, and yeah, you focus more on

102
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
like the things that matter in the story are probably the things that you care about. And so

103
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,360
you'll be drawing, you draw the things that matter. And also just because it's easier, you know,

104
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,920
you finish more stuff faster. And every time you finish a page, you're like,

105
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,120
yes, I did it. I done it. I got it. I got the serotonin. I got the whatever brain chemicals.

106
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,080
And then you can, you get more of that faster and faster until you're a fucking

107
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,560
junkie for it until you're a speed junkie. If you know what I'm saying,

108
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,320
yes. That's the plan. That's the plan. Yeah. Yeah, based. Yeah, based.

109
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,160
But also, I mean, that I think I've explained before that my character designs are all like

110
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,720
minimalist. Like the current like, if you know the Clarissa design that I've posted on Twitter

111
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,600
a million years ago, she doesn't have, she has hair covering her face because I don't like drawing

112
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,200
faces. You can't see her eyes. That's the best way for a character to be. They just have a little

113
00:11:49,200 --> 00:12:00,080
mouth. That's it. Drawing eyes can be a little, I think I like drawing eyes. I think I tend,

114
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,400
yeah, no, I like it. No, you're stupid. No, that's dumb, dude. No, you fucked up.

115
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,840
If you look a pump, she's got triangle eyes. She doesn't have pupils.

116
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,240
Alley Oop is like the very easy, malleable like cartoon circle with a bigger, smaller,

117
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,280
dark circle in the middle. A lot of ghosts are the same. I like things that are really simple

118
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:36,240
looking. Back in the pony days, when I had to draw an eye, I learned how to draw that big pupil

119
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,640
with the big iris and the big like, like, like shiny, shiny spots reflecting the light on the

120
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,040
surface. And I, and I really enjoyed like the depth of it. I really enjoyed the like, oh yeah,

121
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,000
you can, you know, it's actually not that hard to like make it look like, yeah, this is like a big

122
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,600
fucking like shiny, shiny slime hole in like an eyeball. And like, it looks great. And you love it.

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,120
I think there's been time, I think there are a couple frames in the champion where I went too

124
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,080
far and I made like some characters look like really weird, have really weird like way too big

125
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,000
pupils and eyes. I'm thinking of that specifically, that one, what was his name, Damien. Damien,

126
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,840
there was the one I was thinking of. I think I went back and changed because I looked back

127
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,680
because like his eyes are fucked. I went too hard. I fucking remember talking to you about

128
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,000
that eye and you said, no, what's wrong with it? I, yeah, I think it took, it took a few people

129
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,880
mentioning it to me for me to be like, oh, maybe, maybe multiple people. He's just, he's just,

130
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,120
he's just so cutesy big eyes. Like, he, I don't think he looked cute. That was the thing. He

131
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,080
didn't look cute, but it looked like he was supposed to be cute. Right. Yeah, it was like a weird,

132
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:02,320
you know, whatever, whatever. I drew like a 65 page comic and I had one bad panel, exactly one.

133
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:10,560
That means my batting average is insanely high. So many hits, no misses, effectively no misses,

134
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,240
vanishingly small number. And then over on my comic is no bad panels in any of the things I've

135
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,280
done ever. So, you know, no, that's, they're all bad. They're all bad panels. They're all bad

136
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,600
panels over at gibbentake.site. See, the secret is you can't have bad panels if you don't draw

137
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:42,400
panels at all. You could. No, no, you're right. Shit. Fuck. Owned again. Art is once again,

138
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,160
the problem and not the solution. Tom, remember when you spent like a year modeling that room

139
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,000
to put in the comic? No, no, I don't. I don't remember this. You're kidding. Wait, no, for

140
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Sorcerer's lost. You do. You do. That was when that was when you got into like the idea of using

141
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:09,440
3D. Yeah. Oh, the tavern. That didn't take, that took like a year. Wait, no. Yeah. Okay. I was,

142
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,040
I was exaggerating when I said a year, but like, I feel like there was like a whole,

143
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,040
it felt like to me, like for a long time, I was seeing like progress pictures of like

144
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,080
modeling the barrels and like, oh, putting the textures on the barrels and, and like, you know,

145
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,640
oh, like, oh, trying, like Poe trying to pose the character in the space, like trying to place the

146
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,560
scene in the panel or whatever. There was a couple like posts of just like putting out content,

147
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,800
but like the whole, the whole background was done in like a week was not very complicated.

148
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,680
So maybe, you know what? Maybe I mean, the real attack here is just that you spent,

149
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,200
you spent a week making a background and the comic never got finished. Like that's, that's,

150
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,200
that's really the pain point you want to go for. Yeah, you're right. So, you know what? I think I,

151
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,640
I think I just remember that whole, I remember that whole Sorcerer's lost era as like tavern era,

152
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,440
like, because I kept, I just kept seeing that tavern, like all the posts that were like tavern

153
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,840
related, you know? So I think maybe I just assumed you were modeling it the whole time,

154
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:21,520
but actually no. It was, it was done pretty, pretty swift. That was, that was an important

155
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,080
stepping stone to realizing polygons are better than pencils and pens, strictly better, strictly

156
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,040
superior. This is why we shouldn't allow them to teach computers in schools because it leads to

157
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,960
degeneracy, like not drawing comics in panels. Yes. I feel like the fall of Western civilization.

158
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,960
First, for the way that I tend to draw things, learning 3D would be far more difficult because

159
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,480
it takes like one second to draw Aliyup. It would take a while to model her. It takes me,

160
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,040
I think I'm with you on that. I think I can draw faster than I would be able to

161
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:09,680
do a background because I think I'm pretty good at the like, okay, if I do find myself having

162
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,880
draw like a big background, then that can take me forever. And it's a nightmare. But I would, I mean,

163
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,280
I don't know. It really depends on the background, right? Because if you're using, it does, if you're,

164
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,160
have a location you're going to like come back to throughout your entire series, it probably makes

165
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,480
sense to do a model or something of it. So you don't have to continue drawing it over and over

166
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,560
again, make sure that the layout stays consistent. But if you're just like going to a place for a

167
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,120
chapter, just fucking draw it. Yeah. Yeah, usually that's, that's what I mean. Usually it's enough

168
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,760
to draw a background once. And then from then on, you can just do characters, maybe with like one

169
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,560
object, maybe with like one or two, like very minimal like background details to like sort of

170
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,480
remind you of where you are. I feel like, like a flow plan would be more useful to refer to

171
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:04,000
because like if, yeah, I did do a floor plan of like Magda and Vincent's room before I started

172
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,960
the comic because I was like, okay, wait, where's, where's the bed? Where's the desk? Like, where's,

173
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,040
where's the coat rack? Where is everything in relation to each other? And then I always like

174
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,600
refer to it and just like to keep everything consistent. Because I'm thinking like, I feel

175
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:28,960
like you can tell when an image has been drawn using like a 3D, like tracing a 3D model.

176
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,360
Yeah. Because, because the, the, the camera that is used to capture it is always the same. Like

177
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,600
in, if you draw it, you could like add your own like weird angle to it and, and, and, and change

178
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,160
it in ways that 3D space cannot warp without looking silly.

179
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,240
Uh, you're right. That's true. I mean, you, you can tell more or less. I thought that Tom,

180
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,560
I thought that Tavern did a pretty good job of looking hand drawn from a lot of angles,

181
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,760
but yeah, you're right that you can.

182
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,080
Uh, do you remember that there's a while ago, I remember the fucking Joe Joe's bizarre adventure

183
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,800
anime was 3D now. And there was a behind the scenes look at one of the poses from the opening

184
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,880
or something. And they had to completely break the model in order to fit the arm in the way that

185
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,040
he was posing it on, uh, in, in the camera angle. Because 3D don't work like that.

186
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
Well, I mean, technically in the drawing, you're breaking his arm too. It's just,

187
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,880
you can draw whatever you want. So.

188
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,880
Yeah. I'm not, I'm not just saying like 3D is bad, but I'm like, I'm, I find there's,

189
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,440
there's too much of a coward to say that Tom, you're a freak. You've, you've, you've left the

190
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,000
path of wisdom. The third dimension man was not meant to meddle in the third dimension.

191
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,560
All right. I think it might be blasphemous.

192
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Well, I spite God.

193
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,640
Fuck. Damn it. I hate it when people spite God.

194
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Hey, hey, Ben.

195
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Hey, Ben, atheism.

196
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
No, shut up.

197
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Shut up.

198
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,480
Don't say that. Eleazar.

199
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
They don't call him Ben Saint.

200
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Say three Hail Marys.

201
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Hail Mary, full of grace.

202
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Secular.

203
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Seccy Row.

204
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Wait, what?

205
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Huh?

206
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Video games?

207
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Video games.

208
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,480
This week, every time I go downstairs, every time I see, I go downstairs, I see one of them playing

209
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,520
Bug Blast and they're getting all their, getting all those bugs all over, rolling around in the bugs.

210
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
That's unfortunate.

211
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
But I don't know. It is what it is.

213
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
And then I look and I go.

214
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
I go to video games.

215
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
I look at the, I look at the guy.

216
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,760
I think of the games that I'm a fan of, like nostalgic for, that I grew up on.

217
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm like, oh, oh, I love a diso game.

218
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
And then I hear, I hear the common consensus, generally disparaging.

219
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Game bad. Game bad.

220
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Game bad, game not so good, actually.

221
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
If you think about it, it sucks.

222
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
And I'm like, I'm like, no, no.

223
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Clearly.

224
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Hey, idiot, clearly you've never actually thought about that game you like.

225
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Because if you did, you would know it was bad.

226
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,400
So I'm like, oh no, my childhood, my favorite games being destroyed.

228
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
My problematic faves.

229
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:48,400
And I listen to these videos, these analysis, these critiques, these people, these genuine humans.

230
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
And I hear them say these things.

231
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm like, that can't be the fucking case.

232
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
This is unfair. This is wrong.

233
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
And then I realize that I agree with everything they're saying because it's very well-argued.

234
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,400
And I slump down in my chair and I'm like, there's no hope for this world.

235
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,400
There's no hope for me because there's no way I can argue myself out of this paper bag.

236
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
There's no, there's no.

237
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
All you gotta do, Gib, just to be like, yeah, I agree, but I like it anyways.

238
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,400
I know, but it's so annoying to have been on the wrong side of history.

239
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
By not being a Mario fan or something stupid like that.

240
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
There's a wrong side of history in that case.

241
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
It's all personal preference.

242
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
You can, like, whatever the fuck you want.

243
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
I know, but I do like the critiques and analysis.

244
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,400
So it comes up, like, compared to, like, the length and breadth of the video game sphere,

245
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,400
all of the games that came out in this year and all of the games of this genre, this particular one, my favorite,

246
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
is the ugly duckling and the one that nobody likes and nobody remembers.

247
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
And it's like the awkward bunch, the awkward one of the bunch.

248
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,400
And I'm like, no, that's me. You're saying that about me.

249
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,400
But I don't have any argument to say, actually, it's good because it isn't good and they're right.

250
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
And I'm sitting here seething that me is not good.

251
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Me bad game. Me doesn't hold up.

252
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,400
And I throw my toys out of the pram and I jump around and I shit.

253
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Well, that's understandable.

254
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:34,400
If only if only I could have been a based devil may cry head and and everyone's be like, oh, that's a classic is I'll be like not in my head like, yeah, that's a classic.

255
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Instead, I'm sitting here being like, dude, shout out the hedgehog was good.

256
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, it wasn't.

257
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Dude, but but you got Russian clank. You got slide. You got like so many games.

258
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I do have a lot of games. I do. I do. But it's the few ones that I'm like everybody has that one game.

259
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
That wasn't good. I was wrong. No.

260
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
It's like that little feeling, the little feeling of like, oh, well, then, well, then.

261
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Then you just got to that's when you got to make a fucking video.

262
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Hey, guys, sorry, I haven't made a video in a while. I know, I know, I know.

263
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm going to be I'm going to be the the guy who defends that one game that everyone says.

264
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,400
But I think it's cool. But I'm too smart to do that because yeah, okay.

265
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Because I because I know I know in my heart of hearts that I am actually like if I look at it like in a really critical way, the only person that could like this is someone who is emotionally attached to it due to nostalgia and not because of that.

266
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:44,400
A lot of the time, a lot of the time that is just the case for certain things, not everything.

267
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I think so like there's no way to defend Shadow of the Hedgehog, but like in a way that is interesting or genuine question.

268
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Genuine question. I mean, do you not think there are things about it that made you like it?

269
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,400
That you could be like, well, here's what I like. I guess I could.

270
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,400
There are things that are good about it because I really responded to them and enjoy not arbitrarily but for a reason.

271
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Well, yeah, there is. I mean, it's not just Shadow of the Hedgehog.

272
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
That's just like the easiest go to example of this sort of thing.

273
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:23,400
But it's it's not that I couldn't make a video saying I like this game that most people don't like.

274
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,400
It's that I think that is it's not a defense of all of the things that people don't like about it.

275
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,400
And if I just say, here's the things I like and here's the things I don't like.

276
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
It's the same as all of the other videos that are critiquing it.

277
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
It's just that it comes from the other direction.

278
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Like I would say exactly the same things that everyone else says.

279
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,400
But you would just say but you're you're you're the number of points you assigned to each.

280
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Yeah, like the things I like count more than the things that other people like about the like overall me likey.

281
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:04,400
But running. There's this there's this YouTuber that I discovered not too too long ago, maybe a couple months ago called Running Shine.

282
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:15,400
And he has he doesn't have that many videos, but he has a re one of his really good ones is about Sonic Adventure, like the first one that everyone makes fun of.

283
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Because everyone's nostalgic for Sonic Adventure 2, but he has this long video explaining about how Sonic Adventure is awesome.

284
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
And it's a great video. And you know, he does he does.

285
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,400
He acknowledges like, okay, the yeah, the voice acting is pretty bad.

286
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
The delivery is pretty bad. The coaching is bad. The direction is bad.

287
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
However, the voices themselves are good and tales sound like a child.

288
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,400
And he points out a couple of instances were like, hey, in this part, the voice acting really works well and conveys an idea.

289
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,400
And here's why and he's like, there's what and you know, it's great.

290
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I fucking love running shine. He's he's sick.

291
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:57,400
He does that for like Tony Hawk's underground. He did one about he did one about Yic, although he was pretty negative about Yic or Y2K.

292
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm not sure how you actually see that game. You guys still there?

293
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Yeah, I'm talking to myself here.

294
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm just I'm just taking your advice and I'm tuning you out completely waiting for a silence so I can say something completely unrelated.

295
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,400
You've taught me how to podcast so well.

296
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:21,400
So now we've entered the era where the podcasting has become a game of chicken, where it's just how long can we get away with can we each get away with not talk?

297
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
How little can we say?

298
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,400
And just and just hope that someone else will fill the space.

299
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,400
That's what the bonus episode will be. Well, I'll just have to like, try and say as little as possible.

300
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Bonus episode. Like, who can endure the most awkward silence before having to break?

301
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I mean,

302
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
challenge except

303
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,400
not to be not to put not to put not to pull a major anything.

304
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
But do you guys want to hear about a dream I had?

305
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Oh, God. Oh, God. Is this what the bandcast was like? Is this the level of quality drop to the Ben?

306
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I think the Ben cast was short, sweet, terse to the point and get in, get out.

307
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
If efficient, get your money's worth.

308
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
That I delivered value for money.

309
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
What happened? What happened to you bringing up your dream?

310
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Less value for money, but value.

311
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Nonetheless, more smaller volume, higher density, greater overall.

312
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Smaller volume, higher price, you know.

313
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Yeah, you know, more, more air, less chips.

314
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Just don't think about it too much.

315
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Call it diet.

316
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,400
What happened to me was that I've been having a couple of really vivid dreams and I know exactly why.

317
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,400
It's because my sleep schedule got fucked up and I've been sleeping during daylight hours.

318
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,400
And, you know, when you, when you, when you're sleeping in the light, you're more likely to dream.

319
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,400
And also there was one time where like, I woke up and I was like, no, I'm going back to sleep.

320
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,400
I want to go to sleep even though I didn't need to sleep anymore.

321
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,400
And I kept trying to like force myself and I ended up like kind of drifting in and out and I had a bunch of dreams.

322
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:07,400
I had a dream about being in like a virtual reality Hogwarts sort of place.

323
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
And I put on a VR headset and everyone's face changed.

324
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:20,400
And I was like, I was playing like an A, an altered reality game in this like art deco fucking rapture looking ass school.

325
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,400
But the thing that was best about it were these beams of light that were shooting up from buildings into the sky.

326
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:36,400
They were like, they were like flat planes of light, these beams, and they would hit the clouds and they would reflect, refract through the clouds at cool angles.

327
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,400
And they looked sick. They looked sick.

328
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,400
That sounds like the Homestuck land.

329
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,400
That was land of beams art deco and beams.

330
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
That was the first stream.

331
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,400
And now I feel now I feel like that took overly long.

332
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,400
And now I'm afraid to get into the second one because I don't want to be boring.

333
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Well, I mean, nothing happened in the first stream.

334
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
You were in Harry Potter. What's the second?

335
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
It was mostly it was mostly it was mostly just about the scenery.

336
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
The second dream.

337
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,400
I this one made me feel really bad because I and it's not because of anything that like happened in it.

338
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,400
In the dream, I just had a good feeling.

339
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I felt a great sense of like excitement, purpose, that's depressing, camaraderie, friendship.

340
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah.

341
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
And it was great.

342
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
And that and when I woke up, I was like, devastated.

343
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I was like, it's gone.

344
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
None of it was real.

345
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I'm just in my room.

346
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,400
This this stream was like, I was in like a cave.

347
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,400
I was in like a cave system, but it was part of like a game.

348
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,400
It was part of like a like a puzzle game, like like one of those like trap rooms that like a bunch of people are in this cave.

349
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Or in the room and they have to like puzzle their way out.

350
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
But it was like a whole bunch of people.

351
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,400
It was like hundreds of people and we were all in this like cave system.

352
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Like searching through objects, solving puzzles.

353
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
There was some slime.

354
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,400
There was some slime in some places.

355
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
It was pretty cool.

356
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,400
And like I walked over there was a big cavern that sort of had water in the ground and I walked around the corner and I found I walked through a little tunnel at the end.

357
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:32,400
And I found like the the final room in the in the place and I had this like this like computer console on the wall and there was like a code to be solved in there and I didn't know how to solve the code.

358
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,400
I was like, it's some kind of like Sudoku block puzzle thing.

359
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:42,400
And like when you put certain blocks together, the blocks like sort of and then they resolve into like a part of an object, but the objects can complete.

360
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,400
And you have to create the whole object by putting all these blocks, but they often have to have to match numbers.

361
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
And I was like, this is too hard. I can't do it.

362
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
But I was like, wait a minute.

363
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,400
It's okay because like we're all in here.

364
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
We're all in this together.

365
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
You know, we can all we can all put our heads together.

366
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Some like someone can solve.

367
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
It doesn't matter if I can't solve it.

368
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
You know, we're a team.

369
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
We're a community.

370
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:08,400
And somebody did and they put it together and the thing returned into a gun and somebody took and somebody had the object.

371
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:19,400
It was trying to resolve like this magic gun and somebody took the gun and fired it and firing the gun transformed the whole cave system into like or part of it into slime caves.

372
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
It was all slime.

373
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
There was all the walls were slime.

374
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
The pillars were slime.

375
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:30,400
There were still side rooms that had objects and then these and we were and there were suddenly there were like all these new objects appeared.

376
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,400
There were like VHS tapes and cassette tapes and books and papers and like binders.

377
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:46,400
And suddenly I knew that's like we have to find the right object and I start just picking up things like I'm in a VR game just picking up things and turning them over my hand and throwing and like which one of these is the right object.

378
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
This is like key.

379
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
This is key.

380
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
There's one more console puzzle.

381
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
We have to solve it.

382
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,400
We have to solve this puzzle and I need to find a ticket.

383
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,400
What I'm looking for is a ticket and I like a golden ticket.

384
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Like the Willy Wonka's factory and then I find something that's a piece of paper and I pick it up and I go to a guy like an old guy with glasses kind of like a chubby guy just like a random guy.

385
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I don't know.

386
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:24,400
He was he was very specific looking but but I have this piece of paper and I'm like hey is this the ticket and he's like this sucks.

387
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
I hate this.

388
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
He's like this.

389
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
He's like there is no ticket.

390
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
There is no game.

391
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,400
There never was and then I like and then everything goes dark.

392
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,400
It's black and there's like a sort of sense of there are some objects.

393
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I'm in some kind of room and I'm like this is a test.

394
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm I think to myself.

395
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
No, no, no.

396
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,400
This is a test of my resolve and I am meant to not believe that the game is not real because if I believe the game is not real.

397
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Then I lose so I have to believe in spite of the fact that it seems that the rug is being pulled out from under me and then like the lights came on and the room was gray and there were these figures they were all in a circle.

398
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,400
They were like low poly humans.

399
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
No faces.

400
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,400
They were all in a circle around me and they were like dancing.

401
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,400
And I'm and I'm looking around and I'm like, no, I just have to not believe it.

402
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
This is not real.

403
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
The game was real.

404
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
The cave was real.

405
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
The puzzles were real.

406
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
The slime was real.

407
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
So it's a gray room.

408
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:42,400
These gray figures are all dancing around me and I start to sing and I start to sing this very specific song and I woke up.

409
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Well, I and I sing the song like in spite of it to like show that like, I don't know, to like ward off whatever illusion this is because and then I wake up and I'm like, oh no, there was no kid.

410
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
He was right.

411
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,400
There never was a game or a cave or anything.

412
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
It was all an illusion.

413
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
In reality.

414
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Did I lose?

415
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Did I just lose the game?

416
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Did the doubt that the people were like the dream killers, they stopped you dreaming and you wake up.

417
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Yeah, or something.

418
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
And I have this I have this note.

419
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I have this this page of notes here.

420
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Like I woke up and I was like, this feels important.

421
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,400
And I wrote down all these notes, the notes that have our caves, slime room, puzzles, console timer.

422
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Last day, day before code crack console game become gun question mark unlock final day form searching through VHS tapes.

423
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Floppy's find a ticket.

424
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
No game never was everything great.

425
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Dancing figures in a circle.

426
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
This is a test.

427
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Start singing.

428
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Wake up.

429
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
I even I remember the song.

430
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,400
I remember the tune and I even like recorded myself singing it.

431
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
It's short.

432
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Would you have it?

433
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I'm going to be.

434
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah, I have it.

435
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
I could just sing it right now.

436
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
I would be really embarrassed.

437
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,400
It would what would be really embarrassing if this tune was just like a popular pop song.

438
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
And I just like, and it was like, oh, that's just some song.

439
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Like everybody knows that song.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
You idiot.

441
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
But but like if it is, I don't know it.

442
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Maybe I just heard a snippet of it.

443
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Okay.

444
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Should I should I sing my dream song?

445
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Yes, you're committed to the bit.

446
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
You have to conclude it.

447
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Okay, I'm nervous.

448
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
This is embarrassing.

449
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,400
But this is this was the dream song that I sang against these low poly gray figures that attempted that attempted to horn.

450
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Swaggle me into believing that all my work was for nothing.

451
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:41,400
It was like, it was like, um, I believe, I believe in what's begun.

452
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I believe in what's to come.

453
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,400
I believe in those that run.

454
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
That was it.

455
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Does that tune ring a bell?

456
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,400
No, but yeah.

457
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Well, I guess my dream brain just just made it up.

458
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
You had a you had a you had a Queen moment.

459
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
You had a Freddie Mercury moment.

460
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
You got to turn that into a rock opera.

461
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Um, you're right.

462
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I guess you're right.

463
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
What else am I supposed to do?

464
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Your talent has been unveiled.

465
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,400
You're a master musician all this time.

466
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I wrote a top charting pop ballad.

467
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,400
And that's that's it.

468
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I'm I'm sure about I'm sure about the lines.

469
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I believe in what's begun and I believe in what's to come.

470
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm not a hundred percent sure the last one was I believe in those that run.

471
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
That sounds weird.

472
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I'm not sure if that was it.

473
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,400
But that's what I remembered as best I could.

474
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Anyway, I woke up and I was like, God, I hate my life.

475
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I hate everything.

476
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Why can't I just go back to the puzzle caves?

477
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
That was the shit.

478
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Everyone was united in purpose.

479
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Everyone was everyone was on each other's team.

480
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,400
You know, we solved we literally solved racism with slime and puzzles.

481
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
And that's what it took.

482
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Yeah, that's what it took to build solidarity among the working class.

483
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Who can say what which is real the slime puzzle world or the reality we live in now.

484
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Maybe the great people were the ones who put you to sleep.

485
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:31,400
I that's honestly, honestly, I hope I hope and believe that you're right.

486
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,400
That this this is the illusion that has been cast on me.

487
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,400
A real Ben real Ben is is in a coma in like the in like the hospital ward

488
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
is somewhere in like that they built in these slime caves to take care of

489
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,400
participants in the puzzle game, you know, that fell under the weather.

490
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
He's in a coma.

491
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
They're hoping he'll come back any minute.

492
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Meanwhile, you know, the console was solved.

493
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,400
The next item was resolved out of the block Sudoku puzzle.

494
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,400
And, you know, the room has taken some other form now and further adventures are afoot.

495
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
And I'm missing out, God damn it.

496
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I have to go back.

497
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Rubik's gauntlet Rubik's gauntlet.

498
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
It was such a, I don't know.

499
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
It left.

500
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:28,400
I would just woke up with a very, a very strong emotional reaction to having experienced this.

501
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,400
And I and I didn't like it.

502
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
That's that's what's up.

503
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Have you tried playing a Sudoku Sudoku puzzle to like to like wake yourself up?

504
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
And then like I solve it and it resolves into a gun.

505
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,400
And it's like, you know what you have to do.

506
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
That's the real shit.

507
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
It's like, it's like that.

508
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
It's like that.

509
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,400
That meme of like the noose and through the noose, you see your anime waifu, right?

510
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
But like it's a slime cave.

511
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
It's a Sudoku puzzle.

512
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Well, that was pretty cool, I guess.

513
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:20,400
I hope that I told my dream story in as compelling a fashion as one would hope for.

514
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,400
It conjured up a few images in my mind.

515
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,400
The caves and the puzzles maybe think of like a multiplayer uncharted game.

516
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,400
It had a, the room had like a square.

517
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
I remember that like the whole area was square.

518
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,400
And but parts of it were cave and parts of it were room, but it was all contained in a square area.

519
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:54,400
And like the starting area, like the starting area and the final room with the console with like the code, the block puzzle in it.

520
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Where they were right next to each other, but you know, they had a wall between them.

521
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,400
So you had to go all the way around the square to get from one to the other.

522
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
You know what I mean?

523
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Yeah.

524
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:12,400
And like, and like the last room before a few little, little like final rooms that sort of you would walk through to get to the lab was like a big area that took up a lot of the space.

525
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:21,400
And it was this big like cave system that got became a slime cave after the first, after the second, the penultimate find the puzzle was solved.

526
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
That feels good.

527
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,400
The most fantastical part about that dream was definitely the fact that everybody was working together.

528
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I for common goal.

529
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:43,400
I, I, I have no, there was no context about like why all these people were here.

530
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,400
I'm pretty sure we were here of our own volition.

531
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Like we had all deliberately come here to solve these puzzles.

532
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,400
What if what if you're just one of all like many people who had that exact dream slam gun puzzle dream?

533
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Like the like the old guy with the glasses who told me there is no game.

534
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
He was just like another doubter.

535
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,400
He like someone had told him that there was no game and he was about to be taken by the gray low poly people as well.

536
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,400
I hope I have a fucking cave puzzle slime gun dream tonight.

537
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I hope I fucking hope you do too.

538
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I hope that a lot.

539
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I go into the dream and I find Ben Saint there surrounded by gray people and I kill them all.

540
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Yes, yes, bring you got to bring me back.

541
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,400
I, I, I think it's funny that.

542
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
They're like the block puzzle.

543
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
I was like, I have no idea.

544
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
This is like completely beyond me.

545
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,400
It's like, um, there's an episode of Batman the animated series where someone traps him in a dream.

546
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
This is like going to be really spotty.

547
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Remember, I don't remember which villain traps him in a dream, but he doesn't know that he's dreaming.

548
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,400
This is like someone's scheme to like defeat him is like they're going to give him basically put him in the matrix, right?

549
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Give him like this perfect life in the dream that he won't want to wake up from.

550
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,400
So Batman will just stay asleep forever.

551
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Um, but like the way that Bruce Wayne realizes because he's not Batman in the dream, like he still has his parents and all that.

552
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:23,400
The way that he realizes that he's dreaming is he opens up a book because he wants to read and like the book is full of like fucked up, like gibberish, like squiggles.

553
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,400
And he's like, what, what, what the fuck is this?

554
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,400
And it turns out that like, um, the explanation in the episode is that like it's some kind of reductive shit.

555
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Like, oh yeah, dreaming is right brain reading is left brain.

556
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,400
So you can't read in a dream because they don't use the same part of your brain or something, which there's probably like some truth to.

557
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,400
Um, but it was like that it was like looking at this block of the Sudoku puzzle.

558
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,400
I was like, I cannot even begin to understand any of these like letters.

559
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,400
This is complete gobbledygook and I'm going to need some other fucking guy to solve this part of the experience for me.

560
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
It's weird how your brain thinks that you can't understand, right?

561
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:11,400
It makes you feel like disconnected from yourself when it's like, yeah, my brain conceptualizes this and yet I do not understand it.

562
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,400
I can, it's like you get the emotion, the emotional reaction of confusion.

563
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Like it's like you can sort of create that out of nowhere, but like the specific, the specifics of what you're confused about it.

564
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
You don't even know.

565
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:41,400
It's like, it's like my mind just like sort of wanted to put in this place this object that like sort of symbolically represented like something you cannot solve.

566
00:44:41,400 --> 00:45:01,400
And so it just kind of layered a bunch of like elements together like a grid and like symbols and like moving blocks in a like a sort of square configuration and put it over like a little like, um, it was over like a little door hatch or something like, I don't know.

567
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:11,400
Yeah, and my mind just put these things together in a way that like sort of related to each other in space, but there was no like further connection.

568
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,400
They were just kind of layered on top of each other to create the effect of, I don't know, I don't know what to do with all these things together.

569
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,400
They're just, they're just things.

570
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:32,400
They don't make any sense because like, you know, they were, they were not conceived of in a, in a like a way to really achieve any end.

571
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
They're just, they're just arbitrary, more or less.

572
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I don't know.

573
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Dreams are weird.

574
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Yeah.

575
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
Oh, yeah.

576
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Shout out to Mage.

577
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Shout outs to Mage.

578
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,400
You know, clearly I'm a hypocrite.

579
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Clearly I'm not, I'm not above it because here we are.

580
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Here we are having Ben's Dreamcast.

581
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Oh no.

582
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
I love Dreamcast.

583
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Powerstone 2.

584
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,400
What a classic.

585
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,400
I never had, I never had a Dreamcast.

586
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Dude, get a Dreamcast.

587
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
It has no copy protection.

588
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,400
You can just burn isos to CDs and it'll play.

589
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
That's, that's fucking cool.

590
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Life hack for the instant Dreamcast question.

591
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Wow.

592
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Damn.

593
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Yeah.

594
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Damn.

595
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Yeah, that's great.

596
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Actually.

597
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Um, well, all I did this week was think about cool things because I said, fuck it.

598
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
I'm taking a break from social media.

599
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:41,400
I did barely logged onto Twitter, barely went on YouTube, didn't do any of that shit and just was doing real life stuff, like making cool things, conceptualizing cool things and not worrying about

600
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Is this going to be good for Twitter?

601
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:54,400
It was just like, oh, ideas were just free flowing and I had so many cool ideas like, oh man, I should get like a raspberry pie and like 3d print, like a shell for it.

602
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,400
That looks like a Sega Genesis make a little mini Sega that you can just like throw retro pie on there.

603
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,400
Like this would never be for anything, but it's like, it'd be so cool to just do because now I can do that.

604
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,400
And I was like looking at like how to like solder shit and like become like cooler.

605
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,400
And I was like, whoa, when you just like don't care about if it's marketable, you all of a sudden like have so many cool ideas.

606
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Hmm.

607
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Are you are you soldering like a 3d print stuff?

608
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Well, I'd be like soldering like connections to a raspberry pie and then you would go into a CAD program.

609
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Oh, wait, a raspberry pie is like a fucking is like a what is that I was thinking of like a food.

610
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
A raspberry pie is like a little micro computer.

611
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:44,400
You can get like you can get like a raspberry pie zero for like $5 and then you can run games and like Linux and stuff on there.

612
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:52,400
So you can like use a raspberry pie is like the like electronics for like, you know, DIY projects and stuff.

613
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:02,400
So it's like, what if I took a little $5 raspberry pie and 3d printed a shell for it that like looked like a retro console and then like just like.

614
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Solder some little like connections on there and like have it play video games and it would be cool.

615
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
That's handheld.

616
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
That's unbelievable.

617
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Yeah.

618
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
That sounds insane.

619
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:22,400
I was thinking of just 3d printing like a micro like bar top arcade cabinet and then like wiring up some like joysticks and buttons and then put like a

620
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,400
Zooming game on a little bar top cabinet and I could do that.

621
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,400
It would be cool.

622
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
You could you could sell it as like a little like tiger tiger handheld.

623
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Yeah.

624
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:39,400
You can you can get like, you know, like five inch seven inch displays and they go through like a pass through that plugs into the raspberry pie and then they

625
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,400
output video and it's just like, oh, this is pretty sick.

626
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
This is pretty legit.

627
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
I love that idea.

628
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,400
The idea of like a like a desktop arcade cabinet where you can play a zoomie little buttons.

629
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
Yeah.

630
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Yeah.

631
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Yeah.

632
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,400
It's just like and and ninja suffering.

633
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
You'd have to get like a vertical screen.

634
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Yeah.

635
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
It'd be cool.

636
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400
It just has one button.

637
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
You should put.

638
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Hey, Tom.

639
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,400
Here's I'm going to I'm going to backseat dev for you.

640
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,400
I'm going to tell you exactly how you design your game to make it.

641
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,400
You have you have like one.

642
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,400
I mean, as a zoomie has like levels, right?

643
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,400
It has like discreet.

644
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
It has like stages.

645
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Yeah.

646
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Well, in each stage in each stage, you put a little arcade cabinet in there that you can find.

647
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,400
And then as a zoomie, you can play a little bonus game of ninja suffering of like increasing

648
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
difficulty.

649
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,400
And if you win, if you get to the end of it, you get like, I don't know, a fire flower,

650
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
a mushroom.

651
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Sick.

652
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,400
That's that's how you that's that right there, Tom.

653
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,400
Listen, I know you I know you are kind of new with this whole thing, but that's how you

654
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
that's how you make the good game right there.

655
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Well, I'm glad you could spare some of your sagely wisdom with me.

656
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Me too.

657
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
World's a better place.

658
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
I was playing.

659
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
I was playing.

660
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Oh, what's that one?

661
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,400
Not Wings of V. What the one where you're the girl and you climb in the mountain.

662
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Celeste.

663
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Celeste.

664
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Because it was in because it was in the racial justice package or whatever.

665
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,400
I played through a bunch of it.

666
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,400
And that game has a little spot where you find an arc like an arcade cabinet and you can

667
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,400
play what I surmise must be the like original prototype Celeste that was probably like on

668
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Newgrounds or something.

669
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
Right.

670
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Right.

671
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,400
Yeah.

672
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,400
And it's funny because playing the arcade version of that I played through the whole

673
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,400
thing.

674
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,400
I beat it and it actually spoiled the twist that comes later in the game where in your

675
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,400
double jump gets updated, upgraded to your dash jump gets upgraded to a double dash jump

676
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,400
because that happened in the that that version.

677
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,400
And I was like, well, clearly they did it in the prototype.

678
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
They're going to do it in the final version too.

679
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,400
And they did.

680
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Well.

681
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,400
Shit.

682
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Suckers.

683
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,400
If only if only they had fucking Game Guru Ben Saint to give advice and to not spoil the

684
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
big twist.

685
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Yeah.

686
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
And then.

687
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Oh, and also the only way that Izumi can collect all seven chaos emeralds is she gets

688
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
one from each of these bonus stages.

689
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
And then she she becomes super Izumi.

690
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Where do you come up with these ideas?

691
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,400
It's like that was like right off the top of your head.

692
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
The good game.

693
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
I just I don't know.

694
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,400
You know, I just I get my ideas from the world around me.

695
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,400
I look at things like the sun and I think what if that was a video game and then I come

696
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
here and I tell you about it.

697
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
I interpret.

698
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
You know, I don't go outside.

699
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
I think that's where my my failing comes here.

700
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,400
If you want to make the good video game, I strongly advise staring directly into the

701
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,400
sun for as long as possible until inspiration strikes.

702
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,400
I mean, everything that we know came from the sun.

703
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,400
So like everything is in there.

704
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Everything is in there.

705
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,400
That's why they tell us to look away from it because that's where enlightenment.

706
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
They want to light.

707
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
That's why it's called enlightenment.

708
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
They want to keep you stupid.

709
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
They want to keep you educated, stupid.

710
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,400
They say don't stare at the sun because they know that the working class will become

711
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,400
too powerful to crack the code.

712
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,400
We'll stay and go outside and stare at the sun.

713
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
We will take over.

714
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
We will win.

715
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
We will win.

716
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,400
We all come from the sun and from the sun to the sun.

717
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
We must return.

718
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,400
You know, Elon Musk is trying to get us further away from the sun to Mars.

719
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,400
But I think we got to be heading closer.

720
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
I think we got to move inwards.

721
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Jaden Smith was right all along.

722
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,400
What if mirrors aren't real because our eyes aren't real and we don't need them?

723
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:58,400
What if my room isn't real because the slime cave isn't real?

724
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,400
No. This episode is getting too intense for me.

725
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
Impossible.

726
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Tom, you should make Grand Theft Azumi where she goes around and she checks people out of their cars.

727
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
It checks me.

728
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,400
It sounds like a revolutionary idea.

729
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
There are no bad ideas.

730
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,400
She gets into the car and she drives and she crashes it a lot and it's open world.

731
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,400
So you can go around, you go to a strip club as a tiny little raccoon person.

732
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Wait, so you're saying have a game without levels?

733
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Yeah.

734
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,400
No. That's too radical.

735
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
It's not too radical.

736
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Half-Life did it.

737
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Oh, shit.

738
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,400
What is this episode going to be called?

739
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,400
It's going to be called...

740
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,400
It's not real. The episode is not real. That's the title.

741
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,400
The Slime Cave.

742
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
The Sun.

743
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
Sun Dev.

744
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Stare directly into the sun.

745
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Just like PCP stare directly into the sun.

746
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
That's what it's called.

747
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,400
I hope we get tons of voicemails of people taking our advice and threatening legal damages.

748
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Speaking of which, are you ready to go to voicemails?

749
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
We have a lot, actually.

750
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
Do we?

751
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,400
We have like a shit ton.

752
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Why?

753
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
If they all angry at you.

754
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
I don't know, maybe.

755
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
I guess we'll have to find out.

756
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,400
I guess I got to open up speedpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

757
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
You really do.

758
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,400
You really, really do.

759
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:46,400
The first one we've got today is called I Will Give Ben Something to Fear.

760
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
Oh.

761
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,400
Yes.

762
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Wait, is this like...

763
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm looking forward to it.

764
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,400
On page two, because I'm looking on page one and I don't even see it.

765
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Yes, it's on page two.

766
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Are we really going through all of these?

767
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
I will do it.

768
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,400
They don't take long. They take 30 seconds.

769
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,400
We have 25 voicemails, Ben.

770
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
I'm ready.

771
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,400
I'm ready for it.

772
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Oh, yeah.

773
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
Oh, yeah.

774
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
Okay.

775
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
We'll be litigious.

776
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,400
We'll be discriminant.

777
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,400
Spartan.

778
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
We'll be Roman.

779
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
We'll be...

780
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Those are the same thing.

781
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Just go.

782
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Just go.

783
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Every statement, waste more of our time.

784
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
I will give Ben Something to Fear.

785
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Three, two, one, go.

786
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,400
Some pussies call him again, but not really.

787
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
Ben, this isn't a joke.

788
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,400
I am going to fucking beat you up when I see you.

789
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,400
I am a six-four, 280-pound monster.

790
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,400
Boxer football player.

791
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
I am going to kick your teeth in.

792
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
I am going to fuck your mouth.

793
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,400
No.

794
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
You're not a sexual wick.

795
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Not my teeth.

796
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
This is not a joke.

797
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,400
This is actually a threat on your livelihood and lifestyle.

798
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Okay.

799
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Okay.

800
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,400
You see, I really appreciate about that one.

801
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
And good job, by the way.

802
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,400
Mission accomplished because I am terrified of having my teeth fucked up.

803
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm afraid of my teeth.

804
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
My teeth make me scared when I look at them in the mirror.

805
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,400
And I think, oh, where will they end up?

806
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,400
Punch and beat the shit out of.

807
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:31,400
Beat the shit out of by a six-foot-four football monster.

808
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,400
Let's hear from YouTube in three, two, one.

809
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,400
Hello, cringe department.

810
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,400
You're going to want to see this.

811
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,400
I don't know what he's showing.

812
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
There's no link.

813
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,400
I think he's just referring YouTube to us for the cringe department.

814
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
So there we go.

815
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,400
Thank you.

816
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Thanks for letting them.

817
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
Sick.

818
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,400
Leftism in my PCP in three, two, one, go.

819
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,400
What's this?

820
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:18,400
This cannot be a cool, calm and productive conversation about leftism in my procrastinator's podcast.

821
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,400
Is this what this episode was all about?

822
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
I will not.

823
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:28,400
I need my room temperature IQ takes from somebody that read three quarters of The Fountainhead

824
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
when they were in middle school and then never touched a book again.

825
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I feel like they're referring to someone specifically, but...

826
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Hashtag both sides.

827
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Hashtag both sides.

828
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
I wouldn't want to name any names.

829
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,400
I don't know what he means.

830
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,400
I don't know if he's referring to a specific episode.

831
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:54,400
No, despite what you might think, the Ben cast was not just an hour long screed about needing a democracy in the workplace or whatever.

832
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
No, I will add this into it.

833
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
I promise.

834
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Believe it or not, I restrained my golf.

835
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,400
Wasn't that in the Digi and Ben you talked about stuff, didn't you?

836
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Did we?

837
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
I mean, before I appeared.

838
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Wait, Digi and Ben?

839
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Was that recent?

840
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Yeah, like two weeks ago.

841
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,400
It started with Digi and Ben and then Gibbon was halfway through.

842
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
I didn't realize Digi was on episode recently.

843
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,400
She was, believe it or not.

844
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,400
I know, stranger things, miracles really do happen.

845
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,400
Let's hear from...

846
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:37,400
I think I must have had a stroke or something because suddenly I'm having the sensation of smelling and tasting buffalo wings.

847
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,400
Oh.

848
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
And I want one.

849
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,400
Oh, Ben, don't have a stroke.

850
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,400
Please don't.

851
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
No, no, no.

852
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,400
I think I'm actually just thinking like, what if I had some buffalo wings right now?

853
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,400
And then like that desire is so powerful.

854
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,400
There's overriding my sensory data and just filling my nostrils that, yeah, you know, you know you want to smell that.

855
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:07,400
You know, you said, but before we go on to Todd's dildos, you mentioned that you've been having great ideas and having like being creative and doing cool shit this week.

856
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Well, not me because last night I got back into it and I worked all night trying to finish the last shot.

857
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
I'm on the last shot of a slime and punishment finale.

858
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
Hell yeah.

859
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Before that, for like a week, I was just like drunk all the time and I was just like ordering takeout like twice a day.

860
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,400
I spent $250 on like buffalo wings in like a week because I just love them so much.

861
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,400
Good Lord.

862
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,400
Is that keto?

863
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,400
Okay.

864
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,400
The thing about keto is that everything's keto if you eat little enough of it.

865
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,400
Well, you didn't eat like a ton of buffalo wings.

866
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
It started good.

867
00:59:51,400 --> 01:00:00,400
It started with good intentions because I realized like, okay, one small order of buffalo wings is about like 35 grams of carbs,

868
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,400
which like if I don't eat any other carbs, like that's fine.

869
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
That's under the limit.

870
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
So that's okay.

871
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
If I eat clean other than that.

872
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,400
I thought the limit was 20.

873
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,400
I've heard like the strictest one I've ever seen is 20 more.

874
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
I think a lot of people say 50.

875
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
50?

876
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
It kind of depends on the.

877
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Yeah.

878
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Man, I was doing strict 20 the entire time.

879
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
I thought that was like the hard and fast.

880
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,400
There is, I don't think you need to go 20 all the time.

881
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,400
I think I've seen like, I'm pretty sure that I've seen like old like keto diets like prescribed to kids for epilepsy,

882
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
you know, cause that's where it comes from.

883
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:46,400
I think I've seen like, like old school keto diets like that, that are like 50 grams.

884
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
That opens up a lot more options.

885
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
Yeah.

886
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,400
So, so it started like, I can get away with one.

887
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,400
I can get away with one.

888
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,400
And then I was like, but maybe I could also just eat it for every meal because it's so good.

889
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
And then like, you know, fuck it.

890
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,400
I'll get, I'll get this.

891
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,400
I'll get the sweet sauce.

892
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
I'll get the honey barbecue.

893
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,400
You know, you know, nothing's, nothing matters.

894
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,400
God's fake.

895
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,400
Anyway, it was, it was a week of debauchery.

896
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
It was a nightmare.

897
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
But I'm back.

898
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,400
I'm back.

899
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,400
I'm on the wagon again.

900
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:24,400
So I just wanted to relate, I just wanted to relate that story to you and say, you know, life's better when you're post food.

901
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,400
When you're not post food, you wind up like me.

902
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,400
You spend $200 on buffalo wings.

903
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,400
And you just, you live, you live your life thinking about what could have been.

904
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,400
So it's cautionary tale.

905
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
All right.

906
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Todd's dildos in three, two, one, go.

907
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,400
Hey, this is Todd from Todd's dildo.

908
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
Yeah.

909
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
I, I get it.

910
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
I get it.

911
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,400
A very, very funny, very clever.

912
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,400
I'll pass your message along.

913
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,400
So, so for those, for those who don't know, Nate loves dildos.

914
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,400
Nate loves dildos.

915
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,400
Yes.

916
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:37,400
This is a, this is a reference to the well-known fact that Nate is just a big, he's just a collector.

917
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,400
Like it's not a sexual thing.

918
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,400
It's not weird.

919
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,400
Don't make it weird.

920
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,400
Yeah.

921
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Uh, Nate, Nate moved, Nate moved to Virginia and like, uh, um, he like didn't like tell anyone.

922
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,400
He like, he like kept it a secret.

923
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,400
Like it wasn't a secret, but he didn't say anything about it.

924
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
Didn't bring it up in the chat.

925
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Didn't even tell Digi, like until the day that he showed up.

926
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,400
He just kind of like moved in secret.

927
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,400
He didn't really mention it.

928
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
He didn't really mention it on Twitter.

929
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,400
He said, he said for like a week or two that like he wasn't able to stream.

930
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,400
Uh, and then he, he, but he didn't say why.

931
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,400
And then he didn't tell Digi until the day that he, that he got to Virginia.

932
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,400
I don't know.

933
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,400
I don't know why he's like this.

934
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:31,400
I, I can't imagine it's just sort of like, it involves a lot of work and he just doesn't

935
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,400
want to spend any time on the internet telling people about things.

936
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,400
So it's just like, I'm just going to do it.

937
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,400
Does it take that?

938
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
Does it take that long though?

939
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
I don't know.

940
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:49,400
I feel like it's maybe told as patrons or something in like his Patreon podcast that

941
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
he does.

942
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,400
I haven't listened to those.

943
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
Does he, does he do a patron podcast?

944
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Yeah.

945
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
Doesn't everybody now?

946
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Yeah.

947
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,400
Everyone stole my idea because it's the best idea ever.

948
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Oh, that reminds me.

949
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,400
I wanted to mention, I feel like I haven't brought this up, but I was going to say this

950
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:13,400
when you, when I, when I sang the dream song and you, and you said like, ha, you're a composer.

951
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:19,400
Um, did I mention, did I tell either of you that while I was doing my last patron podcast,

952
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,400
I talked, someone asked me about, have I ever tried to make music?

953
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,400
And the answer was yes.

954
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,400
I, I made a song for the, for a Homestuck music contest.

955
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Did I talk about this on the show already?

956
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
No, I've never heard of that.

957
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Yeah.

958
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,400
There was a, there was a Homestuck music contest.

959
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,400
It was, and it, people were invited to like contribute tracks for what ended up becoming

960
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
the album colors and mayhem.

961
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,400
Do you remember that one?

962
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,400
I do.

963
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,400
Yeah.

964
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,400
But they didn't say that it was going to be a troll themed album.

965
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,400
They said submit a track that is themed around a character.

966
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,400
They didn't say troll.

967
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,400
Colors and mayhem is a troll themed album, but they just said a character.

968
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,400
So yeah, I like downloaded fruity loops or some fucking music program and I just threw

969
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,400
it together.

970
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,400
And I made that, and I made a track about Typhius, the Denizen.

971
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,400
And, um, you know, and like I themed it with wind, like I only used, I only use wind based

972
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,400
instruments.

973
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Like there's like a, like the melody is like a pan flute and like the background like tracks

974
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
are like, uh, it's pipe organ.

975
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,400
It's like a big like churchy pipe organ, you know, obviously cause Typhius has the organ

976
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,400
in his layer and there's like, there's like wind sounds in the back.

977
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,400
And I went through through my old emails and I found it.

978
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:41,400
I found the track and I, and I put it on the last, um, uh, patron podcast post because I

979
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
had mentioned it in there.

980
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,400
And, um, I actually think it's kind of okay.

981
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,400
It's not like all amazing, but I think some of the little bits in there are actually pretty

982
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,400
good.

983
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,400
Do you guys want me?

984
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Should I post it?

985
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
I'm not, I'm not going to play it on the episode.

986
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,400
I will.

987
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Yeah, I got it.

988
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,400
No, I'm not going to put in the show notes.

989
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
It's for patrons only bitches.

990
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Well, then what, what were you going to do?

991
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
I was going to ask if you guys want to be here.

992
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Oh, I will lord my exclusive access over the peasants.

993
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Okay.

994
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,400
Um, well, I probably shouldn't look for it right now cause that would have to go through

995
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,400
my files.

996
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,400
We still have 22 more fucking voice mouths to go.

997
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,400
Hell yeah.

998
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,400
Yeah.

999
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:31,400
And speaking of which next one, Ben, you ruined my life again in three, two, one, go.

1000
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Do not support Ben's thing.

1001
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
He is evil.

1002
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:42,400
He is anti-American.

1003
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,400
First of all, viewers, folks, uh, you're going to want to sit down.

1004
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,400
What?

1005
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,400
What is happening?

1006
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,400
He thinks passion fruit is good.

1007
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
You asshole.

1008
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,400
They look like animal creatures.

1009
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
Have you ever looked at the passion fruit up close?

1010
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,400
No.

1011
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,400
That's a yurk.

1012
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,400
That's not a...

1013
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,400
What the fuck?

1014
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,400
It's disgusting.

1015
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,400
It's disgusting.

1016
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,400
It's disgusting.

1017
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,400
You...

1018
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,400
You monster.

1019
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
That's enough of that.

1020
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
Yeah, enough of that.

1021
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
Have you guys ever eaten a passion fruit?

1022
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,400
I have not.

1023
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
I have never eaten a passion fruit.

1024
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,400
I think I know what the taste is though, from juice or something.

1025
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Really?

1026
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:27,400
I, um, they have the most incredible smell.

1027
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,400
They smell incredible.

1028
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
They taste incredible.

1029
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,400
Yeah, they're like...

1030
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,400
It's like, it looks sort of like a hard plum and you open it up and like it's full of snot.

1031
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Like it looks disgusting.

1032
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
It's full of slime.

1033
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,400
It's a slime fruit.

1034
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,400
But it's so good.

1035
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1036
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,400
It looks like frog spawn or something.

1037
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,400
Like eggs.

1039
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,400
Um, I have...

1040
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,400
I have some...

1041
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,400
I bought some flavorings for gummies and I made...

1042
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,400
I made a batch of gummies that I...

1043
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,400
They didn't end up coming out quite right.

1044
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
They didn't...

1045
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,400
They didn't cohere enough.

1046
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
They sort of just kind of stayed as goop in the molds.

1047
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
They didn't become solid.

1048
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,400
And I was really disappointed with that because the flavor was incredible.

1049
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,400
I would like...

1050
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,400
I had to like...

1051
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,400
I had to dig the goop out of the worm molds with my hands and just like eat it off my fingers

1052
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
because it was so good.

1053
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,400
Passion fruit is so good.

1054
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,400
It's the greatest...

1055
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,400
It's the greatest thing I ever invented.

1056
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
It was passion fruit.

1057
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
You're welcome.

1058
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,400
And I went on Twitter and I said,

1059
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,400
if you don't like passion fruit, unfollow me right now.

1060
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,400
Get out of here.

1061
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,400
And I guess this guy...

1062
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,400
All your followers.

1063
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,400
Gone.

1064
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,400
Oh, they're gone.

1065
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,400
Cut in half.

1066
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,400
That was the last straw.

1067
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,400
They got...

1068
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,400
I could...

1069
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,400
I can forgive.

1070
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,400
I can forgive being an Antifa terrorist, but I cannot forgive.

1071
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,400
There are some lines you just don't cross with.

1072
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,400
Bad fruit takes...

1073
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,400
Okay, next voicemail.

1074
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:52,400
I'm looking forward to saying the word fuck exactly one time.

1075
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,400
So saying the fuck word exactly one time.

1076
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,400
Three, two, one, go.

1077
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Fuck.

1078
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,400
Nice.

1079
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,400
I'm pretty sure that was Doon Koon.

1080
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,400
Given us exactly what was promised.

1081
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,400
That sounded like Doon Koon to me.

1082
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,400
This next one is a...

1083
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,400
Oh, I'm scared.

1084
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,400
But it's the name of the voicemail is a link.

1085
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,400
I'm going to try the link.

1086
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,400
The link is an audio file.

1087
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,400
The link...

1088
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,400
The link is to an audio file.

1089
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,400
Which I guess we can put in the show notes.

1090
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,400
Wait, should we just play the audio file?

1091
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,400
I guess.

1092
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Right?

1093
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Oh wait, this is just what you said.

1094
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,400
This is just what you said last episode.

1095
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Let's listen to it.

1096
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,400
Yeah, okay.

1097
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,400
It's only like 20 seconds.

1098
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Three, two, one, go.

1099
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,400
White people probably don't say it.

1100
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,400
But I'm not going to...

1101
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,400
I don't have the power to enforce that.

1102
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,400
And I don't think that I can say...

1103
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,400
The words you use, ultimately it's up to you.

1104
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,400
Myself, I don't think I should say it.

1105
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
A few moments later...

1106
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
N-A-B-A-C-P.

1108
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,400
It is angry about Caucasian people.

1109
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
I'm sorry, it's a funny joke.

1110
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,400
It's a really funny joke.

1111
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
I just wanted to quote a really funny joke.

1112
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,400
And you can't not say it and quote the joke.

1113
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,400
When I hear N-A-B-A-C-P, I just think of that scene

1114
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,400
from Charlie Brown's Kwanzaa.

1115
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,400
And I didn't use the hard R, so it's fine.

1116
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,400
Ben, I think you just got canceled.

1117
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,400
No!

1118
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,400
Ah!

1119
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,400
Ben, who's the real hippo crit around here?

1120
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,400
Oh, no.

1121
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Oh, my God.

1122
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,400
Oh, no.

1123
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,400
And the hippo crit really was the best guy ever.

1124
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:46,400
And Tom Oliver really was the digital bro.

1125
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,400
Oh, God!

1126
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Ah!

1127
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,400
All right.

1128
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Can we move on?

1129
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
What did they say in the actual voicemail?

1130
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
Oh, right, there was an actual voicemail.

1131
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Oh, it just says, please listen to audio on the link.

1132
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,400
Okay, we did.

1133
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
Okay, so please listen to the audio on the link.

1134
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,400
Yes, listen.

1135
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
No, I'm not a hypocrite.

1136
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,400
It's just like Walt Whitman said, I contain multitudes.

1137
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,400
Do I contradict myself?

1138
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,400
Then I contradict myself.

1139
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:18,400
I am a fucking, I am a constellation of flavor.

1140
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,400
Okay.

1141
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,400
Bitch.

1142
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Yeah.

1143
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Next one.

1144
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,400
I think it's fine to say it in context.

1145
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
And I said-

1146
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,400
I'm not a cop.

1147
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,400
It's basically a context of reference I was going to say.

1148
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
Listen.

1149
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
I didn't finish saying it.

1150
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,400
I, I, I, I, that's most, that's mostly how I feel.

1151
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,400
That's like, that's mostly how I feel.

1152
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,400
Wait, fuck.

1153
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,400
I was going to, I was going to, I was going to, I said in that, I said, I'm not a cop.

1154
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,400
I said, I'm not a cop.

1155
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,400
So don't be a cop.

1156
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,400
And by being a cop, I mean, criticize me in any way.

1157
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,400
Because that's, that's what, that's what cops-

1158
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,400
Sounds about right.

1159
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,400
That's my, that's my understanding of what the police, like that, that's why everybody's,

1160
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,400
that's why everybody's protesting the police, right?

1161
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,400
Because like they, they say mean things about them and like bully them on Twitter.

1162
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Yeah.

1163
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,400
Yeah.

1164
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,400
Yeah.

1165
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,400
Yeah.

1166
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,400
Yeah.

1167
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,400
Yeah.

1168
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Yeah.

1169
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,400
Yeah.

1170
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,400
Yeah.

1171
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,400
Yeah.

1172
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,400
Yeah.

1173
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Yeah.

1174
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
Yeah.

1175
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,400
Yeah.

1176
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
Yeah.

1177
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,400
Yeah.

1178
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,400
Yeah.

1179
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,400
Yeah.

1180
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,400
Yeah.

1181
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Like you're, you know, that why did you make videos about Winnie the Pooh?

1182
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
That's cringe.

1183
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,400
And I say, shall we, shall we listen to?

1184
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,400
Yeah.

1185
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,400
Open, open wide for the red pill.

1186
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,400
Three, two, one, go.

1187
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,400
Hey Ben, Benjamin Netanyahu over here.

1188
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,400
That's free.

1189
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
This questions for you.

1190
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:53,400
Do you believe in white privilege Do you believe that white people as a class have a

1191
01:12:53,400 --> 01:13:00,920
structural advantage and influence over Western society. Okay, now if you believe

1192
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,920
this, why do you have such a problem when people apply that same standard to Jews?

1193
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:21,680
I don't, I don't really believe that it's the same. It's, it's, I don't, I believe,

1194
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,680
God, this is like a serious question. No, I think, I feel like he's conflating things. Like,

1195
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:32,600
the idea of white privilege is that- I understand, I understand the point he's making. Okay. I mean,

1196
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:40,400
okay, let's- I mean, if you walk into a place and you have white skin, you are treated better

1197
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:46,880
than like, on average, like average of the entire America, you're treated better than a person with

1198
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,640
brown skin, like face value, sort of judgment. Jews do not have like a specific look that you

1199
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:00,560
could easily, like immediately identify them as, aside from the, the types of clothes they wear.

1200
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,280
Well, a lot of them look, a lot of them look white. Well, a lot of them just look white. Like,

1201
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:10,520
there's like, okay, okay, I don't know, see, I don't see how those two things could be,

1202
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,120
like, because you can't like, clock a Jew immediately, and then treat them better or worse.

1203
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,040
This is, you know, this, what I think is wrong with this, what I think is, has gone wrong with

1204
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:27,840
this question, is that it is, it is reductive. It's not that like, it's not simply that white

1205
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:34,640
people have privilege, or white privilege, and Jews do not, black people do not. Like,

1206
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:40,160
that's not where the question ends, because the various things that people perceive about you,

1207
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:47,280
and the roles that you inhabit in society, these are all interconnected. So like, there is,

1208
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,240
there is some overlap between like white privilege and Jewish privilege, because a lot of Jewish

1209
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:59,440
people look white. You know, maybe if, okay, let's, let's go full stereotype and just say like,

1210
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,880
oh, you're like a, you're come from like a family of like rich banking Jews that are like connected

1211
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:12,240
in Hollywood, or whatever, right? Like, obviously, obviously that position confers some privilege.

1212
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:19,280
I would say, I would say that like, materially, if you come from a background that's wealthy,

1213
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:26,000
that confers a great deal of privilege in its way. I think that culturally, Jews probably don't have

1214
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,680
the kind of like, a cult, the sort of cultural privilege that whites do in quite the same way.

1215
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:39,280
Jews aren't seen as the default in the same way that, you know, the white man is or whatever.

1216
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:45,760
But like, my answer to this question is intersectionality. That's the answer.

1217
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:53,120
I think also there's like, there's a different kind of like camaraderie. The, you know, white people

1218
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,120
don't really have camaraderie within their race, because that, you know, they, the white privilege

1219
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,880
has nothing to do with what some of them do, some of them do. But like, in the same way that if

1220
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,200
you're a Greek and you go to a Greek food market and there's a Greek guy behind the counter, he's

1221
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:15,040
more likely to like give you a discount because, you know, there's just sort of like a camaraderie

1222
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:21,920
of culture. So like, the Jewish people have that with them in the same way that any culture, like

1223
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:29,120
the close net in maybe in a country, like I'm talking like in England, like Greek people seem

1224
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:36,800
to like other Greek people more than they like others, I guess, not like a racist way, but just

1225
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:43,200
sort of like, they treat them a little better or treat them a little nicer. So like, there's that

1226
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:49,200
aspect of that to the Jewish privilege, if there is, you could say the Jewish privilege, but like,

1227
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,400
white privilege doesn't, does not have the same, it's not the same thing. It's, you can't say like,

1228
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:01,680
oh, you treat white people better, because like, you want to give back to the white culture,

1229
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,480
white community that is not really a, not really a thing in the same way.

1230
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:14,480
The thing about, the thing about whiteness is like, like being, being like Jewish or

1231
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:22,560
a black or African American or, or I don't know, Greek or whatever, like those things are about

1232
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,880
what you are. Being white is about what you are not, which is you are not any of those other things,

1233
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:34,400
except you are not in one of these groups that is not white, you know, black people, not white.

1234
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,720
I see this is what you look like. Hispanic people, Hispanic people,

1235
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:43,680
well, it's what, it's what you look like, but it's like, do you look like a thing

1236
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:52,560
that is not something, well, I mean, some, some like, some, some Hispanic people are also white,

1237
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,240
like Italian people, like most people would say they're white, Greek people, maybe most of the

1238
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,800
time, Irish people, most people would say they're definitely white now, but they weren't always

1239
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,560
considered to be white. It's like being, like being white is just belonging to an in-group,

1240
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:15,040
the boundaries of which are sort of malleable, a little bit, a little bit arbitrary.

1241
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,240
I don't know, there's a lot, there's a lot you could say about that question.

1242
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:30,400
And I don't have all of my points neatly aligned to like explain, but I think we said

1243
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,320
more enough. I think, I think, I think we answered the, I think we answered the question at the

1244
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:42,960
very least. We saw, and then doing so solved racism. Let's listen to weird, quacky statistic.

1245
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:53,280
I hope it's, I hope it's 13%, 50, whatever, whatever the, what's the thing about black crime?

1246
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:59,440
Okay, but three, two, one, go. Whoa, despite making up 13% of population. There it is, there it is.

1247
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,560
No, hit me with, hit me with 41% next. I want to hear 41%. That one's a classic.

1248
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,760
I don't even know what it is, but I don't care.

1249
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:17,200
40, 13, what is it? It's like, despite making up 13% of the population,

1250
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:23,760
black people do like 50 something percent of the crime. 41% is like 41% of trans people kill

1251
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,640
themselves. Haha. Great, great stuff. It was, I knew it was going to be one of the two.

1252
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,920
But you know what? It's good to be reminded because the thing about numbers is that there are facts,

1253
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,040
and there's no such, there's no such thing as interpretation. There's nothing to be,

1254
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,920
there's nothing to be considered. There are only numbers to be compared in value, absolute value.

1255
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,520
Number big, number small. Which, which bar on the bar graph is taller and which is smaller?

1256
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,200
And that's it. That's the answer to the question. Why is white privilege real and not

1257
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:05,040
Jewish privilege? Because bar graph, because number. Okay. Persona 5 opinion shrunk to 23 seconds.

1258
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:12,080
You're welcome. Three, two, one, go. Persona 5 has like a shit story, but it has really fun

1259
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:17,200
combat. Okay, the real world sections are boring as fuck. But once you go to the brain worlds,

1260
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,480
playing the video game, the JRPG shit, it's fun because the gameplay is really deep and fun.

1261
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,720
That's it. That's my opinion. Number out of 10, I don't know, like seven, I guess, but I haven't

1262
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,520
beat the game yet, so that might change. Why is this guy so dedicated to giving us his opinion of

1263
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:41,040
Persona 5? Because it's easier than making a video about it. Just make a, you should have made a 23

1264
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:46,160
second video in which you just said that. Put it over footage of the game, put your little

1265
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:53,760
cartoon avatar in the corner, get 10,000 views, done. Because I don't know what it is, and I'm

1266
01:20:53,760 --> 01:21:00,400
scared and confused. My opinion of Persona 5 is that it has good graphic design, 10 out of 10.

1267
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:07,920
That's true. The menus look sick as fuck, and it's a JRPG. And if the game feels good,

1268
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:14,080
then the game feels good. The game basically just is menus, so yeah. Yes. Putting their effort

1269
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:23,680
Next up is a hot take. HBO Max is based, and here's why. Parentheses streaming service.

1270
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:33,520
Three, two, one, go. HBO Max is based, and here's why. They got Cartoon Network, Adult Swim,

1271
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,840
and all the Ghibli movies. It's fucking based. I didn't have like cable TV growing up, so I never

1272
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,360
got to watch all the based cartoons. So now I'm just watching cartoons. It's fucking amazing,

1273
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:51,200
bro. Watch cartoons. Fuck anime. Anime is cringe. Watch cartoons. Except Ghibli. They're the good

1274
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:57,600
anime. Okay. I was going to say you said Ghibli. Okay. Watch cartoons online has existed for like

1275
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:05,360
10 years. Yeah. Why would you pay money? Why would you pay money for anything? That's a cringe take,

1276
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:16,160
dude. Is it? Is it? Is it? I think there might be a, is a normie thing. Like I, I, unless I'm like

1277
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:23,680
specifically invited to do so, and I'm feeling in a wild mood, I never watch things on a TV.

1278
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,840
I feel like I'm maybe, yeah, I feel like that's maybe kind of a weird internet person thing. I

1279
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,760
feel like most people watch things on a TV. It's because it's, you need to usually find stuff to

1280
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,720
watch on the, on your computer and putting it on the TV requires some amount of effort. I don't

1281
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:47,680
want to. It does. Yeah. It's been like the times that like I've tried to get a movie and show it like

1282
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,440
in my house on my TV. It's like, yeah, oh, I got to get a flash drive. Oh, I got to get the file,

1283
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,520
get the torrent, put it on the flash drive, put it on my friend's computer. He gives his computer

1284
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:02,720
up to the thing. It sucks. I don't remember where I got it. I think it came with like an eBay thing

1285
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,520
I bought like years ago, but I have this thing called a Microsoft display adapter. And it just

1286
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:13,040
plugs into an HDMI port on my TV. And then you can just wirelessly mirror any PC to it. And it's

1287
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:17,680
like so easy to watch torrents and stuff on the TV because it's just like, do you want to connect?

1288
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:24,640
Yes. Bing. There it is. Go. I guess, I guess what I'm, what I'm thinking is like, yeah, if you're,

1289
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:29,600
if you're, if you're not a norm, if you're kind of a normie, if you're not like, if you don't

1290
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,440
feel like deep diving into like like learning how to torrent stuff or whatever, you don't know how

1291
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:40,400
to do that. Just buy HBO Max. Cringe. I guess it was buy HBO Max. Yeah. That's, that's a, that's a,

1292
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:45,760
you know, valid, valid. You guys are rebuilding cable on the internet and tearing down everything

1293
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:51,280
that the internet was cool, which was being anti cable and anti all that corporate interest

1294
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,040
shit. And you're bringing it all back because people don't know how to use bit torrent.

1295
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:06,240
You disgust me. I mean, on the one hand, on the one hand, if people genuinely get value out of

1296
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:11,840
having it like convenient and available and all that, like, I guess that's the only good thing

1297
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,560
about HBO Max is that it makes it easier for people to rip the stuff from the service and put

1298
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,080
them on torrents and higher quality. Yeah. On the other hand, and I think I believe this more

1299
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:27,520
strongly, it was cooler. It was cooler when just everything was free. It was cooler when the

1300
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,000
internet was just communist. It still is though. It's just a little bit more obscure. Just a little

1301
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,480
bit more. I get, yeah, yeah, it's, it's like that. It is that just there are, there are some,

1302
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,480
there's a little more corporate crackdown on it and there are, there are more people who are

1303
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,960
choosing not to do that. There was the golden age of lime wire. Then we had bit torrent and that

1304
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:53,200
was pretty good. Then then now we have these like sketchy weird streaming sites that are like kind

1305
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,120
of crap, but like it also is kind of convenient that you don't have to download anything if that's

1306
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:06,560
what you want to do. I would just much rather deal with watch cartoons online than I would with

1307
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:12,880
having a Netflix subscription, an HBO Max subscription, a Disney plus subscription,

1308
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:18,560
a Peacock subscription. Like, like why? Yeah. Like that's like what, like $70 in streaming

1309
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:25,200
service costs? It's, it's, it's so, it's like, it's so obviously. Plus my Amazon Prime or my Spotify

1310
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:30,160
and like all this shit and it's like. Yeah. Like monthly subscriptions for all of these things. It's

1311
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:36,480
so like unbelievably obviously going to crash and burn with the amount of money people are expected

1312
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,600
to pay monthly. And your Xbox Live and your Switch streaming and your PlayStation Plus.

1313
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,080
That cannot continue. Like it, why, why do they keep doing it?

1314
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,080
These companies have this like really strange obsession with owning the entire pipeline.

1315
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:58,400
Like instead of just being like, oh, Netflix exists. Let's leverage this platform and use it

1316
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,880
in conjunction with the content that we do. It's like, no, no, no, no, no. We need to make

1317
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,120
all the money. So instead we're going to make our own Netflix that's shittier and

1318
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,440
batter because we're not a software company. We're an entertainment company. But this is

1319
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:16,960
we're going to force it down people's throats. This, this is that, this is that illusion of the

1320
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:26,080
possibility of continual growth. That is the reason why like this is, this is the, this is the,

1321
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:31,280
this is one of the problems with capitalism is that like when you're a corporation or whatever,

1322
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:36,720
your goal is not just to continue to make money, but to always continue to make more and more money.

1323
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:43,360
And yeah, it does lead to, this is probably like a relatively benign example of it. But like, yeah,

1324
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,560
like all these companies want to own, they don't, they don't just want to make money

1325
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:55,440
selling product. They want to own market share in new market. They want to command a segment,

1326
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,080
a sizable segment of the market because it's not just about, it's not just about

1327
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:05,680
owning stuff. It's not even just about creating revenue. It's about when you own market share,

1328
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:11,520
you have influence and you can like throw your weight around more and gain more market share.

1329
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,960
And the more of that you have, the more you can lobby and the more you can like influence legislation

1330
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,920
that will allow you to abuse your market share more and more, allow you to abuse your continually

1331
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,840
more and more monopolistic ownership of the market. Isn't it strange that monopoly

1332
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,760
which does lead to just completely unsus... That is like the end goal of every company by design.

1333
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:36,480
It is. It is. And we broke up. We used to, we used to fucking break these things up.

1334
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:42,160
Teddy Roosevelt, everyone thinks he was pretty cool for busting all these trusts,

1335
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:47,760
but now it's like, oh no, we, Jeff Bezos earned every penny and we got to give him tax breaks

1336
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:57,840
so we can make, keep making jobs. Fuckers, nationalize Amazon, fucking nationalize Tesla,

1337
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:03,600
coup Tesla. Did you see Elon Musk saying like, will coup whoever we want for lithium?

1338
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:11,120
No. Well, he said that. Did you see, this is unrelated, but did you see,

1339
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,320
did you see Elon Musk? And I know you didn't, but I'm going to say it. Elon Musk said,

1340
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:23,760
pronouns suck on Twitter and his wife Grimes was like, please stop this. Give me a call. I

1341
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:32,320
can't endorse hate. I know this isn't you. And it was really funny. How and why the fuck did Elon

1342
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:38,800
Musk get with a person so strange? I don't really know anything about Grimes. I know nothing about

1343
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,400
her, but just like the way she carries herself online is extremely weird and they do not look

1344
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,720
like a couple that is a match. It's very odd. Somebody said that like,

1345
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,560
edge lord and, edge lord and care lord, you know, it never works out. That relationship never

1346
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:03,200
works out. I read somewhere that apparently Grimes had been like questioning her gender or something,

1347
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:08,720
like not too long ago, making it like, was he talking about that when he said pronouns suck?

1348
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:15,600
Hmm. I don't know. Very funny. Fuck Elon Musk. Elon Musk divorce would be

1349
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:22,160
possibly even funnier. Well, no, probably, no, definitely funnier than Jeff Bezos divorce.

1350
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:28,160
That was actually pretty boring. And just kind of annoying. Elon Musk divorce would be,

1351
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:36,560
who gets to take, who gets to take care of fucking 7x9 QRA or whatever. You know what I mean?

1352
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,600
The kid, the kid has fucked up me. The Tesla will do that.

1353
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:48,560
They'll just, yeah, yeah, they'll just pay an engineer to just design an electric powered

1354
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:55,440
parenting, parenting bot. They'll just put it in the car and say like Tesla, drive out to see.

1355
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:01,280
Tesla, raise child. Okay. Okay, master.

1356
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:06,960
All right, we still going with these? Yeah, we're still going, baby.

1357
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,200
You are using Twitter in a way that makes you, I mean, really an hour and a half in.

1358
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,680
You are using Twitter in a way that makes you feel bad in three, two, one, go.

1359
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:24,000
Twitter is not shit. You guys are just using it in a shitty way. Okay. So like, it seems like what

1360
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,920
you do is you open it and you go to like the trending tab or you go to your whole political

1361
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:33,840
shit. Don't follow politics on Twitter. They can't even speak full sentences. It's like 140

1362
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,840
characters or whatever. And like on the trending page, it's all still the same shit. It's like

1363
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:43,200
either politics or pop culture bullshit or whoever is canceled this time. You know, don't do that

1364
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:50,320
shit. Just follow like artists you like or games you like or I don't know, anime, whatever, man.

1365
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,360
Just follow cool shit. Follow based on epic stuff.

1366
01:30:54,320 --> 01:31:00,560
Wow, what a big brain. That's exactly what I do. The problem is I Twitter is a platform is fine.

1367
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,760
The people on Twitter are annoying. And the problem is there's discussions about annoying

1368
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:11,440
things and you the people you follow for cool art also have opinions and they have to share them.

1369
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,680
And you're pulled back into the conversation, even if you're there, not to have that conversation

1370
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,880
because you're not in the right mindset for it because you're there to consume content, not to

1371
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:26,480
think. It's like, guys, just just only think about things that are frivolous because the

1372
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:34,080
serious things are just make you sad. Then just don't think about it. It's counter revolutionary

1373
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:39,760
is what it is. Yes, I follow fucking political people on Twitter. Yes, I'll fucking see Dave

1374
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:46,080
Sarota tweeting about the new like the new horror that is coming down the congressional pipeline

1375
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:54,320
and is like passed unanimously in the Senate or whatever. And I'll say I'm not and I'm going to

1376
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:58,400
keep doing that. I don't really look at the trending tabs unless I see something that's really bizarre

1377
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:04,640
and it's just like why and then I'll look at it and be like, oh, that sucks. I don't I famously I've

1378
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,280
changed my trending tab to a different language. I sit Twitter to a different language that one

1379
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:15,760
that I can't read. So trending tab doesn't make any sense ever. But and I follow like basically no

1380
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:22,720
one. I catch up on people like I type in Ben St into the search bar to find out what Ben St's

1381
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,200
saying. I was going to say, I can't believe you unfollowed me, bro. I unfollow everyone, basically.

1382
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:34,560
That hurts. That hurts deep. Because it's because when I go to Twitter, I don't want to be like

1383
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,560
you don't want to see me go on Twitter and say fuck you if you don't eat passion fruit.

1384
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:47,520
No, you're a piece of shit. The thing is like I have like the optimal Twitter viewing experience

1385
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:56,960
and even then it's like it's not good because if I want to indulge in knowing about what Ben

1386
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,000
St's talking about, which is usually some sort of politics and you know, seeing if there's a

1387
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,520
little drama going on. The funny thing that what's that guy, JK Rowling, simp man.

1388
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:14,240
Glynner? Yeah, Glynner. Like what's he up to? Like Ben's probably talking about it. I type in Ben

1389
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:19,920
St and it's like an action that I am deciding to do. If I follow Ben, I'm bombarded with it

1390
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,160
whenever I go to the site no matter whether I'm interested in seeing that sort of stuff,

1391
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,840
which is why following people is a bad idea. But even when you don't follow people.

1392
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,640
I have to do that even with the people I do follow. It's not like I'll be caught up with

1393
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:41,600
what a person is doing. If I want to see what one of you guys is doing, I don't just look at

1394
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,000
my feed because I don't follow a huge amount of people but I follow enough that it's hard to

1395
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,920
keep track of. So yeah, I have to go to the search bar and type in someone's name and be like what

1396
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,720
are they tweeting about? What's fucking Tom or Gibbon or Digi or something or tweeting about?

1397
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:04,560
Curious. It's good if you have no public persona that people will...

1398
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:13,040
Like if you're not a public person and you are very, very, very stringent with who you follow,

1399
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:19,200
then yeah, it could be fun on Twitter. It just is not for most people.

1400
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:24,160
I don't know. I'm not on Twitter. Like I understand if you want to like browse it

1401
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,320
for art and you follow artists that you really like. I do follow some artists,

1402
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:36,160
but I'm not really on Twitter to look at art. I'm on Twitter to like read what people are saying

1403
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:43,760
about stuff. Like I'm there to engage with the kind of thing that I think this caller would

1404
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,400
consider to be like the bad stuff, the bad part of Twitter. I mean then you're probably having a

1405
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:55,360
grand old time. That's the purpose of Twitter to me. I mean you're using it for the right reasons.

1406
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:01,440
That is what it was designed to. It was designed to be the news, to get people the news and like

1407
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,760
have updates for the news in real time. What are people like? What are the birds saying? What are

1408
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,320
all these tweeting? I'm more interested in what are people talking about. The problem is that the

1409
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:17,360
platform is also being used by artists and it's terrible. But I'm there to see cool shit too.

1410
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,560
I'm there to see like oh they like protesters in Portland burned down a construction site that

1411
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:29,360
was building an addition onto a juvenile detention center. I was like yeah that made my day. So

1412
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:37,200
you know it's not all bad. There are glimmers of hope in the darkness. No I'm doing it right.

1413
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:46,800
Fuck you. Next one is DigiBro is pretentious. Three, two, one, go.

1414
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:13,920
I don't know what the point of this is. Did did did Digi say something? Is this talking about the

1415
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:19,120
PCP or is this talking about I think something on Digi's channel? There's no way. I just assume

1416
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:25,360
like Digi's content is you know everywhere. There's lots of people who are who are all too eager to

1417
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:31,840
say you know what Digi? I'm unsubscribing. This content is not what I want anymore. So I assume

1418
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,800
I don't think that's I don't think that's what this this this person said Digi talked shit

1419
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:44,720
about the voicemails. So it must be about we only do voicemails on the PCP. Digi doesn't do them.

1420
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:49,920
I think no am I confused? I don't remember a voicemail where someone called in and asked hey

1421
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,480
Digi what do you think about the wind rises? I don't think that's I don't remember this. I think

1422
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:00,400
maybe Digi has in the past dismissed voicemails as being dumb but we all have. This voicemail

1423
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:05,920
sucks. All of us have done that. This voicemail sucks ass. This person didn't think it through.

1424
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:11,040
They didn't have a clear message or theme that they wanted to convey with it. It's a mess. It's

1425
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:21,280
chaos. It's soup. Next. Alternate. Alternate platforms. Question mark. Three, two, one, go.

1426
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:28,400
How much money are you making from these alternate platforms compared to YouTube? Like you're on

1427
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:34,800
what Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, whatever. I don't know. Just kind of look the can you look

1428
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,800
those numbers up right now? See like how many people are watching compared to how many people

1429
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,840
watched on YouTube and the money and shit like that. Because I mean, if you're making more money

1430
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:51,200
from these other platforms, why not just stay there? I don't think Tom. Do we make do you have

1431
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:55,840
any data? Do you have any data on that? You have data on views but you by design make no money from

1432
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:02,240
podcasts. So so we don't we don't make any we don't make any money on like iTunes or Spotify

1433
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:08,960
or Google Play or whatever. There is no revenue stream. Only through Patreon. They are they are

1434
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:19,200
purely there for convenience. Is Spotify, wait, which one's Spotify? The orange one.

1435
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,960
It's the green one. Oh, wait, I was thinking which one is the orange one? Are we on are we on

1436
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:34,080
SoundCloud? No. Should we be on you have to pay you have to pay monthly to get enough space to

1437
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:44,080
upload the episode. Really? Remember, we have to keep deleting voicemails. Oh, that's right. So if we

1438
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:50,880
had full to be totally thought. Oh, that sucks. That sucks, major dig. There is a there is a

1439
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,680
podcast on Spotify that I listen to is called the relentless picnic, but they only upload like

1440
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,000
they make a pretty decent amount on Patreon and they probably so they can probably afford it and

1441
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:06,640
they always they only upload like once a month or so. So okay. That makes sense. Okay, what about

1442
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,520
what about like numbers like we don't get to Spotify if you had

1443
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:24,000
one that in the last week. So this week, we've had 1469 starts, 1333 list streams from 295

1444
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:37,520
unique listeners. I can dial down to all time. 1507 listeners, about 30,000 starts in 21 or 22,000

1445
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:43,920
streams. So what's a start? So a start just means you started the stream. And then a stream

1446
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:50,480
means they listen to a significant amount of it. I see. So so there's like, so there's maybe like

1447
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:58,080
200. Okay. And this is two. So 300 people in the last month have listened on Spotify and this

1448
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:06,160
is during the last week. Okay. Okay. But this is during the time when the podcasts are not on

1449
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:10,800
YouTube. So that's going to be like inflated. Like normally, I'm sure it would have been way lower

1450
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:19,120
than that. Um, well, okay, that's just one of the platforms. We're also on Google Play and iTunes

1451
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:22,720
and stuff like that as well. So I'm sure they're dispersed among different options.

1452
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,280
Yeah. Yeah, true. Yeah, true. When you go to the website, what is it? What does it play on

1453
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:35,040
automatically? It just it doesn't play anything by default. You choose an episode.

1454
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,880
Isn't no, no, no. But when you go to, when you go to the procrastinators.com,

1455
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:46,560
it's like post July 4th, Bencast. And then there's, is that just like a raw MP MP3? That's just the

1456
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:54,800
MP3 uploaded to WordPress itself. It's not connected to any platform. Okay. I see. I would,

1457
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,560
I would bet that a lot of people that are going to these alternative platforms are just listening

1458
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:04,080
to it right there. It seems like the easiest way to do it. I mean, if you subscribe to a podcast

1459
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:08,800
on Spotify, it'll get a notification for time to go live. So I'm sure a lot of people probably do

1460
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:14,800
that just for like, Oh, I don't have to go look for it. It comes to me. Yeah. That would, that

1461
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,760
would make a lot of sense. I don't use, I don't use iTunes or Google Play or Spotify. So I don't

1462
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:29,600
know anything about anything. Uh, okay. Next up, we've got God to in a row, Margar, Margar.

1463
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,200
All right. First, first one from Margar. Three, two, one, go.

1464
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:38,240
Hey, PCP, Margar here. I like to expand on something that Digi said a few episodes ago

1465
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:45,120
about thesis statements in your voicemails. So many of your voicemails that you guys are sending.

1466
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:51,760
Yes. Do not get to the fucking point fast enough. I've only sent like a few voicemails up till now,

1467
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:57,280
but even doing it week after week, it's not that hard to get an idea across and ask a fucking question.

1468
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:03,360
I mean, I swear to God, most of these are not worth listening to. Get your message across

1469
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:10,640
or shut the fuck up, please. The PCP has never pretended to be anything

1470
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:17,120
other than a kangaroo court. And if you think that making good voicemails is any defense against

1471
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:23,760
being caught up in the PC prison industrial complex, then you are mistaken, my friend.

1472
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:30,800
Oh, by the way, last episode, Doon Koon sacrificed his voice grail status to free

1473
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:38,160
All Die Corporation from voice jail. So a lot of drama happening there. A lot of movement on that front.

1474
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,560
What a badass. Okay, next from Margar. Three, two, one, go.

1475
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:53,120
Margar here. Ben, do you intend to make me a Margar in a case for why the abolition of the

1476
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:59,040
voice jail is required? I have performed no offense and have consistently been.

1477
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,480
And I feel that if I were to be put in court, it would be a kangaroo court. And there's no

1478
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:14,000
justification for my being caught up in all of this red tape. And frankly, I think that this

1479
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,560
is this is ridiculous. Release me immediately. Justice for Margar.

1480
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:23,600
That's what I said. Now to listen to the rest of the voicemails in their entirety.

1481
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:28,480
Most of which will not be worth listening to. But yeah, all you got to do. I don't think you

1482
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:34,880
even need to script it out. Just like, think about like, hmm, I want to say this and then think about

1483
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,080
you know, what, what, what do I want to say about it? Okay, I have a clear idea of what I

1484
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:46,880
want to communicate in my voicemail. I don't know. Yeah, have a theme. Next up is

1485
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:56,800
half our Ben St. Corr colors. And there is a link to an image of old Digimon toys.

1486
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:04,480
Whoa. Now you're speaking my language. Yeah. Yeah, I want them all.

1487
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,840
Did you have did you have a digital? I had multiple.

1488
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:14,480
I me and Nate each had a Digimon. And this was before the cartoon. Yep. Same. Same.

1489
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:21,840
I don't remember. I remember I had a red one and he had a blue one. And none of they didn't

1490
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:26,320
look like any of these. So I must have had a different model. They released like one version

1491
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:31,120
of these in America. But there was like multiple iterations in Japan. So these might be ones over

1492
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:37,520
in Japan. Yeah. Yeah, none of these are the ones we had. But yeah, these three of these are Ben

1493
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,600
St. Corr colors. The black and white ones really cool. The purple and black ones really cool.

1494
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,520
These are I like that like RFCK like green and pink one. That's pretty nice.

1495
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:51,280
Let's let's hear the voicemail. Shall we three, two, one, go. All right. So several times on the

1496
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,440
podcast, you talked about your issue of feeling the need to look at a screen pulling up Twitter,

1497
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:00,160
feeling bad. So you get off Twitter, wait 10 minutes, feel the need to look at a screen cycle

1498
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:06,480
repeats. So here's an idea. VPETs, you look at the screen, but then instead of getting Twitter

1499
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:12,400
and that toxicity, you get your little guy and you help him grow. Well, you might think, hmm,

1500
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:17,040
which one? Maybe the Ingellium Tamagotchi or something. Well, that has giant shipping prices

1501
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:23,920
because you have to import that. But Bandai of America has recently released only $20 for the

1502
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:30,400
American Digimon version 20th. Now the Wave 3 is coming out soon and these colors are completely

1503
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:37,600
Ben St. Corr. Look at them. I left it as the link. Next, Radcon. Do like a Royal Rumble thing to see

1504
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:47,200
who the best digital monster parent was and see who the weakest parent was. See if Ben or Digi is

1505
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:55,120
the better parent and who's the better at bullying their unironically on a joke. I have one of these

1506
01:45:55,120 --> 01:46:00,160
in my room, right? Right. And within arm's reach, I have one of the 20th anniversary Digi mods.

1507
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:06,160
So is it doesn't look like one of these different color? Because he just said that's a new version

1508
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:10,960
they're releasing. Mine's blue, much like Nate's probably was because it was a they were styled

1509
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:20,000
in the original America. Yeah, I feel like I feel like if I had time to prepare, I could I could

1510
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,280
have the perfect Digimon. I feel like it's not that complicated. About the 20th anniversary Digimon,

1511
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,920
they changed it so you can raise multiple Digimon at the same time. There's like multiple trees

1512
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,720
instead of just one and the growth is much faster. So instead of it taking days, it takes like one

1513
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:40,560
or two days to get like a full adult. There were multiple trees in the old American release. But

1514
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:46,000
there's like 50 different guys you can get on this one. Oh, shit. Yeah. And you can raise two

1515
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,200
eggs at the same time. And it's like it's it's it's intense. It's it's hardcore. Honestly, maybe

1516
01:46:52,560 --> 01:47:01,520
maybe rat radcon five stretch goal. Digimon roll. I'm about it. I'm about it. I'm about it. That

1517
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:07,040
sounds awesome. That sounds really cool. Actually, yeah, I'll do it. I'm down. Okay, next up,

1518
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:16,880
pancakes. Love is cringe. Three, two, one, go. Listen, love is cringe, especially parental love.

1519
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,560
You know, I was on a bus yesterday with a father playing with his little daughter,

1520
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:25,440
and I was like, I nearly puked in my own mouth. And you know, when someone has

1521
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:33,200
to say someone over and said, Hey, yo, cringe, bro. That's why my parents are the most base

1522
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:37,600
ever because all they ever does is leave them out of doorstep. And hey, if you listen up there.

1523
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,520
Nice. Nice. Pretty base.

1524
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:53,600
I have to agree. Parental love is is is not is not even based. You don't even have to earn it.

1525
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,200
Come on, you should have to earn everything in life. Like, you know, you should pull yourself

1526
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:01,680
up by your bootstraps and prove to your parents. Oh, I was thinking the other way around enough

1527
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:06,800
of an enough of an asset to be to be loved by them. You should have to earn your keep.

1528
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,120
From from the perspective of a parent, it is it is cringe to love your child.

1529
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,400
It's more based to throw them down a down a deep pit and see if they come out.

1530
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,720
Isn't it like proven like when a child's born, like there's like a chemical like reaction in

1531
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:26,640
the parent's brain that makes them like makes them cringe? Yes. Yeah, like makes them make

1532
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:31,040
them love you. Like that's not even real. It's just like chemicals. Like I'm saying,

1533
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:37,360
I'm saying it's cringe of you, the child to expect a handout from these from these parental

1534
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:43,280
authorities. Yeah, I'm saying you need to do better and you know, give back.

1535
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,960
So yeah, hard, hard agree. Hard cakes on this one hard.

1536
01:48:51,760 --> 01:49:00,720
Oh, that's gonna get a hard R for me, my dudes. Okay, next up,

1537
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:07,040
pro quest, you know, is an animus. Three, two, one, go.

1538
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:15,520
Oh, my boyfriend, though, didn't come in, come inside my boy pushy. Oh,

1539
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:24,720
he didn't wear a boy condom. Am I going to get bad pluggers now? I is too young to be a boy

1540
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:32,720
mother. Can I get this a boy portion? Oh, whoa. Can I pay my colleges with my boy pushy washy?

1541
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:38,480
I don't know. Can you? Perhaps I could offer him some of my tasty boy milk? Oh, whoa.

1542
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:44,160
I'm not one except the pint of my sticky boy syrup instead. Oh, whoa. I'm not the one to be

1543
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:50,560
asking these questions. Well, this is why parental love is cringe. If you if you raise this. Yeah,

1544
01:49:51,440 --> 01:50:00,720
it's time to stop. This parents mistakes were made. This is what happens when kids are given free

1545
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:06,720
communist handouts of parental love that they didn't have to work in the mines for.

1546
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:12,560
This is the fall of Western civilization. This is what you get when you don't when you don't

1547
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:17,040
work in the mines. This is what you get when you don't go to war.

1548
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,920
What I'm saying is that humans are the virus. We need a good war.

1549
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:27,600
Pestilence should definitely be, you know, encouraged in the poorer sections of society

1550
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:34,320
so that the well bred nobles can continue and humanity can evolve. This is this is the

1551
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:38,480
this is what's meant to this is the chaff meant to be left on the miller's floor.

1552
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:47,280
Or if there's ever been an excuse for boy abortions after birth. This is one.

1553
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:53,280
Yeah, baby. Yeah. Malthusianism. Here we go.

1554
01:50:55,120 --> 01:51:01,520
Is the PCP deep or bleak? Hmm. Three, two, one, go.

1555
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:08,320
Hey, PCP. Most likely Ben St and maybe give and take. I don't know about anybody else.

1556
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:16,880
But I had a question. So I got into the PCP when I was around 11 years old. Oh,

1557
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,040
God, I'm so sorry. A little lolly.

1558
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:29,920
All right. So I'm just thinking if I got into the procrastinators podcast at 11 years old,

1559
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:36,880
was I mature at 11? That is technically groom. You have mature enough for me to start enjoying.

1560
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,800
What? This was not the that's a different question than you titled your question, you you fuck.

1561
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:54,800
Yeah, but 11 year old. Like, like, like if is the question can is it like understandable for an

1562
01:51:54,800 --> 01:52:02,400
11 year old to be into the PCP? Like, are we so immature? And so that is the audience we.

1563
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:09,680
Oh, is that the question? I think was this person just mature? And we're just immature? Or are we

1564
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:15,040
just immature? The question is, were they mature for their age to get into the podcast? Or are we

1565
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:20,320
immature? And that's why it resonated with them. I think we're just really, really cool. And we

1566
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:28,560
and we transcend. We just appeal to everyone. We transcend maturity. The procrastinators podcast

1567
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,680
is focused, tested to appeal to the widest possible demographics where we can make the most

1568
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:41,760
possible money. So it's kid, it's kid tested mother approved. There you go. I'm just kicks

1569
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:47,680
his three words. PCP is three words. Maybe there's a t shirt in the future. Dude, kicks

1570
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:53,200
unironically based unironically a great serial. It really is. You can't you can't go wrong with

1571
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:56,560
it doesn't get enough love. It's simple. But that's that's part of its charm.

1572
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:03,680
Just like life. I love life serial. I thought you meant life was simple. I was like, what the

1573
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:09,280
fuck are you talking about? Life is like kicks is like life. It's just simple. It's just a little

1574
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:15,440
ball of corn. You know, yeah, yeah, with a little sugarcoating on how does a fucking 11 year old

1575
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:22,240
find that like click on a PCP video? Well, it's like, it's started with the Steven

1576
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:26,800
Universe episode and all the downhill from there. Would it would have been would have been through

1577
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:33,440
like digi or someone else? Like like maybe maybe like how how it's it's just

1578
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,600
the same way how unusual that I guess I don't know what children do. I guess I don't think it's

1579
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:44,640
that unusual. I it's the same way that people would that, you know, parents would give babies

1580
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:49,200
iPads and the baby would have no idea what they're doing. It would just click random things or be

1581
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:54,800
on autoplay. And that's how babies ended up watching all those weird like family finger

1582
01:53:54,800 --> 01:54:01,280
songs videos about like pregnant Elsa with Spider-Man in the supermarket and like Joker 3D Joker with a

1583
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:07,200
gun like shooting people just just made by an algorithm, you know, just just to get just to

1584
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:13,840
get those clicks, just random noise, no all noise, no signal. That's that's how it happens.

1585
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:22,000
That's how it occurs. In case you were wondering, I hope that explains why didn't we get hundreds

1586
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,160
of millions of views from the PCP episodes then, huh? We weren't we weren't we weren't we should have

1587
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:34,160
maybe maybe we were getting we weren't getting the babies. We were getting like the slightly

1588
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:40,400
older than babies. I wonder if we would have gotten like a huge audience of babies who would now

1589
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:45,280
like just be reaching the time where like they start to get like an allowance and they start to

1590
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:50,800
have a tiny bit of disposable income and no like necessities to spend it on. I wonder if they go

1591
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:56,400
to patreon.com slash the procrastinators. That's right. That's that's right because they hear it

1592
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:03,520
and they think I must do it. They and like if we had just titled our episodes things like, you

1593
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:14,000
know, Marvel, Marvel Spider-Man, Avengers, Elsa, Frozen, you know, song, baby, child, you know,

1594
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,840
just think like that was just every episode was just a string of like highly searchable words.

1595
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:24,400
We missed our window. What a shame. We did. Well, I don't know. Is it is it too late? Well,

1596
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:32,080
they crack down on child content or content that is gathering data on children you because

1597
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:38,640
they can't do that. Oh, fuck. That's right. Fuck. That's right. Shit. Damn. We could have built a

1598
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:49,440
mansion with that baby money. The best kind. We got a hone on this baby market. No. Yeah,

1599
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:55,920
you're right. We missed our window. We fucked up. Okay, this one is called I forgot my question.

1600
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Can't wait. Three, two, one, go. How do you fucker cop not killer? I'm the guy who's going to be a

1601
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,400
Ben St. in real life and I have a question. Question is again, it's too scary.

1602
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:18,560
I hate I hate this audience. Hey, audience, I hate you. What do we say about a thesis statement?

1603
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:26,480
Listen to Margarh. I feel like, okay, you know what? You know what? Because Margarh was so right,

1604
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:31,520
because Margarh was so on point. Margarh, I'm going to step in. We've been waiting for months

1605
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:36,880
for YouTube to just cut the red tape, cut the bullshit, quit lying, just unlist the video.

1606
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:41,440
Just today, did you, I don't know if you happened to check the email, the procrastinator's email,

1607
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:46,880
but just like last night Nate sent another email being like, hey, it would be really easy to solve.

1608
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,720
YouTube caused this problem and like destroyed all this content that people paid for.

1609
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:57,280
Like you could just do it and I'm going to keep asking for updates on it like until it's done

1610
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:03,120
because it needs to be done and you caused this problem, please fix it. And you got another email

1611
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:09,760
that's like, sorry for the delay. I understand that, you know, this the long response is

1612
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:15,280
it was like misspelled the word unacceptable. It said, you know, we're again reiterated,

1613
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:18,400
we're working with a limited team due to the response to COVID-19.

1614
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:22,400
It's an algorithm. It's not a real person responding.

1615
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:30,880
I don't know. I don't know that. I don't know if I believe you. I think it is a real person.

1616
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,960
I'm more and more convinced that it is simply a real person and I just think

1617
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:40,560
they're copy pasting. It's a real person. It's a real person, but they're copy pasting like that.

1618
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:46,800
Yes. Yes. Here's the hand response plus or minus like a few different words.

1619
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:53,200
I think they are just sort of coached. I think they are just kind of like coached or

1620
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:59,360
told to follow a template. Yes. I think they should I just read the email?

1621
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,680
Well, why? Yeah, sure. He brought it up for some reason. It said, hi, Nate. Thanks for getting back.

1622
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:10,080
I definitely understand that the length of this being resolved is not justifiable

1623
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:14,640
and I would like to apologize for this delay. As much as we would like to have this resolved as

1624
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:20,400
soon as possible, but we are unable to, since we, this is a nightmare, since we are unable to,

1625
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:25,600
since we submitted the report to the appropriate internal team that is working on this,

1626
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:30,800
rest assured, I am also keeping an eye for this since this is ongoing for a long time.

1627
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,760
I will circle back as soon as possible. Let me know. Should there be anything in the meantime?

1628
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:40,960
Best Martin. This is really funny because yesterday I was watching Jimquisition videos

1629
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:47,600
and there's an episode of Jimquisition where he talks about getting sponsorship offers from

1630
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:52,080
companies that clearly do not know who he is and clearly are not familiar with his content,

1631
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:56,960
but they're clearly just spamming channels with, you know, offers or whatever. And he

1632
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,480
specifically mentions that they all say like, hey, just circling back to get back to you.

1633
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:07,600
Just circle back to this. Yeah, I'll circle back to this. And there it is. On the same day,

1634
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:13,120
it appears in this fucking response email, that phrase. It's probably like, like one guy who

1635
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:20,960
made like a course, like it made a DVD on how to do emails to customers who are angry. It must

1636
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,720
have got just like circulated, like everybody in every company uses that DVD to train their

1637
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,880
personnel. That's very professional language. That's very professionally. Don't say,

1638
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:35,440
don't say you'll come back because that sounds like jizz and that's gross. That could be considered

1639
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:39,840
pornographic. That could be sexual harassment. Say you'll circle back like it's highly recommended

1640
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:47,520
just just to avoid any any even the appearance of untowardness. Anyway, I brought this up because

1641
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:53,600
why did I bring this up? Yeah, why did you write it up? I brought this up because

1642
01:59:54,160 --> 02:00:01,520
just like we are waiting for YouTube to cut through the red tape and just fix the problem.

1643
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:06,960
I am going to step in for Margar and cut through the red tape and say, you know what,

1644
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,440
Margar, your application is processed. We can forward you to the end of the line.

1645
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:18,800
We can Disney express pass plus you pass the waiting lines. You have successfully landed

1646
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:26,640
in voice jail. Congratulations. You're there. We did it. We got you through the process.

1647
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:33,920
The system works. The system works, my friend. You made it. Margar. Congratulations.

1648
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:37,920
These are the people who are completely terrible. We got to pass.

1649
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:45,280
Some people spend their entire lives trying to get to voice jail, but this guy did it.

1650
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:55,440
Okay, next one. Next one is from Cross at GameCon626 at gmail.com. Okay, three.

1651
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:03,280
Is that part of his name? Is that supposed to be public? I don't know why it has an email attached

1652
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:09,840
to it, but it does. Three, two, one, go. Someone mentioned Vosh like they followed him and I was

1653
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:13,440
just wondering what you guys thought about him. I first heard of him when I saw a video he did

1654
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,360
bashing Lily Orchard and then I skimmed his channel and found that the vast majority of his

1655
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:21,360
content appears to be focused on antagonizing and calling out other people, though this is

1656
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:25,760
just going off of the titles of his videos. Not only this, but he uploads more than once a day

1657
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,720
on average and all of his videos seem to just be him live streaming, talking to his chat or arguing

1658
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:35,200
with someone he's in a call with. I decided not to check out any more of his videos and even told

1659
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:39,520
YouTube not to recommend him to me as all of this struck me as a very unhealthy channel,

1660
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,760
not only for the viewers, but also for Vosh himself because I don't think that spending hours

1661
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:48,240
every day and talking about people you claim to be problematic and getting mad about them publicly

1662
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:52,080
is productive or good for helping anyone gain a stronger understanding of other people's

1663
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:55,760
perspectives and resolving those disagreements. What do you guys think is my first impression

1664
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,280
of Vosh inaccurate? Do you agree with my reasoning for not watching his videos? What are your

1665
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,040
general thoughts of him? Thanks in advance and don't feel like you need to rush the rad content.

1666
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:18,320
I have not watched a lot of Valsh, but I have seen a video or two of him

1667
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:29,280
deconstructing something like those. I had no strong negative reaction from watching whatever

1668
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:37,040
video it was. He was sort of deconstructing an argument and saying why it was not correct or

1669
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:42,320
something. I was pretty smart and I just moved on. I can't really remember much.

1670
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:51,600
What's your opinion, Tom? He's pretty good. I listened to a bunch of his videos. I was

1671
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:59,200
binging them for a while. I don't usually tend to watch Left Tube that much. There was a couple

1672
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:03,840
there was a month and change where I was watching a lot of Vosh and Philosophy Tube just to be like

1673
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:13,600
to expand my palette of ideas because that's always fun to do. It was good. It brought new

1674
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:22,240
ideas into my brain. That was good. I liked that. I felt like Vosh was probably the best way of if

1675
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:32,640
you want to get somebody into Left ideas to send them Vosh because he's not prissy or

1676
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:37,440
trying to be squeaky clean in his presentation. He's down there in the fucking mud with everybody

1677
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:44,960
else. I appreciate it. He's a little bit dirtbag. He's not full dirtbag left, but he's kind of got

1678
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:50,080
that aesthetic. He just feels like a real person. He's not putting on airs by having to make sure

1679
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:54,000
everything's squeaky clean. I appreciate that because it made the ideas much more digestible.

1680
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,560
I don't know. It felt like someone talking with you instead of talking at you from on high

1681
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:10,160
from their position of virtue, which was good. Do you want to finish?

1682
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:16,160
I was just going to say that I can understand why someone might think that it's unhealthy in terms

1683
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:23,920
of consumption of the content. Vosh clearly seems like a dude who can handle being in conflict

1684
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:27,760
with multiple people at the same time. He clearly gets off and has fun at doing what he does. I

1685
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:35,520
wouldn't worry about him, but I can absolutely understand getting burned out on watching somebody

1686
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:39,920
for hours on end and just picking fights with people because I eventually stopped watching

1687
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:44,640
them all the time because I got burnt out watching someone pick fights with people all the time.

1688
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:52,720
I was the same with Destiny for a while. I assume they're somewhat similar. They seem to be

1689
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:58,160
talked about. Vosh spun off. He's like a spin-off of Destiny. He was active in Destiny's chat,

1690
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:00,960
and then he started doing his own videos from what I understand.

1691
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:08,160
It's the same thing. They're fun for a bit, but to watch that sort of content every day would get

1692
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:18,720
exhausting. Yeah. This was a while back, but I binged Destiny. I never made the leap from

1693
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:24,720
I'll watch a compilation or I'll watch a highlight video. I'll watch one of the good clips that

1694
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:30,480
have a lot of views that are like him really taking down someone who really deserves it,

1695
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:35,040
and it really makes a good case for something. I watched a lot of those, and I love those,

1696
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:39,520
but I'm not going to tune in to watch. I don't want to watch him live. I don't want to watch him

1697
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:46,320
just tune it. I have tried, and it's boring. It's rarely anything that I'm interested in,

1698
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:50,320
and it's the same with Vosh. Someone recommended me Vosh, and I eventually checked him out, and

1699
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:55,280
I binged a lot of his good old highlighted videos. I would never watch a stream of that

1700
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:01,200
because I tend to because Vosh is up close. I have no interest in watching Vosh play

1701
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:08,800
fucking Dark Souls 2 or whatever he's doing. No. His takes are mostly good. In the highlights,

1702
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:15,040
they come off pretty good, but then on Twitter, I don't understand. I see that it seems like Vosh

1703
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:21,520
will take down people that I think are bad, and I think that's good. But then I see on Twitter,

1704
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:27,200
it seems like maybe not so much anymore, but he had a little beef with Thought Slime, and I like

1705
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:32,800
Thought Slime. Why do you beef with Thought Slime? Then he had a little beef with Peter Coffin,

1706
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:38,080
and I like Peter Coffin. Why are you beefing with him? I saw him calling Peter Coffin a class

1707
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:43,440
reductionist, which I don't think he is, and I think that sucks. I don't really understand a lot

1708
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:48,640
of the combativeness that seems to be there, but I don't actually see it in the Vosh content that

1709
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:55,840
I have seen. I don't really understand what this perpetual beef machine seems so bizarre,

1710
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:00,800
and I don't really understand the workings of it. It might be a Ben St. situation where he

1711
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:08,160
seems a lot more angry and fighty on Twitter than he is in real life as a non-stream.

1712
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:17,440
Maybe Twitter brings out more antagonistic aspects of his personality. I don't understand.

1713
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:23,040
It seems to me like Thought Slime and Peter Coffin and Vosh have way more in common than they have

1714
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:30,880
that they disagree on, and I kind of wish that were more like, because I don't see them interacting.

1715
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:35,200
Well, I saw one interaction positively. It was when they had that hilarious thing,

1716
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:43,680
this hilarious moment. Thought Slime made a video about a guy, and the guy responded,

1717
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:50,000
and the guy was such a weird dweeb, and he basically criticized Slime itself

1718
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:56,160
and said that the working class doesn't like Slime. The working class wants to get rid of Slime.

1719
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:00,640
I can't take this guy seriously when he calls himself Thought Slime, because Slime is gross.

1720
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:09,280
And I saw Vosh respond to that as a thing. So weird. And then Thought Slime, he said

1721
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:14,960
Borger King. He pronounced it Borger King. And this guy assumed from that that this guy didn't know

1722
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:21,040
what a hamburger was, and therefore had never had never worked fast food. It's like, I don't know.

1723
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:27,760
It was very funny. So like, I saw Vosh's reaction to that, and Vosh was like, hmm, okay, I guess maybe

1724
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:34,800
I'm on Thought Slime's side. And it was like, yay, left unity. But like, why? Why was the why

1725
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:40,720
was this a rift that needed to be healed? You guys have so much more in common. Why was it?

1726
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:44,320
It's bizarre to me that there would have been any bad blood there in the first place.

1727
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:49,600
And I don't understand it. I don't like it. But I kind of don't really engage with that side

1728
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:52,960
of it at all. Like when I see that, I sort of just look away like, oh, no, no, no,

1729
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:57,120
two people that I like are fighting. I don't want to hear about it. I hate that.

1730
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:03,920
Reminds me of the old classic YouTube poop beef between Waxinator and Guy Buchan that I never

1731
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:10,480
really truly understood to my favorite YouTube poop creators. And they just didn't like each other

1732
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,240
for some reason at some point. I was like, oh, no, that's bad.

1733
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:19,680
Did they have like an ideological disagreement? No, it was like one of them exiled the other at

1734
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:24,320
some point and it just was bad blood. I think maybe it was just some bad blood that built up

1735
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:28,320
over time. Not like their content or like my YouTube poops are good and yours are bad. No,

1736
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:35,760
mine are good. Yours are bad. This is exactly what happened. Seems like it probably is what happens.

1737
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:42,640
YouTube poop elitism. Anyway, that's what I think about Vosh. Hope that was enlightening.

1738
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:53,760
Next one. Ben cast best cast. Hmm. Interesting. I wonder what we're in for now. Three, two, one, go.

1739
02:09:54,800 --> 02:10:00,880
I'm fucking tired of these goddamn pussies telling me and coming on the podcast and going,

1740
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:05,280
oh, this is the worst the podcast ever been. This is the worst the podcast ever been. Oh,

1741
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:11,280
it's the best the podcast ever been. This is the best. There's just like, Ben, it's just Gib,

1742
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:16,640
Tom, did you want it? It's just people that are like, they're good at talking and they don't talk

1743
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:21,920
over other people and they're not fucking annoying all the time. Like like a certain someone who

1744
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:28,240
wears fucking glasses. This two months has made me realize I don't even like Nate. I don't even

1745
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:33,840
like it. You know, he's probably still good. I don't know. But the podcast is just better. And

1746
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:39,280
these people are like, oh, don't release the solo Ben cast. The greatest podcast ever done. We all

1747
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:48,560
know it's a great podcast. Don't be afraid of your feelings. I know we all know the Ben cast was

1748
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:54,640
the height was it'll never get better than this. We've peaked feelings don't care about your feelings.

1749
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:57,760
This guy might have been on Twitter. I think there was someone on Twitter that was also

1750
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:04,240
like, I like the podcast better without Nate. And like, you know, if we have, you know, thousands

1751
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:08,960
of people listening to these, probably, yeah, it doesn't surprise me that a few people are like,

1752
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:14,640
you know, I, I prefer it this way. There's always been people having their old like, here's my PCP

1753
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:22,240
tier list. Here's the guys that I like hearing about the most. And it's always different always

1754
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:27,120
is always completely different. There's never been like a total consensus on who is the best

1755
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:34,880
and the worst of this funny, stupid little group. It's funny that this guy says that Nate talks over

1756
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:42,800
people because I have seen people. I feel like the sentiment is a lot that me and Nate talk over

1757
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:49,760
people. I wonder you do definitely you do I. Yeah, earlier, earlier, the beginning of this,

1758
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:54,480
I was taught maybe it's because of the latency. I did it like one. I did it like one time. Yeah,

1759
02:11:54,480 --> 02:12:00,640
I did it once. Yeah, but like, I feel like that's also because of latency, like me hearing you

1760
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:07,840
later than because I'm further away or something. I'm going to blame. I mean, just in the whole,

1761
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:13,520
that whole Vosh thing, I kept no, no, fuck that you don't know. There were a whole bunch of times

1762
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:18,320
that I wanted. I was ready to interject with my opinions that they, but you guys had more to say

1763
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,760
and I was like, okay, okay, yeah, let him continue, let him continue, let him continue, wait until

1764
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:26,320
they're done. Then I can say my bit. Then I can say my Pete. I don't know all of the times that

1765
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:31,280
you've restrained yourself. All I know is the times that you have interrupted. What about all those

1766
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:38,240
times I didn't wear a dress to school? Nobody ever talks about those times. The, that's a

1767
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:46,720
Simpson's reference, by the way. The, the, the, no, I think we need to blame everything on Nate.

1768
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:52,800
I think the answer is that people think that I talk over people because I just, because Nate

1769
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:57,440
talks over me and I have to try and talk over him. You know, to get my point across, that's my

1770
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:04,640
hypothesis. You can't prove it's wrong. It doesn't matter. Anytime you say, no, but what about this

1771
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:08,720
time you talked over someone unrelated to Nate? I will say, no, that's the, that's the exception

1772
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:13,680
that proves the rule. Every time, every, every all counter examples are just the exception that

1773
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:22,960
proves the rule. So there you go. I think, I mean, the patent that proves the rule. I think,

1774
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:29,600
I think it's kind of refreshing. I don't think it's bad to have, you know, we're going through,

1775
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:38,480
like, I was on almost every episode in the, in the past, I miss him. Nate's on almost, has been

1776
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:44,160
on almost every episode. I don't think it's wrong to be like, Oh, you know, this person who is on

1777
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:50,080
many episodes, he's not around anymore. Oh, there's a different vibe now. Maybe we, we can,

1778
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:57,520
we can appreciate that. That's the thing. Um, okay, cool. Glad, glad you like, glad you've been

1779
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:04,880
enjoying the episodes. Friend. Um, next one. Yep. You're closing in on the end.

1780
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:09,600
Oh, two more. Next one. I'm like, wait, hold on.

1781
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:18,480
Okay. No, my house is not burning down. Uh, smelled smoke, but it's, I think someone's

1782
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:23,600
saying you're having a stroke. I'm having a stroke. I'm having a stroke. I'm having a stroke, baby.

1783
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:32,240
Next one is vocals are instruments. Three, two, one, go to the guy that said that hip hop is

1784
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:36,320
becoming worse just because the topic of the lyrics shifted from rapping about being poor to

1785
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:41,120
rapping about being rich. Uh, fuck you, buddy. You should be voice jailed. If you want to listen to

1786
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:47,280
the lyric or miracle bullshit, go listen to J. Cole or Eminem. Your voice is a fucking instrument,

1787
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:52,480
and that's how it should be used. Us chads will continue to bump Uzi, Carti, and

1788
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:53,920
woo.

1789
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:01,120
Uh, I never said that I, I, when I was talking about the voice mail, who said that?

1790
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:09,280
Yeah. When I was talking about, um, what, because I, I'm just like repeating what I have seen other

1791
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:14,480
people said. I, I, which maybe I shouldn't even do because these are not really my opinions.

1792
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:20,720
I don't really have an opinion on the hip hop scene. I think that if it's true that people are

1793
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:24,880
talking more about being rich than being poor, then that's not a problem with the musical

1794
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:29,680
aspect of it. Cause I absolutely agree that vocals are instrumentals. Uh, it's just like

1795
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:34,080
it doesn't appeal to, that's, that's a change in the theming of it and the change in the aesthetic

1796
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:40,080
of it. And in the politics of it, maybe, maybe even that I don't like because I would, I think

1797
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:45,440
being rich is fucking gay. Uh, I don't know. What do you, what do you guys think?

1798
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:53,760
I think vocals are instruments. I always prefer in fact that, um, I, like the words in a song,

1799
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:59,280
I've never been one for like, like reading the lyrics. I was just like the way things sound.

1800
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:02,320
I agree. I'm a sound boy.

1801
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:07,840
Yeah. There are tons of songs I've listened to for like decades and I don't know all the lyrics

1802
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:12,240
to it because I just kind of like having the vocals blend into the instrumentation and just

1803
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:15,280
like being able to listen to them as sound and not as words.

1804
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,480
Yeah. I take it all back. I take it all back.

1805
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:31,360
Well, the thing is you need to learn the lyrics in order to sing along.

1806
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:39,600
Uh, so if you want to sing along and sound like not shit.

1807
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:46,160
And what are you saying? What are you implying? That's false. I don't, I don't know what you mean.

1808
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:46,960
I'm implying.

1809
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:53,600
No, I'm just going to, I'm going to do the whole song. I'm going to do the whole song.

1810
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:03,760
I, I can, I can get enough satisfaction not knowing the words, not understanding what they mean

1811
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:06,560
if it's in like a different language and just kind of hum along like that.

1812
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:16,160
Yeah. No, it's fine. No, I agree. Yeah. Just go. That's why humming is based.

1813
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,360
So, hey, vocals are instruments. Uh, no, we, no, we agree. No, we agree. Please don't,

1814
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:25,840
please don't beat me up. Please don't get that six foot four football monster.

1815
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:28,160
He's already coming. That, that, that dies been cat.

1816
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:34,160
Please, please can we negotiate?

1817
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:41,360
I like how, I like how Margar is in voice jail for just some pretty, making some pretty like

1818
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:46,800
some pretty mild. I don't even remember what, why I put him. Yeah, we didn't shoot the messenger,

1819
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:53,040
but we did imprison it. But this guy, this, this, this football monster, he's not, he's

1820
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:58,320
just made threats against my physical safety, but I'm too, I'm too scared to put him in voice

1821
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:01,440
jail. I mean, if I call the police, I'll just make him mad.

1822
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:05,520
If you put him in voice jail, he's going to be closer to you. You want him to be as far away as

1823
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:14,800
possible. Uh, yes. Voice eskaban. Uh, yes, exactly. Wait, no, no, eskaban. What's the real version of that?

1824
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:23,520
I have just, uh, alcatraz. Alcatraz. I have just started like sweating profusely for reasons that

1825
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:29,040
I don't understand. Ben, you're having a stroke. This is so many red flags coming up. Every, every,

1826
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:33,760
every episode I have, every episode I have a stroke, every episode I have a stroke. How many

1827
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:40,000
more? I think it's, I think it's the Karongi virus. Is sweating, is sweating a Karongi virus thing?

1828
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:45,520
It's a symptom of sorrow which we're in. It's a, it's a symptom of heat and, and or fever.

1829
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:51,360
Oh God. Wait, wait, wait. I took my temperature. I took my temperature before the episode. Let me,

1830
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:59,520
let me take it again. One more voicemail and Ben's going to drag this out as long as possible.

1831
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:08,400
Oh my God. 200 degrees. Well, according to this meat thermometer,

1832
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:19,040
my temperature may have risen by a degree or two. Yikes. Yo, God. We're going to do this voicemail

1833
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:24,240
before Ben St collapses and dies. We gotta, we gotta wrap this up quick. Okay. Darren,

1834
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:33,120
Darren the Red. Three, two, one, go. So I was drunk, listening to Hatsune Miku cleaning the

1835
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:39,120
kitchen, jamming my ass out. I hit the orange justice and dislocated my knee. What's the most

1836
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:45,520
embarrassing way you guys have been injured? Um, that's not embarrassing. I mean, that's pretty cool.

1837
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:51,680
That's based. Uh, I mean, do you count me, uh, breaking my tooth, biting that sign in the RFCK

1838
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:58,080
lecture? That seems, that seems valid. It's a little embarrassing. I broke it on paper. I feel

1839
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:04,480
like a more embarrassing break of your bones, Ben, is, is when you just walked, like you heard

1840
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:08,800
something in Radcon 2 or Radcon 1 even, and you came into the room and you stubbed your

1841
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:13,280
toe and you had to go to the hospital. You stubbed it so bad that it broke.

1842
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:19,120
I mean, was that really embarrassing? Like, I was just, I just stubbed my toe. I was just,

1843
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:25,520
like, walking somewhere and I stubbed my toe. Yeah, how embarrassing that you have such a frail,

1844
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:31,120
weak body. That I wasn't, that I wasn't even doing anything. Um, I mean, how, how is it,

1845
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:36,160
I'm just, I guess I'm trying to think of like, what is embarrassing about being injured?

1846
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:39,920
Like is, if it's your fault that it happens, I guess, then it's embarrassing.

1847
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:46,960
I guess, okay, I'm thinking like, okay, you're thinking like, like the injury itself is embarrassing.

1848
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:52,080
I'm thinking like, what was I doing something that is, would be embarrassing anyway,

1849
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:56,320
that result, that resulted in injury. I, I see where you're coming from though.

1850
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:03,440
Um, I have never embarrassed myself, so I can't answer this question.

1851
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:08,720
I can't think of a thing that would be embarrassing to be called, and then also get an injury doing it.

1852
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,640
Like if the injury is not part of the embarrassment, there's nothing,

1853
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:15,120
you can't be embarrassing, it's impossible.

1854
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:20,560
Uh, what's the, what's the, what's the most severe injury you've ever had?

1855
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:25,280
Mine was, breaking my toe is actually like the most, I'd never, that was the first time

1856
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:29,840
I'd ever broken a bone, and I've actually broken that bone like several times now. I've broken that toe.

1857
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:40,080
Yeah. Uh, I think, you know, the, the, I've never broken a bone. I've been very cautious in my life.

1858
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:44,880
I'm, I'm squeaky clean. I've only ever had like illnesses.

1859
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:46,960
Nice.

1860
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:50,720
So I guess the most embarrassing one is, uh, diarrhea.

1861
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:53,920
Gross.

1862
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:55,680
Because there's shit everywhere.

1863
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:56,720
Oh, the work.

1864
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:57,680
Yeah.

1865
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:00,800
Yeah. Just sitting around, minding your own business, and then it's like,

1866
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:05,360
and you got to, you got to get out of the hair. You got to go real quick.

1867
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,320
It's time to escape.

1868
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:13,920
All of a, all of a sudden I'm like, I'm all, I'm super sweaty. I feel weird. I feel really hungry.

1869
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,080
I really want to eat, and like I did, I ate some like pickles and I drank some like coffee and

1870
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:21,760
almond milk. I shouldn't be hungry, but I'm like, gotta get, gotta get those soft drinks.

1871
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,760
What is going on? You met a morphosizing, you.

1872
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:25,600
Oh no, please.

1873
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,200
Is it a full moon?

1874
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,400
Change is bad. Change is bad. Uh, I hope not.

1875
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,400
Ugh, please. Oh, please don't let me be.

1876
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:35,040
Should we end the podcast before you die?

1877
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:38,800
No, she's don't want you to have the Karungi virus.

1878
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:39,840
I would be really funny.

1879
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:40,400
You're not coughing.

1880
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:45,360
You know, the most, the most embarrassing way, everything is the Karungi virus.

1881
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,440
Everything is the iKarumba virus.

1882
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:54,400
I went outside and I went into a pizza place and I hand sanitized.

1883
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:57,120
I was with, I was with Kazi and Munchie.

1884
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,240
We went to a pizza place because they were getting pizza.

1885
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:02,640
I sanitized my hands because I touched the door.

1886
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:05,680
The guy behind the counter was wearing his mask wrong.

1887
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,520
He had his fucking nose out.

1888
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,720
I wanted to kill him.

1889
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:12,880
I wanted to kill him, but he was ethnic, so I couldn't because it would be a hate crime.

1890
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:20,000
But if he was white, if he would, this is why you know white privilege is fake,

1891
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,080
because if, if he was white, I would have killed him.

1892
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:23,840
Damn.

1893
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:24,480
I'm convinced.

1894
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:28,720
Or, you know, Jew, or Jew, Jewish white passing, you know, whichever.

1895
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:32,320
I'm sorry.

1896
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:36,480
I end, I end all the podcasts on weird racial notes now because I don't know.

1897
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,400
I fucked up.

1898
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:40,480
It's, it's just the Karungi virus, guys.

1899
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:43,440
It's, it's, it's, it does, it does bad things to all of us.

1900
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,800
It's, it's, you mean, you mean the Kung flu.

1901
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:47,920
Oh, yeah, that.

1902
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:50,880
Oh, cringe.

1903
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,040
Are we, are we ready?

1904
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:53,520
Are we done?

1905
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:54,080
I think we're done.

1918
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:33,840
And, um, hey, by the way, since I did have a work spree last night,

1919
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:35,520
and I have almost done with slime and punishment,

1920
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:39,280
next thing I do after that, after I drop the finale to that,

1921
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:42,720
is I'm going to be releasing a sonichu lecture too.

1922
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:47,440
So I don't know what's going on with Munchie's lecture or Digi's lecture,

1923
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:50,240
or is there another one that we're waiting for?

1924
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:50,960
No, just those.

1925
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:53,760
Your second one, and then the two.

1926
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:58,720
Yeah, sonichu, sonichu lecture number two is, uh, is going to be,

1927
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:01,360
is going to be coming out pretty soon, actually.

1928
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:03,360
So I'm excited for that.

1929
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:08,240
I need to, I need to reupload the brisk lecture because I have it still.

1930
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:12,160
I just, I don't, well, we, it's going to come back maybe.

1931
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:14,000
Bad.

1932
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,480
It might, I was thinking, yeah, we, I've been thinking like, okay, well,

1933
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:22,320
you know, we shouldn't reupload because it would be really shit if like,

1934
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:26,560
the Animorphs lecture came back with zero views instead of the like 200,000 that it had.

1935
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:30,160
Um, I would just, I would just be sad about that.

1936
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:30,720
You and me both.

1937
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,520
But then I was like, but then I was like, wait a minute,

1938
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,800
I had this like, this like late night, like anxiety thought.

1939
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:40,640
I was like, what if, what if they do actually get around to doing it,

1940
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:44,800
but they bring them back, but like the, all the views are the comments and stuff are lost.

1941
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:47,760
And like, it's as, it's as if we had just reuploaded them anyway.

1942
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:50,560
I don't know whether that happens.

1943
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:54,880
Uh, I mean, I don't have to go to YouTube HQ and riot.

1944
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:59,040
Like, why would that specifically YouTube HQ, why would the,

1945
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:04,160
why would specifically that amount of the data of the YouTube page be lost?

1946
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:05,840
I don't know.

1947
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:07,200
Why are they gone in the first place?

1948
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,000
None of this makes sense.

1949
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:08,320
Yeah.

1950
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:08,880
Yeah.

1951
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:10,400
And not, yeah, none of it makes sense.

1952
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:11,760
Like who's, who's to say?

1953
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:15,040
We don't even really know, understand the details of what they did.

1954
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,720
So who's to say?

1955
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:17,280
I don't know.

1956
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:18,400
I mean, I don't do it.

1957
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:21,840
I don't know if that will happen, but I don't know that it won't happen either.

1958
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:24,880
But they, I'm just saying, Hey, wouldn't that suck?

1959
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:25,760
Wouldn't that be shit?

1960
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:26,560
Pretty bad.

1961
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:30,560
Well, let's, let's, let's see, I guess.

1962
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:32,000
Uh, yeah.

1963

All right.

End of the podcast.

02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:36,160
I guess so.

The end.

See you.

Thanks for, thanks for listening for another week of pro procrastinators.

Goodbye.

Bye.

Bye.

1974

Bye.

1975
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:48,560
Bye.

1976
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:49,360
Bye.
