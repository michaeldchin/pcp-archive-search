1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm ready. I'm recording my Redman.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, so you're...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't even want to know what just happened over there.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So you're doing the Redman.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm doing the Redman, yeah.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, God.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I like it. I like it personally.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All right, if you...

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I kind of like the unfinished slight jank of Redman.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Like, I'm watching it right now and it makes...

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It comforts me on a spiritual level.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The way his body moves is very comforting.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, he's...

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, it's so squishy.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's like a bowl of Jello as a child.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, yeah, he's like...

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I really wish my eyes moved where my direction is,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but they just don't.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It really is just like he's full of blood.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you popped him, he would just...

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And what's more comforting than that, right?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's more comforting?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Exactly.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's warm.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It is.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Among other things.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Fuck, well, should we just...

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Should we go?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, let's just go.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That was a cold open.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, oh, that was a cold open.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Welcome to the Procrastiners podcast.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We got me Ben St.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We got Gibb and Take.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, it's me.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And AKA Redman.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, well, look at the screen.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's me.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Guys, Redman's here.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Redman's here.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And sorry, guest, fuck you.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
While Redman's here.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Not only is Redman here.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Redman Merch is here.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the form of the ratty fuckers cop killers,

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
an endless war of pins.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Pog.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Pog pins from the kick starters are in.

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Eleazar, show them.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Show the Merch.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Redman's there.

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You can get him.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have a tweet.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I will link a tweet.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where I explain.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you missed it and you want to get in on it,

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you want to buy any of this cool shit.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have that.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have spent another week this week fucking doing

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
envelopes and shit.

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's very cool.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They're very...

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They look great.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They look so good.

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They look so good.

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Where Redman?

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's the point.

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And we got low art.

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Our guest today is YouTube man, low art.

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, yes.

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who I did a...

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You want to introduce yourself?

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, sure.

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am the low art.

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I make videos.

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am ashamed to say that I am a tuber.

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's a shameful thing to say.

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you a Vtuber?

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Just a tuber.

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just a tuber.

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Not a Vtuber.

86
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Terrible.

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah.

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It is terrible, isn't it?

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is a...

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's like a support group for recovering tubers.

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's very important to have that because people don't

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
understand that it's a disease.

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's an affliction, especially when you review other

94
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
people's content primarily.

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just review TV shows and video games.

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Actually, a funny bit of lore is that one of my very

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
first videos on my channel is an orchestral cover of

98
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the PCP theme.

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait, what?

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

101
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, you can find it.

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's still up there.

103
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A PCP fan makes reviews.

104
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't know that.

105
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, it was one of my earliest things.

106
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Endless Jess commented on it calling me a fucking

107
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
hero.

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It was pretty great at the time.

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I had no idea about that.

111
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, that's wild.

112
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That changes...

114
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I got to say, this changes everything.

115
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, man.

116
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wow.

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We were just going to relentlessly shit on you, but now

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we like you.

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

121
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, okay.

122
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, that's...

123
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I mean, you can still relentlessly shit on me because

124
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I feel like that's more fun.

125
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

126
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

127
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

128
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Good, good, good.

129
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Stupid.

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What...

131
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So what have you...

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What have you been...

133
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry, I haven't looked at your channel in a little

134
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
bit.

135
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What have you been making recently?

136
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What have you been doing?

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, I jump all over.

138
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I started making more video game stuff.

139
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hmm.

140
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I just made a video complaining about Nintendo being

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
stupid, which is like just a cottage industry you can

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
always complain.

143
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it about the Melee thing?

144
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Melee taken down Twitch streamers for streaming a game

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
too early.

146
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

148
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

149
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

150
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

151
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

152
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

153
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

154
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

155
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

156
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

157
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

158
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

159
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

160
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just that stuff.

161
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

162
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I always...

163
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm in a perpetual cycle of abuse.

164
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You had like older videos about Fullmetal Alchemist and

165
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
then you made like a bigger series about it, right?

166
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

167
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I had like a big series, but it was old and shitty.

168
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

169
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And like it was me figuring out how to make videos and I

170
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
was doing absolutely brain dead things like mixing the

171
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
background audio in with me speaking and then I was

172
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
unable to take it apart because I deleted files and I

173
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
was just...

174
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It was a struggle.

175
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I decided to go back and make it less shitty and that

176
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
turned out to be a pretty good decision.

177
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So that's nice.

178
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Excellent.

179
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

180
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Excellent.

181
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So what's Redman been getting up to?

182
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey, Redman.

183
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

184
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How you been, man?

185
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've been done.

186
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm all right.

187
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I exist in the 2D, 2.5D realm.

188
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Look how squishy you are.

189
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Have you been working out?

190
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

191
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Your stoutness exercises?

192
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've been doing those...

193
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What do you call them?

194
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Crunches?

195
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Scrumples?

196
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Scree-crumples.

197
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The Redman crumples.

198
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

199
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Doin' squashes.

200
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Squashes, yes, squashes.

201
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's different from a squat.

202
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know how, really.

203
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Because there's no bones or muscles involved.

204
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's all fluid hydraulics.

205
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's all like a...

206
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You ever see Big Hero 6?

207
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm like that guy.

208
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

209
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Red.

210
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Blood inside.

211
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's like...

213
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When Redman works out, it's actually...

214
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's to keep his outer membrane supple.

215
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's the...

216
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's the goal.

217
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Redman is like...

218
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, man.

219
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Is Redman like...

220
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

221
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now, I don't think I talked about this specifically in the JDR lecture.

222
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But there's a thing about the slimes, or the jellies, rather.

223
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The jellies are...

224
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They're the white life forms.

225
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And they're just cellular clusters, basically.

226
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They're just fluid clusters.

227
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And they're drawn the way she draws eyes.

228
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
She draws them with this big vertical oval.

229
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And they look glossy.

230
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's just how she draws eyes.

231
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But she's made close-up diagrams.

232
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And she does anatomical diagrams with the jellies.

233
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And literally, the jellies have vertical strips

234
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of ocular cells or something that go up and down

235
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
on the surface of their membrane.

236
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right?

237
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's like...

238
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They're literally shaped like that.

239
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are Redman's eyes like that, or does he just have two eyeballs floating in there?

240
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I mean, it's a very complicated thing you just said.

241
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know.

242
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I definitely have eyeballs, but I can't blink for some reason.

243
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I haven't figured that out yet.

244
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No eyelids.

245
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know if Redman needs to blink.

246
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It looks like Redman has seen so much in his time

247
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that he's forgotten how to blink because he must always keep his eyes wide open for any threats.

248
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is Pupil's moved?

249
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, when the face tracking breaks, he just goes to default mode,

250
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
which means he stares directly at the camera, which is kind of funny.

251
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He bears into your soul.

252
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You know what?

253
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Man, I think we talked about this when Mary was here,

254
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
but I think it's cool.

255
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I wonder if there's some simple way to just have one arm.

256
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If I had a V-Tube avatar, which maybe I will work on one,

257
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but I would like to have a face and a body that moves around.

258
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You can do a full VR setup if you're really fucking fancy.

259
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I would just want one arm that I could just gesture with.

260
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That would be cool.

261
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Just one so I could just make a little Italian like,

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
what are you talking about?

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like imagining a puppet arm on a stick that you could wave in front to be like,

264
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
oh yes, I'm gesturing.

265
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That would be cool.

266
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What just simple gestures?

267
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If I was streaming or something, I could have a PNG of an arm and just move it around.

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, bad.

269
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, just click it with a mouse and just like...

270
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, click it with a mouse on the stream on OBS and then drag it around the screen like,

271
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
oh yes, something with my hands.

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Just like a flat, open palm hand full on front view and just like,

273
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
wag it back and forth like, hi guys.

274
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

275
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I feel like you could do it though.

276
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think you could do it.

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You might have to like cover one of your arms in like green or something,

278
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
like a green cloth so that the program doesn't pick it up maybe.

279
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I feel like it would be from like a user end.

280
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't know if you could jigger the software to do it,

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but from like a developer end, I feel like maybe it wouldn't be that hard to,

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
like instead of like a VR glove, because that's how like ones with more limbs work,

283
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
they have like VR gloves and feet and stuff,

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you could maybe just have like just something you could hold,

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
like it's just something you could like hold in your hand,

286
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
maybe like a like a fucking Wiimote like like light thing or something and like,

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
just so we could see where that is and it would just move the hand with that single point, right?

288
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It did not like a fully articulated like five finger hand or anything.

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Just a Wiimote dangling in the air.

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not an arm. It's just an image of a Wiimote.

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, much better because you're a gamer.

293
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's your hardcore gamer.

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, we're all gamer girls here, so.

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yay.

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
True.

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

298
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So, um...

299
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, so I wanted to mention about the creation of Redman VR, VTuber, not VR.

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I have to thank Mage for helping with one aspect.

301
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
She told me that in the way you make these things,

302
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you have a Photoshop file with all the different layers of all the different things

303
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you want to move independently from one another,

304
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and you input that into a thing called Live2D Cubism,

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and they have like templates like pre-made anime characters that you can animate,

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
which means they have like rigged all of the head motion, the body motion, the arms,

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the blinking eyes and the mouth and stuff.

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can just apply a new Photoshop file to those existing rigs,

309
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
so you don't actually need to make anything.

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You just need to tweak it so that it doesn't look strange.

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So what I did, what Mage told me about is you can get like a chibi character that they have,

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and I just like mapped the eyes to the eyes, the mouth to the mouth, the head and the body,

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and then I deleted like all of the hair and the arms and stuff that I need.

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I just exported it. It was very easy.

315
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When I did it, because I asked Mage about it, and she also told me about Live2D.

316
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wait, I don't think I used a template, although there is like an automatic,

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
there is like you can sort of just tell it to like automatically map a bunch of like mapping points onto your files.

318
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I made like a Photoshop file from scratch, loaded it in and then just told it like auto-generate,

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
mapping points, which it did.

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I got mine to move its head and to make expressions with its mouth,

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and the mouth worked really well, but he didn't have any eyelids, his eyes,

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
because he had really big eyes, and I think maybe it made him sensitive,

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
because his pupils would not stay steady, they would kind of like jitter in place,

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
even if I wasn't moving my eyes.

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I tried to make his hair like flow back and forth, but it wouldn't.

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It stayed stiff, and I never figured out why, but I had it so we could tilt his head,

327
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and I could just like Mary's cat ears.

328
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I said it so that he had like ears that you could control when his eyebrows went up,

329
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
his ears would go up, and when his eyebrows went down, his ears would go down.

330
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I should fuck around with him some more.

331
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, I feel like I need to add functionality, maybe eyebrows, so he can be angry,

332
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
but the thing I really need right now is-

333
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's like a robot.

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's like a robot friend who you can like tinker with sometimes.

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can like step in there and be like, hmm, maybe I'll give him like a more robust set of expressions.

336
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Maybe I'll give him like a soul or something.

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Maybe I'll make him sad and loose in the end.

338
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Give him some morale, morality, morale.

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe I'll give him a dark backstory and a quest for vengeance today,

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and you go in and you abuse him.

341
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Redman has the eyes of a killer, you know.

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's well-

343
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He shouldn't because he's a rowdy.

344
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He's a fucking fusser.

345
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
All right.

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's like, Redman has the potential to murder.

347
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's my opinion.

348
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, no question about that.

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, the lore of Redman, if you don't know, is in New Los Angeles City,

350
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
aka Neo Milwaukee, also known as Slime City,

351
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
there is two gangs, the rowdy fuckers and the cop killers,

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and Redman stumbled in one day and he was like,

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
hey guys, what's going on?

354
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And he loves blood.

355
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He wants blood and he kills people,

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but then turns out people in Slime City bleed slime instead of blood,

357
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and so you're just like, well, fuck it, fuck it, whatever.

358
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Can't do anything around this place.

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So he's like, he's kind of a weird pacifist.

360
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He's only a pacifist because there's no blood anywhere.

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's no blood.

362
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Wow, it's like a vampire that doesn't kill just because like, why bother?

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't get blood from these people.

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
All there is is this dang useless slime.

365
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What a fucking quirky weirdo.

366
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He's from...

367
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's a beautiful idea.

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He's from...

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Fuck, what's the place in Lord of Ghosts?

370
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, it's New New Biggin by the Sea, aka Neo York.

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, he's from New Biggin, aka Neo York, right?

372
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Originally, he emigrated or something or floated across the sea.

373
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He maybe took the train, I don't know.

374
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The tale of Red Man's journey is a strange one.

375
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He probably doesn't even remember.

376
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's shrouded in mystery, to say the least.

378
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And intrigue.

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And now here he is.

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He's gone on a journey and now he's here, guys.

382
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He made it.

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I made it all the way to the PCP.

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The top of the pyramid.

385
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I love the sassy little head bobs he's doing from time to time.

386
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, I really like...

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh yeah, hell yeah.

388
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, it's so cool to see him move like that.

389
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And then he looks straight at the camera.

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I have to finish one.

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I have to finish one.

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Soon.

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Soon.

394
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, so what's going on?

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What's going on, dudes?

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What do we want to talk about?

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Do you got any topics to discuss of interest this week?

399
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You know what?

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm...

401
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll think of something.

402
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I always think of something.

403
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't believe you would show up unprepared.

404
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Listen, my life is spent...

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh yeah, there we go.

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's what we could talk about.

407
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Life is just spent being unprepared.

408
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's all that being...

409
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like, my life since...

410
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
All of this lockdown crap and everything.

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I don't mean crap as in it's stupid,

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
because you got to lock shit down sometimes.

413
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I just mean I'm hiding out in my house.

414
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
My sleep schedule is abysmal.

415
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Waking up at 5 p.m. sometimes.

416
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Going like, what has happened to me?

417
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What have I become?

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Dude, I've...

419
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So how are you keeping yourself sane?

420
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Maybe that's a good topic.

421
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I've had quite a week in terms of like sleep schedule.

422
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You know, sometimes I go to bed a bit late.

423
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, boo-hoo.

424
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Wake up, boo-hoo.

425
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But this time it was like, I almost stayed up for an entire day.

426
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Just casually, just like not even thinking about it.

427
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I went to bed at 7.30 a.m. one of those days.

428
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It was just sort of like, what the fuck?

429
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't get a handle on this.

430
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have gotten completely fucked up.

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I finally gave up and put up blackout curtains

432
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
so I could just like go to sleep at like 1 p.m.

433
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and wake up at like, you know, 11 p.m.

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and just go like...

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm saying that I'm also just completely fucked up.

436
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay, yeah.

437
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's the worst for me and this was where I felt truly like I had failed myself

438
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
was I said, you know what, enough's enough.

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm staying up a whole night and then I'm not going to sleep

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and then I'm going to go to bed at a normal time.

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And then I went to bed at a normal time

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and I wake up and it's like 3 p.m. and I go, well, what the fuck?

443
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's literally...

444
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's exactly what happened to me today.

445
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's exactly what happened to me today.

446
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's the opposite happened to me.

447
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I was like, you know what?

448
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I should really go to bed at a reasonable time tonight.

449
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I stayed up until 6 again.

450
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And I was like, well, I fucked it up.

451
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I go to bed.

452
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I wake up at 11 and I'm fine.

453
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know how that worked.

454
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I mean, if you're in like...

455
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well, if you're in like a rhythm, I don't know.

456
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like when you're in a rhythm, sometimes you wake up at the same time

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
no matter when you went to sleep.

458
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But I've always been waking up at like 3 p.m. then 4 p.m. then 5 p.m.

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I was like...

460
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

461
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The days just are nothing.

462
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
All I'm learning is that we all need help.

463
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Everything is meaningless.

464
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
All I have is my video games and anime.

465
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And my red man.

466
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And my red man.

467
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's all you really need though.

468
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's true.

469
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And his warm and his blood to keep me warm at night.

470
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, it's getting cold these winter months.

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hell yeah.

472
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

474
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm all fucked up.

475
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm at odd hours.

476
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't see anyone.

477
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I got my blackout curtains up.

478
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's dark in here all the time.

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's great.

480
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I've regressed.

481
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I've regressed to like...

482
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know.

483
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I guess I was gonna like pick a time in my life when I've also been

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
just like no outside world, no relation to the outside world.

485
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But there's actually been multiple times.

486
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This happens every so often.

487
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's completely unhinged and off of any schedule at all.

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's great.

489
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's nice.

490
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't even mind it.

491
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Eventually you have to accept it.

492
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, I'm at the point where I'm accepting it.

493
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm like, I'm staying up real late again.

494
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But you know what?

495
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm awake.

496
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And usually at the end of the day I'm like, well, that was a long time.

497
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like sweat off my brow day of playing video games.

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's time to do some art.

499
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's time to draw.

500
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I do a little bit of drawing.

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And it's, you know, like if I'm awake and I feel like doing some work

502
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
right at the end of the day, I guess I may as well capitalize on that

503
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
if that's gonna happen.

504
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So just this is how it is.

505
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't have any control over anything.

506
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm just gonna like take things as they come.

507
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, that's the issue is like prime time for me has become 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.

508
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Like when I'm up at that time, I'm working because if I don't,

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have like this sense of what am I doing wrong?

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So you just you just plow through work at those hours.

511
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's probably when Red Man was created, you know, when I one thing I always

512
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
find that if I if I wake up and if I start doing something productive

513
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
immediately, I will have like a good and productive day.

514
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And if I don't, I'm fucked.

515
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like if I if I wake up and I start like, you know, wasting time or doing

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
this like 90 95 percent of the time, I will continue to do that for the

517
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
rest of the day.

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So like my my like self hack is like, yeah, OK, if something needs to get

519
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
done, just make sure that I do something like immediately when I wake

520
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
up and then I'm like, I've like set myself on the right course for

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
like, yeah, my wife.

522
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I won't wait today.

523
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah.

524
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Like she she scared the shit out of me.

525
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
My wife, because all of a sudden she just like the alarm went off and then

526
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
she did like pretty much a full front flip up out of the bed, just like

527
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
catapulting her body.

528
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I'm like, what are you doing?

529
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And she's like, well, if I don't do this, I'm not doing anything.

530
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Like it's either I get that with this flip.

531
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That is like just just catapults.

532
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I see. OK.

533
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That is like leave the bed with momentum.

534
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Leave the bed.

535
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah. Get out of the bed.

536
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's the first step.

537
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I mean, some of the some of the days I'm like, most of the time I keep my

538
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
phone on my desk out of reach, so I have to get out of bed.

539
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If I want to check my tweets, I want to see the notifications that are coming

540
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
in.

541
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hell, yeah, hell, yeah.

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It was a good strategy.

543
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you the worst is when I wake up and the pure heft and beauty of my cat

544
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
is on top of me and I'm like, well, I can't possibly get up now because I

545
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
can't disturb the boy.

546
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I fucking hate cats.

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I fucking.

548
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
How dare you?

549
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No.

550
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How dare you?

551
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
They're like that.

552
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They're like that.

553
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And it's so awful.

554
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's beautiful.

555
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's the best thing to ever happen to me.

556
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
God, no.

557
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Well, how does your cat appreciate being moved?

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's the question.

559
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's the killer question.

560
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He accepts anything and everything that we do.

561
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He's like, that's very complacent.

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Like if I want to get up, I can do it.

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't want to because he's so snuggly and nice.

564
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I see.

565
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Okay.

566
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
All right.

567
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
See, it's all about framing.

568
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's all about framing.

569
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When the cat is like going to attack you for moving them, then it's like, I'm not

570
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
in control.

571
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't.

572
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm a prisoner here.

573
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm forced to feed this person.

574
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He's not like that.

575
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But like the cat I have similar is just like completely complacent.

576
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can pick her up in any way and she will always find an excuse to start licking

577
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
her hand, even if she's like sort of trying to get away.

578
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
She's just like sort of normal.

579
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Like, oh, it's a person lick.

580
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's good.

581
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's so nice.

582
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

583
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The beautiful sandpaper ton brushing across your skin.

584
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

585
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Ben, I don't understand how you couldn't like cats.

586
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I used to think like you.

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I used to think like you.

588
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I just don't.

589
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Then you don't use, I don't know.

590
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's just, it's not that I hate them or anything, but like, I don't particularly, I like them

591
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
well enough, but like, I wouldn't want to own one.

592
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Like if I see a nice cat, I'll pet it or whatever.

593
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah.

594
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, okay.

595
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
There you go.

596
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

597
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You aren't out here kicking cats.

598
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm not out here kicking cats, but if I, but if I woke up and there was a cat on me,

599
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,000
I wouldn't be like, oh, I'd be like, get the fuck up.

600
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, like I wake up and he's wrapped around my arm, like just cuddling up against me.

601
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And I'm like, well, what are you doing?

602
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You know, you sweaty being you warm creature.

603
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hmm.

604
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's, it's great.

605
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You know, so this, like this cat shows, shows us, we went to go look at the, at the shelter

606
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
with all the animals and he's reaching through the bars, just wanted to have belly rubs.

607
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's how you find a good one as you go.

608
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And that's why I learned I didn't know this until, until this moment was like, it was

609
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
right after Halloween, like a little, a couple of weeks.

610
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And we found him.

611
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And I learned that apparently animal shelters often won't sell black cats around Halloween

612
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
because people will like buy them to like, I don't know, sacrifice them or something.

613
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't know what's going on in the world.

614
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What?

615
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Truly.

616
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

617
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah.

618
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Wait, I thought that'd be like a fake thing, but then people there were confirming to me

619
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
like, oh yeah, no, we, we can't sell them around then because bad things will happen to

620
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
them.

621
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And I just, what the fuck?

622
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
All right.

623
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
At first I was thinking, oh, you can't sell black cats because it's like a Christmas thing.

624
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
People buy a puppy for Christmas and then they don't actually want to keep it.

625
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Like get a, they get a black cat for Halloween just for their costume.

626
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then they throw it in the dumpster afterwards.

627
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But sacrificing, like what, what is that?

628
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Like, I guess some, you might be right about some of it.

629
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Part of it might be a weird thing for like Halloween festivities of having a costume

630
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
piece.

631
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But yeah, it sounded like some people are out here ritualistic sacrifices to the blood

632
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
god.

633
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't know what's going on.

634
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Well, if you're talking about a blood god, then it's fine.

635
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sorry.

636
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What are people sacrificing for Halloween?

637
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Black cats, man.

638
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Black cats.

639
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Like butchering them?

640
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't know.

641
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't, that's, that's a question I still have to this day when they said like, yeah,

642
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
we can't sell them because people will hurt them.

643
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And I'm like, uh, I didn't know that we live in, in a world where we're still holding on

644
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
to superstitions of black cats so deeply that we would go out of our way to harm them.

645
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Geez, geez, frickin Louise.

646
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
My cat's a black cat.

647
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Never heard of such a thing.

648
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And she's like, it's great because she's cool and like it looks like a little panther in

649
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the distance in a silhouette sort of way.

650
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Um, but you can't take a picture of her.

651
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I've never been able to show anyone what she looks like through a phone.

652
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It just doesn't work.

653
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It is a struggle.

654
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They're just black blobs.

655
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Wait, I saw, I saw a really good poorly drawn cat the other day.

656
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Um, and I have to, um,

657
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Was it the square?

658
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Show you.

659
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It was the square.

660
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

661
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Wait, I'll encase lower.

662
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It hasn't seen.

663
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I will throw that in the, in the boom, baby.

664
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
There it is.

665
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

666
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'll check out this poorly, poorly drawn cat.

667
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, I did see that.

668
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I didn't see that.

669
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I really like it.

670
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah.

671
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's fucked up.

672
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Honestly, it's fucked up that it could be shaped like that to begin with.

673
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know.

674
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's upsetting.

675
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
They're liquid beings.

676
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I guess so.

677
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
They're like memory cat.

678
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay.

679
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Like, whoa, what the hell happened to my eyes just there?

680
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I think blinking fucks up the thing.

681
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
They, when you blink, they like jerk back to neutral.

682
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They do something.

683
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Right?

684
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
When your, when your eyes are closed, it doesn't know where to put your pupils.

685
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So it just puts them back in the neutral position.

686
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's what it probably would be.

687
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's because you don't have eyelids on the thing yet.

688
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Right?

689
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah.

690
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That they're, that yeah, I need to add like a Photoshop layer of the eyes being closed.

691
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I didn't think of that.

692
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, I just saw them do a little twirly thing.

693
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
They just did a little like.

694
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Awesome.

695
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Awesome.

696
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm just looking at it.

697
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm just looking at it.

698
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm squished.

699
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's just, I keep looking at him.

700
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He's mesmerizing.

701
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

702
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Like a body, like a bowl of Jell-O bearing into my soul.

703
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's, I love him.

704
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's, it's so cool.

705
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I, I really, I'm, I'm happy.

706
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm happy that Red Man exists finally.

707
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
After all these years, he's finally.

708
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's finally real.

709
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
He's finally real.

710
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh no, he's, he's frozen.

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
He's staring at me.

712
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He's stopped staring at me, Red Man.

713
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
No, that can't happen.

714
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh God.

715
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm looking, I'm looking over Twitter.

716
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Trying to remember what, what happened this week?

717
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, Ben, you said you had some hot goss.

718
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, well you mentioned hot goss.

719
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Maybe.

720
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay.

721
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This is a weird, this is a weird story.

722
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This is going to, this is going to sound very bizarre, but yeah,

723
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
something happened yesterday that I thought was very remarkable.

724
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So I'm, I'm on Twitter and I'm, and I'm looking at, um, it's a,

725
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I passed by a tweet from that account who I've mentioned before,

726
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
who I really like.

727
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Posadist Trapgod, who lives in Atlanta and he's like a,

728
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you know, communist and he's out counter protesting,

729
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
uh, uh, some like, it's some like pro-maga, uh, uh, uh,

730
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
what's the protest, right?

731
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
There's like some pro-Trump protesting going on in Atlanta

732
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and he's out like, you know, he's on the other side.

733
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He's counter protesting them.

734
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He's like taking pictures of them.

735
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He's tweeting about it.

736
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And then I see another, uh, a tweet from someone else.

737
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't remember who, uh, from, that's the same, uh, the same,

738
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
uh, protest from the other side.

739
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like this is someone who's on the, the MAGA side of it.

740
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
They're tweeting about the Atlanta protest.

741
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So I, I look and I look at the stream and who do I see in this

742
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
protest, uh, this pro-maga fucking thing.

743
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Uh, uh, in the stream, then, uh, then May.

744
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh.

745
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh.

746
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You got, yeah.

747
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
May's there with Ethan Rao from the kill stream.

748
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh, of course.

749
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And I watch, and I, and I watch, and I watch for a while as

750
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
she and him stand in a crowd listening to white nationalist

751
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Nick Fuentes give a speech about how the governor of Georgia

752
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
must overturn the vote and how President Trump must be

753
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
president not just for four more years, but for life.

754
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Uh, and they all clap and cheer.

755
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Uh, that's so bizarre that you happen to find that on some

756
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
stream.

757
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That's, that's the really bizarre part of this to me.

758
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, I had to, I had to

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
mention it because I was like, wow, that was a journey.

760
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That was a journey that I went on.

761
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah.

762
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I wonder what they were doing.

763
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's weird.

764
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's really, really weird.

765
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Like I could imagine if you asked them, they're just like,

766
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
oh yeah, we just wanted to see like laugh at it, you know,

767
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
have a bit of fun.

768
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

769
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You know, how distance ourselves.

770
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No, no, no.

771
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
They were cheering.

772
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
They were cheering.

773
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, what do they say on that show?

774
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Maga hats and everything.

775
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Disavow, they'd say disavow over and over again, I think.

776
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Which, which, um, yeah.

777
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Like, are you a hundred percent sure this wasn't just some

778
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
lookalike?

779
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,040
100 I am 100% sure Ethan did you know that did you recognize Ethan Ralph as the Ethan man, okay

780
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,820
Yeah, and I know yeah, I know who he is. I would like to see this

781
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Anywhere to look

782
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
It was the kill it was the kill stream

783
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,040
Which is on D live I think so the footage was from the kill stream that you saw. Yes, okay

784
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, that was the that was the stream that it that was linked

785
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah

786
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,680
the

787
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't know. I don't I don't know what else to say about it other than to

788
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
A mention that that occurred

789
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,440
You weren't kidding about the hot goss that is that is hot goss. It's wild, right?

790
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,480
Well, just like because if I was reading a work of fiction and this was a plot point

791
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I would say that is contrived

792
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,760
And like kind of silly that this is how something developed

793
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Um, but then here we are

794
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,280
It doesn't doesn't surprise me as much as maybe I wish it did

795
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,640
You know

796
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,920
She she was all on that Ralph retort thing

797
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
For a while. Yeah

798
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,920
Oh, yeah, I did I did like she listened to it or she listened to it. She was on it a couple times

799
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,840
Um, I I remember watching the first one where she was on and she did pretty well

800
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,160
Um, but I guess I never watched it. It was all right

801
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,720
I mean, it was like all right in the sense that it was

802
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,120
I could I could see the appeal, but I didn't like what was being said

803
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,880
And I didn't like the people that were calling in. They were very nasty

804
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
Lol, yeah, yeah, the chat was very

805
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Special. I I saw some of the chat

806
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,800

And then he won't even join craig's having a mood. He won't even come back. I don't

826
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
What is wrong with him? What do we?

Oh, no, no bench. What do we what do we pay him for? I don't know why I just left the call

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,720
You're so mad you had to leave craig

I demand your presence. Okay. Well, this is maybe I'm gonna try to plea with him craig

830
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Please come back. We need you. We didn't mean to call you all of those terrible horrible things in chat

831
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,680
We didn't mean to consistently insult you in chat while we were speaking

832
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah, like I maybe maybe he's a big fan of the kill stream and was like, you know

833
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm out of here. He's like fuck this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and teeth are the real fascists. He said

834
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,840
Oh, yeah, oh craig's back. Yeah, craig. Oh, no by craig. What what is he doing?

835
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I don't I don't understand

836
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,120
It says fail to join if I persistently fail to join and maybe an issue with the voice server

837
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,680
Well issue with no, there's no no, there's no problem with the voice server

838
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,480
There's no problem with the voice server. Is there a particular reason why he's named craig?

839
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,480
I don't know. He's just he's just a recording bot and

840
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,560
I don't know why he's named craig. There's actually two craigs. There's a craig two

841
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
But we don't need him. We don't need two of them

842
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,600
Okay

843
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Uh, and I don't know why he's named craig

844
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Probably the guy made one of those things

845
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,400
That's how it goes sometimes

846
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,280
Oh

847
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,400
Craig's back. Okay. I guess he's back even though. I just told him to leave. Oh, he failed he failed

848
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,160
Okay, whatever. Well, we'll just have to see it without him. Yeah, if we're all recording it should be fine

849
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,960
Hope hopefully he captured the early part from the pre the pre show

850
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,680
discussion for that bonus episode patreon.com slash the procrastinators

851
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,160
Probably do a behind the scenes a clip show pretty soon. There we go. He's back

852
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
He's back, baby

853
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Now we're recording

854
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,040
Now a recording he says in his fucking robot voice craig. I missed you. We're sorry craig

855
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
God bless you craig

856
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,920
You're doing a civil service here. Have my babies craig. Oh, yes. Just get deep inside me craig

857
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,360
Oh craig he's a shit you craig salad

858
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,360
Craig left and I'm revoking my permission for craig to enter me. I um, I did um

859
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So kip kip kip from rfck did a meme

860
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,720
Or did a did a uh, uh, uh, what's it called like a ranked a tier list of sandwiches

861
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
I saw this on twitter

862
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,640
And I was like I I have to do I have to do my own sandwich tier list now

863
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,640
Uh, I had to yes, I saw that on germa's stream

864
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,640
There's a lot of sandwiches. Oh, I don't think we use you saw you saw my tier list on germa's no the the sandwich thing

865
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
He did it

866
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
And he had a lot of opinions

867
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,080
I've realized from from from watching that that I don't fucking know sandwiches

868
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,600
There's all of these things that I'm just like what the hell is that?

869
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,720
Like ingredients I understand but like named sandwiches of a specific kind. I just I just guess I don't know so much

870
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,160
There were a bunch of sandwiches that I had never had before actually there were a lot like the

871
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,200
Tied for the biggest uh group in my tier ranking was never had it

872
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,920
Uh, let me read you all the sandwiches. I've never had okay. You croak. Miss. Do you have an image so we can follow along

873
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Oh, um, yeah, sure. Um

874
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,520
If you insist uh, here, I'll post it in general. I'm bad at listening to this visual

875
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm bad at listening to bed saying no all the sandwiches. I've never had croak. Monsieur croak. Madame

876
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
torta ham bone puree

877
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Monte Cristo tonkatsu

878
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,200
bocadillo

879
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
liverwurst cucumber tea

880
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,760
Italian beef and kentucky hot brown

881
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,560
Are these like common sandwiches because I've I I don't know apparently I'm uncultured. I don't know anything about anything

882
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
I have not I

883
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,480
I thought a bocadillo was just a Spanish word for like a sub sandwich

884
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,320
I didn't think it was a specific kind of sandwich. Um, Italian beef

885
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,600
I just I may have had that and just not known I was having one because that sounds pretty common

886
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,400
Like you didn't know that the beef was Italian, but it was beef

887
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,400
I I don't know it must be just a certain things on it

888
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,280
I don't fucking know and I and I know of Monte Cristo

889
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,800
I've heard of Monte Cristos and I've heard of tonkatsu's but the other ones I've like

890
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,800
I've never heard of a cucumber tea sandwich or a Kentucky hot brown

891
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
um

892
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,600
Mate, I don't I didn't know about these the croaks the croak

893
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,840
Uh couple croak. Monsieur and croak. Madame never heard of it. I

894
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,440
The biggest struggle for me was where to place egg salad

895
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,920
Because on some days egg salad is definitely in the nice category, but other days it's in the good category. I don't know

896
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,280
Egg salad in my own personal opinion is an abomination, especially if it's being eaten in public

897
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
You're a fucking mute. You're a fucking mutant

898
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,200
Egg salad underrated egg salad is highly underrated the scent of egg salad pervades

899
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,000
Everything it has ever been around. I wish I could smell an egg salad right now

900
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,360
This if I know you don't when I smell egg salad I just get hungry and I think I'm jealous. I wish it

901
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,920
It's not scrambled. It's hard. It's hard boiled and chopped. It just doesn't smell good though. It's powerful

902
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,080
Yeah, yeah, I I don't know. That's just something I like but I like it sort of like the smell sort of I don't know

903
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,640
Like I I enjoy an egg egg salad sandwich is just sort of like comforting

904
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,560
You bite into it and it's like a sandwich, but it's also like you're having an egg

905
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,400
I

906
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,880
Love it. I like in my personal opinion

907
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,920
I'd I'd rather just eat an egg or eat some bread like I don't need these things to come together

908
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,480
It's such a strange. It's such a non-strange thing to combine though. It's not like like putting an egg salad sandwich

909
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,320
I don't know. I chocolate ice cream with uh, like

910
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
roast beef

911
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,640
I love like I love deviled eggs and an egg salad sandwich is basically just a deviled egg sandwich because it's just

912
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,600
Oh gosh, you brought up deviled eggs and now I need to tell something. Oh gosh. Okay. All right, so

913
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Has have you watched spongebob?

914
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,000
Sure. Yes, like okay, so there's an episode in that where spongebob talks about how

915
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,680
um

916
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,480
There's like there's a pinata with deviled eggs in the episode

917
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,880
Okay, and at one point I was talking with my wife about different types of eggs and she brought up deviled eggs

918
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,840
And I was like I can't believe people put those in pinatas

919
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
And she's like

920
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
She just looks at me and she's like

921
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,880
What do you mean?

922
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,360
And I'm like, you know people will put them in pinatas at parties. She's like you mean in spongebob. I'm like, what are you talking about?

923
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,080
That's a thing people do and I had this gap of knowledge where I had seen it in spongebob forgot

924
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,520
It was from spongebob and thought people were putting deviled eggs

925
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
In pinatas

926
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,720
Dude, I can't believe they put february eggs in pinatas. I mean it's not as gross as this, but it's like if you read that like reddit

927
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,680
That reddit that reddit post about like

928
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,240
My boyfriend like literally will not wipe his ass because like he thinks you're not supposed to or something

929
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,000
What?

930
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
Like he thinks it's like gay or something like he genuinely is like no guys don't wipe their ass like come on

931
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Oh, of course

932
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,840
Yeah, but anyways, so like I she made fun of me for that

933
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,200
Well, she still makes fun of me for that and rightfully so because I don't know

934
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,280
Yeah, absolutely. I can't believe we put deviled eggs in pinatas

935
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,160
That's pretty wild man. I like that a lot actually

936
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,200
Yeah, anyway, sorry for derailing the sandwiches, but you said deviled eggs and I had war flashbacks

937
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,400
I don't know. All I had to do was um, all I wanted to do was draw attention to the underrated egg salad sandwich. Um

938
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,320
if there's an

939
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Another one on here is the Thanksgiving

940
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,480
My my lowest my lowest ranking for sandwich is I'd still eat it because like there's no sandwich that I think is like bad

941
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm surprised PB and J is down and I'd still eat it obviously because to me like

942
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,520
I don't know PB and J. It's a classic. It's a gooder

943
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Put it in my mouth. It's fine

944
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Like, you know, it's fine

945
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
it's not

946
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,680
I think it's I think it's odd how like one of the most classic sandwiches is also like the only sweet sandwich

947
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,840
Like every like every other sandwich is savory. PB and J is sweet. It's like it's it's actually like

948
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,080
Completely different from every other sandwich on this list. That's a good point

949
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,760
Yeah, if you think if you really think about it, it's fucked up like it's fucked up

950
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,720
Like it doesn't it is the only other the only other sweet sandwich I can think of is like those weird little

951
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,840
Rolls where they put cream cheese in it. Do you know what I mean?

952
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Um, they're disturbing. They're disturbing creations. They're more like these fancy little like finger sandwiches

953
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,560
Little rolls that they put cream cheese in. Yeah, it's not good. It's like I don't I don't know what you're talking about

954
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,560
Okay. Yeah, it's it's a basically like a circular looking one and they have like cream cheese rolled into it and then

955
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,440
Sometimes there's like fake cherry shit in there. It's not good like a crepe

956
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,760
Um, you know what? Yeah, it's pretty much like a crepe, but it's like a piece of fancy bread and it's not very good

957
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,720
Okay. Okay. Okay. Is it like a rolled up crepe that's been sliced into like a spiral?

958
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,160
Yeah, kind of like that. Okay. Okay. Like you could you could put it that way. I don't know if I would call that a sandwich

959
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,520
But uh, I don't I got you. That's a good point. Yeah, I'm not sure if it it shouldn't qualify as a sandwich

960
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:48,560
It's an abomination. I mean this brings this obviously this recall the the ancient is a hot dog a sandwich chart

961
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,880
Everything is the sand of the sandwich alignment. Yeah, I I've seen that

962
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,160
What what Ben what is your stance on hot dog specifically?

963
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,480
um

964
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,320
Because I can't yeah, it's it's a yeah, it's a sandwich. Okay. I would agree the

965
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
It depends on the

966
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,240
in the merriam webster's dictionary defines

967
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,560
specifically includes a clause in the definition of sandwich that means it can include um

968
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,000
A filling between a split roll and that's what a hot dog is. It's a sausage in a split roll

969
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,560
So yeah, it's yeah, but like you wouldn't call a kebab a sandwich or a or a hero

970
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,440
um

971
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,160
I don't know. Uh, well that well. Yeah, because that's not a split roll. That's a that's like a wrap

972
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,120
Or a pocket so split so the roll has to be something that you could turn into a sandwich if you split it all the way through

973
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,280
although

974
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,800
Well, no, it is it is a sandwich even if it's merely split. I mean like like in terms of like bread

975
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,520
Things like you can't wrap the bread around the sandwich. It has to be cut into

976
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,280
I don't know. I honestly like I'm a bit I'm a bit of a of a sandwich anarchist myself

977
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,120
I kind of think that like uh, yeah, maybe a maybe a euro or a or a pita pocket is a sandwich

978
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,240
I'm I'm inclined to feel like it is even though I can't give like a robust

979
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,080
explanation

980
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
Is a pizza pop a sandwich then?

981
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,120
What the fuck is a pizza pop like a like a pizza you don't know what a pizza pop is

982
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,400
Like a pizza pocket like a piece. Yeah, yeah, pizza pocket pizza. I mean you said I envisioned like a frozen like popsicle

983
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
Okay, uh

984
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
No, no, I think

985
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,880
What makes

986
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,960
What makes it what makes a pita what makes a pita or a euro feel like a sandwich to me is the fact that it's assembled

987
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,840
Whereas like the fact that like the the the pocket is like sealed in a factory

988
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,240
Makes it feel less like a sandwich to me. What if you made it at like home though?

989
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,520
How you you can't yeah. Oh, yeah, you can I've made them homemade before man. What it's good shit. Yeah

990
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,800
So wait, what what is a pizza pocket? Is it like a pizza where the bread is on both sides?

991
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Yeah, it's kind of like it's it's um

992
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,320
Like the crust exterior and then inside you like put the stuff like a calzone

993
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,920
Um

994
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,320
Kind of you know what now I need to figure out the technical definition of a pizza pocket

995
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,320
We could we could I mean we could go down the sandwich rabbit hole

996
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,600
I mean, yeah, we could just talk about sandwiches for the rest of this is fucking is fucking ravioli a sandwich

997
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,600
I mean the little sandwich is basically just just several sandwiches stacked on top of each other. Yeah

998
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,840
A spaghetti is actually just a bunch of like it's just like a

999
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,480
Sort of three-dimensional. That's where I have to that's where I draw the lines

1000
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
because

1001
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,400
No, but because the the topping the the filling the meat or whatever you want to call it

1002
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,880
Can go under and over and all over around the bread

1003
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
carbohydrate in this case

1004
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,360
spaghetti

1005
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,800
Um, and I feel like that definitely changes lasagna counts

1006
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,160
Um, I didn't say that you said that

1007
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,600
Okay, I'm trying to think if lasagna counts because like maybe if

1008
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,280
If the top of the lasagna and the bottom of the lasagna are both like

1009
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Uh, you know the lasagna sheet

1010
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,600
And then you know all of the inside is like the stuff

1011
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,720
You can't you can't really have like lasagna with all of the the the pasta right at the bottom

1012
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
It wouldn't be called that

1013
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,040
You know

1014
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,560
Well, what I'm saying is what I'm saying is that lasagna is like

1015
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,840
Noodle it's like carbs filling carbs filling carbs filling

1016
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,400
So it's basically just it's basically just a multi layered sandwich, right?

1017
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:58,800
Um, I don't know I would say that that that checks out just because of aesthetic things like it's it's usually like a flat

1018
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,360
plane like a bread

1019
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,600
Um, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly

1020
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,600
But spaghetti I think just because of the fact that it's not intended to be eaten

1021
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,680
Um in layers. It's just a mulch. It's just a squelch

1022
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,440
Of all the ingredients you you you eat it however you like if you put a if you get a ham sandwich

1023
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,920
And it's like little little ripped up bits of bread and little ripped up bits of ham and you eat it with a spoon

1024
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
Is it still a sandwich? I don't think so

1025
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Uh

1026
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,600
There's actually people are debating this online apparently I just looked up is lasagna a sandwich

1027
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,920
This is a years a years long

1028
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,480
Uh odyssey like we're we'll never we'll never get to the bottom of it. Nobody somebody somebody said something interesting

1029
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,640
Which is impossible pick it up with your hands and eat it

1030
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,320
If you're very cool, you can like me if you if you have if you have to eat it with a knife and fork

1031
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,080
I think that's I I do I agree. That's that's kind of disqualifying. Yeah

1032
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,120
Yeah, I'll give it. I'll give it that so yeah

1033
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Uh pasty what are they called?

1034
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,720
What are they called so that I can tell you what they are because they're a british thing pasty

1035
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,280
um, oh

1036
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,200
Different these are uh yorkshire past no it's not yorkshire

1037
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,960
Okay, it's like a it's like a it's like one of those jamaican like beef pockets

1038
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,760
A pasty god these look good. Yeah, they're like cheese and beef in a in a thing

1039
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:29,280
And it's intended to be eaten with your hands. It's like a work of food. It's like an easy way to have food on the job

1040
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,160
That's the other day. The other day I I learned about the worst british food. I've ever heard of um

1041
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,080
It was a spotted penis. Is that the one?

1042
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,880
Wait, what no the spotted dick is a thing and people. No, no, no, I don't I I've heard of that

1043
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,080
I don't know what it is. Um, no what I am talking about is the this is so fucking funny

1044
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,120
Um, um, I'm scrolling back because I remember who was talking about okay, okay

1045
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
It is the the vegan kebab

1046
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,040
The what the weekend the vegan kebab

1047
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
What does it consist of okay?

1048
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,800
This was like a you here. I'll post the video. This is so good. Um

1049
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,960
There's a whole video on it. Okay. Yeah, there's a whole okay

1050
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,440
I guess I guess vegan I guess vegan is like the name for some part of britain or some like some person from a certain

1051
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
From we can we can

1052
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
All right, um

1053
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,520
Is that up? Is that a place? I I don't recognize it, but I guess it is. Um

1054
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,680
Is is it what it looks like? It's just a pie but with a bun burger bun

1055
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,360
It's a meat pie if it's a it's a sandwich, but the filling is a pie. That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen

1056
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,720
Yeah, like a pie is basically already a sandwich

1057
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,920
A pie is already like meat encased in bread. It's not even a kebab

1058
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,720
The kebab needs a wrap for it, doesn't it?

1059
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,720
I

1060
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,640
I thought if you like skewered through see yeah, I thought that a kebab

1061
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,840
I thought that a kebab was about it's about the meat on the skewer that you carve off like I thought it was

1062
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,040
It was the meat shish kebab. Wait kebab. No, no, no, no. I'm not I'm not saying like a shish kebab

1063
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,120
I'm I'm talking about the sandwich kebab, but I thought what called what was what made it that was the sliced meat

1064
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,720
Um that comes from the big piece of meat on the skewer

1065
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
I think well

1066
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,840
I'm not a I'm not greek and I don't know these things

1067
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,800
But I think I've had like kebabs

1068
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,480
Where the meat inside is you know chunkier

1069
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,200
But I don't know it probably probably true donna kebab is is the one where you slice the meat down

1070
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,160
Yeah, that's the the german one right um the

1071
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,800
the the

1072
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
Oh, that's that's

1073
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,960
Well, then okay. Well, if that's if that's not if the meat from the if the sliced meat isn't what makes the kebab

1074
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,640
Then I don't know what it does because then it just seems like it's just a pocket

1075
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,360
I think that that that literally is the the thing because it's like the the bread

1076
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,640
I think it comes from Greece the the or turkey or you know that area of the word Mediterranean

1077
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,440
They use that type of bread the flat bread and they slice it open and put stuff in it and depending on what the type of thing is

1078
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,880
It's either like a donna kebab or a shish kebab or

1079
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,440
Because you're not you're not really supposed to eat the shish kebab on a stick

1080
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,720
You're supposed to put it into the bread and eat it like that

1081
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,520
This this video is so fucking funny. It's like he

1082
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Like he's not even speaking english

1083
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,400
He like okay

1084
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,640
They he goes to this place and he orders the vegan kebab and it's just a fucking pie on a bun

1085
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,400
And then he asks for like another thing the smack barm pee weight

1086
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,560
And and the smack barm the smack barm pee weight

1087
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,080
Is literally it's just like it's like a chicken patty

1088
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,440
And the and the pee pee wet

1089
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,560
In smack barm pee wet what it is

1090
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,440
It's just the the liquid runoff from like cooked peas

1091
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,280
It's just like the the soup of a pea soup just the liquid part just kind of splattered on to the chicken

1092
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,280
patty

1093
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,840
And so a smack barm pee wet is like a chicken sandwich with like gross pee water splattered

1094
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
And he says it's like

1095
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,000
It looks disgusting. What do you say?

1096
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,520
What do you say? Oh, and then he gets his full order and he's like uh a vegan akimbo with a smack barm pee wet

1097
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,080
And i'm like that's not you're not allowed to say these things. You're not allowed to talk like that. You should go to jail

1098
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,600
Oh for sure. You should be fast-tracked to the nearest attention facility. Fuck yeah

1099
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:45,840
I I I kind of would would eat that though because like I I love like mushy peas with with with things like class food

1100
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,120
It's just it's good. You know, I looks disgusting, but I would I probably I'm talking shit

1101
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,160
I'm talking shitty. I don't actually think it sounds that bad. It's like a sandwich topping

1102
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,680
It's just but uh, but uh, it's just but it what's gross about it is just that it's called pee wet

1103
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,440
Pee wet pee wet a smack barm pee wet with a vegan kebab

1104
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,600
And then it's like oh, oh a scouser tries the vegan kebab like ah, yes a scouser

1105
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,040
And then he takes a bite and he's like no, that's what I call a buddy and I'm like, ah, yes the scouser tries the buddy

1106
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,200
So many layers it just keeps going. I don't know what any of these means. I know I know all these things

1107
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,800
I

1108
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:35,120
Know like I know that in America in America. We have the chip buddy, which is a kind of sandwich

1109
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,920
So I'm assuming that a buddy is just a sandwich

1110
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:45,920
Oh, yeah chip buddy is is yes like you put chips a lot of fries into between bread and eat it

1111
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,520
I'm not too fond of it honestly because it's like it's too much carbs and not enough anything else

1112
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,400
But maybe if you put a lot of vinegar and salt and stuff on

1113
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,680
Um

1114
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,800
Yeah, I've I've had one before I thought it was weird

1115
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,400
It kind of reminds me of like spaghetti sandwiches, which I think is another like bizarre thing that people do

1116
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
Uh, I've never understood that

1117
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:15,440
Spaghetti sandwiches. Yeah, what is this world? I'm learning of it's it's it's weird because it's it's it's it has the same problem

1118
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,120
As the week in kebab, which is just that like why do you need to double up? Why do you need to carve like it's like the point

1119
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,760
The point of spaghetti is that it's a carbohydrate vessel to carry the flavor of the sauce to your mouth

1120
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,280
Yeah, like no like before I was being facetious saying that they should go to jail

1121
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,760
But these people do need to be stopped and I don't know what like I don't know what we should do about it

1122
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,240
I just know that something must be done

1123
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,920
So how has the government let this go on how put pusatist pusatist trap god when he was at the atlanta protest

1124
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,840
He was like filming like the the mag of people chanting and he he said like you know

1125
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,880
I'm sorry for the tone shift, but it just reminded me

1126
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,840
He said like you know, there's a lot of people here who will never be reached

1127
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,760
And it just begs the question of what can be done or what what must be done

1128
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,120
And so that's not a change in tone. This is very pertinent

1129
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
This is the same thing. Okay

1130
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,560
What can we do? I've tried to make a spaghetti sandwich before and I found it's it was it's hard

1131
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,560
Like it's hard to keep together like it doesn't it's not an actual thing

1132
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,080
I think the idea like I think the idea the idea is like oh you have leftover spaghetti

1133
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,800
So it's like, hmm. What can I do with this? I'll make a sandwich out of it same with like the thanksgiving sandwich, right?

1134
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,520
It's like, oh, I have leftover thanksgiving shit. I'll put it on a sandwich that makes sense to me

1135
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,120
That actually can make a sandwich. It's not my favorite sandwich. I don't I don't love that

1136
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,880
But like at least it works spaghetti. I don't know

1137
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,600
I don't like that you're even beginning to rationalize this right? This is how people are radicalized

1138
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,680
It's it's like having it's like having like, I don't know like steamed rice in a bun. It's like why

1139
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
It's yeah, I don't

1140
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,160
It's just eat the rice. It's perverse. It's just eat the rice. Just eat the right. Just eat the spaghetti. Just eat the spaghetti

1141
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,400
Yeah, yeah, you don't you don't need to do any favorite pie on a farm

1142
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,080
You don't need to do anything with spaghetti to like like with leftover. You just eat it

1143
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,960
If I see a single fucking in the comments section defending this holy shit

1144
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,160
It's fucking broke

1145
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,960
Someone's

1146
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,560
um, there was a

1147
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,600
There was a guy there was a guy who worked at my college

1148
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,360
I think we I think people called him the batman because I think he like

1149
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,440
Because I think he wore like batman shirts and stuff. Um

1150
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
he worked at my college a

1151
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,920
food dining hall

1152
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
and he would like

1153
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,520
Basically, he was cool and people liked him and you could ask him for like a special

1154
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,720
Sandwich he had like he had like sort of a special sandwich that he'd make

1155
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,320
um

1156
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,240
Which was essentially just a chip buddy, right?

1157
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,840
But it wasn't it wasn't on the menu

1158
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,280
Like he would he would put fries and like barbecue sauce and like chicken on this thing

1159
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,480
And it was like it was like his sandwich and if you asked him for it, he'd make it for you

1160
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,240
And it was pretty good, but like, you know, I don't know fries on the sandwich

1161
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,000
I mean like it just feels like like makes sense to me

1162
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,320
Although I will put I will put potato chips potato chips on the sandwich are good

1163
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,000
But like that's because like that ends it like a different texture because it's crunchy

1164
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,280
Yeah, like I like I'm like a like a like a tuna melt

1165
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,880
It's a bad idea to do it

1166
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,760
But it's it makes some sense right because you already have like you'll have fries with a burger

1167
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,680
So like who's to say that you can't just combine them, you know, you know, you know

1168
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,280
There's a large there's a large segment of the population

1169
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,880
Uh, I would describe it as a cult. Um, who believes in the in the myth that like

1170
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,840
Dipping your french fries and your milkshake is good

1171
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,520
And I don't subscribe to that view at all. I think that that's

1172
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:52,000
Fully unscientific pseudoscience. Uh, I think that it's dangerous rhetoric that it is it is dangerous. I'll give you that right?

1173
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,040
Yeah, that's for sure. Um, are you are you guys with me on that? I haven't tried it

1174
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,560
I don't think ever because I've heard people say it and I'm always like no no no fuck off

1175
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,920
Wait, I've I've tried it and like it's not terrible

1176
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,120
Like it just tastes exactly like you think it would and like it's it's whatever. Wait, I missed what we're talking about

1177
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
I was too busy looking at red man

1178
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,600
Dipping your french fries in your milkshake. Oh that I feel like a lot of the time

1179
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,880
Yeah, it's just you don't get enough of the milkshake to really get any of the flavor of it. It's just sort of wet. Yeah. Yeah

1180
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and it makes your french fries soggy and the last thing I want is a soggy fry

1181
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,520
That's that's true. I mean sometimes sometimes fries are just soggy because there's so much oil on them and they're still fine, but

1182
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,960
I think that's a problem in and of itself though. Like if somebody passes me some soggy fries

1183
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,200
I'm gonna give them a little look and I won't kill them the first time but if it happens again

1184
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:54,080
Well, some some establishments fries just kind of come out soggy or and to be honest, I don't I don't always mind it

1185
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,720
Fair enough. Like I guess it can be okay

1186
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,040
Like um, um five five guys has some of the best fries out there for like a fast food place

1187
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,480
And those fries are not particularly crispy. I mean, I also wouldn't classify them as soggy though

1188
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,240
I would say they're soft. Like like now. Yeah, they're not they're not soggy. I like I like them a little bit malleable and not like

1189
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
Snappy, you know what I mean

1190
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay, now I'm with you on this. I understand what you're saying. I like it both ways. I like it both ways

1191
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,120
Um, um, but I do like the crispy ones. Um

1192
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
Like I'm extremely salty too. I have like

1193
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
A very high salt tolerance

1194
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,360
Uh, I I I eat I eat the dust at the bottom of a bag of pretzels

1195
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,160
Uh, oh what the

1196
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,120
Are you are you okay? Are you gonna go into shock?

1197
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,320
Are you drinking salt water one time?

1198
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,080
Make sure you drink water if you drink that much salt

1199
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:54,160
I'll tell you one time. I got I got an over my head. This was is in um, I was living in northern california

1200
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,840
And I went with some friends. We we were hanging out in sacramento one time

1201
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,960
And we went to a ramen place. They were like, oh, there's this there's this nice little rustic ramen place

1202
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,360
Let's go there. I was like, okay. I've never been to a ramen place before

1203
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:11,280
So I went there and I'm looking at the menu and I'm looking at what I want in my ramen and I see an option

1204
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,320
On the menu. That's like you can ask for extra salt

1205
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,560
In your ramen and I'm like, oh, oh, and I'm like, oh boy. I love salty stuff like like so, you know

1206
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,800
If if if anyone's gonna want extra salt in their ramen, it's me like that's for me

1207
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,880
So I got it and uh, oh fucking boy

1208
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,360
I

1209
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:38,560
Like like let me remind you I eat the I eat the pot the the the dust at the bottom of the pretzel bag

1210
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,400
I could not eat this ramen. It was so the broth was

1211
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,000
Inedibly salty. I tried I tried to like mask the the salt with like I tried to put tons of like hot sauce and like oils

1212
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,680
And stuff in it and just like drown it out with other stuff and I couldn't do it

1213
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,600
I couldn't finish it. It was like it was the saltiest thing. I've ever I've never had something that was so salty

1214
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,840
I could not eat it before but this was it

1215
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,720
It was disgusting. Maybe maybe because why why do they offer this?

1216
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,280
Maybe they're just more used to it because they have soy sauce and that's quite salty

1217
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:17,600
Maybe that's very normal to have a lot of I feel like this was like saltier than just drinking straight soy sauce

1218
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,600
People have like died from drinking straight soy sauce. So don't really don't try that at home kids. That's the real

1219
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,840
I didn't finish it. I didn't finish it and I think I I don't I think I'd have died if I did it was

1220
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,560
I was like

1221
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,880
Man, I don't know. I don't know man

1222
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,400
There is a level of saltiness where it turns into an assault on your senses like like your body rejects it

1223
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
Yeah, so I like

1224
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,640
That's sad, you know, it was sad

1225
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,360
It was uh, uh, actually actually

1226
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,280
I

1227
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,960
Rather than just eating it straight now when I had when I finish a bag of pretzels

1228
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,720
I save the dust and then I use it as a topping

1229
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,280
I use it as like as like

1230
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,520
Yeah, I use it as salt because it has that pretzel flavor

1231
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,480
So if like I sprinkle it on like a grilled cheese sandwich or something that's and then like it just kind of imparts a little

1232
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,560
Sort of pretzely flavor to it. Yeah

1233
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,760
Whoa

1234
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,800
Yeah, it's pretty good. That's that's pretty hot. Oh, it's kind of like saving. It's kind of like saving your bacon grease

1235
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,080
Right. It's like, you know, why why waste this I can cook with this later

1236
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,360
Dude, did you see that I made pretzel bread pretzels?

1237
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,040
They the other day I posted it on twitter or instagram or somewhere

1238
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,880
I I was I was proud of them because they they looked really jank, you know, I couldn't roll the dough in the right shape

1239
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
But it was a really fun

1240
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,160
different way to cook bread

1241
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,400
because it involved a vat of bubbling

1242
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
a cauldron of like stuff

1243
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,800
and

1244
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,200
The the idea to give it that pretzel taste

1245
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,280
You know, you make a bread you got dough and yeast and it's very normal

1246
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,120
But then you have to before you bake it

1247
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,760
Dunk it egg wash, right? No, you have to dunk it into a bubbling cauldron of of like baking soda

1248
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,680
Like a lot of baking soda and you keep it in there for like 20 seconds

1249
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:13,520
And then you take them out and then you put them in the oven and they taste like pretzels. They're like big pretzel bread things

1250
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,720
It sounds awesome. Oh, it was really good. I saw the image of them that you had you had made and I thought they looked pretty damn good

1251
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,680
They they were the best bread I've ever made. I thought they got their flavor from an egg wash. No, that's that's it's

1252
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,560
Wouldn't you know it's the baking soda and apparently that's how bagels are made as well

1253
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,680
Oh

1254
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,240
You dunk a dunk a ring into a thing

1255
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,080
And then you cook it and it comes out with a nice taste

1256
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,680
Nice, I'll also try that that sounds good. Yeah, look up recipes. It's not that difficult

1257
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
aside from like there was a moment where

1258
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,480
Um, I put the baking soda in and the water was too hot and it was sort of a bubbling too much

1259
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:54,480
And it sort of frothed everywhere and I had to clean that up. It was an explosion

1260
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,840
Um, I make um, but yeah, it was it was good when I

1261
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,040
Whenever I fry whenever I fry chicken

1262
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,440
I make the I have a I have a big like tubs of oil that I reuse

1263
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,320
And I'm always I'm always going overboard

1264
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,080
I'm always going overboard with the oil and cooking it and it like it's always like right about to bubble over

1265
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:21,520
And I have to like stand there and watch it cook and use a little ladle to like continually stir the top of it to pop all the bubbles

1266
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,840
So that because it's like like right at the top

1267
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,560
I'm like no and I'm like blowing on and I'm like, please don't boil over

1268
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,880
Please don't but and I'll just stand there and just like whisk it around like whisk around the top of it and blow

1269
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,960
And it's like no no no because um start a fucking grease fire

1270
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,800
Um, I don't know why I don't just use less oil, but I I don't know I always find myself

1271
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
I always find myself in this predicament

1272
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,200
I always wanted to try like deep frying something, but it's like

1273
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,960
You have to get a lot of oil to have enough dunking space

1274
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:56,080
And I don't feel like putting a big thing of oil there. What am I going to do with that afterwards do it again?

1275
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Where am I going to keep it you?

1276
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,760
You save it you you know you put you you let it cool

1277
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,960
And then you just pour it like you buy like a big like a big like two gallon oil

1278
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:13,760
thing which costs like six bucks and then you um, yeah, you could you cook it in a pot you boil it in a pot

1279
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,560
And then you let it cool and you just put it back and you use it again later

1280
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,600
Maybe you maybe you strain it so it doesn't have like, you know

1281
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,520
A residue from whatever you were cooking in it. Okay, maybe I could make doughnuts. That would be a cool idea

1282
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,320
Well, that would be good. Hell yeah, you know, I'm I am looking at these pretzels

1283
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,000
And I do think an egg wash an egg wash would make them darker

1284
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,040
So if you're looking to get that

1285
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,400
The recipe didn't call for it. I think some of them I didn't keep in the the the mixture for long enough

1286
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,520
It's mostly aesthetic. It's it's mostly aesthetic. Oh for the shine. Yeah, maybe

1287
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,880
Yeah, to get to make them darker and shinier. Yeah, they tasted perfect and I sprinkled the salt all of them

1288
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,440
They look good. They look really good

1289
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,480
Definitely gonna do that again

1290
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:06,000
Very nice. I've been watching um, I've been watching this uh, this uh, uh cooking youtuber

1291
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
his name is uh

1292
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,800
His name is my name is andong. You ever heard you're seeing him? No, I don't think so. Nope

1293
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,240
He he made um, he he's german. He did a pretzel video. He did um

1294
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,160
He he he doesn't he doesn't he does like some more normal stuff and then he does some more out there stuff like he made um

1295
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,920
He made like uh, uh chips out of

1296
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,720
Other foods by which I mean like he ordered like a burger and fries

1297
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,240
sushi and a doner kebab and then he took each of those dishes and like

1298
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:49,760
pulverized them in a food processor and like made them into a paste and dehydrated them to make chips out of them

1299
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,120
like

1300
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,160
Yeah, to make like a chip a crunchy chip that was made of like a doner kebab

1301
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,920
He wasn't that impressed with the burger or the or the kebab, but apparently okay

1302
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,720
He he he takes the sushi one and he and he and he takes a bite of it

1303
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,840
And then he looks directly at the camera and he I can't you won't see my face

1304
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,240
But he goes like oh these like and I was like, oh my god. I'm so excited for you and dung

1305
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,440
I'm so happy for you that you that you did it

1306
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,480
You've made a discovery. Apparently the sushi like the chip tasted like sushi, which is very funny

1307
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,400
um

1308
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,360
Yeah, yep. Yep. Yep. He made um, he did one that's like

1309
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,360
read like

1310
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:35,040
Making a Naruto ramen like ramen that looks exactly like the the ramen that Naruto orders in the show

1311
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,320
Uh, yeah, you know, there's stuff like that big north

1312
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,960
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The idea of making like crisps or chips out of of like anything

1313
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:51,840
Reminds me of that one channel that makes knives out of everything and anything. Yeah, I love watching this occasionally

1314
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:57,920
They're just part of my recommended. I haven't but this sounds extremely interesting. All right. So there's this guy

1315
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,280
um

1316
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:06,560
I think he lives in the old the the east and he doesn't speak but he he does these videos where he's like

1317
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,800
Gets, uh, you know a concept for making a a knife that can be super sharp the sharpest

1318
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,680
X knife in the world. So it would be like the sharpest

1319
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,960
Gelatin knife in the world the sharpest chocolate knife in the world

1320
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:26,880
He'll make whatever it is and there's you know, there's no commentary. There's no annoying like hey guys, welcome to another video

1321
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,280
It's just like yeah, silence silent like

1322
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,520
Like process of like all of these things he's doing. I'm like, what where's this going? Where is this leading?

1323
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:42,640
This is such an adventure to see how you make a knife out of like the bottom of an aquarium like how do you do that?

1324
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,200
I've seen him make the one that someone linked me was a sugar

1325
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,920
He he makes one out of like candy. Yeah, and and he and he doesn't just make the knife

1326
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,960
He makes it and it and he makes it come out so sharp that at the end he like slices paper with it

1327
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,480
Oh, he does like show tests of what he's doing with them after the fact

1328
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,800
Well, he'll he'll often unmake he'll often unmake them afterwards

1329
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,440
Like he'll he'll make it and then he'll like melt it down again

1330
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,440
Because like i'm sure i'm sure that a knife made of sugar doesn't like keep you know

1331
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,720
Yeah, I wouldn't keep

1332
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,560
Wait, though the weirdest one I saw was he made one out of fire

1333
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,560
Oh, by which I by which I mean that he he made it

1334
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,160
Well, he made one out of soot

1335
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,480
From a fire like he burned shit and then he held a pan over the fire

1336
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,360
And the pan like collected soot in it and then he collected the soot and like

1337
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:39,680
Yeah, like boiled it down and like reduced it and like crystallized it into a knife and like cut shit with it

1338
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,000
That's so unique. I I wish

1339
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,840
that

1340
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,320
Like that's one of those ideas you hear and it's like it is brilliant that this this person came up with this

1341
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,640
Um, and you can't help but hope that one day you'll come up with an idea that is so esoteric and brilliant

1342
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,800
It's I mean, what yeah once you have the but by the idea

1343
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:05,040
Do you mean just like making a knife out of anything like just the idea of making a knife out of anything and then pushing it that far

1344
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,120
Yeah, like once I mean once you have the idea and you start like

1345
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,840
Hmm, what can I make a knife out of once you have the idea like the basics are just like

1346
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:22,320
How can I how can I like collect any given material and mold it right? Yeah, and I'm sure some materials work better than others

1347
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,720
It's like as long as you can turn something into a paste or a liquid

1348
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,840
Like like any any sort of solid that you could turn into a liquid you can and then you can solidify it

1349
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,960
You can morph it into a thing. Yeah, it's like

1350
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,840
it's it's like the the

1351
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,480
It has like elements of like weapon building tutorials or like those not tutorials those those videos where like

1352
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,640
Um, they they restore like super rusted old things

1353
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,760
But also cooking like cooking experiments as well because a lot of them are food

1354
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,640
It's just sort of all of the things he he makes it uses all the tools

1355
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,680
It's just very well, that's what makes it like to me

1356
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,520
That's what makes it so brilliant is you're combining so many different ideas into one thing

1357
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,280
That's so weird that I never would have thought to ask the question of it

1358
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:15,200
But as soon as you say hey, this guy makes knives out of anything. I'm like, what now I want to watch this

1359
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,720
This sounds fun

1360
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,720
Oh, oh my god

1361
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,760
Oh my god, there it is one of the one of the wait. Is this the right?

1362
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,200
Is this the yeah, there it is one of my never had it sandwiches the hamon puree. I was just looking

1363
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,120
My name is andong has a video where he makes a hamon puree

1364
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,280
Perfect. I'm probably I'm probably pronouncing that wrong because it's french and I don't know how to how to

1365
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,880
How to pronounce french words, but damn damn the guy's got a fucking answer for everything

1366
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,760
The hamon brulee. There you go. Hamon

1367
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,840
hamon

1368
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,680
French is

1369
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,040
Whenever I don't even like I don't even want to try to pronounce like any french word because it seems like every time

1370
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,720
I see a french word. It's like, oh, okay

1371
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,160
I have some idea of how it's pronounced and then when I hear it pronounced

1372
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,840
It's like, oh, you just like ignored half the letters or just like added some extra ones in like I don't I don't fucking

1373
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:09,520
Understand this at all the thing with french that annoys me is is that you know sometimes

1374
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,040
The s is not spoken, but some other times it is and there's no I feel like way to tell

1375
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,400
I feel like

1376
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,960
I feel that way, but like I don't think it's just s's I

1377
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,440
There's lots of things but the s is always like at the end of words you you always assume

1378
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,040
Oh, if it ends in any s it's like air and rather than s

1379
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:32,000
But sometimes that's just not the case and I just I look like it looks stupid sometimes

1380
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,560
Very stupid very stupid. Yes

1381
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,960
Uh

1382
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,840
Yeah, pronouncing french

1383
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,440
I am horribly useless at it despite the fact that here in canada. I was forced to do it for

1384
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,560
Uh, like all of elementary school and I'm just useless. That's right. You're canadian

1385
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:58,560
Yeah, I learned nothing. I learned nothing from french. All I know all I knew was how to ask to go take a shit

1386
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,720
I learned um

1387
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:06,480
I I studied spanish like all through high school like middle like middle school and high school and college

1388
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,120
Like yeah, I could speak it kind of okay

1389
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,000
And then like after college. I never used it and I've like I've completely forgotten like

1390
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,000
I mean I can kind of still read it and like have love like I

1391
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:24,720
I generally know like what's going on often, but like I can read it and I can kind of understand it

1392
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,800
But like if I had to speak it I'd be like

1393
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,640
You know, I because I would like forget the words like until I heard them. You know what I mean

1394
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,840
languages are so hard

1395
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,520
It's such a

1396
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:45,680
Like you need to know you can't just learn it because uh, you need to use it all the time or it just

1397
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,720
There's some serious attrition. It goes away

1398
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,120
Yeah, um, all you need to do is just say uh, I can I could speak a little and they'll be like, oh, okay

1399
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,480
I could speak a little bit of polish when I lived in poland, but now I remember like

1400
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,120
Half a dozen words and like yeah an expression and that's it. Yeah

1401
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,680
I I just learned like I just learned a bunch of like kind of functional phrases and words to like get around like

1402
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,960
Yeah, you ask people directions like say hi to people, you know, whatever. Yeah, I only know um

1403
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:26,480
Uh, I know one polish word or phrase which is dobranos for I think dobranos dobranos

1404
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,680
What is that? I think it's I'm pretty sure it's just like

1405
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,480
Good night, and it's the only thing I know so whenever I see my wife's polish family

1406
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:40,880
I just wave and say dobranos no matter what the situation is and and it's like morning and they all shake their head like

1407
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,560
Oh, it's that fucking

1408
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,720
That's fucking uh, this stupid outsider that westerner. Yeah, they they all turn to each other

1409
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,840
They do the they do the Picard hand in head gift

1410
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:58,240
Oh, yeah, oh this actually leads to a this leads to a fun story that you might enjoy

1411
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,680
Um

1412
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:04,000
So back when I was in high school. Well, I'm still an idiot, but I was particularly an idiot in high school

1413
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:11,440
Uh, and that was where I I met my wife and I was away somewhere on a little trip

1414
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,680
Wait in in high school. You said yeah in high school. Okay. Okay. Uh, so then I was

1415
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:22,640
Wait, wait, how wait, how old are you okay? Because schooling is different like how old are you in high school in canada?

1416
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,480
Um, like you you go there until you're like 17 or 18

1417
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:33,920
Okay, all right. So same as america. Yeah, same same thing. Um, so I was away and I had gone to this sort of like

1418
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,200
world war two

1419
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,280
shop

1420
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,480
Like it was kind of weird because at first it looks like a museum thing

1421
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:48,080
But there is a weird amount of just paraphernalia where I'm like, I don't know who's buying this stuff

1422
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,000
um, so then I told my wife for a joke. I was like, oh, I bought you a poster of uh

1423
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,960
Of of the big Adolf

1424
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:04,000
And it's so I'm gonna bring that back to you and I just said it as a joke right so then I got home

1425
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,400
And I was like, okay. Well now I need to follow through so I printed off this really shitty picture

1426
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,520
The big Adolf. That's what they called him. That's what they called him back in his old college boxing day

1427
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:20,400
So I I had a picture of him and underneath I put the words. I don't know how anyone could not see you

1428
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:27,280
And I brought this I brought this to her house and I I like just started dating her

1429
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,920
I don't know what possessed me to do this. It was really dumb because her family's polish

1430
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,680
So I I take this in and I haven't folded up. I'm like, don't show this

1431
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,520
Uh, like to anyone right? This is a stupid edgy joke

1432
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,200
and

1433
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,560
She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, and as soon as she walks inside her mom's like, oh, what's that you have there?

1434
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:52,560
And she takes it looks at hit and then stares at me and says we don't like that man here

1435
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,120
And I'm like, no, no, no, no, I should I should think not

1436
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,840
This is a stupid joke. Like it's nothing more than a stupid joke

1437
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:10,640
So then I'm sweating and I go home and I'm talking talking to her and then you're and then you're you're you're

1438
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,640
You're then then girlfriend. I imagine it's like, oh, yeah, sorry about my sorry about my hitler loving boy

1439
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,960
Well, no, she was like and the parents like, oh that boy the hitler boy

1440
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,400
And she was telling me she's like, no, no, no, it's fine

1441
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,360
She knows it's just like a joke and I'm like, are you sure?

1442
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,840
Like because I don't blame her if she's upset with me. This is like the first time I've met her

1443
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:39,440
Um, yeah, yeah, but you know those nazis there was carrying a bunch of women pictures of Adolf looking at him

1444
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,640
Oh, yeah, it's so uh, it's important to them as I'm talking to her a bunch of people

1445
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,640
laughing in the background because I was talking to her online and uh

1446
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,760
I'm like, oh, what's that?

1447
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,440
So then she goes and apparently her mom was showing all her friends this picture because her mom thought it was hilarious

1448
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,440
That I'd bring that into the house

1449
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,720
But she didn't want to like let me know she thought it was funny because I guess she didn't want to encourage this high school bullshit

1450
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,240
um

1451
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:11,840
So that was just a very good way to meet someone. So kids don't very good. Don't do that

1452
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,240
Don't make the mistakes I've made

1453
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,720
So it was like it worked just

1454
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,880
When you meet your your your significant mother's parents, I would say try to avoid

1455
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,800
Hitler

1456
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,360
You know try to avoid jokes like that on the first time

1457
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,840
It did kind of work though because I think she thought it was funny and was like this this kid

1458
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,280
You know this guy

1459
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,640
Yeah, polish polish fascists are are pretty awesome actually

1460
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,080
Oh, gosh, they have they have cool iconography

1461
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,200
Because I mean poland just has like cool iconography. They have like the royal eagle and stuff

1462
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,920
Yeah, and I've I've seen like some old like polish like fascist literature that it's like

1463
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,160
I've seen like they have they have those symbolized things with like the axe

1464
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:02,160
They have like big axes with with like eagle wings on them and stuff. It's like that's that's pretty cool. That's pretty like um

1465
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:09,440
Uh, that's that's kind of warhammer 40k. I'm sold like I I could get into this actually now that you say that

1466
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,920
Yeah, a shitload of the fascist

1467
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,520
I don't know images and stuff looks like something on a warhammer

1468
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:20,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they do for sure. Which is probably purposeful probably warhammer wanted them to like

1469
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,760
I don't know maybe look like that or maybe it's just that

1470
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,640
You know, you know the thing about fascists you gotta hand it to them

1471
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,000
You you just you just gotta hand it to them. Well, they really like painting litter. That's all I'm figurines

1472
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,400
What have you gave you see you seen that you seen that drill tweet?

1473
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,560
uh

1474
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,720

Famous famous drill tweet is like is like uh apologies for my last tweet regarding uh isis

1476
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,440
You do not under any circumstances gotta hand it to them

1477
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:00,560
Oh, I do remember that I think I have that in one of my favorite in that fucking drill tweet book that I bought

1478
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,560
Oh, okay. Well, I hope I would hope it made the cut. It's a classic. I enjoy that book quite a lot. It's very silly

1479
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,160
Just to open it to read tweets printed on paper

1480
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,560
I'm looking I'm looking at

1481
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,160
Okay, there's a there's a there's a like a fascist polish group called the o n r

1482
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,040
And I don't know what that stands for but but their logo their logo is like it's the stylized um

1483
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,600
Arm holding a sword. It's kind of neat. It's kind of a neat logo

1484
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,760
That looks like an esports team. That looks like a fucking minecraft team

1485
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,360
It is no that oh my god, you're right. It looks like minecraft

1486
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,640
And when they when they go to battle with their minecraft team, they would say get ready to take this l

1487
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,880
I

1488
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,720
Hope you'll show it on the screen. Oh, no, what are they talking now?

1489
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,760
I'm thinking of a rally with people with diamond armor on

1490
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,520
I I guess the it stands for

1491
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,600
oboats

1492
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,600
Not a dovo

1493
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,760
Eradi Eradi colony

1494
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:19,120
National radical camp is is what it means in English. Okay, the national stands for oh, no, we're radical

1495
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,600
Dude, I want to go to a radical camp

1496
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:28,640
Is that when I'm a kid when I'm a teen? Yeah, it's like it sounds radical. That's that's really that's yeah. Why not?

1497
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,080
Why not? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm doing like sick kickflips and stuff like

1498
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,720
base based as fuck

1499
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,240
If only they were actually like that well that fucking was a journey

1500
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,760
Hmm said if only they were actually like that

1501
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,520
Yeah, then I'd agree with all of that points

1502
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,080
I can't I can't believe

1503
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:57,840
I can't believe I didn't see before that. It's just minecraft. It's a diamond sword

1504
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,720
I love that

1505
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,640
Uh

1506
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:11,280
Lord when we do these shows we usually go we chat for a while and then we go to voicemails. Um

1507
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,720
Do you want to hang around and listen to voicemails or uh?

1508
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:21,120
Yeah, I'd be down to listen to voicemails if you'll if you'll have me for your voicemail times. Sure. Um,

1509
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
We don't have to do that right now, but um

1510
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,960
I don't I don't know give what do you what do you think?

1511
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,520
um, I mean

1512
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,760
I don't mind, but I am wondering about like whether I will have the enough space for all of this red man

1513
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,360
footage

1514
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,480

01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,120
uh

1516
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:51,360
So that's no ongoing voicemails. Um, I mean does anyone have anything to talk about for now for for for topic ways

1517
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,200

1543

1544
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,400
There's endless war. There's a

1545
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:52,080
Canny an investor praise slimer made pizza chan mega slime slime hearts. Yeah, these are very nice

1546
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:57,600
Imagine imagine wearing that that new los angeles city flag patch like on your fucking shoulder

1547
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,960
Imagine like walking around looking like that. I I kind of wish I had one

1548
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,280
I bought one

1549
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,000
Because I do I do have a winter coat that I could put it on

1550
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,400
I might just I mean you're just just because you're gay. Well, maybe I'll toss you one

1551
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,240
Yeah, I'll fucking I'll fucking toss you you might get one

1552
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,360
You may if you're a good boy in your Christmas stocking. Oh, I can't wait

1553
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,640
Yeah, um

1554
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,560
Well, Santa's gone mad. Well, let us go mad with power fucking

1555
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,880
I just I just want to okay. Can we talk about how Santa's just evil?

1556
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,920
Go on like, okay. This is the thing that's really bothered me forever. Um

1557
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,360
So this whole idea of being naughty or nice, right?

1558
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,080
Yeah, you tell kids this and then it's like well Santa's a cop Santa's a fucking cop

1559
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,240
Well, Santa is all about that thin blue line

1560
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:57,920
You could argue that Santa is the thin blue line between naughty and between society being naughty and society being

1561
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,160
I mean, you're just building the argument even more because I didn't even consider that

1562
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:08,320
Like Santa so you tell these kids, right? Like if you're good, Santa will bring you presents

1563
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,280
If you're bad, you don't get presents

1564
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:20,080
In my mind eventually down the long run this equates morality with the amount of money you have so that your parents can buy you things

1565
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:26,960
Oh, I see what you're saying and that like as a kid if you genuinely believe this right like imagine little timmy's been so nice

1566
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,320
He's just a great kid

1567
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,720
But his parents don't make that much money and he's like I got like one little thing

1568
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,760
And then this other dipshit in the class is like my parents bought me a million things

1569
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,040
Bought me a fucking car or whatever and it's like damn that rich kid, but it's supposed to have been so much nicer than me

1570
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,360
Yeah, I don't like it. I don't I've never you know, santa. I think we need to kill him

1571
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
I mean, I wonder I wonder

1572
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,560
Do you kids kids more likely to believe in santa like think that that's it?

1573
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,120
santa rewards the status quo

1574
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,520
Mmm. Yeah, like I'm not I'm not necessarily making the argument that kids are operating on this level

1575
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,840
I'm just saying that in retrospect looking back at it. I'm like, you know what santa's kind of fucked up. Yeah, definitely

1576
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,960
I mean, I

1577
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,040
I legitimately wonder like

1578
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:21,760
Maybe kids do have that thought like I just wasn't nice enough that I didn't get the fucking I didn't get the playstation 5

1579
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,560
Unlike, you know, josh

1580
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,440
josh who fucking uh gave me a swirl at the other day

1581
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:34,240
Uh, he he got it though like damn. What am I doing wrong? Yeah, and I feel like it would be much nicer like I don't know

1582
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:40,960
Just to know, you know, if you know your parents are scraping by if they're open with you about like we don't have that much stuff

1583
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,200
I feel like you would be more grateful if they're like we bought this for you because we care about you

1584
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,520
It's as much as we can give you not like that big fat fuck gave it to you

1585
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,440
I think there are parents. I think I've heard of people who are like

1586
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:59,200
Yeah, we don't tell our kids that santa got them stuff because it's kind of fucked up and like, you know

1587
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,840
We want them to know that like, you know, we got them these things because like, you know, we love them

1588
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:08,160
Yeah, and I learned like real quick that santa was a total fraud because uh,

1589
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,280
My my parents would always like leave out

1590
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,120
Like this was when I was like four or five. They leave out cookies being like

1591
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,880
Santa's gonna come and eat the cookies and then they leave out a giant carrot for the reindeer and my dad would eat the cookies

1592
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
And the the carrot would never get eaten

1593
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,240
And they were always just like, well the reindeer wasn't very hungry and I looked at my parents and I was like

1594
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,680
Fuck off with your bullshit. Oh, okay. Okay

1595
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:37,920
Why would they do that? Because I was just fun. They don't care, right? They didn't actually want to support even this guy

1596
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,560
Okay, okay, okay, but like if the if the scheme is like we're gonna put this thing out

1597
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,760
So so he'll you know, so it looks like santa like ate the cookie and gave the reindeer the carrot

1598
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,600
Why would you leave the carrot? Why even bother with the carrot if like you're just not gonna eat it and you're just gonna leave it there

1599
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:59,280
Like why even bother? It's a mystery. But uh, yeah, I guess they just didn't care. They probably figured it was kind of funny

1600
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,520
That's nonsense. It's like, oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm

1601
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,040
It's like if you know, you're not gonna eat the carrot

1602
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
I don't I don't get it

1603
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,520
Santa's weird. There was also like factions when I was in

1604
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:18,000
The younger grades like grade one between, you know, as kids start to realize that this is just not real

1605
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,680
Um

1606
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,480
Then like certain kids we get very passionate about like guys

1607
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:29,120
You're being duped by the system santa's fake and the other kids would be like, how dare you speak against my worldview?

1608
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:33,520
Um, and like they would get into legitimate fights over this. It was very funny

1609
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,160
Preparing them for the future

1610
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,280
Yeah

1611
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,240
They got to learn they got to learn to hate their fellow man

1612
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:48,880
Eventually you have to learn sooner rather than later. There are dividing lines and one of those dividing lines is labeled ho ho ho

1613
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,160
Begs begs the question of what is to be done?

1614
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:00,720
We got to collect all these santo lovers all these radicals and all of these, uh, I don't know

1615
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,280
weird like pizza sandwich

1616
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,640
Fuckers

1617
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:11,280
And these yeah, these radical these radical, uh, these radical anarchists who say that a choco taco is technically a sandwich

1618
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:16,080
Which is just a lie. That's a lot just just criminal and punishable

1619
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,120
Um by a week in the in the stocks

Uh, let's give that a listen in three two one go

1627
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:58,720
So, uh, I just started listening to the podcast recently, uh, most recent episode because we're talking about foreskin a lot

1628
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,040
No

1629
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,080
Hey guys, welcome to the pro circumcision podcast

1630
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:16,080
Welcome to the pro circumcision podcast. We advise any foreskin that's allowed to survive is fucking punishable

1631
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:20,720
Immoral and shouldn't be done. I am not going to listen to anybody. I love circumcision

1632
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:25,360
I hate I hate short nerve endings. I hate sexual pleasure

1633
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:33,600
If any if any others are about circumcision, I'm just not gonna listen. I'm gonna talk. Yeah, what what is going on with circumcision?

1634
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,800
Nothing nothing. What nothing is happening. No, no, no, no, no

1635
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:45,840
Just watch the last 10 weeks the last 30. Oh, yeah, what's the last several months of I I have like watched

1636
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,120
a bunch of them

1637
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:51,440
And then I always see like I haven't finished them or I'm watching them on a video

1638
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,800
And then um people will be in the comments like circumcision talk and I'm like, okay

1639
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:01,920
I guess just you know, they're just they're just they're just they're just this josephi

1640
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,760
You're a you're a fucking goof. You're a fucking funny man and a goofball and you're a real comedian clown, mr

1641
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,440
I like them. I like I like them, you know, I like his I like his name

1642
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,640
Yeah, I like out of his job. Yeah, I like circumcision too. If we get one more here's here's the thing

1643
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,440
If we get one more where I'm gonna open the the new like pcp

1644
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,560
um forced circumcision clinic

1645
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,560
They will be circumcised live on air

1646
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,040
Wow, and if they're already circumcised, I'll just put some forescales

1647
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:39,600
We will implement a like mandatory circumcision policy in the uh in the in the

1648
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,960
But in the in the pcp in the pcp prison

1649
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:48,720
So like that guy that I sent to prison last week for asking asking about circumcision too much

1650
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:54,480
We will circumcise you we have the ability our only circumcised people allowed on the podcast

1651
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,360
Um, they will be okay because I was just about to say like I've got a knife ready. I'm prepared

1652
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,160
if uh

1653
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:10,080
Stand by we we'll we'll we'll be using that very soon. Okay, because I could be the first one in the circumcision clinic

1654
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,520
I'm ready for

1655
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,920
You know, do you want to do all the forced circumcisions on our political prisoners?

1656
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:22,160
I think I should be the recipient of a forced circumcision. Uh, you're too into this. You you were waiting for us to say this

1657
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:28,000
No, he's too. Well, he's too willing. It doesn't that's just doesn't have the same. I mean don't no don't circumcise me

1658
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,080
No

1659
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:35,840
Doesn't feel the same. Well, okay. I mean I guess we could if you insist

1660
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:43,520
Next next voicemail is called defund the police, but I am confused. Am I dumb?

1661
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,320
Okay, three two one go

1662
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:51,920
Okay, so if there's a hostage situation the police are supposed to come and like help resolve that

1663
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,840
Or if like I my house gets broken in two I call them and they help resolve that issue

1664
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,920
And there are a bunch of other essential functions that we give them the power to

1665
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,720
Fulfill but then they abuse that power and are racist and bad

1666
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:09,040
The current consensus is like, oh, we should just defund the police because they're

1667
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,200
Causing the problems here

1668
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,920
And like it sounds like it would be great

1669
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:20,640
But my question is about those essential functions like either a we just leave them unfulfilled once we defund the police

1670
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,800
I've heard this question so many times

1671
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,800
And then what's to stop them from being just as racist and bad as the police are

1672
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:30,560
It seems like it's just kicking the can down the route. What's to stop who from being as racist?

1673
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,800
Am I stupid? Is this just an obvious answer to this question that I'm dumb and missing?

1674
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,520
Please elucidate

1675
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Okay, man

1676
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:45,200
I don't know why I have to answer this question. I feel like you could google this but uh like

1677
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,880
The point is the point is to reduce the scope of the police by by defund them

1678
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,320
You reduce their scope the point is that they fulfill too many functions like yeah

1679
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,560
We should still have some form of law enforcement and like civil protection in the case of like, you know

1680
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,960
Someone is like actively committing like violence somewhere. Yeah, like

1681
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,920
It's it's not that like it would be reduced to zero

1682
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
It would just be like, you know defund it

1683
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,160
Restricted scope

1684
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:18,720
Greatly the problem the problem is we have over we have over policing in america and probably in other countries as well

1685
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,360
The way to think about it is if you expanded their scope to say include the military

1686
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,800
The police would have access to a lot more dangerous weaponry

1687
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,480
um

1688
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,440
That they could just use or like, you know, just give

1689
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:39,600
That they would have too much extra stuff and it would cause even more problems to defund them is to limit the powers that they have

1690
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,800
To to you know that the corruption

1691
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:49,520
Would yeah, if there is corruption would you know cause problems the end the end goal

1692
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:56,240
The end goal is not that like literally nobody is there to respond when like someone

1693
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,680
When the occasional shooting spree happens, you know, yeah, because there's always that that's sort of like

1694
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:06,480
safety net for police officers that do terrible things they get off lightly

1695
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,600
Because everyone this they've got too much

1696
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,840
Sway over the justice system that they can get their buddies off

1697
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,360
Scott free and it's like they shouldn't be able to have that

1698
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:23,440
Like I don't know too much about this shit, but I feel like there's problems with self-regulating systems

1699
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,400
like if the system of law itself is supposed to look after itself

1700
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,000
And check and balance itself that kind of poses like

1701
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:36,560
I don't know a problem of who's actually going to keep things in check

1702
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,080
Yeah, yeah, the police the like the police like

1703
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,720
Is is

1704
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:48,400
To a large degree they are they regulate themselves and like, you know, I think there's been a lot of people calling for like

1705
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,600
civilian review boards need to be you know

1706
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:55,520
They like the police need to be more accountable to groups outside of them

1707
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,080
And I know I know that they are to a certain extent accountable to those outside themselves

1708
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:05,120
But like, you know the argument is well, it's it's it's not enough, you know

1709
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,040
Uh

1710
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:11,200
Overpolicing is the problem like your argument isn't to let anarchy run wild in the streets

1711
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,880
Well, the good kind of anarchy. Maybe okay. There we go

1712
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,080
Um, the next next one is called a punished sweeper

1713
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:26,480
I like the title of it. I don't I don't know what to make of it. Uh, three two one go

1714
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:34,080
Okay, like fucking so many weeks ago. I said in this voicemail about minesweeper.online

1715
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:42,240
Uh, how fucking cool it is. Yeah, the only problem is that now I fucking spend hours every day

1716
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:47,040
I'm literally every day fucking logging in. This is why we didn't do it shitty fucking

1717
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,480
Actually, not shitty awesome. Why we didn't listen

1718
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:56,480
And I'm like I'm wasting away. I'm sitting here. I'm playing it right now as I'm recording this

1719
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,040
Oh one oh two

1720
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:02,160
Oh, oh shit. I miss clicked god

01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:07,600
It's like it's like that episode of starcraft with the game. This is this is all I am now

1722
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,680

What the hell?

1727
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:35,120
He's trying to pass. I think he's trying to pass the curse on like he's been cursed that he can only play minesweeper

1728
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,240
And like to break it. He needs to like have someone replace him

1729
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:46,560
That's my hypothesis. Yeah, maybe maybe this guy's got some stocks and minesweaver online dot org or whatever it was

1730
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:52,160
You know, okay something something sinister is definitely going on. There's something a fuck

1731
01:39:52,800 --> 01:40:00,160
There's no way that anyone would just make pzp voicemails to call in to tell us to go to minesweeper.com or whatever

1732
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,320
Such a huge audience we have here

Bless you, sir. Bless you

1782
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,320
Next voicemail is called, uh

It's uh, wait, there it is. It's called a killer dog. I assume it's from killer dog. Um

1784
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,680
Three two one go

1785
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:51,440
So I started listening to the podcast again after a while because oh, hey look guests

1786
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,360
Uh, and you know what last couple episodes, uh, haven't been pretty cool

1789
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:11,200
Who we the voicemails were uh, were way worse than I remember and that's saying something

1790
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,080
it's the the last voicemail I remember before before this was uh,

1791
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,880
I think the jewish question guy

1792
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,120
Oh, yeah

1793
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,120
Yeah, some of you guys need like

1794
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,760
A discord server or a youtube channel or friends or something

1795
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:34,800
Um, you complain about voicemails and yet you make one curious checkmate. I'm very intelligent

1796
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,520
I don't care about, um

1797
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:42,720
I heard about a guy who's like talking about persona five or something. I didn't hear that. I just heard that

1798
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,240
Yeah, that was a nightmare

1799
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:50,800
That was almost as bad as circumcision go outside or like go join like a discord server go join rfck or something like

1800
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:57,600
Yeah, join join a cult do do anything maybe go buy a maybe go buy a pin. Hmm. Hmm. Think about it

1801
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,160
somebody called in just to tell you about persona five

1802
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:07,040
There was a guy who like every week for a while he would make like one or two voicemails just like being like

1803
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:13,040
Okay, no guys like I really want to explain how much I like persona five and then you'd call back week next week

1804
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:17,040
Yeah, we just wouldn't and he'd be like all right. I didn't I didn't really explain it clearly

1805
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,040
But what I really like about persona five is

1806
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:27,920
Just make a youtube video god damn it. That's right like a hundred thousand percent more use of your time better use

1807
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,400
That's true. That's probably somebody who's talked to all their friends about and all their friends are like

1808
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Maybe I won't and then they they're desperate and they're like I need I need to know

1809
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:42,800
I've had an impact as far as persona five playing is concerned in this world and sir

1810
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:49,760
Sir, if you are listening or watching this, I have played persona five and let me tell you I will carry the mantle

1811
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,200
I will call in every week to try to explain

1812
01:45:53,520 --> 01:46:00,560
You know no that under that underrated classic persona five like no one appreciates it. Nobody's played it. It's it's ridiculous

1813
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,800
And I and I gotta I gotta do something about it

1814
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,320
Uh, uh next next one is called let's go

1815
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,840
Three two one go

1816
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:18,320
Hello, and welcome to Bay Saints by Iluzon. You begin with the saga of st. Benedict the need who could

1817
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:25,360
Benedict or benfort horn was a fifth century rich family italian man who got sent to be educated in rome

1818
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,960
St. Saint ben is christ was rome disgusting

1819
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,360
Everybody just fucking sucking

1820
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,400
Drinking and eating all the time. That just wasn't our boy ben's vibe at all

1821
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,840
But it is that rather than have a good time hating himself

1822
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:46,320
He decided he'd rather stay a god pilled dumb dumb minimalist in a small village in the middle of nowhere

1823
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:53,920
Well, dad was pretty good living until he got accidentally got famous in the dumbest way possible

1824
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:59,120
Crash when the ceramic sea benedict repaired it, but everybody was like

1825
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,520
You

1826
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,560
Everybody knows you don't just repair ceramics

1827
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,520
He must have prayed it together

1828
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,680
Well, and so they started simp and you young ben 24 fracking seven

1829
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,800
We're like

1830
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,440
He got good at it

1831
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,200
He saw only a single path leading to everyone finally leaving him alone

1832
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,320
Become a cave living need deep in the heart of the mountains

1833
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,960
Um

1834
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:38,240
Did did did I miss something? No, no, I think it's on just wanted to

1835
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:46,720
Deliver us this this the life story of st. Benedict with some with some dramatic flair and and he did it

1836
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,600
Yeah, he did it. Wow. Um

1837
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,280
Yeah

1838
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,680
Well, now now you know everyone. I hope I hope that was uh educational for you

1839
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,680
I hope yeah

1840
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:03,280
Okay, next one next actually next one is called. Hmm end me

1841
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,160
Hmm

1842
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,640
Sounds familiar

1843
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:12,240
Sounds sounds like what I say to myself in secret

1844
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,960
Uh three two one go

1845
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:21,120
Ha ha pee pee poo poo stinky

1846
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,800
Voice grail voice grail I'm thinking no fuck no no

1847
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:41,520
Stupid stupid. Okay next time next one is a urban dictionary

1848
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,560
Uh, there it is. Wait one sec. There it is. Okay three two one go

1849
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:55,200
No one truly misses the topics. We all just really miss urban dictionary. Please bring urban dictionary back

1850
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:02,480
Uh, it was the best part of the pcp. You know what that's fair. You might be like well, but but but episode the

1851
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:08,400
The best part of the pcp is this part and you're wrong. It was always the urban dictionary

1852
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,320
You've been lied to episode 23 is just okay

1853
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,320
um

1854
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:19,920
The monsters and dreams and voicemails and all this other bullshit. It's all an illusion

1855
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,400
You have to go back to the days of urban dictionary. I I agree. You know, I agree

1856
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:28,960
Uh, uh the the idea of like we must have a topic. I never made much sense to me

1857
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,120
But we have lost something valuable

1858
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:36,080
In the in the losing urban dictionary. So let me let me let me fix this

1859
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,800
Urban dictionary defines circumcision as oh god

1860
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,600
To remove a male's foreskin

1861
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,520
So that's pretty straightforward. I hope I hope I hope I hope everyone is amused

1862
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,000
Wait, are there surely there's some other definitions? There's usually like secondary ones, right?

1863
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,680
Are there any funny ones? No, no, wait

1864
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,560
um next one

1865
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,080
What happens when ignorant parents are jealous of their beautiful child?

1866
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:09,440
Uh followed by a barbaric and cruel act of cutting someone's foreskin off his cock

1867
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:15,360
It's what needs to be illegal except for really really bad medical conditions parents should not have the right to circumcise their son

1868
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:19,920
We circumcision ourselves. We've punked ourselves by listening to yet another opinion

1869
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,480
Wait and then and then this this this one has a dramatic reenactment

1870
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:31,360
American christian father when our son is born. We're gonna circumcise to him

1871
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,600
American christian mother. I agree. He needs a circumcision

1872
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,920
American christian father it would be painful at least he won't remember any of it when their son is born

1873
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:46,000
He got circumcised doctor cut stick baby

1874
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,840
The baby cried for two weeks

1875
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,520
There okay, can I ask how did circumcision come up the first time?

1876
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,640
Just it was just someone asked in a voicemail

1877
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,400
about

1878
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:07,440
What we thought about it little did they know what people didn't like my answer what they had done

1879
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,920
Yeah, it's

1880
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,400
They know they they they know what they fucking did

1881
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,080
um

1882
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,080
next one is

1883
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:18,240
wha-ba-ba-ba

1884
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,360
next

1885
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,400
This one's on thin ice next one is called is digi fuda

1886
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,240
Oh three three two one go

1887
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:33,840
Assuming digi still has her pymosis cock would she be considered fuda at this point

1888
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,720
Just need to do some research so I can get all my galboro tags in order. I

1889
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:40,640
uh

1890
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,600
I

1891
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,600
I feel like this is gonna

1892
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,840
I feel like maybe we should ask digi's opinion about this. I don't know if I feel comfortable saying yes or no

1893
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:56,560
Yeah, I don't this people have different definitions for it. I usually only think of it as like a fake porn thing

1894
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,280
And not a real thing

1895
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,800
But maybe people do identify as that. I don't know

1896
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,600
I'm probably some yeah

1897
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,800
I'm gonna say that probably is like uh, I'm gonna say what do you what do you think? What do you think?

1898
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,360
Hmm pass it back to the leader leave your leave your past back to the viewer leave your comments down below

1899
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:25,520
Next one is called um it is called

1900
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,720
Weird baby dick

1901
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,680
Nice three three two one go

1902
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:34,560
Okay, so

1903
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,200
Ben you asked about my ex's kids weird dick

1904
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
so he fucking

1905
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,640
He was partially circumcised

1906
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,640
I did basically the doctor did was cut off like

1907
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,680
The top 80 percent of it. So he has foreskin on the bottom basically

1908
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,240
And it's just fucking weird looking

1909
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,320
What?

1910
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,280
Also for digi

1911
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,760
It's easier for me at least

1912
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:01,440
to

1913
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,000
suck a dick when I don't have to like

1914
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,040
Navigate the foreskin with my tongue

1915
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,680
Even though that's kind of neat

1916
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,160
But docking is pretty cool docking is fucking epic. Um, okay

1917
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:18,960
Okay, so I first I thought he meant that he cut off like the 80 percent of the dick

1918
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:22,160
But I don't think that I think what he's saying is that the doctor

1919
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,800
Didn't cut off the entire foreskin

1920
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:29,920
But only like the top 80 percent of it. Oh, I thought he meant like 80 percent down the shaft

1921
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,680
That's what I thought too, but I don't

1922
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,480
No, I I think I

1923
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:42,400
Because that's because if you cut down the shaft like that's not foreskin. That's just skin. Yeah. Yeah, so that would be a fuck up

1924
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:48,000
So by botch circuit the botch circumcision here was that he's not circumcised enough

1925
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,680
So, I mean, I would maybe consider like

1926
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,840
Finishing the job at that point. They're in no man's land

1927
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,840
Yeah, um, I mean, I'm sure it

1928
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,240
I'm trying to imagine what that would even look like. I mean, I'm sure it works fine

1929
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,000
Hmm

1930
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Just kind of like a flap on the bottom of yeah

1931
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:15,040
Yeah, it's yeah, I didn't realize people had such strong opinions about this because I have like a weird rant

1932
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:19,040
I have told my poor friends that they have to listen to about how I hate circumcision

1933
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,960
But like I'm not going to subject you to that. I just wanted to don't know. We've had enough

1934
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:28,560
Yeah, I just I just wanted to let you know that I didn't realize this was such a hot topic among the people

1935
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:33,280
When I remember when Andrew Yang came out and said that like he didn't like

1936
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,800
He didn't think that like circumcision should be a mandatory

1937
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:42,160
I remember there was a certain section of the internet was like really excited. We're like fuck. Yeah

1938
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,920
Wait, he didn't think they should be mandatory aren't circumcisions

1939
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:50,560
Not well, no, I mean no, what I mean is he said the thing that's like, um

1940
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,760
You know like uh

1941
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,560
Parents probably shouldn't make the oh, okay. I see what you're saying like that. Yeah, he said that and people were like

1942
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,080
Which you know, I'm fair enough. Okay, um

1943
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:08,800
Next next one. Yeah, it's called. I literally hate you awful mic quality

1944
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,320
um

1945
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,320
3 2 1 go

1946
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:16,000
The voice grail and the voice jail are a false dichotomy

1947
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:20,400
What always happens is someone will make a shitty voicemail and it'll get sent to voice jail

1948
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:25,920
But you're giving these failures attention and almost always they take that to continue their narrative

1949
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:29,920
Whereas the people who get voice grailed often send one good one and leave it at that

1950
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,680
It's a negative feedback loop

1951
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:37,120
The answer to this is just to say this voicemail sucks and skip to the next one because we still have fucking losers

1952
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:42,720
Like maga and that voicemail guy continuing to waste everyone's time by sending their self-indulgent shit

1953
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:47,520
Like no one has a sensible mail. They haven't even made a good voicemail to invest us to them

1954
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,520
How does it feel that your sad existence is continued because of people like ben platform hate speech saint

1955
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:59,200
And his laziness you're so bad. I wish nate was back just to beat you like jesus christ

1956
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:04,080
You're a fucking loser artist calling onto a podcast full of other loser failure artists

1957
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,680
I dread having to listen to you jerk yourself off every episode

1958
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,640
No one cares about your previous voicemails and no one cares about the voicemail voicemails. You're making now

1959
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,800
You're actively making the show worse

1960
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,040
And I just wanted you to know that there was someone that has genuine ire for your existence

1961
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:25,280
Please get a bit ask a real question and stop talking about yourself as if we know who you are

1962
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,120
You're awful

1963
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:30,320
Wow that the vote apart from the voicemails the show is pretty good

1964
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,960
trans rights BLM gay rights

1965
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,480
Good. Bye. I

1966
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:41,680
I thought he was talking about me for a second there. No. No. No. He's talking too bad voicemail givers

1967
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,960
Oh, okay, because when he when he because when he when he said like

1968
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:50,320
When he said like you're a fucking loser artist like like a clawing on to his shitty podcast and I hate you

1969
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,720
I thought like oh now he's talking about me

1970
01:56:54,960 --> 01:57:00,080
He did say going on to a podcast full of other shitty failure artists. So I I you know

1971
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:06,480
I I I feel I'm just gonna assume he's talking about me. Uh, no. No, I you're beautiful. I think this guy

1972
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:11,360
I think he makes a bit. I mean if you did say we're a bunch of shitty failure artists

1973
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:17,440
And that that is why that they call into this show. Uh, how doubly embarrassing I guess is what he was saying there

1974
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:24,240
I think I think he's right in that the voice jail doesn't really serve as an effective punishment of anything

1975
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,120
Uh, yeah, I just I just want to be able to say fuck you in a specific way

1976
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,360
Do a person. Yeah

1977
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:35,040
Yeah, it's uh, we probably should be a little more selective honestly

1978
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,640
Like if like if a voicemail if a voicemail is genuinely bad

1979
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:43,520
And like we voice jail it we probably shouldn't like keep playing. I mean

1980
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,960
I I'm I'm pretty lax with my standards

1981
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:51,760
But like, you know, if I think a voicemail is like actually like really brings nothing to the table

1982
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,080
I I am trying more to actually be like, hey ellie's are cut this don't

1983
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:01,040
So what so what that means is that the ones that you hear are actually the ones that that meet my standards

1984
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,440
So that that should tell you just how low my standards are

1985
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,760
ma'am

1986
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,920
Um, any anything else?

1987
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:12,240
No, no, okay. That was an adventure though that

1988
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:18,640
The the one comment I have I don't know if it's my place to say this is I don't know if the shitty voicemail people

1989
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,200
Uh, I don't know if they care about your eye or for them

1990
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:28,480
Like oh, that's that might be true. You might that's probably it might that might feed them as well, right? You might have accidentally fed the loop

1991
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,240
That's all I have to say

1992
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:38,480
There's probably a certain strain of shitty voicemail sender who will take who will take this as encouragement. Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely

1993
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,320
It's it's really inescapable. It's an inescapable cycle. Yeah

1994
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:48,240
Um cycle of violence the next one the next one is called irish ninja

1995
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:52,080
Three two one go. I think I know who this is

1996
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,760
So you's had the irish samurai on last week

1997
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,200
Um, I don't care what kind of gay lore shit is going on. Fuck that guy

1998
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:08,400
That's an offensive stereotype. Terrible accent me and all my homies in the japanese IRA. We're gonna fuck him up

1999
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,280
um, my question

2000
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:17,040
What is the most appealing and least appealing accent? I wasn't on the last episode

2001
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:21,840
I do want to say I listened to it and it was anything but irish that guy

2002
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:27,280
It almost sounded Welsh like a like a strange combination of Welsh and Scottish

2003
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,880
I was like, this is terrible that you you don't know anything

2004
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:34,640
Well, I mean I I won't defend it too hard

2005
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:41,200
But I will say it was meant to be a a mash-up of irish and japanese was the goal is what it was supposed to be

2006
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,080
That was the weird part

2007
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:50,800
There were I I could I could tell that's what it was going for. Okay. Um, okay, but the most and least appealing

2008
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:53,680
accents

2009
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:01,040
I might be a little biased here. I think that one of the least appealing accents is a Providence

2010
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,520
Rhode Island accent

2011
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,720
um

2012
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:07,440
It's a little bit like a boston accent, but not quite

2013
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:14,240
It has an annoying quirk of like adding r's onto the end of words that don't need them like like

2014
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,960
posture

2015
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:21,920
Yeah, I I don't I can't really do a good impression of it, but like

2016
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,560
It's not like people from like south boston have like a really strong

2017
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,040
Ah, pock the cut like you can really tell the the the providence accent is not usually that

2018
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:36,800
pronounced like it's sometimes hard to identify but like when I hear the when I hear that extra r

2019
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,360
I'm like, oh

2020
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,000
Um, you guys you guys have opinions. Um

2021
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,200
like my my one of my lowest ones is a

2022
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,600
A very strong like southern accent. I'm not fond of

2023
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:51,920
at all

2024
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,040
um

2025
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,000
Well, there's there's different kinds of southern accents

2026
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:01,040
Okay, I might be uninitiated due to my you know being up here in the great north

2027
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,960
There's um

2028
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:11,600
I don't I don't really know which is which I've heard people like I've heard people do impressions of like an alabama accent

2029
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:16,720
Versus like a tennessee accent versus like a you know, a virginia accent or whatever and like they're all different

2030
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:19,360
All I know is that there are some

2031
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,600
there are some

2032
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:26,960
I don't I wouldn't say that I like love or hate any of them in particular. I think that some of them sound better

2033
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:31,920
When women have them and some of them sound better when men have them, you know, and I'll agree with that

2034
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,720
I agree and they don't work as well in the reverse. Yeah

2035
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:41,520
Uh, yeah, I'm trying to think of like ones. I don't like what what accent does sarah palin have?

2036
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:49,920
Oh like uh like oh like I'm like a midwestern sort of uh, like wiskansen like like a kind of wiskansen

2037
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,200
I just I just remember being very shrill and

2038
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,760
Sharp and I didn't like it

2039
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:01,600
I mean, I know she's alaskan, but I don't actually know if I think she it has like a midwestern like wiskans

2040
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,320
Yeah, but yeah, that that's a bad one. That's a pretty bad one. Yeah

2041
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:15,520
I feel like it's less about specific accents and more how accents combine with people's like voice types

2042
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:23,200
Where yeah, you'll hit one where they have this picture like tones their voice combined with the accent. That's just no no good no good

2043
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:27,440
I like I like I like irish accents. Oh, yeah

2044
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:31,680
That's pretty good. Um, I'm trying to think if there's any that I particularly like

2045
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:34,480
irish is good generally

2046
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,160
I'm trying to think of like what is they said attractive voices, right?

2047
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,360
Yeah, like I don't know

2048
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,360
exactly

2049
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:49,760
What what what I think of as like an attractive voice because it's always with a person attached

2050
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,320
Right

2051
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:55,840
Even if you've never had you've never I mean you've never had like a

2052
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:58,000
I mean

2053
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,440
Surely there have been like people who you you've heard them speak, but you've never

2054
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,960
Like garrison keeler has a really good voice

2055
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:10,320
But like I saw that motherfucker like a couple weeks ago. I'd never seen what he looked like before and like holy shit

2056
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,720
Do you know who that is? No

2057
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,680
garrison keeler is a

2058
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,520
He's the like a the end. He's an npr like radio

2059
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:26,720
Guy rate radio personality. He has a he has a very nice voice and he looks like a fucking

2060
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,360
He looks like fucking

2061
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,360
God

2062
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:34,240
Like down syndrome dwight shrewd. I don't know. Oh, no

2063
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:36,800
You look

2064
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,800
I exaggerate but not that much

2065
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:41,600
Yeah, I need to see what that what's this guy's name

2066
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:47,200
garrison keeler keeler is spelled key k e i l l o r

2067
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,680
Yeah, all I can think of is like fucking

2068
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:58,480
Like voice sounds and not really accents because I I guess I can't parse american accents, but like

2069
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,040
Raven from teen titans

2070
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,040
and and like kim pine

2071
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:05,440
uh from the scott pilgrim movie

2072
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,640
And and and and and what's her face the girl from b and puppy cat that's sort of like

2073
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,120
understated sort of

2074
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:15,120
low-pitched female voice

2075
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,920
But that's not an accent. That's just a feeling

2076
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,680
Yeah, that's so that's like a like a personality type

2077
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,960
I

2078
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:33,200
Is that is that the attractive type to you or the unattractive type the attractive. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's pretty good

2079
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,320
um

2080
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,880
I

2081
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,440
Don't know. I don't know if I have like a voice

2082
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:43,040
type

2083
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:48,480
Exactly, it just yeah, there's not really one type. It's just sort of like things sound good or they don't

2084
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:52,640
And I can't really attribute that to an accent although some accents are very thick

2085
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:56,400
I don't think any thick accent is particularly like attractive

2086
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:59,920
But I do think a lot of northern british accents are funny and cool

2087
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:03,520
If a voice is too

2088
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:08,960
No, the English I should say a voice can sound like too, uh, uh

2089
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:15,920
Strong there are some voices. I don't know what it is like they voice their vowels too much or like they are too like

2090
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:21,680
There's there's a such a thing as a voice that like sounds too strong and I find it off-gooding

2091
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:26,000
I don't know. I don't know how to explain that but there have been voices. I've heard that I'm like, ah

2092
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,720
Ah, it's not what I wanted. Yeah

2093
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,920
I don't know anyway

2094
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:37,040
Uh, any should we should we move on? Yeah, I think so

2095
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:40,000
Okay, next one is um

2096
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:44,720
Next one is uh, this one is called. Sorry. It is called. How many do we have left?

2097
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Only like two I think

2098
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:53,120
Oh, yeah, literally two the next one is called xx the lore destroyer xx

2099
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:56,080

2100
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:02,160
I gotta make this quick because I never know who's listening to me. I'm constantly being watched

02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:04,320
I am constantly being

02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:05,840

From from many decades ago many many millennia so many millennia you will never understand

2106
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:28,960
It is impossible for humans to comprehend a long time. But but point being that that I was sent

You hate them. I hate them

2110
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:45,280
It's funny because we know we didn't have any of those this week, but it's okay. It's okay

2111
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:52,800
We we we it's okay because because I'm going to kill every person who makes lore

2112
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:56,560
This is my burden. This is my curse

2113
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:00,960

For not coming sooner

2115
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:08,240
I have had your services, uh, frank. I've been constipated

2116
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,000
I was supposed to get out on my my mission a few

2117
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:18,240
Few weeks ago, but I've been on the I've been on the toilet, man. Oh, it's it's it's what it is

2118
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:21,120
But keep an eye out for me

2119
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:23,840
Um, because I'm gonna be here. We could we could uh

2120
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:30,000
Gucci we we could we could enshrine this we have several options. We could enshrine this in the voice grail

2121
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,520
or

2122
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,520
We could we could demand

2123
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:38,160
We could basically demand that he make more voicemails by putting him in voice jail

2124
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:46,480
Ah, no, uh, I don't now that the the meta has shifted if that's the case then the jail will be more sought after

2125
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:51,040
There'll people be coming in saying uh, I'm stupid. You hate me now put me in the jail

2126
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:56,000
They'll come back. It's I you say that if that's a shit. I feel like it's always kind of been like that

2127
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:59,120
Yeah, I guess

2128
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:04,400
All right. Look lord destroyer. We will we will we will watch we will be watching the skies

2129
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,440
signal

2130
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,440
Good good screaming

2131
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:15,360
This is the last one. This is the last one. This one is called cross got my wisdoms pulled

2132
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,920
three two one go

2133
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:23,120
I got my wisdom teeth removed a couple of days ago and for the first 48 hours after the surgery

2134
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:27,920
I was actually doing pretty fine, but throughout day three. I've been extremely nauseous and lightheaded

2135
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:31,040
Obviously, I'll feel better by the time you're hearing this but nonetheless

2136
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:35,520
I'm curious if any of you guys have gotten your wisdoms pulled and if so, how was the recovery?

2137
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:38,160
I feel like I

2138
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:41,360
Am I crazy? I feel like I got asked this like not that long ago

2139
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:45,680
I even on the show. I don't think it was on the show, but um

2140
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:49,440
I I had wisdom teeth coming in

2141
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,320
And for some reason they said yeah, you can keep them

2142
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:54,000
I was like, oh

2143
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Oh, I've all the only like the only situation I've heard of wisdom teeth is that they have to be pulled out

2144
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,600
And so when I heard they were coming in I thought that was bad

2145
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:06,640
But no, I just have them now. I just have extra teeth

2146
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:09,840
Well, you just have enough space. You're a you're a good one

2147
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,880
I'm I'm one of the bad. I'm one of the good ones

2148
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:14,880
You're a vault

2149
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:21,520
Um, well, yeah, I had my wisdom teeth out when I was like a senior or a junior. I think it was a junior in high school

2150
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,560
and um

2151
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,880
Yeah, I didn't find I didn't get nauseous

2152
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:32,080
I didn't find the pain too bad, you know, it ached it ached for a while afterwards

2153
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:37,520
But um, I got swollen like my face was swollen for like a week afterwards

2154
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:40,400
Uh, uh, it was very hideous

2155
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,560
And it was very cringe because I actually had like a date with a girl

2156
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:47,600
Uh, I don't think she thought it was a date lemal, but I liked her

2157
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:51,280
And then we went and I had to hung it hang out with this girl

2158
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:54,400
Uh with my fucking swollen face

2159
02:09:54,960 --> 02:10:02,080
And uh, it was embarrassing. Oh no, um, yeah, so that's that's how mine was. Yeah, you know, I it all worked itself out

2160
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:04,160
I didn't get nauseous from it. Uh

2161
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:08,240
I did get like it was really weird because I got them pulled

2162
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:12,560
And then I was doing like totally fine. I wasn't even sore but for a few nights in a row

2163
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:18,080
I would wake up in a cold sweat like I've never had before like just my body shaking

2164
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:24,000
And I'm pretty sure I was like fighting off some sort of infection, but at the time I was like, it's fine

2165
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:28,560
I'm sure it's fine and I just kind of lived my life and I'm still here today. So

2166
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:31,120
Uh, good luck with your wisdom teeth

2167
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,120
I remember like

2168
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:38,240
Not very like like after like the the the teeth wounds had already started healing

2169
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:41,680
I remember at some point like I felt something like

2170
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:48,080
In my the in back there in the teeth and I reached back and I pulled out like a big like hard chunk of something

2171
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:53,120
And I I remember I remember thinking at the time that it was like a piece of bone that they'd left in

2172
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,320
But I don't think that was it

2173
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:58,400
I think it was probably actually like a chunk of like maybe blood or something

2174
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:03,360
That had like coagulated it could have been like some healing stuff too because like

2175
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:10,160
At least when they didn't mind they left like little divots kind of and I had to like make sure I cleaned them out very specifically

2176
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:13,360
Yeah, because it would just collect like gross gunk

2177
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:20,080
True. Yeah, I don't know. Um, so I don't know you could probably look forward to like pulling pieces out

2178
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:24,720
Uh, you're basically ruined as a human being at this point. Yeah, it's over

2179
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:30,880
You know with I mean the the the wisdom teeth actually contain many like short short nerve endings that like

2180
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:37,200
Massively increase sexual pleasure. So like, you know, good luck. Good luck having a fulfilling relationship now

2181
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,760
At this at this point you're doing it to yourself

2182
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:44,320
You you have been mutilated. You have been mutilated cross. You brought it back around

2183
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:47,600
We've finally enforced for a forced

2185
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,000
But

That's um, that's it. That's the last one

2187
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:01,360
That's the last one. Oh wow

2188
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,280
Wow

2189
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,760
And it was some circumcision via ben saint

02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,080
What is this like is this a poo mug and like it didn't have poo anywhere on it

2233

2234
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,640
What about this quote and someone looked it up and they're like, oh

2235
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:16,320
Apparently that's an a.a. Milne quote and I was like no

2236
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:22,480
No, it's definitely it's definitely not an a.a. Milne quote because it's from that movie and that's like way after Milne died
