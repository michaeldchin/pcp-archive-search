00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,520
I'm the best guy ever. What do we got going on here? We got Hippos here.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,160
We got Lethal Aurora Maid.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, shoot. I'm second. Hi. Hello. I am here.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,920
Indeed. I'm alive. We've got Ben Saint.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,520
Tom Oliver.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,920
Hey. Oh, let's go.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,120
Oh, hey. And of course, Endless Jess.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,720
Oh, fuck. Hello. It's also me.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,520
Oh, man. Well.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,400
What a cast of characters. What a motley crew.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,600
This is a motley crew.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,360
So, I posted a question, and I can't pronounce it because pronunciation is part of the question.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
So, I want you guys to bidet it.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
It's pronounced bidet.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
It's pronounced by debt.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
Anyone ever use a bidet?

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,240
I hope to one day. It's a dream of mine to own one.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,840
Actually. Okay. Funny story about a bidet.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,440
So, the house I live in, there used to be a guy who lived here,

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,000
who we called Little John, and Little John had bidets,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,480
and he installed bidets on every toilet in the house.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
Bidets for days.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,360
Yeah. And so, we do have bidets, right?

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,800
Like, they are on every toilet.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,840
But I tried it one time, and I hated it.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,440
I thought it was, like, horrible.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,160
It was like a powerful, concentrated stream of water that shot right at your anus,

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,760
and I don't like it. I do not like it.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
I wonder about the cleanup. Do you have, like, a towel?

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
Like, how do you, I guess, toilet paper?

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,120
I assume you would just use toilet paper.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,880
I mean, I never got good with it, right?

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,480
I never mastered the techniques.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,440
Yeah.

37
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,160
So, we have them, and I don't like them.

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
Maybe I should give it another shot.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Another shot.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,520
Suddenly, bidets.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,680
They're in the general sphere of anything involving my asshole is gay.

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
Yeah. I was going to say, that's pretty homo-adjacent, if you ask me.

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
It's not, though.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
It's not that it's gay.

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,760
It's just that it was like, oh, god, wow, what, no.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,960
It feels bad.

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,000
This raises the old question of, is a man getting pegged by his wife, let's say, is that gay?

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
I mean, there's no man in the way.

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
It's not gay. It's just sad.

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
I actually wanted to mention this the last time this sort of thing came up,

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,880
because the whole, is it gay?

52
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,040
I know it's a meme, partially, but people do ask these questions.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
And it's always stupid, because gay is a sexual preference.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,880
It is not a physical action.

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Like, any physical action can be anything, but your perception of it is your preference for the same sex.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
That's what it means.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,840
Touching a foot can be just as non-sexual as it can be sexual.

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
So, yeah, I can see what you're talking about.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Let me make an argument for why I kind of think it is gay, even though there's no man involved.

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:08,320
But the pegging is approximating or simulating an act that naturally could only be performed by another man.

61
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,200
Surely, we're not comparing the act of literally getting fucked in the butt

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,160
to just splashing water on it to keep it clean from poopies.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,160
No, I don't think a bidet is gay.

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,520
I mean, it could be.

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,560
But I think getting pegged by your wife is kind of gay.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
If the pegging thing isn't gay, we can surely say that the bidet is not gay.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,880
So, you know, I'm using that as a starting point.

68
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,640
I think the getting pegged kind of is gay.

69
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,600
I think it's kind of gay.

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,760
I think getting pegged by your husband is definitely gay.

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,880
Well, of course.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,520
Unless you're a woman, well, I guess that's not a good point.

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
I didn't think of it that way.

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,920
I think it's not gay unless you think it's a guy, unless you think it's the same sex.

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,720
I don't think so.

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,840
If you just concentrate really hard on it being something else, then it's not gay.

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,680
I think even if you're not into guys, I still think it's kind of gay to get pegged.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
That's the thing, though.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
Not if there's anything wrong with that.

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Ah, Jerry, she had man hands.

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
This leads to another question.

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
Does that mean, like, food is gay?

83
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,520
It's also approximating dude parts?

84
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,680
I mean, I just said, like, gay is a sexual preference.

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Preference for the same gender as you.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm glad that right off the bat, we're getting down to the real issues that matter in the world.

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
Man, these issues are too complex.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,960
Why don't we all just, everyone in the world just say,

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
fuck it, we're all gay, and then we don't have to think about this anymore?

90
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,160
We're everyone's gay.

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,840
Hey, I think that's the big brain thing to do now in 2019.

92
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
We've concluded this.

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
Everyone's on the gay spectrum a little bit.

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I don't think food is necessary.

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
It probably mostly is gay, but I don't think it's always gay.

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Okay, so surely you'd say that, like, the whole man getting pegged by his wife.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
Again, that's, like, partially gay.

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
Obviously not, like, full gay.

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
Well, we're all about a wife getting pegged by her wife.

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah, obviously.

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
It's not as gay as it's less gay than getting pegged by a guy, obviously.

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
But what about a wife getting pegged by her other wife?

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
I mean, that's still gay, but woman gay, which isn't real gay.

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
I think that would be straight.

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,200
That would be straight because, like, the phallus thing is like...

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh, okay, well, then it's straighter.

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,640
It's straighter than not pegging each other, but it's less straight than getting pegged by a husband.

108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,680
Can a woman be pegged?

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
We've got to draw up a graph here.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,000
We've got to just, like, put all these in, like, quadrants.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
Since we're talking about gay things...

112
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
When a woman gets pegged, isn't she just getting fucked in the ass?

113
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
Isn't that not pegging anymore?

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,720
Is there a distinction?

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
Is there a distinction there?

116
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,120
It's still gay if a woman's getting pegged.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,920
Is there a distinction in the nomenclature?

118
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,000
The only pegs I care about are clothes pegs, to do the laundry and to put the clothes pegs.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,960
Since we're talking about gay things, I want to mention a thing.

120
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,040
Double-decker, Doug and Carole, this anime, that's kind of a little bit gay, but not really.

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,360
Do you want to tell them our secret mage?

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
Yes, I want to share the secret.

123
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm going to reveal the secret.

124
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I showed Ben this anime, and although we haven't finished watching it,

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
he liked it, and I'm so happy.

126
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
We got, like, six episodes in.

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
Oh, no, Ben watched the anime.

128
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,080
And it was... I didn't...

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
Yeah, I actually was enjoying it.

130
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,040
It was actually pretty good.

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,080
Belie, I know, right?

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,960
I know, sad.

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
It was fun, though.

134
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
It is, it was.

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,920
Like, that's why...

136
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
What is the anime?

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
Give me the picture.

138
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,200
It's called Double-decker.

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,560
Double-decker, Doug and Carole.

140
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah, it's about cops in New York?

141
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,640
Question mark, question mark, question mark.

142
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,480
San Francisco?

143
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,120
I don't know, they're in some...

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
Oh, Maple?

145
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,680
I think it's like an American...

146
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,560
It's like a Japanese sort of...

147
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,000
It's sort of like...

148
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,200
If you took the character designs from Persona, and instead of a school murder mystery,

149
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,600
you put them in an American style...

150
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,320
Or the Japanese approximation of an American-style buddy cop sort of action drama.

151
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,160
And then you gave someone a big anime gun with a cool, like, 3D...

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
Like, oh, I'm charging up my gun, and I'm shooting my gun at the end of the episode.

153
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,240
Like, that kind of thing.

154
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
Now, is Digimon transformation happening?

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
Is gun a euphemism, or is it an actual gun?

156
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
No, it's...

157
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
He has a...

158
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
We were just talking about gay shit, so excuse my confusion.

159
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,760
He has a secret science gun that counteracts the effects of a drug

160
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,440
that turns people into monsters, not unlike Joy and Lisa.

161
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
He has a secret gun that counterfeits people turning gay.

162
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,560
So it's a magic gun.

163
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
Where did he purchase that?

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
I think he got it from the police department, so there you go.

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
Well, all right, so I guess it's a secret to the other people, but not to the police.

166
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
Just made to have answers.

167
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
It's similar to the police department.

168
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,960
It's called like...

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
Right, right, it's like a secret branch.

170
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
Yeah, it's like a sister branch of the police.

171
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,440
Okay.

172
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
That deals specifically with dealings with that drug, because that drug,

173
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,480
turns people into literal monsters.

174
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,600
So...

175
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,240
Yeah, dude.

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
It changes the human genome.

177
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Sick, I love blood.

178
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,320
That's the way to do it, if ever there was one.

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Hey, I've got a fear, a deep-seated fear and insecurity I want to discuss

180
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,640
based on the Miamath of an episode I just released of Green Screen Memes.

181
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,760
And basically...

182
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,720
Saw that on Twitter.

183
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
Yes, yep, it's out.

184
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,120
It's good.

185
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,800
Here's the thing, though.

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
When you are...

187
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
I consider myself a pretty funny guy.

188
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
I think I've got some japs and some jokes.

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,280
Oh, I'm laughing.

190
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
Yeah, indeed.

191
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,720
It is so...

192
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,080
Okay, with this video, more than others, but I feel this a lot.

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
It is truly terrifying to me.

194
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,240
The idea of releasing something that I'm trying to make funny,

195
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,960
but to have it not be received as funny.

196
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
This haunts me a lot of the time.

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,960
So where's that gonna happen?

198
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
Wait, what happened?

199
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,280
I stepped away for a bit.

200
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,480
What happened?

201
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm sure you can relate to this, Jesse.

202
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,840
It's my deep-seated fear of trying to be funny and failing.

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,800
And it is just...

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
Oh, God, if that ever happens, I'll die.

205
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
I'll kill myself.

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,200
Thank God it hasn't happened yet, to my knowledge, indeed.

207
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
Everyone says this, right?

208
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
But, you know, they can't all be gems.

209
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,280
No one's gonna succeed 100% of the time.

210
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,520
So even if you're funny, even some of the time,

211
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,800
I think people will generally forgive you if sometimes you fail.

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,400
You know what I mean?

213
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,680
That's definitely, I think that's one of the most everything in life.

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,160
I think that depends on the age of your audience.

215
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,560
Young people expect to be laughing constantly, or else they'll kill themselves.

216
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,360
Well, you know, I mean, it's fair to consider your audience, I guess.

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I've always heard, like, you listen to comedians talk about being a comedian,

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,040
and they always say, like, everybody bombs sometimes.

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
Once in a while, even the grits go out there and bomb.

220
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
But like, so here's the thing.

221
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,640
I've done stand-up two times, and neither time I bombed.

222
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,360
So like, if I never do it again, I'll be the only comedian I've ever bombed.

223
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
Yeah, yeah, perfect batting average.

224
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
Just leave now, you've done it.

225
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
I just retire, I'm done.

226
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm the greatest comedian who's ever lived.

227
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
This is the issue, though.

228
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,360
I mean, okay, so like, when I'm normally making like a video or whatever,

229
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,960
so like, this is in the context of like, the green screen meme video I just released.

230
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,280
So like, haha, like, Filthy Frank did it.

231
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,480
You know, other people have done it.

232
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm like, this would be funny.

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,640
Jeremy did it.

234
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,760
Jeremy did it, indeed.

235
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
So these people are like, you know, really funny.

236
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,120
And I'm like, I did this, I did some goofs and gaffes,

237
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,400
and I'm looking back at it, and I'm like, this is not as funny.

238
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,200
This is like, kind of funny, but like, but the thing is, I have to release a video,

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
because it's me and Mavva.

240
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,520
I have no choice.

241
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,640
And I don't want people to like, I'm not of a negative perception of the video.

242
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,320
It's like, I go into it and releases, and then someone says like, Nate,

243
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
you're no, you're no Filthy Frank.

244
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,240
And I'm like, um, okay, fair, fair, but I bet, I bet that in general,

245
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,280
this video will go around and some people will have some positive experiences of it.

246
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,240
And any potential, like, like, it's not as good as the best who've ever done it,

247
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
will be overshadowed by what good it does do in the larger, you know,

248
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
in the larger ecosphere of video creation.

249
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
And so I'm, I'm hinging my will on that.

250
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,920
And like, in general, when it comes to work being produced,

251
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,960
and this is kind of the spirit of me and Mavva, and I don't know,

252
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,080
and we ag want everything I do to force me to get stuff out.

253
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,000
So I don't obsess about it.

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,760
It's not worth just sitting around and being concerned about

255
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
and worrying that like you're going to bomb,

256
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,160
even if like this video turns out to be hated and despised or whatever.

257
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Like it's just one video of many put out during me and Mavva.

258
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,400
I did that fucking Sopranos ASMR video who asked me a Mavva.

259
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,600
If there was every forgotten video in the best guy ever catalog, it was that video.

260
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
I certainly don't remember it.

261
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
Indeed, no one does.

262
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,760
And I can't blame it.

263
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,120
See, Nate, you have the perfect cover here because if this video does bomb,

264
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
you can just be like, well, I only did it in 24 hours.

265
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,080
You know?

266
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,880
I mean, that's true.

267
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,520
That's true.

268
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,240
You have the perfect cover.

269
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
But like, that defense, that defense is like, if someone,

270
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
like if you're arguing with someone as to like why you're not shit,

271
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
then like that's fine.

272
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
But that's a whole different thing from like

273
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,120
getting people to think you're funny in general,

274
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
because you can't debate them one-on-one and explain your situation.

275
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,640
You've just got to be funny and give them a positive pressure.

276
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,560
Humor like anything else is subjective.

277
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,440
So if some people don't find it funny, you're just like, well, that wasn't to your taste.

278
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,000
Like, okay.

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
You got your bases covered here.

281
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,960
This was a prime time to experiment.

282
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,920
Look that another way.

283
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,320
You will always fail because someone will always not find it funny.

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
I mean, of course, of course, that's true.

285
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,880
And I don't know.

286
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm not trying to say that I'm like overly concerned about it,

287
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
but it did get me thinking because like I do think about, you know,

288
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,080
I mean, I was thinking certainly about like the filthy Frank clock and like

289
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
but to think about it from another way, like that filthy Frank clock thing,

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
like sure, it's funny, but it was just some retarded shit.

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,440
He probably just had a broken clock around and he didn't like have some grand plan

292
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
to make it be like, you know, this thing that gets used all the time.

293
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,120
He was already a very successful guy, obviously.

294
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
So people would like it no matter what.

295
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,520
And here's another thing.

296
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,920
I don't know.

297
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,960
Here's another thing to consider, like all those green screen memes,

298
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,360
like their hilarity is reinforced by the context that you know them in.

299
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
So like, I think I think if we just saw the filthy Frank clock

300
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,680
of devoid of context now, we'd be like, huh, okay,

301
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,400
it's all the memes that it's used for that make it great.

302
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,440
That is absolutely true.

303
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
You know, it's all kind of just like the fact that it's filthy Frank doing it.

304
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
True. Very true.

305
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,480
I mean, what can you do about that?

306
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,960
You know, the filthy Frank is like famous man.

307
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,280
He's like the mainstream green screen guy that is everywhere that like broke into the

308
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,920
into the world.

309
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,520
But you know, who's the true connoisseur of the green screen,

310
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
the true champion of the green screen meme is Jerma.

311
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Jerma put out a green screen video that was like he did it for like five hours.

312
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
And then like, yeah, it's a huge stream.

313
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,520
And he did like every possible like action and thing like reaction possible.

314
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,120
When I finished it, I felt so deeply and he made it for the purposes of like

315
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,320
having his followers make films with it.

316
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,960
Right. Right.

317
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,280
And it was so robust and great.

318
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,840
I one of the main things I felt as I was like editing and finishing was like,

319
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,120
oh, there's so many reactions like different types.

320
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I wish I'd put really I skewed mostly towards the like negative reaction of various stripes

321
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
towards the thing on screen that I am referring to.

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
Like that's the vast majority of it.

323
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
And like that's fine.

324
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,760
But I wanted there to be more like positive ones that could be used in funny ways.

325
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,240
I don't know.

326
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,960
Yeah, I'd be like so scared that like I jump in front of the green screen and go,

327
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,560
this guy is a stupid piece of shit.

328
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
And then someone just put me behind me.

329
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,280
And it's like, oh, no, why would you do that?

330
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,040
I mean, I'm thinking about it now.

331
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,440
I mean, just I guess I was taken to the extreme.

332
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,920
Like you could take any of these kinds of things.

333
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,200
And like, I don't know, you could put it to like some horrible like terrorist footage

334
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,440
and have just be in me like, like, haha.

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
Epic joke, my dude.

336
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
I just had the perfect idea.

337
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,960
I mean, this is the thing I came up with like years ago when I was doing like the green screen

338
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,600
like stupid shit where I would you get this video from you, Nate, you take the same video

339
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,640
and you put in the background and you offset it by about 10 seconds.

340
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:16,960
Oh, yeah.

341
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,760
And so you're just reacting to the last thing you did.

342
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh, that's good.

343
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
I will come out of that one looking rosy.

344
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,600
Let me tell you because I'm roasting guys in this in this clip show.

345
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,960
Well, that's it.

346
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,000
These are my thoughts on comedy and green screen memes.

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,920
Ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy.

348
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,120
I did.

349
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,880
Savory.

350
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,800
Well, speaking of Mia Maffova and speaking of having thoughts on things,

351
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,160
what about that final fantasy seven trailer that came there?

352
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,880
There's a topic.

353
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
Oh, my goodness.

354
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh, I haven't seen that yet.

355
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,280
I haven't.

356
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,560
Well, I mean, I haven't watched Nate's video yet because I was like, maybe I'll do a video.

357
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,800
So I didn't want to watch Nate's first and pepper it.

358
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,280
But since we're on the fucking podcast, what did you think?

359
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
Well, okay.

360
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,760
So first of all, there was the initial sinking in my stomach when I first saw it that,

361
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,600
oh no, it's still happening.

362
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,760
It hasn't been canceled.

363
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,280
Of course, though, that was the initial motion.

364
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,240
I had almost forgotten.

365
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,320
Beyond that, I mean, there were some things looked cool.

366
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
Like my second reaction beyond that was like, oh, it's cool to see final fantasy seven

367
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
like looking nice, which it does.

368
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,960
I actually thought it was pretty reassuring for the most part.

369
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,240
Right up until the end, where fucking Sephiroth shows up for no fucking reason in the reactor.

370
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
I made a big screed.

371
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,920
I said a big thing about like, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.

372
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,360
Sephiroth does not show up on final fantasy seven until so far later to like build him up

373
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,080
as an antagonist of like mystery and suspense and shit.

374
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Like I get that like, because it's 20 years later, you can't really have Sephiroth be a

375
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
surprise anymore.

376
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,400
Yeah, yeah, but you can though, just like, because the eyes will be hungry.

377
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,000
Like it's like narratively and like interesting.

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
It would just feel better to like, even if you know, if you've seen a movie before

379
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,920
and you know what the monster that he comes out like, I don't know, like the thing or something,

380
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,120
you know what the thing is.

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
But watching the movie from the beginning, the suspense is still built because it's just

382
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,280
good film.

383
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,560
It's just good film.

384
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,720
Maybe, I mean, perhaps this is a more cynical calculation by Square Enix that like,

385
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
they just want to start putting Sephiroth in promotional art.

386
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,120
I mean, in every way, I think this is a mistake.

387
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,040
If they're doing it, I can't stop them, whatever.

388
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,520
They're doing this like episodic release as far as we know.

389
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,760
I think that was confirmed recently too.

390
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
The only way that it could be acceptable to me is if they're just doing like a thing

391
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,920
where they're expanding on clouds like mental episodes and he's hallucinating Sephiroth.

392
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,440
I mean, that's definitely what they're, okay, this is the thing.

393
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,640
Cause like FF7, to this day, I'm pretty confused as to exactly what the implications are of what's

394
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,600
going on inside clouds head when we get the like black screen, white text at various times.

395
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,080
And like we know Sephiroth is involved with like Genova connection and stuff going on.

396
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,280
But like, frankly, this is, this is kind of my other point I made in my video.

397
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,040
Like I love the ambiguity and I like not knowing what the fuck's going on because it makes the

398
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,400
game feel better.

399
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,080
And do I think that a bunch of like, I don't know, I don't think there's anyone in the world

400
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,840
who like really is served by trying to fill in every possible detail in a story.

401
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,640
I think that in general, you're better off leaving a bunch of stuff to the audience's imagination.

402
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,680
I think there's a difference between something being to this day confusing and something being

403
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,320
open to interpretation, like it could be this.

404
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,360
Well, like I said, I know what's going on.

405
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,880
Sephiroth is communicating with cloud like through Genova connection.

406
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,280
But like it's presented in such a mysterious way that like you won't know that.

407
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,920
But now you will in the remake because Sephiroth's right there.

408
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,240
I mean, like there are people who don't actually actually, there's probably a ton of people who

409
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,640
if they played following 57 for the first time right now, they'd remember the bombing mission.

410
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,400
But they'd forget that during the bombing mission at the very beginning of the game,

411
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,000
cloud has one of his psychotic breaks because we all kind of forget that like a lot of FF7

412
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,440
is just dealing with how mentally fucked up cloud really is.

413
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,320
We just think about, oh, the buster sword. Oh, we fight Sephiroth.

414
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,360
You forget about like the horror element and the body horror element of cloud,

415
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,320
literally losing control of himself and it's fucked up and it's scary and spooky.

416
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,920
And like, I mean, I really hope they preserve that element.

417
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,760
But I just think they'll lack kind of the delicate touch that's required.

418
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm also really worried that they're gonna do like the fanwanky like arch nemesis thing with

419
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,240
Sephiroth that they've been doing. Of course they are. Of course they are.

420
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,200
Even in the trailer, he shows up at the fucking bombing mission and immediately refers to cloud

421
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,360
by name. And it's like, oh my God. It don't say that. Don't call him cloud. You don't care about him.

422
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,520
Cloud, it literally isn't important right now. He literally means nothing to Sephiroth.

423
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,200
Like in the game, like yeah, like cloud is kind of obsessed with him because he's scared of him.

424
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
I guess he did kill Sephiroth. I guess he is the one who stabbed Sephiroth before.

425
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
Yeah, but like to Sephiroth, cloud is just-

426
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
This isn't the 10th since I have no context for anything.

427
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
Well, like in the original game-

428
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,280
We'll be done. We'll write.

429
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
As far as Sephiroth-

430
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,440
No, it's okay. I legit mean it. This is funny to just listen to it.

431
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,120
Yeah. Well, like the whole thing was that like cloud thought of Sephiroth as like the worst thing

432
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,240
that ever happened to him. But to Sephiroth, cloud is just some dork in a blue suit who fucking

433
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,120
threw him over a cliff once by accident. Like I don't think he ever, in the original

434
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,720
game, is not until like halfway through at least, there's not a point where Sephiroth

435
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,640
goes, hey cloud, it's me. Fuck you. He's always like, who the fuck are you again? Oh yeah,

436
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,440
that little meat puppet that I fucking don't care about.

437
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,320
I think the moment when cloud starts to actually matter is when cloud turns out to be the most

438
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,040
successful of all the men cloaked in black, who's the one who actually delivered the black

439
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,840
materia to Sephiroth and Northern Crater. That's what made cloud like special in this situation,

440
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,920
basically. He was the successful one.

441
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,920
So what a good game. What a cool like, what a unique story that's never like been

442
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,200
done again. And you know what bothers me? I hate the fact that when this game inevitably

443
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,560
fucking craps itself out upon the world. Everything that is good about it, Square Enix is gonna get

444
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,880
all the credit as if they just now made all this good stuff. But everything that's good about it

445
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,560
will be the stuff that was good 20 years ago. And they don't deserve the credit. This game is

446
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,400
gonna get, this game is gonna get perfect scores that it didn't earn. It's gonna be standing on

447
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,160
the shoulders of what came before it. And that's my, I guess I'm, I don't really care. That's my

448
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,280
pretend. You know, my, the only other thing I want to say about it is that like with the episodic

449
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,840
release, I mean, God, I could see this game not doing as well as they think it's going to. I mean,

450
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,240
I don't know, it is like one of the biggest games of all time. It's getting this like beautiful

451
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,040
remaster. No, like people don't care that it doesn't play the way it used to, or that it's going to

452
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,560
be less subtle. Nobody gives a shit. They just want to play as Cloud again. So I was gonna say that

453
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,200
like, maybe with the weird episodic release, people will like get frustrated and if they make

454
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,120
weird design choices, but frankly, like considering how well like crisis course hold and like all

455
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,440
the spinoffs, like, I don't know, Advent Children, everybody loves it, it's probably inevitably

456
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,560
just gonna do amazingly well. So I'd let Square Enix really fuck something up. Can you imagine,

457
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
though, if they get like a game or two in and then like, wow, this is like not doing as well,

458
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,120
we have to drop this like this is we're investing too much in this and then they don't finish it.

459
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,240
Like, I'm just saying that would be a true nightmare for everybody forever. And then when

460
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,480
when this happens on that day, they'll come crawling back to me and they'll say, Nate,

461
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,600
you were so right. Oh, you we shouldn't have done it. We shouldn't have strayed from God's light,

462
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,560
but we did now take us back and I will whisper no, no, you die. You die in the muck with them.

463
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:01,840
As a me as a gamer who whose DNA is not like thoroughly interwoven with Final Fantasy seven,

464
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,960
like I played it a few years ago, not as a child and I like it and I kind of want to replay it.

465
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,600
But I'm not like me too. I'm not like it's on the switch. This whole like thing with the remake,

466
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,160
probably I would not completely ignore it. And that's fine. I don't really feel the need to get

467
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,640
another one. But I think we can all agree that the most interesting part of Final Fantasy seven

468
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,800
remake is what they will do with Tifa. Oh, boy, on the edge of our seats waiting to see if they're

469
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,040
going to have like maybe a virtue signaling, you know, like we made her like, what are they going

470
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,160
to do? It's just like that's going to give her no tits and like big muscles and make her look

471
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,080
masculine and be like, you know, let's just make her black. They're going to cover up her entire

472
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,640
body. They're going to put her in like a big coat, a big poofy like George Costanza, you racist,

473
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,200
bro. What are you racist, bro? It's time to make Tifa black. This was inevitable. I mean,

474
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,080
when you think about it, right, when you think about it, like the progress, like the progressive

475
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,800
thing to do, like all like all the things she does, all those stereotypically black things she

476
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,000
does, like obviously she was black all along. Like a data white man, for example. Yeah, exactly.

477
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
We got to change all the characters to be black and we got to change Barrett to be like Albino.

478
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,920
He's got to be the only white one, but he's got to talk exactly. Have you guys,

479
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,880
have you guys seen, there is an image, you know what, I'll find this for the show notes. There's

480
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,920
an image of like, actually, this actually looks really cool. It's the main cast, like they're

481
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,240
all black and like cloud has like cool, like I don't know what they're called, but like cool little

482
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,880
like sunglasses, spiky black hair guy, hair things, like Lil Yachty kind of, not Lil Yachty,

483
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,120
but whatever. Tifa's got like a big like poofy curly hair. She's a black lady, but then Barrett,

484
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,680
like is just a white dude, or he might even be Japanese with like this weird like shaved sides

485
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,360
of his head sort of thing going on. I don't know, I'm gonna find it because it's pretty cool.

486
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,520
But yeah, like that, the whole Tifa thing, they've made a point to not show Tifa at all.

487
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,160
And it's just, it's getting me on the edge of my seat. This is the suspense that they will not

488
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:07,120
have in the actual game is the meta. They've changed it all around. Tifa is Sephiroth now,

489
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,720
and Sephiroth is going to be with you in the party. That's the real hoodwink they're pulling

490
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,720
right now. They better give Sephiroth big boobies. What if you're, what if you're wrong? What if it,

491
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,680
what if they're gonna give Tifa big old titties and it's, and it's fine? Is that, will that be fine?

492
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,720
They're investing in millions. Will you be satisfied, you animals?

493
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
Millions of dollars right now, they're investing into our tip physics to make them be

494
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,040
fucking perfect. That's why they can't show her yet. They're not finished. My main issue

495
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,280
is simply that like, look, look, I played a game that you guys made a million years ago.

496
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,440
You're now, you're like, you're like, I get it, things have to change. All I'm saying is,

497
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,880
you can't expect me to not notice when things are different. Like, I will try to judge fairly and

498
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,360
decide if it's like a positive change, a negative change, a neutral change. But when things change,

499
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,600
my brain will notice. And like, what, am I supposed to apologize for that? I don't give a

500
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,640
shit. It's their problem, not mine. So, so yeah, that's, maybe, maybe like, if it was a company

501
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,600
had more goodwill towards, I suppose the nice thing to do would be like, you know, give them

502
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,960
some leeway, Nate, they, they're like, like, for example, cloud, cloud in the latest trailer

503
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,920
looked significantly more Japanese than he did in the first trailer to me. His eyes looked like

504
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:23,520
more. Yeah, I had the same thought. Like, it's, and frankly, call me a call me a KKK white nationalist

505
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,120
member of the Klan. But like, quote that, quote that, quote that, quote that, put that on the green

506
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,480
screen. It's just that like, okay, that that's taking some getting used to, because like, sure,

507
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
cloud's been in like Advent Children, he looks more Japanese, but like in the original game,

508
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,560
he's just like a Lego guy with like blond hair blue eyes, I don't know. In the original game,

509
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,880
he's from, he's from Nebelheim, which is clearly a European village.

510
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,160
That's true. And like, and there's already an Asian character in the game, Yuffie,

511
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,960
who comes from an actual Asian place. True, that is very true. Yeah.

512
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,880
Um, well, I don't know. I think you're probably right canonically about that. But probably the

513
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,440
audience, right, like the Japanese audience, because he was just a Lego man, probably looked at him

514
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,400
and saw someone like that. Oh, no, no, no, we saw someone like us. I'm sure that's true. And I don't,

515
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,480
I don't blame them at all. I'm just saying as a natural consequence of like having to make this

516
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,520
design more realistic, like now this thing, like I was saying before, like before, there was less

517
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,920
information as to like the specifics of exactly his facial structure and ethnicity, and we could

518
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,600
all project like whatever we wanted now as an as an inevitable consequence of upgrading it to HD.

519
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,080
They like, they basically have to choose a race. And I'm just saying like someone is going to be

520
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,400
like, that's not how I imagined it, no matter what. But I mean, it's just inevitable. I mean,

521
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,280
they didn't choose black, so they fucked up. I mean, when you have a game that was already

522
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,200
multicultural and clearly had people from different regions looking, there were different races from

523
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,720
specific different places already. And cloud clearly was from a tiny little European, like

524
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,800
German fucking, like leader hose in town. I mean, he's blonde. Yeah. And that goes a long way.

525
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,800
He's blonde. Yeah, blonde from the cradle. So do you think the cloud dies his hair? Do you think

526
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,280
he's the kind of guy to dye his hair? And he would have to have at like the age of like nine,

527
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,680
so probably not. Yeah. So I'm, oh, I don't know, gonna go out on a limb here. Yeah, I think Jesse's

528
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:31,520
probably right with the Nibbleheim connection. We got, we got to answer the NQ. Yay, I'm right.

529
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,800
Something's gonna be bad. Woo. I just want to say, though, that there was, there was a little bit

530
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,200
of controversy I saw online. This isn't a big deal or anything, but like some people were saying that

531
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,800
like Barrett sounds too stereotypical in the new trailer. They didn't like his kind of, have they

532
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:53,120
seen Barrett? In the original game, doesn't he literally say he pities the fool?

533
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,160
Okay. In the, he is, his design is 100% a Mr. T based design. This, I think this is confirmed

534
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,800
by the designers. So we all know this. So he's definitely just like a big black guy. Now,

535
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,200
I was actually doing a little research. There's some videos on YouTube and whatnot that are like

536
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,400
breaking down. This is actually specifically about like, if Barrett's like translation to English

537
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,120
was like an accurate representation of like the way he was. And it does seem like they played it

538
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,840
up a bit, not as much as like the video seemed to be implying at the beginning when I actually

539
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,800
watched further. But like he is like a big, you know, a fucking brutish kind of yell allowed

540
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,920
silly man. And he does seem a little more like wise in the, in the Japanese translation or whatever.

541
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,480
But I mean, in either case, I just want to go on record is saying like Barrett Wallace is like

542
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,800
one of the greatest characters of all time. I love him so much. He is so sick. And I said this

543
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,720
in my video, but when you do the first, the opening bombing mission, Barrett's like this piece of

544
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,400
shit asshole, like sure he fights with you. Okay, great. But he's yelling at you the whole time.

545
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,680
He's a big bully. But then you get home and you see Barrett run to Marlene and pick her up and

546
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,360
carry it around for like a train ride or whatever. And you're like, yes, kill Sheenra. They must all

547
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:15,120
burn, protect Marlene. It's like the greatest moment of all time. It's so good. And and like,

548
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,960
I'm sorry, but like Barrett yelling loud and like being I don't know what negatively stereotypically

549
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,640
black. Look, maybe you can make a case for that. I care so little about that compared to what a

550
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,240
great person Barrett is and how much I love him. So I mean, just what am I supposed to be mad about

551
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,960
to anybody who has that concern? I don't know. I don't know.

552
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,680
He's like the greatest. He's the opposite of the stereotypical black guy who bans his children

553
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,360
because this isn't his biological child. He adopted Marlene. He's a very, he's a very complex

554
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,840
character. Like he's morally very complicated. He's an eco terrorist. He kills innocent people

555
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,800
for the greater good. I mean, I mean, and he's also a single father. He has a heart. He's like

556
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,240
he's like a smart guy. Like really, it's shallow to see him as a black caricature when he's very

557
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,760
much I was just going to say it's so again, like I'll give people a chance to get but I did see

558
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,520
a little bit of this. It's so games journalism core to just read some of Barrett's like intro

559
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,320
dialogue and make a judgment on the character based just on that when like you got me and Jesse

560
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:25,200
out here like like nearly in tears just thinking about what a hero Barrett is and what a great

561
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,680
father he is and what a great person he is. It's so weird that like the the idea is that like black

562
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,280
people now aren't allowed to be stereotypically black. I mean like well people people who are

563
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:42,160
stereotypically black do exist. It's a you know and he's not just that he's also that and so much

564
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,120
more but people are going to look at it's the real racist those game journalism tier core

565
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,440
assholes they're going to look at it and go out he's just he's just a he's just a you know

566
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,560
he's a he's a buffer he's a fucking and so they're saying the racist thing you can't call Barrett

567
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,240
a buffer you fucking came through you're the racist. Is that wait I don't know what's a buffer

568
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,160
it's my it's a word that I use and I've never heard anyone else use and I don't know. Is that

569
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,960
that thing about like the people from the other half of Michigan? No I think I'm pretty sure that

570
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:20,800
buffer just means like poor people like dirty lazy poor people and that's how I've used it forever

571
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,640
but I mean what's what's the one I'm thinking of like there's two halves of Michigan and one oh

572
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,640
that's that you're talking you talk about Ubers what Ubers people from the UP yeah yeah Ubers yeah

573
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,640
that's the one that's that's what I was thinking okay okay well hey this this thing about okay like

574
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,240
on a certain level I can understand why people will immediately see Barrett's dialogue and at

575
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,440
least raise questions okay I like I get it but uh like beyond that it reminds me it's like the

576
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,400
same thing with Tifa basically that like okay so yes Tifa canonically Tifa has massive tits uh like

577
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,640
in the cutscenes they're even bigger those may or may not be like quote unquote canon I guess

578
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,120
but we know she has large tits this is established um so like let's just say that she had absolutely

579
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,120
massive tits that were kind of crazy uh like beyond the pale like the CG stuff in ff7 like I'm just

580
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,640
there are women in real life who have those so like it's it's a little bit odd to say

581
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,840
like we can't show those I think um or that we would change it that's like somewhat reasonable

582
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,680
it was like uh with her body type I those wouldn't be natural because that's just not how it goes I mean

583
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,400
that from from what I've heard absolutely women who have oh well okay but can't we can't we at least

584
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,200
agree that there's gotta be some women if you look at Tifa's okay I know I said like crazy tits size

585
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,240
but if we look at her more reasonable tits size like in uh in the original inter like combat model

586
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,040
they're they're big but they're not like crazy big but they definitely stand out and are noteworthy

587
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,840
there are absolutely women I mean millions I'm sure throughout the world who have tits that are

588
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,120
that are that size and look approximately I mean don't don't women who have big tits deserve to be

589
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:09,680
represented as well yeah I mean obviously they're the argument because they're the colonizing people

590
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,280
they're the ones they're the ones who oppress the other minorities on the body it wouldn't just

591
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,560
all go to the tits it just that's not how a body works are you saying that it's impossible that

592
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,200
there's a woman who's skinny with big tits could it never happen I mean I've seen in real life but

593
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,880
do you know if they're real are we are are we saying that Dolly Parton doesn't even matter if they're

594
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,800
really valid as a person the saint that is Dolly Parton listen I don't look at girls with boobs

595
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,040
since you often so I wouldn't know I'm just I'm playing devil's advocate here to major's point

596
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,800
too many just points let's let's think about this let's break this down reasonably I mean

597
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,080
it's probably I'm sure it's it's not impossible that a that a female could look like Tifa and and

598
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,120
well okay I was gonna say and perform like I mean they can't like fucking summon meteors

599
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,960
or whatever like she does with her fists or whatever yeah like summon dolphins get summon

600
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,400
dolphins with like a hand-to-hand combo or whatever but you know be a pugilist right all right but

601
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,280
I don't play devil's advocate here but why does she look like that why I mean it's not it's not

602
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,640
because I mean she looks like that there's an answer and I'll tell you people with I know the

603
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:35,280
answer see mm-hmm uh-huh so it's yeah in the game there's two central female characters

604
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,960
Aris and Tifa and I think the entire point of these two characters is that their personalities

605
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,560
are not how they outwardly appear Tifa looks like a bimbo with big titties and she's very shy

606
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,120
and very insecure whereas Aris looks like a demure like a nice girl next door and she's very outgoing

607
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:00,400
and kind of like hey let's you know touch my butt please sir so like they are the two characters

608
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,680
I think are meant to be a deliberate subversion of like not how they appear at first glance so I

609
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,960
think that is actually the real reason why she looks like that why she has big boobs that's

610
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,760
interesting and I can see that I can appreciate that so I think it's safe to say that there's not

611
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,560
zero reason that everyone looks like it everyone knows that Eryth it's all about that compensated

612
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,920
dating lifestyle yeah you know you guys know what I'm talking about I think I'm understanding you Ben

613
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,360
and I reject this meme because it's hurtful to my feelings about Aris she's selling a flower she's

614
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,320
selling a flower for one deal that's not a sustainable business model that's a dog whistle

615
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,520
that's a dog whistle I didn't read a dojin I read like an article explaining that this is like a thing

616
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:51,040
in in Asian cultures or something I don't know man whatever we meet Aris she's not a prostitute

617
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,000
this is how do you know how do you know I feel like it would come up at some point why would it

618
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,400
come up I don't I guess it might not well the flower thing is honestly the only thing but I mean

619
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,040
maybe you could say it's a strong case to be fair at one point in the game they are all prostitutes

620
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,120
even cloud that's true that's true but I mean I mean she lives she lives in like a fucking

621
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,720
she lives in like the poorest slum in the in midgard she is you know she lives in like a

622
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,640
fucking broken-ass church with a hole in the roof with like no no no she just visits that

623
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,360
wouldn't that mean though Ben that one gill would be would go pretty far in a broken economy like

624
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,440
well look it it's maybe it's sorry I mean doesn't a potion cost like 50 I don't know it's literally

625
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,120
never played you know that's I'm just saying that's the kind of neighborhood that's that's

626
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:48,400
definitely the kind of neighborhood where people would be I mean it's not even prostitution proper

627
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,480
it's like it's like prostitution adjacent yeah okay I will say this it is it's sort of implied

628
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,640
that because eris is etc and she has this connection to the earth that's why like flowers and life

629
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,800
tends to grow around her in places that she frequents yeah where it would normally it's not

630
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,960
flowers don't grow in this crappy city but at her house right she's got a huge garden of flowers

631
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,120
in the church there's a patch where flowers grow because she's there all the time so yeah it is

632
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,000
she is selling the flowers for cheap but she has a lot of flowers so I think it could be sustainable

633
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,720
because flowers just grow around her eris is I believe eris is 21 if I remember correctly 22

634
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,680
22 that's right because she's the one who's older and her cloud's mom says she's a fucking

635
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,320
christmas cake uh unfortunately she's not past the 25th Ben come on she's getting there she's

636
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,600
getting there she's only got three good years left we don't know what eris's mom does uh so maybe

637
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,360
she has a stable income you know as a sheen or employee maybe her mom is the prostitute yeah

638
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,080
she wouldn't live there she had a good gig

639
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,040
well you know a good gig at the honey be in as the milk the rest of the milk I mean I'm sure like

640
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,520
regardless they wouldn't have been able to even imply that in a video game

641
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,040
on the contrary they could only imply it well yeah I mean but like they didn't

642
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,360
well you know like not explicit there's no explicit implication that she could be a prostitute

643
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,600
look I don't think I don't think I'm not saying I'm not here to argue it's canon I'm just saying

644
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,000
you could probably read that into it if you felt like it and you wouldn't be wrong I suppose that's

645
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
fair Nate you did bring up the one thing uh the remake is bad and I want them to change absolutely

646
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,320
nothing and everything they change will upset me but you did bring up like if there's one thing

647
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,760
about final fantasy seven that I would update and change it would be to age up all of the characters

648
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,200
because in hindsight when I was a kid and I read in the instruction manual like clouds 21

649
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,040
that felt like to me oh he's an adult he's a grown-up now that I'm fucking almost 30 I look back and

650
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,720
I'm like 21 year olds are fucking children and I don't care what they're doing I don't care about

651
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,360
their problems because they're idiots they have no brains they have no uh they have no sentience

652
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,920
at all so like if I could change one thing I would just make the characters adults not like

653
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,000
mccloud at least 25 well hey just just for the record for the record yeah go on go on I I feel

654
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,080
that's so hard and I feel like it's like okay stop me if this is weird but I sort of feel like becoming

655
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,640
an old man has made me understand the arguments for like why aren't there more you know people of

656
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,840
color in media because I feel the same way about old people oh yeah absolutely like like the fact

657
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,000
that everyone's a fucking kid in all my Japanese anime is I'm like I can't relate to this shit

658
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,640
where's my relatable protagonist yeah I'm so sick of hearing about teenagers problems and like 20

659
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,080
year olds adventures they're none of them matter get that shit away from me it's it's media not for

660
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,720
us it's like sometimes I watch anime and you're like hello uh I am currently saving the world I'm

661
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,000
finding demons I'm killing people and I'm only 14 years old I'm like well this is why I mean

662
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,880
I mean if I'm if I'm watching if I'm like I can kind of like pretend that someone like I don't

663
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,560
know it sort of doesn't matter how old someone is in a certain sense because like as long as they're

664
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,960
an adult they it depends on the story they might act the same but at the same I like I see someone

665
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,200
doing something and they're like under 20 and I'm like I can't take it's hard for me to take you

666
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,440
seriously I mean there's certain context in which sorry sorry to all the zoomers in my audience

667
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,880
it probably like can you just I'd rather I'd rather the world end I would rather the world

668
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,960
end than be saved by a 20 year old that's understandable the thing is in most anime and

669
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,600
manga and video games uh unless the the graphics are super realistic you can't tell and the only

670
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,520
thing that will make you feel that is the number yeah yeah and so if you don't know the number you

671
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,040
will like the one piece characters are like like in the early 20s when I when I when I think age

672
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,840
is usually young just to attract you know the younger audience but uh it's still meant to be

673
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,360
relatable for the older audience unless you know I guess this has never personally bothered me I've

674
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,840
never really thought about ages is like accurate like they're just they're literally just because

675
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,600
like even if you have like a 16 year old protagonist they're still acting way above their their age

676
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,400
let's not let's not forget that in the old days folks uh like people used to mature a lot faster

677
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,200
than they do now like Alexander the Great was what like 18 when he conquered the world so you know

678
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,200
we've really infantilized ourselves what did you do with your life

679
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,960
when I when I when I read a character when there's a character that I like

680
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,240
conquered the world of warcraft and and then like I I look into it and I find out like oh my god

681
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,560
this person's like 21 I'm like ah shit just like that takes together Ben that's all I actually

682
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,240
what do you mean take something it takes something away from it for me I actually remember the first

683
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,840
time of the age anatomy bothered me I think I think I was like 16 or 17 and and I this is the

684
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:52,160
first time I came across Tokyo Mew Mew and I found out that the main main girl was like 12 years old

685
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,560
I think and I just sort of like what a minute yeah that's a little that's like surprisingly young

686
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,840
for like anyone to do anything I mean the Sailor Moon is like 13 isn't she and I'm just like wait

687
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,280
is she really yeah yeah yeah yeah look we're talking about the wrong side of this equation

688
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,080
right now because we're talking about how like anime is is has all these young people we need to

689
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,240
talk about how real life has all the young people now like there are people on youtube who are

690
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,120
multi-millionaires at like 18 or 19 that's that's the real problem my boy James Charles

691
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:28,320
killing the game right now 19 years old you can you you can fucking have and destroy a career

692
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,640
before you turn 20 you know likes to imitate your art at this point uh what's the I want to study

693
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,800
the life of like I'm gonna shout out uh acro acro station because like I never really think of them

694
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,840
as being young because I get along with them so well yeah and that 10 years younger than I am

695
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,320
they're like almost 16 whoa I had no idea isn't it crazy how the internet has like made it so

696
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,040
like people can like learn how to do things and gain an audience and get clout at like

697
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,080
I said in the old days I think it's really cool and I like the fact that I can like have

698
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,800
like a cool like like friends of all different ages and nobody thinks about it because it's

699
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,200
a crazy idea what if we didn't like shackle like development of a human being to like a rigid

700
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,080
societal structure that's like by this year you'll do this yes by this year you'll how about we

701
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,840
just don't do that that's exactly what the internet should be doing personalized learning

702
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,840
development I mean yeah exactly for sure I guess I mean I have to enjoy all the consequences

703
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,600
the peer the peer pressure of seeing people your age and like middle school accomplishing things

704
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,160
it lets you let you know it's real and it can happen for you and gives you more motivation

705
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,080
it should it should be a contest I mean when I was in like high school I didn't think I could do

706
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,840
anything exactly that was our problem that was our big downfall we didn't have a society that

707
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,040
reinforced that possibility like I dreamed about doing things at 16 but I didn't know it was possible

708
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,880
I think we also we were not necessarily that I wasn't one who grew up from like little childhood

709
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,040
with the internet which gave possibilities because back when I was younger the idea of being an artist

710
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,600
was still like you know easels and paintings the idea that I could be a digital artist like

711
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,680
was never something I could have even considered to become yeah that's that's exactly my point we

712
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,640
just we were all we all the possibility wasn't there so we never even considered it we just played

713
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,120
Final Fantasy 7 got really invested we sure did I think but not me I didn't play it at all I still

714
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,960
haven't yeah I haven't either Tom just sat there staring at the wall doing nothing I don't necessarily

715
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,160
feel like inadequate or like underachieved compared to like other people in my age bracket but like

716
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,320
I often like I genuinely wonder like am I less successful than other people my age or am I like

717
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:52,320
way more successful like I I think I might kind of like I think it depends on the metric like

718
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,600
think of all the people that you've reached with your with your content yeah I mean like

719
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,320
very well loved so yes I'm homeless and yes I'm a youtuber which are both knocks against me I suppose

720
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,600
of course but I mean like I have created a lot of art that is good and that people like a lot of

721
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:13,200
people like so doesn't that make me and like I do have some money not like a lot but like I have

722
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,200
a little bit of money in the bank and I have a car and yeah and I'm not like autistic so I'm

723
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,440
automatically like in the night in like 90% most successful top 1% yeah yeah exactly this is a real

724
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,120
1% or the non-autistic yeah we have to redistribute the autism it's only fair I can't I can't join

725
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:40,560
you there unfortunately I'm like uh I mean I'm I probably make uh I mean I make less money

726
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,600
than like all my friends but like like like all but I think there's a lot of people who would

727
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,800
you know like to do what I do yeah yeah I mean the thing I've always the thing I've always held

728
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,960
on to is that like me and like all of us because we're doing this like online thing where we might

729
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,640
be poor in money but we're rich in time and I think time's way more valuable you know I'm I'm I mean

730
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,800
I'm transitioning to a period where I mean I'm leaving my job in like a month and a half or

731
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,000
whatever and so I will be that's the whole point I'm selling my job I saved up money to get that

732
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,680
precious time to try to work on shit and yeah so it'll be interesting to see if I can manage it

733
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,000
you know that's kind of that's kind of what I did like I don't know I'm not not to the extent

734
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,040
like that you did but like there I did go through I went through a period of like I was I was tutoring

735
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,080
a lot and I and I and I worked a little job and I and I saved up some money so that I could you

736
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,160
know spend a whole bunch of time just working on like this is what this is when I was working on

737
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,720
Vapors one I think I was like now I've got like I've got enough money in the bank that I can make

738
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,160
it through rent for like a while and I did you know and I was like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna

739
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,640
invest this money that I've saved up in you know having the time to work on this thing and kind of

740
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,120
get my sort of art career off the ground with like my first big project and I think that worked out

741
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,360
pretty well not yeah not not it certainly is a appreciated word about that investment uh-huh

742
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,240
yeah I am pretty much hope to do the same but you know on the subject of like raising our kids

743
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,680
you know I think that our when our generation as kids when we have kids here I mean you know I

744
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,520
always wonder like how much does a generation learn like we all think that we're gonna do things

745
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,480
better and different from our parents I'm skeptical as to how much you actually like do in fact do

746
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,400
differently but like if there's one lesson I would like to take away it's that I think that like

747
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,920
the millennials I mean I'm not even making a judgment but they seem like relatively like the

748
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,480
coddled shelter generation in many ways not just you know not like whatever I'm just saying that

749
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,480
like I think with us I hope to and I'm seeing more I'm seeing these guys like um there's this one

750
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,560
guy who's really into like having free range kids and people like raise their free range kids well

751
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,760
well just let set him loose in a field and see what Jonathan height his name is Jonathan height

752
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,680
what does that mean though okay his whole idea is that like okay he's got like a daughter he

753
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,760
lives in New York City in like a very safe place and like his daughter is like I think like wait

754
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,480
did you say that New York City is a very safe place no he lives in a safe place in New York City like

755
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,320
not every neighborhood is bad or good he happens to live in a I mean this is what he says so I'm

756
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,320
taking him at his word sure um and so Jonathan height so like he'll do things like he'll give his

757
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,040
daughter like a $20 bill and say go to the store like it's like three blocks away and so like you

758
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,840
know in New York she'll like go down buy things and come back I mean it's the middle of the day

759
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,400
like statistically these things are very rare to happen and just like by getting your kid to do

760
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,560
this they you know if you do it regularly they get a bunch of life experience they learned like oh

761
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,280
here's life out here this is super important because I think we have this idea that like

762
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,240
children at certain ages are capable of only so much when really it's only because we're only letting

763
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,760
them do that much you know yeah like like back back in the day like 13 year olds were like killing

764
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:56,720
people and fighting in battles they'd be breeding like rabbits is what so I mean I knew how to use

765
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:05,440
an iPad by like h3 or 4 exactly they do that stuff yeah yeah I did navigate like youtube and

766
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,000
and find the videos you wanted to watch children are way more capable than we give them credit for

767
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,800
and if you just like let your kid like get life experiences early he will become a god among his

768
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,680
generation but I mean that's why I'm going to be the best father ever by siring dozens of children

769
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,920
all over the world and raising none of them letting them find their own fucking way to grow up in

770
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,800
whatever country or part of the planet for the number two headband so that they can challenge

771
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,040
you exactly you know just like my my hero the man I aspire to be like in all things uh Ujiro Hanma

772
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,000
from Baki the grappler I only want to be defeated by my son by my strongest son I want him to find

773
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,840
me and kill me yeah yeah yeah you sire the child you make the child you leave a treasure map with

774
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,440
the wife and then you go on your merry way and then like 20 years later um the the the sun's

775
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,320
learned about the map and they go on to to converge on a secret island in the middle of the pacific

776
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,920
where you will be you will be waiting on a throne I will be hosting a mortal combat tournament

777
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,840
to see which to see which of my children can finally kill me

778
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,000
that's so cool I hope that happens hey I distinctly remember like um

779
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,280
the talking about like raising kids just one what one more time uh that my parents or especially

780
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:32,000
my mother was like extremely scared of me going outside um because of I assume I I never really

781
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,440
looked into it but I assume it was just sort of like high-profile kidnappings murders uh that

782
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,720
were in the news that caused people to be like you know keep your kids inside there's dangerous

783
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,760
people around and that was just sort of like permeated through all the parents who were raising

784
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,320
kids at the time social media it's all up in our ears so we're thinking about all the time and yeah

785
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,320
like uh so it was like not a normal thing for me to leave the house on my own so I just never did

786
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,880
I would always go like uh to to the park or whatever when there was a family outing and

787
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,680
then I was like 16 and like I had I felt the need to like ask my parents if it was okay for me to

788
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,720
go for a walk and they they thought I was weird and I was like but but you've raised me like

789
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,000
yeah they raised you that way so I didn't know this was weird I was wait it was weird to go for a

790
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,760
walk or to ask to ask it was weird for me yeah to ask permission to go on a walk I was I was like

791
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,480
I was just like 16 like like I obviously I was a bit too old to be feeling like I'm not allowed

792
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,440
to go out the house it's not like they ever told me I can't go out but I just never felt the urge

793
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,400
to go out because of like um you know this implication that children do not go outside you

794
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,000
and do not go outside it's dangerous you'll die it instantly I mean it's it's like you could be

795
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,600
what if you're the one case in like a million where you get kidnapped and throw into a sex

796
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,040
dungeon gang banged for decades uh you know but like what could happen putting it like that sounds

797
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:09,600
pretty funny I mean I'm sort of sort of similar but not but not at all I guess I have yeah not at

798
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:15,360
all I have it of actually announcing when I'm coming in or leaving the house it was like if I'm

799
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,600
yeah you say uh it's very wait no no it was not before even anime was the thing I would always

800
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:27,520
like announce that I'm leaving or entering just weeb from the womb to die just just to let my parents

801
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,520
know but the thing is I never asked for permission I would just be like I'm going and right yeah like

802
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:40,480
I think from a very young age I never was really supervised when I went outside I was told to like

803
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,200
play in the neighborhood and the neighborhood's kind of big and sometimes I did disobey the rule

804
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,360
and go outside the neighborhood but they would never know because they weren't there to supervise

805
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:59,920
me so I'm somehow alive I mean that's the thing the vast majority of everyone you were almost

806
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,040
kidnapped oh yeah no big deal wait wait wait wait don't just fucking gloss over that yeah what

807
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,840
happened what happened I don't remember too well because I was quite young like six or so and I

808
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,000
was just like I was walking by it was near the neighborhood and I think that it was back when

809
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,120
it used to be like there was this um abandoned store well it was used to be this was before the

810
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:28,000
bomb it used to be it used to be like a pizza place and there were like two adult guys just

811
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,840
like eating pizza god pizza gate and I was walking by and I think I had a balloon in my hand and

812
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:39,680
they were like oh that's a cute balloon I was like yeah and I said hey thanks and it matches my t-shirt

813
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:46,720
and um not that I'm remembering it sounds really terrible what they said next but like my student

814
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,400
had didn't understand and they said like oh you know you're kind of cute yesterday we could never

815
00:54:52,400 --> 00:55:14,800
girl just like you and I'm like okay wait I'm just I'm just curious is it possible this guy was like

816
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,360
was like in a way joking like just trying to like spook you for fun because that's a weird thing to

817
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,800
I don't know I'll never know is this is this when you took your spiked baseball bat and just beat

818
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:32,000
the shit out of this man until he was dead yeah how old how old are you like no more than seven I'd

819
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,880
say okay okay I'm gonna say I'm gonna go out on the limb and say that probably it was just a weird

820
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:50,800
joke yeah like like you know is that so so crazy from like when I came back home I told my mom about

821
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:58,880
it and and she just look I never saw my mom so scared yeah is it so weird from like an old person

822
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,880
that's like oh I'm gonna gobble you up I mean there it's a little more on the nose I mean I had to

823
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,600
translate and just like the way I'm remembering it seems ominous but at that time I didn't understand

824
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:20,480
yeah I get you you walk home with a balloon you say to your mother hey mom what's kidnapping

825
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,160
what does that mean yeah and she like puts down her fucking spat she's like what what happened

826
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,360
tell me everything I kidnapped these guys that they're coming to live in my house now

827
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,720
I'm remembering the source of incredible of my neighborhood boy how am I alive how

828
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,480
I don't know you well clearly you're you're very much an enigma I mean there are the

829
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,520
mage your your lifelong devotion of purple the patron saint of purple has protected you all this

830
00:56:51,520 --> 00:57:00,320
time yeah the the life of your like mad max fucking road warrior apocalypse apocalypse wandering

831
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,680
like bombed out cityscape scavenging for goods and resources have I told you guys about like

832
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,080
that there were like a drug dealers living in my neighborhood apparently I mean I can imagine

833
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,240
not so strange this drug dealers right around the corner for me right now that's not so strange

834
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:21,040
I'm a drug dealer I dare you insult my people like that but like you know they do the shady

835
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,880
scary kind I'm not talking about we sure yeah like not wholesome friendly kinds like I mean I think

836
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,840
you'd probably wielding machetes and shotguns and then jumping out from behind the bushes and

837
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:39,200
going where drugs yeah and there was also not you're kind of cute I got a girl just like you

838
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:47,360
addicted to heroin yesterday in a neighborhood not too far from mine but I never went there

839
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:53,360
because I had no reason to there was a rumor that like there was a kid around my age I guess at least

840
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:59,680
you know I I don't believe this I necessarily because you know kids tend to lie but apparently

841
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,080
there was like this guy something similar to a Lithuanian mafia boss and he had a kid around our

842
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:10,240
age and yeah like you had to and like they were you know he had to pay a nice to this guy or else

843
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,960
you know you know he had in trouble or so or so they say but I really don't think the guy would

844
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,520
hurt like kids that are like seven or eight years old just because they were mean to his

845
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,280
friend no he just had you get kidnapped you know that was that was his plan one of the

846
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,480
quote unquote get kid one of the guys I live with works at like a deli and I mean I just

847
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,040
have his word for this but apparently it's run by someone who is like mafia adjacent like I think

848
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,800
that the deli is on the level like it's not like a crime deli or anything but supposedly the guy who

849
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:49,200
owns it is like a mob guy well it's not a front he just has a legitimate business I haven't heard

850
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,000
anything about it being a front just like the deli he just sells meats and cheese on the side

851
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,320
you know if things go south they gotta have a backup plan yeah exactly you know if the money

852
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,120
dries up in this whole crime thing all right there was there was something I wanted to kind of bring

853
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,400
up to kind of bring it back to what we were talking about with like uh like people having more options

854
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,000
for like being creative and doing it quicker I was wondering do you think that because our generation

855
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,120
was so coddled and we never had to worry about any of that kind of shit because it was all taken care

856
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:27,520
of for us that that's what allowed a lot of this technology to spring up and have it be possible

857
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,200
for like people 10 years younger than us to have all these opportunities like we weren't

858
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,960
worrying about oh you mean like the the digital arms race is was bolstered by the fact that

859
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,080
everybody needed these apps because they couldn't function normally um I mean I guess it's one

860
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,160
possibly the way I was kind of presenting it was just that because we never had to like

861
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,840
sweat the essentials or like figure out how to function because our parents were doing it for us

862
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,480
and like left us to be eternal dreamers and make all these like services that allowed us to kind of

863
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,720
pursue more creative things hard hard to say I definitely think there's something to that I

864
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,040
don't know like because I don't I don't like do you do I don't really see our parents like ever

865
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,840
even coming up with concepts like this even like an analog equivalent you know like that that was

866
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,760
never because like I don't know about you guys but like most of the like like my parents like

867
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,520
they they're always much more grounded and like get a real job get an employment that's more

868
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,880
more rational don't strike out on your own or anything like that uh but like because like

869
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,760
they're so they were so coddling when we growing up like it just left me with all this like time

870
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,640
to think and dream and want to do more than just like do nothing I don't know I feel like it's just

871
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,760
that the like the internet has made it so that like it's it's such a game changer because it's

872
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,600
difficult to have like an analog equivalent for an easy way for somebody to get published and

873
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,000
have everybody see it without going through a publisher like there's no real analog way to do

874
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,600
that on the internet it's completely different so it's it's tough to say man it's because it's

875
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,480
such a different paradigm you know I don't know like that whole that whole super prevalent notion

876
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,360
that like the millennials are a coddle generation like I don't get it I don't relate to it at all

877
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:09,440
I think it's totally bullshit I mean like how can millennials be like the coddle generation and at

878
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,800
the same time be the generation that's totally fucked all the time by everything well they're

879
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:21,360
fucked a particular way I I feel like maybe we were coddled a little bit like we you know we didn't

880
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,840
like go out and like run around in the neighborhood and so but then again we didn't grow up in like

881
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,520
in like a place where there was a lot of shit to do I mean it's a weird generalization to say

882
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,760
that a generation is is coddled or any certain way because I mean like there's poor people and

883
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:41,840
rich people in every generation I think yeah it's it's not like the people are coddled it's that

884
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,600
back in the day there were only so many things people did because there wasn't so much stuff to do

885
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:54,720
with the advent of video games and like taking up like like so great like video games are great

886
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,120
and they've been just like an incredible medium they're just sprang up and now we have those

887
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,960
and they're obviously very distracting and take up a lot of our time and cause us to not go outside

888
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,960
like I don't think it's like that we were coddled but we were distracted by so many

889
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,800
incredible things that we were being made I think I think coddle's not the right way maybe

890
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,200
shielded might be a better word for it well it's not like our parents were doing it because like

891
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,280
like the parents of the people like the older generations are the one who's who are saying

892
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,680
we're coddled because we can't like like you know very generally speaking uh like have less like

893
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,720
we don't use telephones that much we don't like talking on this on the phone but it's not it's

894
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:40,800
not because like napkins we don't go on luxury cruises it's not because we're like scared it's

895
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,640
not like on the whole we're scared of these things it's because we've like there have been

896
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,240
things invented that are better than they're not they're not we're not interested yeah it's because

897
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,160
we're smarter and we're more frugal because we fucking had to be can I just say that I think the

898
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:01,200
idea of a luxury cruise is like the most deplorable thing oh god I almost went on one I was so close

899
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:08,480
to going on a luxury cruise last year because fuck wait how because so the the wrestler Chris Jericho

900
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:14,800
put together his own rock and wrestling rager at sea where like he was gonna okay like okay this was

901
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,320
like a big thing they were gonna be like like famous wrestlers like wrestling matches on the

902
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,640
ship they were gonna be like rock bands like fucking fozzy which is his rock band and probably like

903
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,080
other ones it was just gonna be like a big like a three-day concert slash wrestling event on the

904
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:34,320
ocean and like tickets were like like 1200 for like a good cabin and like I was so fucking close to

905
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,240
getting it and I got talked out of it at the last minute like he's too much money and I'm so angry

906
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,960
that I was talked out of it but luckily he's he's doing another one there's gonna be a rocket ranger

907
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:49,200
at sea too and this time I'm fucking going no matter what nothing will stop me oh you gotta be there

908
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:56,720
dude well that sounds pretty neat there's an exception to every rule as they say it's just like

909
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:02,800
in general the idea is like spend a shit ton of money for like three days where you don't have to

910
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:09,200
like do your own laundry or whatever I don't yeah I guess it's like going to the beach but if you feel

911
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,480
like it the luxury cruise thing I've always felt like you know go like have a nice day at the beach

912
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,080
except you're in a prison ship you can't go home when you are in a fucking prison but there's lots

913
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,080
of activities to do you gotta look in the bright side I don't look in the bright side I don't want

914
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:31,520
to like this thing like I don't want to be tempted by this weird nonsense you gotta you gotta think

915
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,000
of the target demographic if you're like a boomer and like all you do is like worry about your lawn

916
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,480
and shit I'm sure that's a great respite from like spending the weekend like trimming the hedges

917
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,760
or whatever the fuck old people but then you come home and you've got a real long lawn you've got to

918
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,160
do double exactly exactly I guess the fact that you gotta weigh the way the pros and cons like

919
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:53,760
like you literally can't do anything like you can't leave you don't get phone reception probably most

920
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,560
of the time oh man if that's being a boomer sign me up hey man if this is being a boomer chain me to

921
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,280
a wall

922
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:12,000
god can you imagine if I went on a fucking on a wrestling rock and roll cruise and there was

923
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,360
like a titanic situation and that's how I died what a perfect death that's how I want to go out

924
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,840
I want people to say forever whatever happened to endless just oh he died on a rock and roll

925
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,440
wrestling pirate ship well dude remember at the end of titanic when the the the band's just like

926
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,240
gentlemen it's been an absolute honor and they're like just playing as

927
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,360
shit goes down as it's going around the rock and roll band well what I'm what I'm seeing what I'm

928
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:40,800
seeing happening is like snaps the ship in half you got you got lifeboats but there's not enough

929
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,720
so you gotta fucking fight for him you got a lot of people throwing each other over the top of the

930
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:53,440
last man standing it's the one lifeboat everyone's like is like I've been training my whole life

931
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,320
for this and then they flex so hard that they rip through their shirt and like

932
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,400
oh god if you don't think there's any such thing as a glorious death then you haven't fucking been

933
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,560
on the rock and wrestling rager at sea it's like that's that's the selling point it's like come to

934
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:14,480
the rock and wrestling cruise for a glorious death like we will cruise for three days and then we

935
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:20,400
will fucking blow our a hole in our hull and sink you know if my two options on going on a cruise

936
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,680
were to one either emerge a champion who had defeated all my rivals or to die a glorious death

937
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,560
those both sound like great outcomes there's only there's only one lifeboat and that's the prize

938
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,280
the prizes you get to live a champion yeah that's right it's the only prize worth fighting for

939
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,080
it's on international waters so no one can convict you of anything you you do in the process of

940
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:47,120
attaining it is is the whole international waters thing like the same as like uh if the teachers

941
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,760
50 minutes late who are legally allowed to leave is not like the same level of legitimacy or is

942
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:59,360
that actually true i don't know that yeah it's because i think um nobody can i think it's known

943
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:04,960
as international waters is is that um people can you know technically see what you're doing with

944
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,240
murder and stuff but uh you know different countries would argue different things over there so

945
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,480
everyone just agrees that that's we're not gonna bother because nobody has we start arguing over

946
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,640
patches of water it would be like a big a big mess i just i don't i don't buy the movie trope

947
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,800
that like if you sail out far enough and you're technically in international waters you can just

948
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,600
like kill someone i mean i love no one can convict me i believe that on the simpsons on the simpsons

949
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,120
they did that thing were like they couldn't like sell booze until they were in international waters

950
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,320
but selling booze is a far cry from like you know the other shit so that one seems that i totally

951
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,040
believe yeah well yeah jesse can answer the question for us when he sabotages the cruise ship

952
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,360
once they hit international waters we'll see what happens yeah because like of all the cruises

953
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,120
that have gone into international waters i don't know if any that broke into like mass murder

954
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,960
sprees because like law you're legally allowed to kill that guy yeah it's just a gong this is

955
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:03,920
like a gong and a cannon blast happens right now you can kill like everybody gets their daggers

956
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,320
that they've been concealing man i can't wait for this movie adaptation from hollywood to come out

957
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,800
it sounds like a great option just fucking death death ship that'd be great can't wait to watch it

958
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:18,400
i bet that exists gotta rise to be kaiji now that i think about it uh didn't that happen kaiji

959
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,640
well kind yeah kind of i mean they weren't competing to kill each other but the losers ended

960
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,760
up getting sold into basically like human slavery slash like they became like medical testing

961
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:35,440
guinea pigs or some some shit i don't know yikes yikes boy kaiji kaiji's good it's great

962
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:41,920
it's a good program recommended speaking of program speaking of kaiji speaking of anime speaking

963
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:50,080
of animation i was like i animated i animated um a gun girl doing a little jump down and shoot

964
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,240
thing dude yeah it's fucking sick yeah yeah yeah it's really good how long did that take

965
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:03,040
it's for the the thing the the crown prince map uh multi animator project there's so many things

966
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,920
that map stands for now we have to say i can think of a few that are not it's always it's always

967
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:16,640
misanthropony in my heart but yeah it's it was a little thing where half the screen is black

968
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,800
you can choose the left or the right and you just have to have a character do something to the middle

969
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,840
of the screen and then everyone's animations are going to be compiled and this is going to be

970
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,920
they're all going to be interacting with each other in some way it's like a tick tock kind of

971
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,480
thing isn't that what tick tock does you know what the kind of things are okay plot twist i'm

972
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:45,120
going to be part of it too are you ready or how long does it clip five seconds five i think it might

973
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:51,520
be closed oh like the deadline was yesterday yeah i already i already submitted mine nice

974
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:58,720
is it posted anywhere is it a c i haven't posted it yet i uh like no one's posting it so i get i

975
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,360
guess people are keeping it a secret for the most part i'll post mine on my channel as soon as the

976
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,920
actual map is up okay how about you give okay can we get a link to yours at some point it's on

977
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,640
twitter right um i i've posted around i can post it again i just thought we'd put in the show notes

978
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,760
so people can see that'd be cool yeah i i made a tweet where red uh where red man is having one

979
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,400
of his comic moments and dunge girl jumps down and shoots him in the head excellent uh but i i

980
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:32,720
just uh i've been animating a lot of things and that one i feel like is the result of me having

981
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:38,960
been animating for weeks because it's so good and it didn't even take that long it's fucking i mean

982
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,400
the there's like little things about animation that i'm too stupid to be able to quantify in

983
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,400
technical terms but i appreciate with them when i see them and just the way that everything's

984
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:54,000
weighted the way the move the movement feels like it has like some sense of gravity to it and like how

985
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,400
it moves naturally like the timing so there's a little bit of like weight in between each part

986
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,880
of the action so the next one has like the right sense of movement like it's all on point it's

987
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:10,640
fucking great i like i like animation but it's so difficult and like um yeah it's just like i've

988
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,320
been you know like i've been working on that like five seconds animation like i went through i think

989
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:22,960
three or four drafts before i settled on a very simple sort of idea which was basically

990
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,280
just a little blob dude bouncing around and bouncing against the side of the screen and

991
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:35,040
then attacking with with like a water gun not an actual gun you know pokemon water gun thing

992
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,880
sort of thing and i had a lot of fun with the you know bouncing and then bouncing off but like like

993
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:48,080
it bouncing off of the screen was very difficult to do uh ollie you know to give it like um

994
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:56,240
like a big believable weight to it dude that's the hardest part it's super fucking difficult

995
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:00,000
actually speaking of animation i'm putting out a call i tweeted about this earlier but i'm putting

996
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:08,160
out the call on the pcp i found out that if you have a connect for the xbox one whoa and if you

997
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,720
get a you get a pc adapter for it you can use it for motion capture in 3d software and i want

998
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,360
to try it so if anybody bought an xbox one on launch and their connect is just sitting in a

999
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,640
closet somewhere i will pay for the shipping if you want to send it to me for research purposes

1000
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:30,320
so i can motion capture make zumi do cool fucking shit uh that's a cool idea yeah i want it to

1001
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,520
happen it looks right you'll you'll do like a backflip and she'll do a backflip yeah exactly and

1002
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,920
then i'll break my spine and uh and then she'll break her spine it'll be sick they'll be able to

1003
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,840
simultaneously whip and nae nae and it'll all be captured help help commit to my suicide if i send

1004
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,160
you oh yeah yeah yeah you should definitely do that just so you can do the dab and have her

1005
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:56,320
dad oh yeah fun one armed dab it'll be a new a new thing you got to cut off one of your arms to be

1006
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:02,160
able to do it i feel like a one-armed dab would look like something else yeah i don't know i guess

1007
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:07,360
we'll find out when i do it and she'd lose her left arm or right arm uh right arm right okay okay

1008
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:14,000
you dab to the left she's a forced lefty force that southpaw oh that sucks it would still work

1009
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,240
as long as you the arm that you are dabbing with is the one that goes over your face and not the

1010
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,520
other one because then you just that's true making like a dramatic side pose wouldn't have the same

1011
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,640
but but you yeah yeah yeah you she can manage it i'm sure thank god i have to scrap the whole

1012
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,720
character if she can you know what's the point your character can't you can't what's what's even the

1013
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:38,880
point they're useless uh are there characters without arms out there who are just totally worthless

1014
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:46,800
now who's a character without arms uh rin from that fucking from katawa shoujo uh oh shit i guess

1015
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:54,560
that's true um shawnee he doesn't have arms or at least we don't know it's true he don't we have

1016
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,800
never seen his arms he claims that he canonically has no arms okay and uh i think he's probably the

1017
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,080
authority on the matter oh uh paradox crocs only he gets them sometimes as i understand he's got he's

1018
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,720
got yeah when he wants he's got arms whenever he needs them so that doesn't count okay so he's

1019
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,320
got the privilege yep well fuck him he doesn't he doesn't get that uh he doesn't get the like the

1020
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:22,960
government benefits from being harmless well is it trackmaster snake or what's his name trackpad snake

1021
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:28,720
yeah track snake i guess he's just a snake doesn't he doesn't have like does he have like tiny little

1022
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:34,080
arms or i think i think that's in contention i think that's that's uh an ongoing investigation

1023
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:42,080
i i'll wait to see the the official government report on the scandal uh after it breaks all right

1024
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,680
people what else is happening what else do we got we got a burn some more time before we get to the

1025
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:54,320
voice animation just to say that uh you know gun girls cool and uh the bail jpeh thing is in coloring

1026
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:00,160
stages they've finished all the line art do you have an estimated time of completion for this or

1027
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:04,320
is it kind of still out of the air i don't know how long the coloring is going to take obviously it's

1028
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:10,000
taking less time than the line art so it won't be like another three four months how it'll be like

1029
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,560
maybe a week the animation maybe two weeks because like you have the the the animation is like four

1030
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:22,000
minutes oh fuck that's a lot dude yeah it's probably too much it's probably like a big like

1031
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,320
i'm stoked as fuck now i mean it was like it's it's really cool i even had to like cut some of

1032
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:36,000
the things i wanted to do um i know that feel but like um it's a it's a really big project

1033
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:44,320
perhaps too big um it feels like a little bit of uh i worked hard not smart on this one

1034
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,880
but the results are gonna be very good and i'm excited i'm gonna be sick i'm like legit excited

1035
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:58,400
for this yeah it's fucking cool dude how long was your other uh like uh the spider boy and the

1036
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:04,960
the fish at the door those are much shorter is i remember correctly right those uh were like uh

1037
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:12,080
the fish at the door was first half of year two of like half a year so six months that was

1038
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,480
the other one was another six months and then you took your six months to make them

1039
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:23,120
it the the project was six months long yeah okay i think but but both the timelines of those

1040
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,200
animations were both they were much shorter than four minutes right yeah it was like a one minute

1041
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,360
and then a two minute film right and then third year it was a three minute film which took

1042
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:36,320
just going up going up a minute each time right so like doing a four minute animation

1043
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:43,280
obviously takes a while i'm not like but uh i have the luxury of not having to do any of the

1044
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:51,200
preliminary uh you know stuff to like right get my idea present it to the class present it to the

1045
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:56,720
people and then go back and like rework it like i i already had a web comic going i know exactly

1046
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,880
what's gonna happen all i needed to do was like write down what scenes need to happen in this in

1047
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:07,360
this thing and then i'm doing it sick it's fucking awesome coming soon ladies and gentlemen the

1048
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:15,120
finale coming soon speaking of uh speaking of coming soon uh Vapors 3 only has like a couple

1049
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,680
more pages to go oh damn i'm not sure how to how to handle releasing here's the i don't know here's

1050
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:27,760
what i was thinking i was thinking that maybe because like i need some time to like prepare the

1051
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,760
the the Vapors 2 Kickstarter right like that's been a thing i've been planning to do for a while

1052
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,720
but there's like a lot of shit that needs to happen like i need to confront for it i need to

1053
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:43,760
write some like the like side stories for it i need to like get people on board who are willing to

1054
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,560
do them and work that whole thing out i don't know i was thinking that maybe when Vapors 3 is done

1055
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,360
maybe i would do like because i have the the vaporettes from the previous one i was thinking

1056
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:59,360
maybe like every friday like for like three weeks i would release like a new uh like vaporette

1057
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,320
friday vaporette friday vaporette friday and then Vapors 3 comes out and may and that buys me like

1058
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:09,440
a month to like you know build up to making this Kickstarter or whatever because i need yeah i need

1059
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,440
i need time or i don't know i thought maybe that would be like a way to build some hype for it or

1060
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:18,800
something i think that's a good idea yeah yeah yeah i certainly look forward to them i'm looking for

1061
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:24,000
i haven't had much you know uh it's all so ugly is if that's still the overarching brand here maybe

1062
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,120
it's not maybe it's just been st i think it's just been st yeah i've been i've been hungry for content

1063
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:36,160
for for a while yeah i gotta i gotta you know i don't like i don't just want to drop it i feel

1064
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:42,160
like it needs hype it needs it needs a good idea i want to make it an event like it's got to be

1065
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,880
i want to build up to it so i'll probably do that so i don't know in the next like in the next little

1066
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,040
while i'll probably be announcing like there will probably come a day where i'm like hey guys if

1067
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,640
you're listening to this that means today there were there was new like vapors content on stcomics.com

1068
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:02,480
or whatever patreon.com so it's been st um and then i'll i don't know that that that that i'm very

1069
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:08,960
stressed about it honestly finishing a thing is very stressful i feel like now i'm stressed yeah yeah

1070
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,160
yeah well what why what about it worried that you haven't done everything perfectly perhaps or uh

1071
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:23,520
that i'm okay i uh i have i i you know i'm ashamed of everything i've ever made uh this this

1072
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,200
especially i feel that way you know whatever whatever the latest thing is that's the thing

1073
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:33,120
that i'm most like uh how why did i do this yeah i am i'm actually dying to get a new video out so

1074
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,280
that i can push this green screen meme away forever and i can forget that i ever did it look

1075
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:42,400
forward to that yeah yeah yeah so uh ben are you experiencing completion fatigue have you ever

1076
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,400
do you even know what i'm talking about maybe what what does that mean exactly for me completion

1077
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,360
fatigue is when you've worked on the long project for a long time and you're at the end oh and you're

1078
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,840
just like uh i don't even know like i'm barely invest i just want it i just want it done i've

1079
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,520
been staring at this for so long and like yeah your height to get it out is matched by your fatigue

1080
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,760
of even looking at it at the same time yeah definitely like yeah definitely it's like

1081
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,920
finishing the azumi demo was hardcore completion fatigue i just like i should be a more excited

1082
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,480
because it's like oh this thing i've worked on so long like it's almost done it's almost time to

1083
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:23,360
put it out there and you know reap all the sweet sweet accolades exactly it's it's time to do

1084
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,000
the thing it's time for the moment that this is all been that i've been working in service of

1085
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,840
this has all been leading up to but actually i'm just it's dread it's like oh god it's almost

1086
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,120
it's almost done that means that means i'm gonna have to actually show it and and like oh god no

1087
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:44,000
now that i'm staring down the barrel of that and i'm like oh maybe this was all a mistake

1088
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,720
and this was definitely all a mistake i'm shut shut it all off shut it all down the the pressure

1089
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:56,720
of the temptation talking about a project so that this is why it's so nice to have zero

1090
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:01,920
hype for something and then to drop it so it can be pure pure positivity and anyone who

1091
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,160
criticized like well i do you fuck you man i mean i it's free and i just released it to everybody

1092
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:10,880
so what do you complain about you can you can fall back into that i guess but as soon as there's

1093
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:17,920
stakes narrative stakes for one's own life and and hype builds and whatnot oh it's scary oh it's

1094
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,400
spooky i don't like that one but when you pull it off the rewards are worth it because you deliver

1095
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:28,160
on hype and it makes it even bigger that's rare but yes yes i don't know why i don't feel

1096
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:33,520
completion fatigue for this because bail jpeg i said it would be finished like at the end of 2018

1097
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,360
and it's been going on for for a long time but i don't feel like it was like my fault in terms of

1098
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:45,440
like i'm not working hard enough i've been working like constantly all the time so it's like it's just

1099
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,440
a matter of time until it's finished and it's not like i'm staring at anything or a blank canvas

1100
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,240
and like i don't know what to do here because i planned it out i guess i think that's the benefit

1101
01:21:54,240 --> 01:22:00,640
of like doing a release cycle for bail jpeg like you're doing uh because you you do a page or whatever

1102
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:05,200
and then you release it because like it's different when like if you were doing bail jpeg where all of

1103
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,960
it was done up to this point but none of it was released and so you just been sitting on at this

1104
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,040
entire time i feel like that's a different kind of psychological pressure where you have this

1105
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,920
huge backlog and nobody knows about it's you've been toiling away without any context if it's good

1106
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,400
this animation is kind of like yeah because it's a lot of stuff that people haven't been

1107
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:27,040
seeing yeah so when you're in the last like 15 seconds of the animation maybe you'll have some

1108
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,880
completion fatigue or maybe you won't maybe you'll be you'll be free of the curse in which

1109
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:37,520
case i envy you deeply because i i i really don't know why i don't feel like that i i like i'm just

1110
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:44,240
like curious like is there is there like an element of like you don't know what comes next in in the

1111
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:48,400
work that you're doing and you're trying to think about it or is it just like you know exactly what

1112
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,960
you're doing and it's just doing it that's difficult wait you're you're talking about well how long

1113
01:22:52,960 --> 01:23:00,480
have you been working on this thing uh months okay then then yeah you should be getting it i would

1114
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:06,160
be getting it i i find like the like the longer i work on something the more like the more depressed

1115
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:13,040
i get because about it and in and in general because it's like oh i've spent a now i've invested

1116
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,400
all this time uh like okay it doesn't even matter how successful it is or how much people like it

1117
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,680
because like it still would have been better to have done the same thing faster so the longer

1118
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:29,680
you take doing it the more it's like well you know the end product will be what it's gonna be but i

1119
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:36,480
i've wasted more time i feel i feel like i feel like that's a losing mindset oh absolutely yeah

1120
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:42,320
no i i would not say completion fatigue is good in any way it's a big losing mindset

1121
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,800
absolutely uh needs to be overcome so if you just naturally don't have it you've ascended

1122
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:54,400
to a higher plane and uh i'm jealous yeah but it's but it's like okay with vapors um like a page of

1123
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:00,560
vapors it'll vary but i would say that a page generally takes no less than four but no more

1124
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:06,000
than 12 uh hours like 12 would be pretty rare like you should probably somewhere between like

1125
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,840
six to eight would probably be the average um and that and that's long and that's long enough

1126
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:20,080
that by the end of it i'm like uh and and and the longer it goes on and the longer it goes on the

1127
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:25,760
less i want to keep working on it and and the harder it is to like make myself you know push

1128
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:34,080
push to the end and uh so that's like i think with bescapades i didn't get that because a

1129
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:40,720
panel of bescapades was done in you know five minutes sometimes maybe 10 or 15 maybe half an

1130
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:48,720
hour like a gif might take a couple hours to work on but like uh like i feel like working on

1131
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,600
something there's like a sweet spot where like the the best things and the the most satisfying

1132
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,480
things and the best work generally happens when you have a project and you like however long it

1133
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:04,320
takes it's it's it's under that threshold where past which you start to be like uh because like

1134
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:09,840
as soon as it takes long enough that that fatigue starts to set in the temptation is like i don't

1135
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,520
want to look at this anymore i don't want to look at it and that just makes it take longer if you if

1136
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:21,280
you give into that i i suppose there's there's an element of like uh going a little beyond your

1137
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:29,200
own skill level like nothing i draw anymore is attempting to be better than what i can draw

1138
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,160
like i used to think ah it's got to be perfect and then i would never do it right and now i'm just

1139
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:40,960
you know it's more loose and more you know just whatever um but it but it still works because

1140
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:48,160
that that like positive vibes whatever is allowing me to work longer and harder without getting

1141
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:53,440
sort of dissatisfied with what i'm doing i think i think you've figured out a method

1142
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:58,880
a good method here and i we could all learn from it to just not i mean i don't know i don't know

1143
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:05,760
what's so much pressure on any method is like subject to like a personal like you know differences

1144
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:12,320
i don't know like whether anything i could say as advice would work with ben uh probably not it's

1145
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,840
it's just it's just pathological for me yeah i'm just i'm just broken um okay yeah well

1146
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,920
i still have hope that maybe one day i can overcome my innate stupidity but you know

1147
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,480
it gets worse with every passing day i think that the the the less uh i care about the quality of

1148
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:38,560
my drawings the better i feel about them well yeah yeah i know what you mean because what would you get

1149
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,560
what would you get what's there to bum you out if you don't give a shit you know i'm not on that

1150
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:48,480
it's not that i don't give a shit it's just that i care less about uh i give less overshad

1151
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,200
like i i understand that i'm not the best artist in the world therefore i can draw

1152
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,120
like once once i managed to draw a background it's a pretty crappy background but because

1153
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:03,840
i included the background it gave my drawing the atmosphere and i just i still love that drawing

1154
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,240
i showed it to you guys because i was just so proud of my my boy right just sitting there and

1155
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:15,440
there's like a city behind him and that's like the the crappiest fucking city just like ms paint

1156
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:23,440
sort of a quality city well like well like um but it works i just some some something something

1157
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:31,040
that i definitely improved at in my craft is uh not putting in too much detail on backgrounds like

1158
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,520
if something's in the background you can make it it can kind of look like crap like not like crap

1159
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,720
but it can be very simple you don't have to really sweat the details and if and if you've

1160
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,880
composed your panel right or your image right it fades into the background and you don't have to

1161
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,600
think about it too much a trap i think i've mentioned this before but i used to fall into a trap of

1162
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,360
like spending way too long on like way too many details of the background of like a tiny panel

1163
01:27:55,360 --> 01:28:01,600
that like you can't even see them and i still do that sometimes but uh it's something i've overcome

1164
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:08,000
i do it a lot less smart yeah i'm a lot more efficient now didn't you post like an image of

1165
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,800
you drawing like a really extravagant white picket fence like all the way across the background

1166
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,840
like kind of recently yeah there were a couple vapors panels that had a lot of a lot of a lot of

1167
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,720
my car and in the driveway yeah yeah trees and buildings and like houses and a car in the background

1168
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:30,880
and a long white picket fence and clouds and stuff i mean it looks really good thank you but i can

1169
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:37,440
imagine that took a long time i didn't like it the only thing i like drawing are uh people

1170
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:45,520
faces uh and and like explosions and energy like beams um things things that are moving things that

1171
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,400
are like emoting uh are the only thing that's interesting trees and buildings they're boring

1172
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:55,280
i hate them i wouldn't draw them ever if i could get away with it but i gotta set the scene like

1173
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:00,880
and yet i spent i spend so much of the time like wait like i can draw a face i can draw like a like

1174
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:07,600
a like maybe like a chest up face making a making an expression and maybe a hand i can draw that in

1175
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,960
like minutes but then like if i have if i have to like draw the room behind them the trees in the

1176
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:19,680
sky and stuff that's like that's that's like the real labor both literally and emotionally

1177
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:27,280
i just can't the backgrounds they're just like i hate how bad they look and so empty i'm just

1178
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:34,400
miserable with those kind of comic pages it you can you can like minimalism is so powerful and

1179
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:40,320
you can go it goes a long way and it's i yeah i mean i also don't like backgrounds but i feel like

1180
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:45,600
i mean look at the gun girl thing i posted uh the reason there's just like a groovy background

1181
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,880
is because i considered drawing like the floor and i drew a line i was like i don't want to do

1182
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:56,800
that so i didn't even draw a floor i didn't draw anything it looks great the color palette of

1183
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:02,800
this background reminds me of my favorite scene in any cartoon which is the part in cult cartoon

1184
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:09,360
all stars to the rescue where the kid falls down into the sewers and is chastised by michael angelo

1185
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:14,720
or rafael or whatever the fuck one of the the ninja turtles about how doing drugs is bad and

1186
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:20,800
the sewer sludge is like vibrant like yellow and pink for some reason he's living in like neon like

1187
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,560
cheese is like what the sewer looks like and uh it's my favorite it's just my favorite thing

1188
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:32,160
and that's what this looks like you ever feel like when it comes to all this all this kind of

1189
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:37,040
we're talking about compromising and and you know finding ways to get around stuff i always feel like

1190
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:44,080
such a piece of shit uh just in general when i when i concede to like okay yes the reality is

1191
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:50,960
i cannot spend all my life on this one panel making it perfect i'm always like if life was

1192
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:56,320
perfect if i had the time i would make this one thing like as amazing as it possibly i i dedicate

1193
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:02,160
you know 10 000 years to honing the craft of doing this one task that i'm now going to instead

1194
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:07,680
spend like two seconds and kind of just bullshit because you know i need to get by i feel i feel

1195
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:14,400
the opposite yeah honestly when i when i find a corner that i can cut that doesn't like negative

1196
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:19,840
right like when i when i when i draw a background quickly right and i don't put in a ton of detail

1197
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:25,280
but it still looks okay i feel like i have found a shortcut i feel like i found a corner that i can

1198
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,840
safely cut and i'm like yes i've shaved a little more off like i should do more of that like i need

1199
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,400
to cut yeah i need to cut as many corners as possible every time i find one it's like a victory

1200
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,120
time savers that don't that don't hurt quality are great because like you have you have a purpose

1201
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:44,000
for the work and if you can find ways to deliver the work faster that doesn't sacrifice the purpose

1202
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:52,880
then like you're working better absolutely i want to be man so a new episode of monben got released

1203
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,840
or got translated you guys know monben i've talked about this right yeah i kind of forget for the

1204
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:04,720
for the viewers and for nate i guess yeah and me it's it's or mage it's so good mage you should

1205
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:11,680
watch it it is a show where this oh god i god i always forget his name but there's this manga guy

1206
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:16,400
he's like a pretty famous manga guy i've heard him compared to like the steven king of manga okay he's

1207
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:22,080
very like you know he sort of he sort of makes manga for like the the the working the working

1208
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:27,200
man's like he just writes you just fucking churns them out and they're just very kind of middle

1209
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:34,080
of the road like yeah anyone can appreciate this kind of manga guy he's successful he he puts he'll

1210
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:40,000
he'll contact some other manga man or women there's a couple episodes about women um and he'll put a

1211
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,200
camera in their studio and just film their studio for a week and then they'll cut down the footage

1212
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,280
and he will meet with the person and they will watch the footage of them working and just like

1213
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:55,040
comment on it and just talk about their process and talk about their workflow and and their techniques

1214
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:01,120
and all that stuff it is so good there's some some guy has uploaded like every episode that's been

1215
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:06,160
translated to daily motion there is um i think there's like seven or eight that are translated

1216
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,760
there's more like there's more than aren't translated and i'm so mad i hope that in the description he

1217
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,240
says like if you want to help me translate this contact me here i hope that people contact him

1218
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:20,080
and help him translate because i want this i want all this shit this is i'm here for it

1219
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,360
but um wait what why did i even why did i start talking about that where how did they get on

1220
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:33,920
to mount monben oh i was just gonna say watching that like i just i just want to be like one of

1221
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,200
these guys i want to be like one of these guys who puts out like a fucking chapter a week that's

1222
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:45,200
like a dream and like i know that they i know that i can do it right because i i could be like them

1223
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:49,680
because i don't think that people are that different right like i i think that it's not

1224
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,920
some inherent difference between them and me i could be doing what they're doing and i think

1225
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:59,680
it comes down to like a combination of one they've got the discipline you know they work at it

1226
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,160
like a real job they work like eight hours a day they show up to their office and they also the fact

1227
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,960
that they have an office they have like a a specific space for working that they go to and while

1228
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:15,840
they're there they work yeah yeah i don't have that that's a problem um there is and and and also

1229
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,320
like their workflow pipeline like you know a bunch some of these guys have assistance and obviously

1230
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,840
they can churn out more and pass it off their assistance to finish up obviously they're gonna

1231
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,960
be more efficient at getting stuff out um but not all of them like some of them are are solo

1232
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,440
yeah and and yet they still and and they just you know they have a they have efficient they

1233
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:39,520
have made their workflow pipeline as efficient as possible and i want that i want to be a content

1234
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:45,280
machine oh don't y'all i think yeah i very much agree and yeah you get just kind of find ways to

1235
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,920
achieve that like like the office thing one of my main things is currently i have like um you know

1236
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,080
in my in my apartment we've got like a bedroom and then i have a separate office this is one of the

1237
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:59,760
main things i wanted moving from the last place where we lived i live in such a tiny place my my

1238
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:04,240
office was the bedroom and i'd be working so often while like michelle was trying to sleep

1239
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:09,680
and recording shit and we we worked out a system but now i have an office i go to and that one

1240
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,240
change i mean it the promise it's also like i mean it's where everything is like my video games

1241
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:19,600
my computer my work stuff it's all the same place i hope to divide that up but already i have a space

1242
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,680
where like now i have rooms where i can set up a green screen and like record a bunch of bullshit

1243
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:28,640
um and do all kinds of good stuff so yeah i mean i'm just saying that i totally agree having those

1244
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:34,560
kinds of things to facilitate the the expediency of work as well as to shift into the mindset

1245
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:40,400
is something i definitely aspire to and one day i straight up one i want an office that i drive to

1246
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:45,280
every morning where i film things where i record things and then at like i don't know whenever

1247
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,440
i feel like it's late at night then i come home and i i'm not doing it anymore and so it's like

1248
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:55,840
switched off yeah this is the goal for me i i do you guys remember like uh kc nice that's 368

1249
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:01,120
program yeah we just bought this really big place i was gonna do all this stuff i have no idea what this

1250
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:08,240
is it's like a series of vlogs like he bought a huge place in new york um where any like he

1251
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:13,840
documented the the construction and stuff he fitted it with a kitchen and like a studio space

1252
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:21,680
downstairs where you could record things and um it sucked all the content that he made in that place

1253
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,720
it's just like boring stupid shit and i feel like it's such a waste of kc nice that having that did

1254
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:31,120
that project like fold is he still doing that i i don't know i've i've unsubscribed because

1255
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:34,880
every vlog is exactly the same thing and you know i mean he's fine to a degree that's nice

1256
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:42,080
that for you yeah uh it's like the there was like this news show that uh he he had like

1257
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,800
with v-source three i didn't watch any of those i didn't watch any of the actual 368 content just

1258
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:54,320
his vlog yeah because it was really really like um tone deaf like it didn't know it didn't know how

1259
01:36:54,320 --> 01:37:00,400
to get an audience for somehow it was just like really it was exactly what you would expect from

1260
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:05,680
a like a vlogger in terms of aesthetic yeah doing a new show right but it was really boring and it

1261
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:10,400
was still just a new show it's just like you know there's nothing interesting there and i feel like

1262
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:17,520
that is exactly what i would like like a pcp hq is like yeah that idea of a space where you can

1263
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,160
just go downstairs and there's like you know it's it's quiet you can record there's a big space to

1264
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:27,920
put things up yep but they just did a really bad job of it it sounds to me like those guys they

1265
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:33,040
led with like the they should just give it to us is what i'm saying yeah we can supply the soul

1266
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:38,560
they can supply the tech and the money and the space we've got project 368 more like project pcp

1267
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,480
indeed it's happening we're making the change

1268
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,240
episode 368 of the pcp when we take over should i uh should i acknowledge what did

1269
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:52,480
you just said in the chat here what did he say uh do you want to talk he said it might be possible

1270
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:57,120
to do rad con at my house we definitely have enough space in a way more usable space than the last

1271
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:01,360
oh well that's certainly interesting i mean that is yes he should give us the house log so we can

1272
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:06,000
see have we yeah has he has he done like a tour of you know i think did you was saying that he

1273
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,640
doesn't want to he wants to reveal it piecemeal to like the rest of the world uh but but i think

1274
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:14,880
perhaps for us for for these kind of technical purposes he might be willing to uh to break it

1275
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:21,600
down yeah uh rad con right um munchy and i munchy more than me because he's already going to

1276
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:27,920
brony con tom you're also already going to brony con yes um and i've been like humming and and

1277
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:34,400
humming and whoring about like the idea of doing a rad con either before or immediately after uh

1278
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:40,800
brony con 2019 in august the very last brony con ever indeed where we can like like get the gang

1279
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:45,920
back together and all like fuck around and be like stupid idiots and laugh at you know everyone

1280
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:51,760
it's such a beauty it's such a beautiful idea it is it really is i love it so much i i i am not

1281
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,120
committed but i'm very much like the idea it has to be real i'm hoping i i've i've basically 100

1282
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:01,040
percent verbally committed i haven't like bought it i haven't like bought a ticket or anything

1283
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:08,800
already i'm committed to make it so just what a shocker mage call me come i can't make it during

1284
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:15,760
the summer that's like a known fact it's just just it's because you're with your grandma right like

1285
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:21,280
90 percent of the year is gonna get a ticket for her but bring grandma no i can't that'll be a

1286
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:27,520
stretch goal for the case we just need to do the house alone european vacation oh that's true

1287
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,920
that's what we really need to see to find that guy that you you talked to when you were seven have

1288
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,960
them kidnap you bring them i'm bringing you to bring that well we'll just we'll just put just put

1289
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:43,600
her in a big hamster hole she'll be fine i mean that's fine yeah you guys come in and mean the

1290
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:50,720
thingy when are we gonna do pcp hq walley world uh and then we go to las vegas and then we do the

1291
01:39:50,720 --> 01:40:00,640
european vacation yeah yeah europe you're a pc that's good that's good more like europe pc

1292
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:10,800
shit anyway if i can the brony con radcon idea is really cool um but the reason i i've been

1293
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,200
like not so sure about it before yeah was because not so many people were interested

1294
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,360
it seemed like digi was completely hardline against it digi was hardline against it i'm

1295
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:25,760
very enthusiastic that that he's maybe stone has warmed somewhat warm yeah because now now he lives

1296
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:31,280
in virginia beach again which is is not so far away just to throw out the facts there i i bet it

1297
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:36,080
would be possible now that he's thrown that out there perhaps the radcon could in fact be centered

1298
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:42,160
at digi's place or uh or or you know we can all be upset well okay you know what never mind all

1299
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:48,000
right fair enough fair enough so we could have the radcon digi's place right you know have a

1300
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,160
good old time there and then go to brony con and then you know get brony drunk sing brony songs

1301
01:40:54,160 --> 01:41:04,960
and dance in the street uh do you know we'll do we'll do that all day and then you know uh it

1302
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,520
will be drink incredibly epic drink some hard cider you know i mean definitely if we go to

1303
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,520
brony con this time i'm going to get drunk because the last time i didn't i didn't get drunk it's

1342
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:44,240
be amazing they just like they're just keeping it totally under wraps everyone loses their

1343

shit we fear i'll pray god has abandoned them yeah a relatable feeling well i mean i feel like

1344
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:57,040
it's time to move on the last one should we uh there's actually like there's like there's like

1345
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:02,000
one more thing i wanted to mention quickly yeah before before we wrap up um i just wanted to say

1346
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:09,760
that uh i posted a zoomie game the demo on new grounds last week yeah i saw this the reception

1347
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:14,560
was fucking way better than i was anticipating oh great uh it got front-paged and featured

1348
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:21,280
whoa hey so that is so cool dude oh yeah oh yeah i remember seeing that tweet it was like oh holy

1349
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:27,040
shit you did it yeah like it's the demo tom folk follows me on new grounds now i guess uh so that's

1350
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:32,880
cool so yeah that would it went over really well people seem to be digging it so i will be making

1351
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:39,360
a full game uh working on it right now and nice yeah so that's kind of why i want the uh i want

1352
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:44,000
that fucking connect to do more cutscenes and stuff with like shit it'll be send him it's

1353
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,560
shit people you're not using that connect that makes me wonder if um maybe i should go maybe i

1354
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,800
should i never considered posting on new grounds but maybe i should go back and like post that

1355
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:58,880
like champion i think you should i think it would do really well it's a good idea it's a good idea

1356
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:03,200
like i posted i posted the game first on itch it has like seven reviews and i thought that was

1357
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:07,600
seven ratings and a couple comments i thought that was pretty good i posted mine's the same it's on itch

1358
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:13,040
it's got like a couple of i posted it on new grounds with no fanfare yeah it's currently has

1359
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:20,160
seven hundred like seven seventy favorites like 450 ratings uh not bad i got like four thousand views

1360
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,480
and like it's like front page and featured right now it's like on the games of the month page on the

1361
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,760
game thing that is so i saw i saw you said like as someone who was on new grounds a lot as a kid

1362
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,720
it was really meaningful and i'm like i guess so yeah i would kill the same way maybe i could

1363
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:41,360
do you think uh snakes run away from snakes yes absolutely like some of the games on there are

1364
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,760
like not great so like you guys are already way above the bar like because like people dump like

1365
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,960
you know my first game and stuff on there which i guess is essentially what i did as well but

1366
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,640
like speak speaking of like a weird experience i forgot that i totally forgot this i never

1378
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,280

1404
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:44,080
oh no you're right i just realized what yeah rock bro gulp okay uh next one i guess now i get it

1405
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:51,680
that's really funny we better distance ourselves from that we better go off twitter for a while

1406
01:50:53,120 --> 01:51:00,880
okay this next one is uh bonus episodes what happens follow up question okay go okay i have

1407
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:05,040
another follow up question till last week i was going to ask about what happens when you buy the

1408
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:10,160
patreon like the bonus episodes and you told me those youtube links and that's very good i like that

1409
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:15,920
but um can i just pay once because like you know i pay for it and it's five dollars and then i get

1410
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:21,840
the links to all the videos presumably and then could i just immediately sign off like once i give

1411
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,800
you five dollars i never have to pay you again or do i have to keep paying to keep you having the

1412
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:35,520
episodes because uh i'd like to only spend five dollars and i'll give you a bunch of money

1413
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:41,200
but now i don't know relax i feel like good money situation so could i do that right i feel like

1414
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:47,120
this is like you don't boring question boring answer you just don't tell people you're doing

1415
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:53,040
that what the fuck the the answer is you subs you you you pledge once and you will automatically

1416
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:57,920
it'll automatically it's a subscription service you will have you will then have access to all of

1417
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:04,800
the previous ones yep if you unsub then you will no longer be subbed and you won't get access to

1418
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:10,320
the new ones the thing is i indeed i think what he's asking is like can you hold on to the links

1419
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:15,520
i mean uh for later well this our big problem right now from what i understand is that we

1420
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,600
have them in a playlist so if you have the playlist link you can just unsub and keep using the playlist

1421
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:26,160
don't say the unspoken rules stop no here's here's here's the thing though i mean yeah absolutely

1422
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:32,880
the the thing with it is like um every month uh it becomes a better deal because you're getting

1423
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:37,760
more more stuff yeah absolutely five dollars absolutely and if you spend five dollars to

1424
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:43,280
listen to a bunch of bonus episodes every month there will be a new one so if you unsub if you

1425
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,800
aren't pledge you'll have to re pledge again if you want to listen to the new one i mean what we

1426
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,880
should do is we just shouldn't we should put we shouldn't put the new episode in the playlist

1427
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:57,360
until the next month well you can never get the new one you like the new one i i have long suspected

1428
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:01,360
there's there's a few people that when the when the new episodes come out i see people come out

1429
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:05,840
the word and say nay why won't you add it to the playlist and i'm like why do these guys

1430
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:12,400
want in the playlist so bad hmm big think i'm pulling a big think right now well here's here's

1431
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:16,000
a okay here's a thought then again the people saying that are in the bonus lounge which you

1432
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:22,400
can only get into if you're currently pledging so maybe i'm just crazy could we maybe could we maybe

1433
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:29,040
like refresh the url or something for the playlist every month hmm uh you know i don't know if it

1434
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:33,600
works that way but make a new playlist every month you could you could make a new playlist

1435
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:41,920
theoretically i suppose i mean yeah i know sure but yikes i mean yeah yeah that's uh i mean what

1436
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:46,240
yeah there's really no way to do it because like i was i was gonna say we could use like a bitly

1437
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,400
link and kill it and change it every month but like it the as long as you get the you can get the

1438
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:55,360
link yeah yeah you would still refer to the the main the playlist really is the achilles heel of

1439
01:53:55,360 --> 01:54:00,240
this entire business model like we have to get kind of but you know it's so convenient for people

1440
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,400
and i hate to take away that kind of convenience i i just hope that people i mean this is really

1441
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:09,440
people are pledging for to support the show i i think so hopefully most people yeah i mean there

1442
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:13,840
is a bit of an honor system involved but like yeah in addition to getting the bonus and you know

1443
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,320
what and the reason i've never been too concerned is because i do just pay a general attention to

1444
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:24,080
the total views of each bonus episode and frankly they're lower than like our number of patron of

1445
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:28,160
of like bonus episode patrons so i'm like all right like this isn't getting out of control this

1446
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:32,480
seems pretty pretty in hand if there was like thousands of views i'd be like well okay this is

1447
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:36,480
it's nice that people are interested but this is spreading a bit beyond you know what i would

1448
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:43,200
like it to be um i mean it might not be a terrible idea to once in a while you know maybe maybe

1449
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:47,920
refresh the playlist or if you can't do that just sort of copy it and make a new one and have a new

1450
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,000
link just so like maybe someone who paid five dollars like or if you just if you just have a

1451
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,800
years ago isn't like you know still just co i mean i know people are gonna get the link if they're

1452
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:01,040
dedicated and they want it and that's fine and i don't really blame him for it yeah i mean another

1453
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:05,600
option is to have like a master post man patreon so the playlist is there if you're not a patron you

1454
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:10,480
can't click it in that's not boring look if you have the opportunity if you have the opportunity to

1455
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:15,040
steal something and get away with it do it take it i don't care anti business i don't care if i'm

1456
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:22,240
shooting ourselves in the foot always steal always pirate always steal end of story i say i

1457
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,720
understand closing my rules are different when it's my wallet being affected jesse yeah that's

1458
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:32,640
the difference like i said i don't i don't blame anyone for uh for for doing that i really think

1459
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,160
most people do it out of good will they want to support i i think so too but you know we shouldn't

1460
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:41,760
make it like so we shouldn't make it like so easy right we wanted to be inviting it right all right

1461
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:47,040
i i couldn't agree more i couldn't agree more and you know you know just of interest sam harris um

1462
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,360
for his for his like membership program or whatever for like his podcast he does like extra stuff

1463
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:56,320
beyond the scenes like it um uh oh no he has like an app or whatever that costs a little money the

1464
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,760
interesting thing about him i might have talked about this before but it's just that like he

1465
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:05,040
says straight up like yo here's the deal the app costs like five dollars like i think like forever

1466
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,960
or something or like ten bucks forever or no i think it is monthly whatever but he says like

1467
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:14,960
okay just so you know anyone who wants this app all you need to do email this email address and

1468
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:20,800
just say hey i can't afford this right now we will give you like the month for we will just give you

1469
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:26,080
whoever you are message us on this email you get it for free the thing is though you have to also

1470
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:30,560
message us next month for it to say that i still can't afford please give it to me so there's a

1471
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:35,280
little bit of work involved in doing this it's not a get out of jail completely free but if you're

1472
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:40,000
if you're poor couldn't there's nothing easier than just sending an email so you that really seems

1473
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,560
like a smart business model to me you're giving people what they need but that seems like a small

1474
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:50,080
business model except for the work involved in like going through well the thing is he's got a team

1475
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:55,200
so for him it makes sense but for us yeah yeah yeah we're a little bit too small of an operation

1476
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:02,240
for that i'd say um well okay that was a that was a juicy one yeah let's go on right this next one

1477
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:09,520
is i think uh by the the the grandmaster of the teen cp the first guy who who came up with the term

1478
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,400
now this is a play he's getting more popular than the we have to destroy the cannibalizing our

1479
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:21,760
audience uh it says apply to the teen cp or i'll have to fuck you in the ass uh go auditions are open

1480
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:27,040
for the remaining slots of the teen cp and i wanted to get the message across the teen cp

1481
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:31,760
it's better than any other shit so i thought that i'd say it in the only language on the

1482
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:38,800
hands of thoughts can understand flames of fucking hell in a rap form oh my god i may be

1483
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,680
former baby that's the more than all the good vids you may combine there's that shame lately i

1484
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:48,560
haven't been laughing at any of this shit i blame all you boomers but munchy all the rest of you

1485
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:53,440

1486
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:58,640
risk got on a scrunchie honey yeah i'm trying to line up try to zoom me because tom's the only one

1496
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:58,640

1497
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:02,800
didn't have time he's gonna leave he's leaving me for the squeakle that was like a that was like

1498
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:10,480
an early justin beaver video i think the idea of this track that was really cute i just i really

1499
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:16,640
wish i could understand i yeah our boys need a little bit better mark i got a lot of it yeah i

1500
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:21,760
got most of it i got most of it i think i just said hippo does this man have a name well i'm just

1501
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:26,880
saying does this man know what his name is yeah he has his name i was ten cp your name is teen cp as

1502
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:36,640
far as i'm concerned you're the embodiment that's you mr. teen cp that's you uh well sick uh i'm pretty

1503
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:42,960
pretty happy uh can't can't wait for the squeakle i don't feel thoroughly devastated enough i need

1504
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:47,920
more i say he's cannibalizing our audience and he's roasting us at the same time maybe this is the

1505
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:56,320
true rivalry we've waited for all along what cheek what cheek i say all right all right as next one

1506
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:03,600
is hater man oh go hello my name is hater man i just made up this persona because fuck you i hate

1507
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:08,640
everyone and everything myself included the number one thing i hate about your podcast is that you

1508
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:13,760
don't let nate and ben because who else would be having this stupid argument come to a conclusion

1509
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:19,040
in their debates i understand the other members are discomforted by this but not letting the

1510
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:25,760
argument have a conclusion is at best a waste of time between two episodes of this podcast there's

1511
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:30,960
been no real conclusion or compromise on the pewdiepie debate the whole thing should have just been

1512
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:35,840
cut if there was never going to be a conclusion it would be better to finish the debate at the end

1513
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:40,560
of the podcast after the voicemails where the other members could leave if they so choose to

1514
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:45,280
then to have a half finished debate where the other members are like ha ha that's stupid this guy's

1515
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:50,640
stupid get him out of here no this guy this guy's exactly no okay okay here here you go dumbass

1516
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:56,240
you can't you can't conclude such a debate you'll never end you guys will never yield to you

1517
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:01,360
yeah yeah ben and nate will not yield there will be no conclusion ben and nate are batman

1518
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:07,360
and the joker they are destined to do this forever yeah that's true that's true that is on point yeah

1519
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:11,920
this is why we need you know we need two best brothers bitch about politics like that's the only

1520
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,320
place we do we do i i want to do that's that's that's a very good i like i think that would

1521
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:20,880
actually be successful maybe outside of us i'm pretty sure this is the same guy who commented

1522
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:26,000
like the exact same thing on on the episode i agree i think i think it would actually be

1523
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,480
successful i literally would be fine with going and like posting it on the old uh uh t now okay

1524
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:38,960
i'm just converting it i'm i'm i am somewhat i don't know if i really want to do it but but uh uh uh

1525
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:46,000
like the idea of sullying the the it's a it's a retired deceased channel the idea of taking

1526
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,520
it into a politics channel makes me want to fucking puke it makes me want to make a new channel

1527
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:57,200
branded as t bat politics fine we would okay we wouldn't have to put it on the old channel but why

1528
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:02,640
the fuck not this is what we need to do you guys need to do just as a bonus episode you need we need

1529
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:07,520
to do it as a bonus episode like a 15 hour debate where you guys just go until you're too exhausted

1530
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:12,240
that's how every episode will be and if people like it make a channel yeah make a channel for it

1531
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:17,200
have been draw like people instead of ponies this time and just like instead of doing it instead of

1532
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:22,400
doing it weekly just do it whenever there's a big debate to have like in the news or something

1533
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:27,680
literally literally would love would would love to would love every time every time a political

1534
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:33,280
debate pops up in an episode we cut it and then you guys redo it on that show okay just keep going

1535
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:41,440
forever i just agree with this notion that like yeah debates should or can just be like resolved

1536
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:46,560
like sometimes it's not really a debate we're having a conversation just have it be natural and

1537
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,200
it can get it can peter out and it can come back in the next episode i mean that's like the reason

1538
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:56,080
we dropped the pewdiepie thing last week was because we weren't getting a lot yeah it was no

1539
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:01,040
these are complex there was no agreement these are complex issues so if you just like pretend to

1540
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:07,040
have reached a conclusion it's gonna be false and i mean i really think like okay either one

1541
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:11,520
or two things will happen one we go like really research data and we're able to like disprove or

1542
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,480
make a really strong case that the other person is wrong but barring that i really think basically

1543
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:23,280
every political debate if it's not about the facts just boils down to the like the the core values

1544
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:28,480
of the person because it will be attracted the the idea that debates need to be resolved or need

1545
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:33,200
to have a winner is a cancer on all of society they're supposed to be an exchange of ideas not

1546
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:38,960
necessarily a battle of wills the winner is the fact that it happened it would be nice if we could

1547
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:44,800
come to agreements but like i don't know i mean do people really think that that's how it works

1548
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,960
like i don't know that doesn't tend that doesn't tend to happen i don't i don't recall ever watching

1549
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,440
a debate with a conclusion like that you know i mean don't they only say the debate is for jordan

1550
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:57,920
peterson and sam harris like those discussions like never they never like come to yeah they all

1551
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,200
they always end with people talking about things actually isn't it the point of uh a debate like

1552
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:07,680
an official debate to just present your opinions to argue a little and then at the end let the

1553
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:13,760
audience decide who was right yeah exactly i think most of the time yeah that's yeah like every

1554
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:18,720
like no one's ever swayed in a debate like no one changes their mind at the every debate ends with

1555
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:22,080
well you made some points and i made some points and we can agree to disagree because we're all sick

1556
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,000
of arguing the end i mean that's how every debate in history is supposed to end maybe that's what

1557
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,880
hater man is really craving he wants that moment of like we're like we've reached the end we cannot

1558
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:35,920
go any further let's shake hands and say he's just another lost soul looking for an objective

1559
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,920
truth in the universe that he will never find because it will never exist yeah maybe and i

1560
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:45,680
sympathize as do i as do i i mean i got nothing else to say on this yeah we'll let you know if

1561
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:52,000
we have any political little shows going or something um we i don't i don't know what we

1562
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,760
would do it about specifically yeah but i want to do it maybe you know i mean we could we could

1563
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:01,360
probably try it sometime we could you know we could argue about like where did where it should go

1564
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,880
what to do i mean maybe hosting it just a separate video on the bcp that'd be the first debate like

1565
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,760
where where will the shit go on the music what about this what about this com i mean what if we

1566
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:18,160
put out like a promo on tbap for the new tbap the new the new bad tbap yeah okay i suppose perhaps

1567
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:22,080
something like that i could concede on i suppose as long as it doesn't okay i just don't want to like

1568
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:28,000
you know flood what i consider a nice old channel not everybody was on it but i like it to be

1569
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:35,920
resting in peace yeah i feel you the well okay i just just just for intellectual curiosity

1570
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:41,760
here's my case okay why i wouldn't mind i mean one the people like the people already subbed

1571
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:47,280
to tbap they subbed you know because it was a show in which you and i talked about stuff about

1572
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:52,880
ponies though so who knows how much is specifically that though yeah yeah that's there's that but like

1573
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:58,720
you know there's both yeah okay i got you and two like the fact that the acronym is the same

1574
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:04,080
would just it's funny like it's still tbap it's still tbap even though it's completely different

1575
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:08,640
i hear you on that you know i argue it's purely sentimental it's purely you'd have to you'd have

1576
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,920
to like trick people into getting invested you'd have to like phrase like frame the debate as like

1577
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:19,280
something pony related like celestia versus luna politics and then slowly as the argument goes on

1578
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:24,080
you drop the facade and then that's it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth doing if we had to do that

1579
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:28,480
this is no i don't this is not i'm not saying that would be the whole thing just in the beginning

1580
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:32,480
to get people to click on it but like 20 minutes into the video with hard pivots and then everyone's

1581
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:37,120
trapped because they're invested no see see no i want to draw in this is for a new i don't want

1582
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:40,880
i don't want the old the pony audience then why would you post on the old channel like you're

1583
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:45,200

1584
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:51,440

02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,080
yeah how dare you do my one week

1601
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:58,880
it converts it converts ketones in your body to plasma and then they come exploding out of your

1602
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:05,760
pores the heat of the surface of the sun yeah it's very effective you know you know i got a

1603
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,800
couple of my clients on on on twitter a couple people were messaging me asking me uh like hey

1604
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:16,240
nate um can you tell us like how to get like edited audio into speak pipe and like somebody

1605
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:20,240
replied to it saying that there's like a setting that you can set on windows or something that

1606
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:25,040
allows like your your general audio that's being played to like be received as input audio or

1607
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:29,520
something so like if somebody could clarify that i guess in general i think some people are looking

1608
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:35,120
for that information if we could like directly through soundcloud no no no it's like uh like

1609
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:40,080
there's something you can do on your computer setting so that when you go to uh speak pipe

1610
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:44,880
and you hit record like all audio like happening like if you're playing like something on youtube

1611
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:50,800
and like your microphone it'll all get funneled like into the speak pipe like input well well like

1612
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:56,720
okay i mean like for me to i look i would open up obs and i would just set it to like you know

1613
02:09:56,720 --> 02:10:02,960
register desktop audio and then i would just start recording and play the audio files that i

1614
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:07,360
i mean for obs that's fine but speak pipe doesn't have that kind of like a setting on it so it's

1615
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:11,920
like a more primitive sort of thing so you need to like change your desktop audio to a mic input

1616
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:16,400
it's it's weird i don't know exactly how to do it but like it is doable clearly yeah so people have

1617
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:19,520
been doing it for a while look at if we get i'd love to give people some information on that so

1618
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,640
if anybody has that i don't know put it put it down below in the description if you've got like

1619
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:26,880
steps or something so that people can see that we'll pin that or maybe maybe oblivion fall

1620
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:33,920
knows maybe oblivion fall maybe oblivion fall knows all right what you need is a program called

1621
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:43,280
voicemeter and vb audio cables what voicemeter does is it stands between your microphone and

1622
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:49,840
all of the programs on your computer acting as a middleman and it lets you shift your audio inputs

1623
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:55,920
and outputs around basically you can shuffle them however you like the version i use is the default

1624
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:03,360
simple one and basically you have three main channels you use one for your microphone one for

1625
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:09,280
your desktop audio and one for communications if you want to know how to set this up and how to do

1626
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:15,600
it right check the show notes for this timestamp just look at where you're at i will be linking

1627
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:21,600
download links to both voicemeter vb audio cables and a proper tutorial explaining how to install

1628
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:26,320
how it works if you do this not only will you be able to pre-record your voicemails but you

1629
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:31,840
can also basically have an infinite soundboard at your fingertips when using discord or skype

1630
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:36,480
if you have a folder full of sound effects you just press a button boop they can hear your audio

1631
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:44,800
boop but that's enough from me uh back to your regularly scheduled uh pppness time maybe oblivion

1632
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:50,720
fall knows he probably does that guy knows everything haha we pay him enough to know all

1633
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:54,640
the answers god damn it indeed we do by the way you know what i i've been feeling bad about this

1634
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:59,440
i've been meaning to like do a tweet on the pcp like saying like hey guys just want to let everybody

1635
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:03,120
know congratulations to our new editor oblivion like i didn't do it for the sake of the mystery but

1636
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:07,840
now it's been like two weeks beyond that uh so i really got to do that i like i feel like he's

1637
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:12,720
for all those people who follow the twitter but don't listen to the show uh i'm sure that yeah

1638
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:17,200
for them you know what that's for some reason i feel like real like the twitter is like the

1639
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:22,320
place where real announcements are made like big life changing but we get way more listeners on

1640
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:29,680
the show than people on the twitter so so i don't know okay anyway anyway uh all right let's let's

1641
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:38,560
move on what you got uh next one is critical mistake about hyenas sick go this is the most

1642
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:46,080
embarrassing thing i've ever seen in my life i see the title the episode trans hyenas i know where it's

1643
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:51,760
going we're going to talk about the best part of female hyena the coolest thing nature's ever invented

1644
02:12:51,760 --> 02:13:01,200
the pseudo penis but no we didn't get it we didn't get it so i just need to tell you you idiots you're

1645
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:08,960
talking about like these big hulking female hyenas it gets crazier than that they have in large clitoris

1646
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:15,760
that are so big that they literally are called pseudo penises by science this isn't a word i made

1647
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:24,000
up unfortunately but they use that to literally subjugate the males as you would just i actually

1648
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,840
knew that if that means why would you call it trans hyena is not mentioned the best part about

1649
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:33,760
them actually being trans um fascinating we're bring it we brought it back to pegging we started

1650
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:40,240
oh yeah we can just end the show right here it all so they literally fuck the males into submission

1651
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:46,400
is this the gist of what's happened i think they do have the ability to sort of like make the

1652
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:54,400
correctly oh yeah sure i mean a click can that be on ben sains tombstone it started with pegging

1653
02:13:54,400 --> 02:14:06,160
and it ended with pegging new shirt new shirt new shirt i don't know is it sure with a picture

1654
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:11,440
of a tombstone on it with that inscription if it's ben sains tombstone with these words written on it

1655
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:20,240
oh it's a great idea uh okay why not thanks for the info i want the words put this on a shirt on

1656
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:27,760
my tombstone oh that's good yeah that's good and i want the words put this on a tombstone on a shirt

1683
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:12,880
well this weekly format isn't working for me again here's here's here's here's here's my question

1684
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:19,040
if a if a female hyena were to fall into the bed would they eat a pseudo penis well they too don't

1685
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:24,640
eat riddle my ass riddler how does that work they're not they're not gonna eat the no no no no my god

1686
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:29,200
no this is specifically specifically no no they specifically eat the penis this is this is the

1687
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,200
sort of thing that when the riddler asks us next week we need to be able to rebound with an even

1688
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:38,080
more conniving and impossible to deduce riddle that will be what finally pushes him over the edge

1689
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:43,760
and let's us save our last remaining i guess maybe like the pseudo penis is sort of like uh like uh

1690
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:50,960
like those fake hamburgers or something like that what uh yeah i mean wait what could you explain

1693
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:04,160
