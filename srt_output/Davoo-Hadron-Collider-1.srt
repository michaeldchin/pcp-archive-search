1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Well, that didn't sound very aesthetically appealing, appealing, unpeeling, you know, I'm

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:35,400
all about going fast, and hard, and doing lots of things. I hate being slow, and I hate

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,080
feeling like there could have been more I could have gotten done in the day. You know,

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,720
I hate feeling anything less than really motivated and really energized with whatever

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm doing. And you know, listening to Digi's decompressions about how much he does that

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,960
all the time makes me go, ah, I gotta do that. But you know, a lot of that really comes

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,680
down to how long it's been, how long I've had to build up speed, or rather to build

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:23,040
up mental clarity. You see, I guess in two days, no, probably, okay, it's basically

9
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:30,000
right now, it's basically the anniversary of when I finally left my job, which is the

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,080
thing I had wanted more in my life than anything that I have ever had ever wanted before or

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,000
since it actually got. So this is like the first anniversary of something that I really

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,960
deeply care about. Because there's a number of reasons why, just the fact that you spend

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,480
most of your day doing something you don't want to do. But that, even when you get back,

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,280
it doesn't work as well because you're so tired. You get back from work and you're frigging

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,840
tired. You don't have quite enough energy to do the work you wanted to, you know? That's

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,240
what really made it stressful and annoying and made me hate it so much is that being

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,600
at the job makes it harder to do something else that you want to do instead, that you

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,360
want to be able to turn into a career. So it was like every video I was making, it was

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,680
really suspenseful to me whether or not it would be successful because every video that

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,240
was successful brought me one step closer to being able to quit my job. But if it didn't

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,880
get successful, then it wasn't necessarily a step closer, which meant another whole week

22
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,320
or two added on to the maximum time limit it would take for me to keep doing the job.

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,880
I became an absolute monster of antisocialness during this time. I became very much a nope

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,440
not going to do this, not going to do that. I feel like I've already explained this in

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:04,200
multiple different podcasty areas, but you know. So when I did quit the job, it still

26
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,560
took time to get into the right mental gears. Because like for example, when you're working

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,280
full time, working say five days a week on the other two days, it doesn't quite work

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,040
to just then do a different job. The whole point of having those two days off is because

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:28,120
you need the time off to unwind, to decompress if you will. So working on those days anyway,

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,000
it's still jumbled and messy and confusing and aggravating. Particularly when the thing

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,960
you are doing is blue collar and the thing you want to be doing is white collar because

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,520
my body is like there'd be times where I'd get like a whole week off, but my body is

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,760
very much used or at least was very much used to physical movement throughout the day. So

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
sitting at the computer was agonizing like every single day until about five days in

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,880
I would finally get used to it, but then it would be back to work again and I'd have to

36
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:07,360
readjust the other way. So you know quitting my job took me really took me months to really

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,880
get efficient at what I was doing throughout the day, but I could never be quite that efficient

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,040
because I was still living with my family where you know, there's something inefficient

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,040
when you live at home with people who are off doing their own things that aren't related

40
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,760
to what you're doing, which I know I'm sounding like a psychotic selfish maniac with this.

41
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm not saying this is a terrible thing. You could obviously have a successful career

42
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,520
with this, but I'm all about being faster, being more efficient and like living now as

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,760
I do with you know, the guy who I work with and then also like another guy who also makes

44
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,920
YouTube videos and does art stuff. Like something about it clicks more. Something about the

45
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,840
fact that we're all doing the same kind of thing makes things faster. Maybe just the

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,520
fact that I'm living with roommates who are friends rather than family. It speeds me up.

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,280
I don't know. Maybe it's a presenteeism where I feel the need to be more efficient around

48
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,400
friends. I don't know what it is, but I just always feel like every time I'm in the kitchen

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,360
and like my dad walks in, it feels like it slows me down. Every time I am in the kitchen

50
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,560
and Ben walks in, it feels like it speeds me up. Don't know why it just is. Don't even

51
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,080
know how psychological it is. It might just be purely in my head, but I do think it does

52
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,520
make a huge difference. So after quitting my job in like the very end of the year last

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,560
year, it took me months to really build up speed, but I could never build up that much

54
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,680
speed because I was with my family. And then when Radcon happened and I moved over here,

55
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,520
I got slow all over again. I was like totally discombobulated. I mean, there would be moments

56
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,320
where I'd sit down and crunch out like the whole Kuriko vs. Haikyuu video in like two

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,880
days or like my whole how to understand themes video on my channel, which I put together

58
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,680
in like nine hours from concept to completion. So I still had plenty of moments of like being

59
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,040
fast, but there were just so many not fast moments in between them, you know, so much

60
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,840
build up and so much standing around. What am I doing right now? And it's okay for people

61
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:24,920
to live like that. Most people do, but I find that depressing. So finally, at some point,

62
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I finally everything has just been snapping into place. It was really going back to my

63
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,160
families for a bit because I went back to my family's house for five days for Christmas,

64
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,040
although the days I was actually there was December 15th through the 20th, not on Christmas

65
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,280
because my family wanted me to do a specific thing on the 18th. And I'm like, well, in

66
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,320
that case, I'm not going to be there on the 25th. So I celebrated Christmas a week early,

67
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,440
got back home and I'm like, this is my chance because I took five days off probably the

68
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,640
first time in like four years, I took five straight days without with while neither working

69
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,520
on anything nor planning on working anything, nor feeling bad about not working on something

70
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,280
like I'm always I think I've taken like five day periods where I did nothing. But I was

71
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,200
like frantic about it and always eyeing the keyboard for when I was going to get back.

72
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,760
So I finally took five days of actual break, came back, and I'm like, this is my opportunity

73
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,840
to finally get fast. And it was and I did it. I fasted and I am still fasting

74
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,480
to take that pun more literally, I have been losing weight. I have been

75
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,120
showering more often, you know, almost every day.

76
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,360
My ankle situation is finally going to get resolved, I hope.

77
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I sprained my ankle really badly way back in summer of 2015.

78
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,800
At work, I totally blame the job stupid fucking clean windows getting off ladders.

79
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Grass was wet, sprained ankle, never completely healed. I guess because I'm a trampoline

80
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,400
addict. And I walk around weird, both digi and my brother have told me that I walk funny

81
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,040
when I bring up my ankle situation to them. So apparently I don't walk right. And that

82
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,240
makes it hard for my ankle to heal. And again, for a long time, I just couldn't stay off trampolines,

83
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,840
man, they're so much fun, they're so much fun. So I mean, most of the time, almost all the time,

84
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,640
I would keep my left foot off of trampoline, I wouldn't put pressure on it, I bounce on one foot.

85
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,960
But don't think that really helped because, you know, it's still bobbing around and stuff.

86
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,800
So I'm sure that kept it from healing. But I've been over here, living in Virginia,

87
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,400
no trampoline in sight for over a month. And it's still my ankle just gives, you know,

88
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,680
it's just a little bit achy, not enough pain to be annoying, but enough pain that I still

89
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,280
have to worry about it. That's the problem having to constantly worry about my ankle.

90
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,480
And did you was like, yo, you should get that looked at because I can't like take like a 30

91
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,360
minute walk before it starts to hurt, right? And it'll stay hurting for the next three days.

92
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,880
That's a problem. So I went to the ankle doctor and they said, try stretching it and take this pill.

93
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,480
And I did. And it didn't work at all. The ankle is still just as bad, possibly worse. So I went

94
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,160
there again the next month. And he was like, okay, don't stretch it. Don't move it. Don't use it.

95
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,800
Put on a big friggin boot thing. You know, if you ever see it's sort of like a cast,

96
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,320
but it's also like a boot. It's just got like these metal beams and straps all over it.

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,840
So if you've ever seen that kind of person walked around on their foot with that thingy,

98
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,960
that's what I've got. So yeah, now what happens is now everyone asks, what's wrong with your foot?

99
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,920
What happened to your foot? It got better. That's what happened to my foot. I am better off now

100
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,160
than the last time you saw me without question. But it didn't become visual until now. The problem

101
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,280
is finally being fixed. I can finally walk around without having to worry about it. It used to be

102
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,680
even having to walk over to the kitchen or walk it over to the other computer would be like,

103
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't want to do it and use up ankle points. Now I don't got to worry about that.

104
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,640
So that's good. You know, I still can't like take long walks or anything, but you know,

105
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,800
I got to be moderate with my walking. But at least when I do walk, I don't have to worry about it.

106
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,280
And that's really nice. Incidentally, this is unrelated to what I was talking about. But sometimes,

107
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,120
you know, when you get like a throat bubble and it like feels all weird and it's really itchy and

108
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,600
you want to cough it out immediately, I've trained myself to just keep talking when it happens and

109
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,080
hopefully have a recording on when it's happening. Like I'll usually bust out my phone and try to

110
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,440
record it. But I'm usually not able to get it before it goes away. But thankfully this time I'm

111
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,160
actually recording something right now as I got the throat bubble caused by this angry orchard apple

112
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,560
apple cider. I think the bubble is mostly gone by now. But yeah, I'm gonna keep

113
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,720
Oh gosh, it gets really annoying and hard to not cough out anyway.

114
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,920
Oh, I'm spiking the microphone like a crazy man.

115
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,680
Okay, I turned down the gain. Look at these gains anyway. So yeah, my ankle is doing better. Friggin

116
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,800
What I mean is throughout the day, I have fewer and fewer things to worry about and be distracted

117
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,520
by. Because like, you know, I move into a new house, everything's in a different position,

118
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,920
everything just walking around takes some mental effort for the first like couple of days. It was

119
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,440
only like a couple of weeks ago where it finally everything evened out and I could walk around

120
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,640
without any any increment of conscious thought, you know. So that's good. Just no distractions,

121
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,440
nothing getting in my way, no medical problems other than the ankle. But again, it's it's more

122
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,760
when you work from home, having this thing on isn't an issue. The only time where I have to

123
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,800
walk around a lot is when I go to the groceries. And the only problem then is like old people going

124
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,880
how to let them ankle. I'm like, yeah. And they're just looking at me like, so yeah,

125
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm like, mm hmm. I mean, I know what they're talking about because they're looking at my foot.

126
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,240
But you know, if you're going to say a random comment to a stranger in the grocery store,

127
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,080
prepare what you're going to say, like form your statement in your head fully.

128
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,720
Make sure they're looking in your general direction and then speak clearly or else

129
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:34,360
give up. Don't say it because they're not going to hear you. So with that in mind,

130
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,720
you know, I pumped out that whole Digi video about the fan service and I sat down with a list

131
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,880
of anime to watch. Because earlier this year, I believe in April, May or June, Digi made a list

132
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:55,960
for me at my request of shows that I might need to watch for upcoming videos. Because one thing

133
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,080
that was kind of annoying for me is that every time Digi had a new show to talk about, it would be

134
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,440
a show I haven't seen before. So I'd have to watch it from scratch every time, pretty much.

135
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,280
So I was like, hey, you know what'd be cool is if I could just like, watch all the shows in advance

136
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,520
that you plan to maybe at some point talk about, right? I think that's how it came about. The point

137
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,640
is he made a list called the shows for a debut to watch for possible upcoming videos. And he made

138
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:29,320
a list of all of them. Um, it's like 80 to 90 shows on the list. No, maybe it's more like 70,

139
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know. But, uh, by the way, the list isn't actually complete. He actually got all

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,560
the way up to the letter S and it gave up. So any shows that he wants to talk about that are

141
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,960
between T and Z, he has not listed on that list, but whatever. I decided to watch all those shows,

142
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,240
or at least as many as I could. And so I have been. I've skipped shows that are really long,

143
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,640
like a record seven, and I've skipped some things where he wants me to also read the manga, like,

144
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,920
frickin, uh, King of Bandits Jing, for instance. So like there, there, those are the only categories

145
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,560
that I've ignored shows where you have to also read the manga because I'll read manga when I'm in

146
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,040
the mood for it. And I've read manga, I've read some manga, not quite in the mood for it at the

147
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,160
moment, but when I'm in the mood, I'll do those ones. Not in the mood to watch something super

148
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,760
long out of nowhere at the moment, you know, so I discounted the manga ones, discounted the long

149
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,760
ones, but I've been watching everything else. And so yeah, I think it was like 60 or 70 of those.

150
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,200
And over the course of the year, I've been plowing through them, getting really good at

151
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,840
marathoning as a result. So after I came back from my trip with my family, I sit down and I have like

152
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,800
six or seven shows left. And I have nothing else to do for the rest of the month, right? I finished

153
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,600
the fan service video, that's the only video that needs to be made for the rest of the month.

154
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,840
So I sit down and I start watching them, and I watch one episode of Martian Successor Nadesco,

155
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,840
then I decide to take a shower. And then in the shower, I'm reminded of video games again. I remember

156
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,680
the idea of making video games, what it was like to make that one RPG that I made half of and posted

157
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:27,880
onto new grounds. And was reminded of how I keep going into video game holes, which is what I call

158
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,400
them, where I have the insatiable desire to program video games or do whatever I can to make video

159
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:44,360
games, you know, because, you know, artistic expression, man. And then I'm reminded of a video

160
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,600
that I had watched just a week or two before called object oriented programming is bad.

161
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,640
And that video remind reminding myself of that video made me realize that I should try

162
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,240
programming yet again. So first I'll tell you the story of how I gave up on programming. But

163
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,240
before that, I'll tell you the story of how I tried to program the first time. So I guess I'm

164
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,040
now just going to tell you my whole relationship with making video games. Yeah. Let's go.

165
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,400
My whole life I knew I was going to do some sort of entertainment media thing, right?

166
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,760
I didn't know I didn't realize that you're supposed to just use the word artist as a kid. I

167
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,280
didn't realize that the word artist from of any medium was the term to describe it. So as a kid,

168
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,520
all I could phrase it as was a someone who works in some sort of entertainment field. That's

169
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:43,000
probably even more articulate than I would have phrased it as a kid. So you know, throughout my

170
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,600
childhood and adolescence, I would go from one to the other like making cartoons on new grounds.

171
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,960
I was big in the new grounds for one year. I really thought that making flash day flash games

172
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,480
and flash animations was a cool idea. But you know, didn't really have the patience for it.

173
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,240
And I didn't I didn't know how to pirate flash, you know, how to make how to get flash or how to

174
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,520
I didn't have the desire to pirate it and I didn't know how I didn't even realize that

175
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,000
almost everyone was like I didn't understand yet at the time that most people on the internet

176
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,160
pirate everything, at least in communities such as new grounds. And even then, there are free

177
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,520
alternatives like live swift or at least there was I don't know that program still exists. But

178
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,080
you know, it's crappy and dated even for its age. But you know, it's still sufficient for animation.

179
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,000
If I really wanted to make animations, I would have used live swift and I would have made something

180
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,640
but had no patience, you know, tried art, you know, got went from being abysmal to being terrible,

181
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,760
which is an improvement. You know, tried this tried that, you know, made like one or two songs.

182
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,920
I felt like I was always getting something done, you know, I didn't ever go that long just doing

183
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:04,040
nothing. So I got I got like a familiarity with many different mediums. And at some point,

184
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,160
I decided that it's going to be video games, like that's the best one.

185
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:16,200
As a kid, I did make one video game in Windows PowerPoint, which is the slide show presentation

186
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,840
software. And because I because I realized at one point that you can program buttons in that

187
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:31,240
software, a button in Windows PowerPoint that if you program it, it will take you to whichever

188
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,560
other frame in the project you want to go to. So it was like, oh, hey, you could just arrange a bunch

189
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,480
of these buttons, and they take you to different frames, different slides. And you could essentially

190
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,240
program a game that way. So I just made a very simple choose your own adventure game, where

191
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,520
basically, you go up to a situation, and you're confronted with a problem, and you have three

192
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:04,360
options, and one will succeed, and the others will get you killed. So yeah, it was inspired by that

193
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,160
one episode of Arthur, where a bunch of the kids were playing that particular game. It was just

194
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,560
like it. I had based my entire design document off of that Arthur episode, not on any actual games

195
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:24,520
of that sort. I remember the project ended up being exactly 1111 frames long, and I felt pretty

196
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,600
accomplished in doing it. Made it when I was 10 years old, would have been 2004 on a laptop,

197
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,560
Windows XP, not like I had anything better to do.

198
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:45,720
When I was 16 or so, I was messing around an RPG maker, making some levels, making some items,

199
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,640
but then I was like, you know, I want to tweak things. I want to make the main character walk

200
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,400
slower or faster, or I want to have a specific set of animation frames for this item, and

201
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,400
doing all that just always was such a pain. It was like having these pre-built programs

202
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,520
that do all the work for you. It's like if I want to change something, it just sends me to the forums,

203
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,520
trying to figure out if I even can change it. It's not really that fun for me.

204
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,080
But over the course of watching YouTube videos on the internet, I got more and more inspired into

205
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,600
video gaming. At some point, it just became clear to me that games are the things I care about,

206
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,040
really the most in a way. I mean, not really counting YouTube videos, and YouTube analyses,

207
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,760
those are technically the zero thing I care about, but video games are the first thing I care about,

208
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,600
and videos like AVGN, getting me interested in how to think about games critically,

209
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,960
and getting me an appreciation for old games, and then the Game Over thinker was a big deal for

210
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,320
me. That really introduced me to the concept of artistic expression in a more meaningful way,

211
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:07,960
and creative voice, that kind of stuff. Also, extra credits, framing. It really framed video

212
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,200
game development as this huge series of insurmountable challenges, and that made it really sexy and

213
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,080
cool, and like, oh wow, all these incredibly impossible things that people are trying to figure out.

214
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,640
I'd like to figure that out. What really pushed over the edge was Jimquisition, presenting how

215
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:33,560
shit, and corrupt, and bad so many of the game developers, and even game publishers, and even

216
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,120
some game developers are with their business practices. And that made it even more interesting

217
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,280
for me. It seemed like not only would it be a fun challenge, but it would also be an easy way to

218
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,680
feel morally superior to lots of people by not being shit like that. And I was like, yeah,

219
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,880
I gotta do video games.

220
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,560
Now, when I was 17 and a half, that was when my dad finally started making me go to work with him

221
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,160
all the time. He finally brought me onto the family business full-time. He had gotten me to go and

222
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,640
clean windows with him sometimes, as early as like when I was 13. You know, just once or twice here

223
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,840
and there, you know. When I had free time, nothing better to do, and I could make some money that

224
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,840
way. So it was a great way to make money as a teenager. But when I was 17, that's when he finally

225
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:30,360
started to make me work full-time. And when I was 18, by then, I had built up finally a work ethic.

226
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,280
I finally had the ability to just push past being tired, or frustrated, or not inspired,

227
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:44,120
and just do the work anyway. An incredibly important and valuable ability. That's in combination with

228
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,360
really being inspired with video games and really thinking that I have them. I figured out what I

229
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,040
want to do with my life. So mentally, I was ready. Work ethically, I was ready. And I was really into

230
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,920
MLP at this time, and now it's kind of really uplifting me after a couple of years of teenage

231
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,800
depression. So the tide was right, and I just decided time to make a video game. So

232
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:20,600
what did I do first? I believe what I tried first. Don't remember exactly which one I did first,

233
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:29,080
but I think what I did first was I downloaded Multimedia Fusion 2. And that's a game making

234
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:38,520
software. And I messed around with it some. And then I made a game called Impossible Maneuvering.

235
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,680
It's basically one of those games where you move a symbol around an object like a square,

236
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,720
and you have to dodge other objects like an amaze without touching any of the objects

237
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,120
and to get to the goal without touching anything. It's basically just like that,

238
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,200
but where every level is totally different and every level has a different mechanic

239
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,320
and different graphics and stuff. So that's the kind of game I like, you know, games where

240
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,760
everything, there's always a lot of variety, things are always changing, there's a lot of

241
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:14,200
character involved. So it's that cliche genre of flash game tweaked to be exactly my kind of game.

242
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,040
So I'm still pretty proud of it, to be honest. Like, yeah, Impossible Maneuvering. I would

243
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,040
honestly recommend it, you know, it gets way too hard, way too fast, though. So it's something to

244
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:32,600
get frustrated bail out, unless you like a steep, unfair challenge. So then I thought, okay,

245
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,760
multimedia fusion is great and all, but it's not really a programming language.

246
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,840
It's basically like you throw a bunch of squares together, like it's,

247
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,720
it's sort of like trying to make a user visual interface, even though it is legitimately a

248
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:53,480
programming language. It's just kind of a kind of a shitty one. So I thought, I want to learn

249
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,080
action script, because that's the that's the code that flash uses. So I messed around with that a

250
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,680
bit. I bought I didn't just mess around. I bought a $50 action script 3.0 manual, and started

251
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,400
studying it over the course of a few weeks. And I was getting me I was learning some things like

252
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,920
object oriented programming, which basically is a way to like, chop up the code, like instead of

253
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,920
reading all the code at once, you can look at different little chunks of code at different

254
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,800
times without having to memorize all of it. And also stuff like classes where,

255
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,440
um, like certain objects can inherit properties from other objects. That way, you don't have to

256
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,360
like, type out everything all over again all the time. So that's a great that you know, that's,

257
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,600
that's a popular way to program and stuff. So I learned about that. Because when I made impossible

258
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,040
maneuvering, I had no idea what I was doing. Like, that game has very little complex programming

259
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,240
in it, because I knew nothing about how to make a game really. So it was a good idea for me to

260
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,440
make something so simple. But I wanted to make, you know, I wanted to get more of an idea about

261
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,800
the program. I couldn't, I was able to understand the idea of like how programming works and stuff,

262
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,920
but I couldn't even like, in terms of actually making something, even get so far as successfully

263
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,960
compiling something. I just couldn't figure it out. It was just, no, no, no, no, I just felt like

264
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,320
I really needed like someone who I was friends with who knew this stuff to explain it to me,

265
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,000
you know, going to a class would probably be beneficial at first, like just a couple of weeks,

266
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,160
so that I can get off to a good start. Really, just the best way would be to hire a personal tutor

267
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,720
or for the best, awesome, perfect tutorial to be out there somewhere. But none of those things were

268
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,880
true. I didn't really know anyone at this time. I didn't really know anyone on the internet very

269
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:45,560
well. Certainly not anyone who was like good at anything. Good at programming, I mean. So I put

270
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,400
an action script down, went back to multimedia fusion, and was like, okay, let's make something

271
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,360
else. Let's make something a little bit more ambitious, but not too ambitious. And I just,

272
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,960
I really wanted to do an RPG, like not like a big 50 hour Final Fantasy type thing,

273
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,720
more like a tight, short type thing. That's more about just being quirky and fun, very

274
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Superstar Sega-esque and other games, you know, like Earthbound and stuff like that.

275
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,160
I've actually not played Earthbound, because as a teenager, it was not on the virtual console,

276
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,200
so I couldn't play it that way. And now as an adult who's finally willing to pirate games

277
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,840
and Earthbound is on the virtual console, I just don't have time for an RPG anymore.

278
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,720
But I have been very familiar with Earthbound and what it's about and what it's like. And I've,

279
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,800
in a sense, been a fan of it for a long time for like 10 years, because of that.

280
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,320
You know, because of Smash Brothers and reviews and retrospectives and such. And I did play the

281
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,160
first couple hours of it. So I'm a fan of Earthbound too. You don't have to play something to be a

282
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,360
fan of it. You know, taking influence from those kinds of things. From like, you know, Paper Mario,

283
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,280
other quirky RPGs. And I decided to make one of those. And, you know, not necessarily the

284
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,680
best idea. I ended up spending a year and a half making it. Late 2012 to early 2014,

285
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,480
that was how much time I spent making it. And I only made one half of it. I realized I'm not

286
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,400
going to be able to finish it. I'll just release the first half of it. So yeah, it was long and

287
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,840
tedious. And I did it way too slow. And I didn't know what I was doing. But I was like,

288
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,440
what am I going to do? Am I just going to sit around planning shit, learning shit forever

289
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,160
and ever and ever before I decide to just jump in? Let's just jump in now. Like, yeah, I'm going to

290
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,640
jump in prematurely. And I'm going to suck at it. But at least I'll be getting experience points

291
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,800
in knowledge when I do so. So I just did it. And yeah, I think it was a reasonable use of my time.

292
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,800
I wouldn't have been doing anything else in that time. You know, I would have had nothing else to

293
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,320
do once I came home from work. And I will say, I have no regrets about my work ethic during that

294
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,960
time. I really hampered myself into oblivion, almost never taking any sort of break, you know,

295
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,000
just using almost every single ounce of spare time I had. So yeah, for like a year and a half. So

296
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,040
it was messed up, you know. Over the course of making it, early into making it, I discovered

297
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:16,920
Digi Brony, MLP, and I became a fan of him and then other horseshoe crew people as that whole

298
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,520
group started to form. And here in Digi and Jesse talk about how hard it is to be a YouTuber on

299
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,240
their podcasts, made YouTubeing sound like a really interesting challenge instead. And I was like,

300
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,120
you know what, I think I want to get into this instead, because the whole 2013, that was when

301
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,960
like the analysis thing was really becoming a thing and a lot of different mediums. And I'd

302
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,040
finally learn to understand what I really liked about YouTube videos that I liked. Like I finally

303
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,800
figured out what I liked about certain kinds of reviews. Also with stuff like Roger Van Der Weed.

304
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,200
Roger Van Der Weed. That is a guy who does this series called Sonic Dyssected, which really

305
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,840
introduced me to the fact I really liked the idea of an analysis over a review. And I was like,

306
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,800
yeah, this is what I need to do instead. I'm going to drop video game development for now,

307
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,200
because this RPG I'm making, I'm only going to release half of it and I don't think anyone's

308
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:20,840
going to like it. So April 30, 2014, I finally posted the game on Newgrounds, got like a 2.5,

309
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,720
got like two views, no 2000 views, which is like basically nothing got like five or so reviews,

310
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,600
most of them complaining about the load time because it was like a 20 megabyte download,

311
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,560
which for like flash, for a flash application is a lot. And that was basically it. And I'm like,

312
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:44,840
you know what, whatever. The fact that I made something competent, something that only sometimes

313
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,520
glitches out, bugs out and crashes on my first attempt isn't too bad. And I like, I like the

314
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,960
ideas in it. I mean, it is basically boring, but I liked, I like the style of it. I like the feel

315
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,480
of it. So yeah, I don't regret any of that. But it was time for me to move on. It was time for me

316
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,680
to put video game development on the backboard or focus on YouTube instead. So I spent, incidentally,

317
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,640
the reason why I said I came out with everything with that game, April 30, 2014, was because I

318
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:21,400
specifically wanted to get it out before my birthday, so that I could tell everyone, yeah, I came out

319
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,680
with my first fully specced out game when I was 19, you know, that way I can make myself sound like

320
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:34,360
I have experience, you know, like, yeah, I made an adventure game when I was 10. And then I made a

321
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:44,680
a freaking dodging shapes game when I was 18. And then I made an RPG. I made half of an RPG

322
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:52,920
when I was 19. April 30 is my birthday. But I got it out 30 minutes, no, 15 minutes before my

323
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,880
birth minute. And I'm in the same time zone. So yes, it was when I was 19. I then immediately had

324
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,000
to spend three hours after posting it three hours fixing a game break and glitch. But, you know,

325
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,720
all video games have patches these days. No one counts that. So yes, I released my first fully

326
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,760
specced out RPG with a level up system, battle system, overall system, overall puzzles. Yeah,

327
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,920
it has puzzles, man. It has some somewhat complicated puzzles on it. Okay, it has one

328
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,280
somewhat complicated puzzle in it. And I made it all before when I was 19. I have so much experience,

329
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:40,040
man. And then it was all YouTube for me for the next solid year and a half or so.

330
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:47,880
And then Undertale came out. Had people recommending it to me up and down the street

331
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,360
corners, you know, because it's exactly the kind of game I like is the kind of game I want to play,

332
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:58,840
the kind of game I wanted to make, you know, it's very much I call YouTube. The genre I give to

333
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:05,400
Undertale is good RPG. It's like an RPG, but where everything is interesting and unique, you know,

334
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,680
it's not usually about grinding. It's usually about experiencing characters and a story and

335
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,240
interesting mechanics and having fun and doing creative things all the time. That's my favorite

336
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,840
kind of game. So that's why people were recommending it to me because everyone knows how much I like

337
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,080
Superstar Saga. And I was very much sold just by the fact that people were recommending it to me

338
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,120
for that specific reason. So I finished the video project I was working on, set that game aside.

339
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,720
Well, I set everything aside for that game, played it, made a video about it, really got into it

340
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,000
as much as I possibly could have hoped to.

341
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,400
And again, you know, I feel like I like that game probably more than a lot of its biggest fans,

342
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,680
but for a slightly different reason. Like, you know, the great music, the story, the characters,

343
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:59,240
the unique mechanics, the way it touches your own personal meta with video games. Like, everyone

344
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,040
has this meta with video games where they feel that strange sensation when they restart a level

345
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,480
and they experience the story again slightly differently. But no one knows about it. But you,

346
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,560
you know, that's like a meta element that everyone feels that that game taps into that really,

347
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,960
that really hits people really hard. And all of that brings the game up to like a 9.5 for me. But

348
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,360
what really pushes it into the 10 territory is just the personal connection of it being so exactly

349
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,520
like the kind of thing that I want to exist and the kind of thing I want to make and the kind of

350
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,680
thing I want to play. Toby Fox, that game really feels like I can feel Toby Fox's creative voice

351
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,560
every step of the way. And that I can, I feel like I come from such a similar place as where Toby

352
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:48,600
comes from, you know. And so that really stuck with me. And I'm like, I got to mess around with

353
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:54,600
multimedia fusion again. I just have this incredible urge to work on video games, not going to set

354
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,760
aside YouTube, not going to actually try to make a game, but I'm at least going to mess around,

355
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,800
I'm going to tinker around. And that's when I decided that I probably will make a game at some

356
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,120
point. But I'm going to do it the exact opposite way as I did the first time. The first time the

357
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,880
RPG, I deliberately ran into it with no planning, because I didn't even know how to plan. I didn't

358
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,960
know nothing about planning. So planning it for nothing wasn't going to work. I knew I was going

359
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,920
to have to go in and fail so that I would at least know what it's like so that I could then foresee

360
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:34,920
what the what the second attempt would be like, you know. So this time, I'm going to plan up the

361
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,200
wazoo. I'm going to come, I'm going to learn every single thing I'm doing. I'm going to make sure

362
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,320
I know absolutely everything I'm doing down to the bone before I actually start making it. So

363
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,840
this, I can spend, I can spend all the time I need, because it doesn't need to be my full-time

364
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,200
job. I can be doing YouTube in the meantime as my main job. This can take as long as it needs to.

365
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,680
I decided multimedia fusion wasn't the best choice for me. I decided I want something that was a

366
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,120
little bit more like an actual programming language, because as I just, as I said, the programs just,

367
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,520
they try to make part of the game for you, but it's hard to then make the game exactly the way

368
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,080
you want, because part of it's already been made for you. And I'm someone who always wants to tweak

369
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,720
you know, all the little variables to feel just right and just a little bit more unique, you know.

370
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,760
So I checked out Game Maker, right? I believe I actually bought it for like 100 bucks. I also

371
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,320
bought a $25 book on design flow. What's it called? Like design methods, ways to use the

372
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,600
object-oriented programming in a good way. How to get the program to communicate with itself,

373
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,960
to get the code flowing up and down the tunnels in an efficient manner. I know I worked around

374
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,040
with that for like three chapters, and it was just kind of going over my head, and I was just like,

375
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,200
okay, you know, this is fine and all, but you know, time for me to get back to videos. I really got

376
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,560
to focus almost all my timeline videos. Another six months or so goes by, or nine months, and cut to

377
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,760
a few weeks or so, or a month or so into living here in the Radcon house in the Colin Castle,

378
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,640
where I suddenly fall into a video game hole again. I'm supposed to be making videos, supposed to

379
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,000
be watching anime, but I make the foolish decision to watch YouTube, which is a decision I make like,

380
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,840
you know, 50 times a day, but I watched the wrong video this time. I decided to catch up on the

381
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:39,160
Gymquisition's Best of Steam Greenlight Trailers series, where Jim Sterling will watch a trailer

382
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,600
for a Steam Greenlight game and commentate over it sarcastically. Specifically, Steam Greenlight

383
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:51,720
trailers that are obvious like, big rigs over the road racing tier shit, right? It's like hundreds

384
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,080
of episodes along this series, and I'd watched like all those episodes last year, but I decided to

385
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:03,080
catch up again, which was like 50 episodes. And remember when I said about how much I'm drawn

386
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,120
to challenge, but I'm also drawn to the idea that things are easy, or rather that no matter how bad

387
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,160
I end up failing, I'll be better than a lot of people. I'm like, wow, watching these greenlight

388
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:21,000
trailers, it's like, if I made a game, no matter how bad I fuck up, I will be better

389
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:29,800
by leaps and bounds than all of these people. God damn, I should make video games. I should

390
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,480
make video games. I should make video games. I should make video games. I should make video games.

391
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,640
This chair is loud, and I decided I should make video games. So I did what I described as falling

392
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:53,640
into a video game hole, where I wasted three days messing around in programs, even messing around

393
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,040
in Unity. I was kind of kicking around the idea of like, you know, what about 3D modeling? You know,

394
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,520
I don't plan on trying, even trying to make a 3D game anytime soon. Anytime this decade, probably,

395
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,480
if ever. But you know, 3D modeling, it can still be fun.

396
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,080
Open up multimedia fusion again, just because I'm much more familiar with that program.

397
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,640
I was trying to mess around with certain, I keep saying mess around, but you know, I was trying to

398
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:25,000
like, hash out like a certain mechanic that I had in my mind. And I was having a fun time programming

399
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,240
it and all. But then, very quickly, it just got too complicated for me. It just got too tricky,

400
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,600
and I had to give up. And I'm like, God damn it, I think I just don't have the brain to be a programmer.

401
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,240
I don't have the attention span. I don't have the ability to study, and like, just, and just be good.

402
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,840
You know, too friggin' dyslexic for that shit. I don't know if I, I don't know what it is. I guess

403
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:55,080
just being on disciplines, blah, blah, blah. I don't know, I don't think it's not discipline,

404
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,520
I just think I just literally don't have the mental capacity for programming. That's the

405
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,680
conclusion I came to at the time. But stick with me here, okay? I'll get back to that in a minute.

406
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:13,560
So I decided that what I should do is get other people who are actual programmers and hire them

407
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,880
to do the programming. Now, I know what you're thinking. Well, what some of you might be thinking,

408
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,680
which is, oh, you're an ideas guy. You have all these great ideas for games, but you just

409
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:31,960
need someone else to make them. That's not what it is at all. I can have the idea for a game.

410
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,480
And design all, like, and design all the mechanics. Think about how, and like, draw it all out.

411
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:45,000
Design all the levels. Do all the art. Or at least most of the art. I mean, I could do competent

412
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,200
art if I put a lot of time into it, believe me. And if it was a certain kind of style.

413
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:58,200
I could basically do everything except for making the music and doing 80% of the programming. That

414
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,320
was my conclusion. My idea was not, I don't even have to think about the programming, but rather,

415
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:09,480
I would hire a professional programmer to do like the main meat of the work, but I will closely

416
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,400
observe. And he will tell me, he or she, okay, equal opportunity. Here she will tell me

417
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,880
what they're doing and how the mechanics are working. And they can guide me through it.

418
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,920
And then I can plug the rest of the game into that, you know, like, they design the basic

419
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,840
controls. And then they design, like, how, you know, like, certain objects react to it. And I

420
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,320
can study that and they can tell me and they can teach me. And then I can make little tweaks to

421
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,600
it as I need to. That was my idea. Through that, through that idea up on Twitter. And a certain

422
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:51,880
fan of mine and TPC fan in general, I think, Joji's magical supplies, or Joji's magic supplies,

423
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,480
contacted me saying, Hey, I'm a programmer. I'd be interested in this. So we got into contact. And

424
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,280
I was like, Okay, here's some ideas for a game I have. I'd like you to put together a really basic

425
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,200
prototype that would do this, this and this. If you do it, I'll pay you this amount of money.

426
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:15,960
But Joji, listen, you can take as much time as you need to. Rather, I want you to take as long as

427
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,600
possible. Because I'm busy. I'm making YouTube videos and all, you know, I'm busy with all that.

428
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,720
So I want you to take a long time because I think it's going to be well over a year before I'm

429
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,440
even starting to seriously plan about games I want to make, right? He's like, Cool. So, you know,

430
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,200
he comes out with some early drafts of the prototype in Yada Yada. And again, he's taken a

431
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,000
long time like I told him to, which is fine because he has things to do and stuff, you know,

432
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,520
he has school and stuff. So all that was kind of on the back burner. I went back to making videos,

433
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,840
you know, went to see my family for five days, you know, came back, make a fan service video,

434
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:00,040
you know, decided to finish off that anime watched one episode of Martian Successor in the Desco.

435
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:06,920
Then I went off to take a shower. And as in the shower, I was reminded of all the things that I

436
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:14,200
just told you about, except for one thing that I forgot to mention, which is that a couple of weeks

437
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:20,520
prior, I happened to stumble upon a video. And this video is what really triggered me to remember

438
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:28,120
all these things as I was taking a shower. It's this video called OOP is bad, which OOP stands

439
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:37,720
for object oriented programming is bad. And I was like, huh, I got to click on this. And he's like,

440
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:45,400
this will be the most important video you will ever watch object oriented programming is universally

441
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:55,480
accepted in the industry. No one will listen. No one will believe me. But it's actually the worst

442
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:02,120
thing ever. Okay, I'm sorry. He doesn't sound like a libertarian. Okay, he's perfectly rational.

443
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,600
You know, it's a 40 minute video. I understood like 60% of it perfectly, I think.

444
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,480
And it yeah, I was like, huh, interesting. But that made me think about game design again.

445
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,760
So fast forward to a few weeks later, which is now a week ago, I get out of the shower.

446
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:27,800
And I decide to not watch that episode of Nadesco episode two, I decide to download

447
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,960
Godot, which is a new game design engine, similar to Game Maker, similar to multimedia fusion.

448
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,320
But like supposedly better, maybe it'd be better for me and it's free. So I downloaded it. And I'm

449
00:44:41,320 --> 00:45:03,880
like, yeah, this is an engine. It's good. Oh, I got tired of it in like five minutes.

450
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,160
And that was what really made me realize I don't think these programs are for me.

451
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,000
Maybe I'll move up to them and later on, I know that professionals use them.

452
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,800
I mean, like, okay, look, you know, Undertale, made in Game Maker, sure, but like

453
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:29,080
Undertale isn't the most technically impressive game out there. Whereas like, okay, with multimedia

454
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:36,360
fusion, for instance, you know, I released it in 2014, that same year, five nights at Freddy's and

455
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,840
Freedom Planet come out, also made in multimedia fusion. You know, five nights at Freddy's is

456
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,400
fairly somewhat technically impressive, but just the fact that it has pre-rendered graphics, I guess.

457
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,760
But Freedom Planet is quite technically impressive, just the fact that the character has 360 degree

458
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,520
movement, I think. It's like, how do you even do that in multimedia fusion? Dang.

459
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,840
So clearly people know how to use that stuff professionally, but I didn't. I just think

460
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,640
having these programs that do have to work for me just messes me up when I want to tweak things.

461
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,440
So I'm like, you know what? Forget about it, though. I want to try C++, but it's programming.

462
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,640
Can I really do programming? And I was thinking about that OOP video, and I watched it again.

463
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,000
Why object-oriented programming is bad. I watched it again, and this time it really clicked with me.

464
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,600
Basically, what the guy is saying, and I'm sure he's making plenty of arguments that actual

465
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,440
programmers have already heard before, because Nate was telling me that he's already heard

466
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,640
all the arguments before. Because Nate's an actual professional programmer, by the way.

467
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,120
I don't know how many times he mentions that on TBC, but he's a professional programmer.

468
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:51,400
That's his main job right now, that he's trying to quit. But his job involves a lot of objects

469
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,120
and classes and stuff, and he tells me he's heard what the problems are. He knows what the problems

470
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,920
are. I've never heard of the problems. I've only ever heard good things. What this guy was saying

471
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,960
is that basically, let's say you have 10,000 lines of code. That's too many lines.

472
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,520
Let's split them up. If you split them up, like, okay, let's have 100 lines of code over here,

473
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:16,760
and 500 lines of code over here, and 200 lines of code over here, and 30 lines of code over here.

474
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,920
That way, you'll only have to keep track of so many lines at a time.

475
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,720
But what the guy was saying was that, basically, when you have all these different sections,

476
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,320
you still, you still ultimately have to know everything in the program, if you want to really

477
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:44,760
make stuff happen. But now, not only do you need to know all 10,000 lines of code, but you now

478
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,080
have to know dozens, or even hundreds, of all the tunnels that connect them. You just added

479
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,440
more complications. You have more stuff you have to keep track of, because you have to keep track

480
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,560
of how all the different sections communicate with one another. You have to keep track of all

481
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,240
the different tunnels that you've dug. So what he says is that it basically only makes things more

482
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:16,760
complicated, not less. And with classes as well, you know, you make an object like, say, box. And

483
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,040
box has its own programming. And then let's say you want to make a blue box. Well, you don't have

484
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,040
to make box all over again. You just make it blue box and give it the category of box to give it

485
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:35,160
the class of box. So the blue box immediately inherits everything that the box had. And now you

486
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,080
just add a little bit more onto it to make it the blue box, you just add a little bit more detail.

487
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:47,320
Then you could make blue box with a spike on top. And then you just give it that you just give it

488
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:53,320
the class of box and the class of blue box. And then you add a little bit more code to account

489
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,960
for the spike. That sounds like a great idea. But like, basically, it seems like there's a lot of

490
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,000
people out there who are like, yeah, but then what if you accidentally change something in box

491
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,400
or something? What if you want to change something in box just slightly, but then it makes the spike

492
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,240
go haywire or it makes the blue turn pink? You never know what's going to happen. It's like building a

493
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:21,080
house of cards, they say. And I'm like, oh my gosh, you're right. Fuck object oriented programming

494
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,480
in the ass. Now since then, you know, a week has passed since then and I've learned more and I'm

495
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,440
like, okay, I think there's like a middle ground here. But there's no question I really abused

496
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:38,840
objects and classes when I made my RPG. And with that in mind, I looked back into the memory banks

497
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:44,040
of when I was making that game. Because like, if you were to play that game, you would probably

498
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,760
be astonished that it took me a year and a half to make that took me 18 months to make that because

499
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:55,160
it's you can beat it in four hours, it has almost no mechanics really. It's a very simple, like linear

500
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:07,800
level up system to looking back, I spent at least 50%. But honestly, maybe up to 80% of my time that

501
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:15,160
I spent on the game was spent trying to get the code to work. And usually that was because majority

502
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,320
of the time I spent trying to get the code to work, not writing the code and structuring the code,

503
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,760
but just going back and forth, figuring out what I'm doing wrong, you know, debugging things,

504
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,400
figuring out what the glitches are. Most of that involves most of the thing that was slowing me

505
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,120
down. Most of the thing that was eating up my time was trying to figure out how all the different

506
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:40,360
objects were communicating with one another. That's what was really tricking me out and slipping

507
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,960
me up. Unless I'm remembering it wrong, but it was a pretty big part of my life. So I think I

508
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:56,840
remember it correctly. So I'm like, I'm going to try and program now and not and like do as little

509
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,760
objects as possible, as little classes as possible. I'll only do it when I find it to be absolutely

510
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:09,080
necessary. And with that in mind, things were so much more clear for me. And I picked up C plus

511
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:15,480
plus and I, and like, I'm having a great time with C plus plus because for one thing, it seems

512
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,920
like I don't know if something about it just really just really clicks with me just really

513
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:26,600
click clicks with me as if it as if there's a C making a clicking noise and then some plus

514
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:34,840
signs making me click multiple times. But also because of Bucky Roberts of the new boston.com

515
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:41,720
and his god tier tutorials. I've known about Bucky Roberts of the new boston.com and his god tier

516
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,440
tutorials for like five years now. Because like five years ago, I was messing around with HTML

517
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,600
wanting to make a website. And I found out about his tutorials and I watched it and it was it was

518
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:56,840
great. I actually made another website on just this year for my dad's business. Basically that

519
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,000
was how I was able to quit my job was my dad was like, make a business for me and you can take the

520
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,680
winter off. So I was like, sorry, make a website for me and you can take the winter off because

521
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:13,640
the winter is very slow for window cleaning anyway. So I did that. And by the time winter was over,

522
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,920
I was making enough money on YouTube to leave. So yeah, I made a website, but I don't think I

523
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,680
would have been able to do it if it weren't for hit if it weren't for the fact I went back and

524
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:29,160
watched his tutorials again. And and yeah. And so when I wanted to get to C plus plus, I'm like,

525
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,720
yeah, I'll watch Bucky Roberts's tutorial on C plus plus. And he's just such a good everyone

526
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:43,080
every tutorialist should just study how he does it. Because he'll he'll always give you a metaphor.

527
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,200
He'll he'll always try to really truly analogize what's happening in the computer. He'll be like,

528
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,120
now you may be wondering why I'm putting an equal sign here. Well, the equal sign is telling

529
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,520
the computer to do blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, if you didn't have the equal sign

530
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,040
here, the computer would be going, so wait, what do you want me to do with this? So like he'll

531
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:12,200
he'll always be he'll be walking you through every step. And he yeah, it's it's good. Another great

532
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:21,320
thing he does is he'll acknowledge misconceptions that you're likely to have. We're like, it's

533
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,560
kind of hard to phrase it unless I use an actual example from an actual thing that I can't think

534
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:33,560
of one at the moment. But like, he'll understand he understands what a normal person thinks like

535
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,160
as distinct from a program. And he's like, Okay, now that we've typed out this bit of code,

536
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,120
you're probably going to think because of logical sense that you would do this, right? Well, let's

537
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:51,000
try it out. And as you saw, the code actually did something different than that. So you're probably

538
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,840
thinking, So what the heck? Why did it not do the thing I thought it would do? Why did it do this

539
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:00,840
weird thing? Don't worry, let me explain. And then he'll explain like he'll really walk you through

540
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:07,560
it and give you a true understanding of what you're doing. The other thing that I love is that you

541
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:16,280
get immediate results with with any good tutorial. Like I just can't do a manual man. I just I just

542
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,840
can't learn anything unless I do it myself and internalize it. That's the only way I can learn.

543
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,080
I'm sure that means I'm sure that equals I have a learning disability but oh well.

544
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,840
You work with what you got, man. Because like with with C plus plus, it's like you just you open

545
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,680
up a new you go and download a compiler software, you open up you make a new file and it has the

546
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,920
default like text in there already has the default code. And you just you just type in

547
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:55,640
something like hello, blueby, you hit F nine. And then you see a command prompt show up and hello,

548
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:01,080
blueby showed up, you have this immediate feedback with what you did. And you can change things you

549
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:08,040
can learn one step at a time and learn how to change what results you're really building on it.

550
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,440
You know, it's like finding out the one plus one is two, and then going on from there until you

551
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:22,360
eventually get to algebra. And then more, I guess. Whereas, you know, if you read just a manual that

552
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:28,120
just goes through everything like as like an encyclopedia, it's like it's like if you don't

553
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,080
know anything about math and you're reading about all of math before you actually do any of it yourself.

554
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:43,240
So yeah. That's what's great about Bucky Roberts' tutorials. And so I got halfway through his C plus

555
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:52,360
plus tutorial. And then he started talking about memory and assembly. And I'm like, okay, this is

556
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,960
getting pretty high level. I'm going to take a break for now. I'm going to I'm going to wander

557
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,960
around with other types of computer stuff. I was figuring I should learn C plus plus from

558
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:08,200
other people to to get other perspectives and learn other things. And I basically like,

559
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,240
basically, there were people with videos saying, you should try to learn assembly, you should try

560
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,840
to learn binary, and how assembly code works, because that will give you a better understanding

561
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:24,200
of how C plus plus works. So here's if so let me explain what assembly is to those who don't know.

562
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:32,280
Um, imagine you're watching YouTube, if you use your mouse and you click the middle of the screen

563
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:39,720
to hit pause, that means basically, you know, your mouse has told YouTube to pause the video.

564
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,240
But it's more like this, YouTube, like YouTube's, the website of YouTube, which is, you know,

565
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:52,680
like the video player is probably JavaScript, I assume. So the JavaScript code that represents

566
00:56:52,680 --> 00:57:00,200
the YouTube player has been told to stop the video. So then JavaScript goes over to what I

567
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,680
assume is C code. No, no, I don't know what I don't know what code JavaScript is based off. Is it

568
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,600
based off C code? I actually don't know. Based off something like that. And it tells that code, hey,

569
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,600
let's pause the video. And then the C code or whichever one actual programmers, please correct

570
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:22,120
me on everything in this video, I want to learn and I want to not be wrong. Okay, then the C code

571
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:30,840
looks down and goes, Hey, assembly, we want to pause the video. And assembly code goes, okay. And

572
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:39,400
then the assembly code goes to the actual friggin computer and tells the actual like wires and

573
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:48,040
gates and hardware of the computer to do a different thing to pause the video. So assembly code is

574
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:54,600
directly controlling the computer. Even if you have a programming language, the program like C++

575
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:02,840
or JavaScript, or Python, I guess, those languages are only telling other languages to tell assembly

576
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:10,440
what to do. So learning assembly is can be very useful, because then you'll know exactly what's

577
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,760
happening with your computer. Well, you won't automatically know, but you'll know how you'll

578
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,480
know how to figure it out. You'll be able to look into the individual numbers and the individual

579
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:27,400
memory registers of the computer. It's sort of like indirect, it's sort of like putting up a

580
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,600
microscope to your actual to those actual wires going on down there. It's like putting up a

581
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:40,360
microscope to the actual memory banks. So I thought I want to get into assembly. I know it's way more

582
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:46,520
complicated. But as long as I can find a tutorial like the new Boston, I know I'll be able to do

583
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:54,280
it just fine. But there just aren't any. And I'm like, well, dang, I learned a decent bit about

584
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:01,960
assembly, I learned more about how binary works, and that's super cute. But just no tutorial guide,

585
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:08,840
which is here, let's incrementally add stuff on to a compiler. I mean, there are some tutorials

586
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,960
like that, but they're like weird and have terrible audio and like want you to download a stupid

587
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:21,000
program. I don't want to download. So and it wasn't working out like there is a guy who has a series

588
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,640
on assembly, where he goes through it step by step. But he does it badly. He explains what's

589
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:36,120
happening badly. The first 14 episodes are just him reading from the book and not actually giving

590
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:41,400
you a tutorial. So my standards are just way too high because of Bucky Roberts, man.

591
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,680
So that's what I've been doing, you know, trying to get into the arts, trying to get into other

592
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:53,640
mediums, because you know, I feel like a couple of weeks ago was when I finally got over this sort

593
00:59:53,640 --> 01:00:01,080
of obsession with analysis that I've had for a couple of years. At this point, there's no analysis

594
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,240
that can come out that's like fundamentally more amazing than anything I've seen before. Like,

595
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:10,040
I'm impressed by it a lot still. But I'm like, you know, I kind of know all this stuff now.

596
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,280
So yeah, not really. I'm finally at a point where something being analysis doesn't make me

597
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,480
more interested in it. You know, I'm basically just as interested in just a normal review,

598
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,200
if the review is entertainingly delivered, and makes good points, even if it is still a review.

599
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,280
And I'm just more interested in any other kind of ways to make a video entertaining.

600
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:41,000
So I feel like I basically got as good at YouTubing as I really need to be. Like, obviously,

601
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,400
I could still be a lot better at writing, and I could still be a lot better at narration.

602
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,280
So, you know, I might still be putting a lot of effort into those at some point.

603
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,200
But with editing, I don't really need to make that many more improvements.

604
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:01,320
Like, I could, I'd like to eventually. But really, my goal was that for all year,

605
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,960
my goal has just been to get faster. Because there's really no need to make something that's

606
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,520
specced out with lots and lots of new effects, like Nerdwriter always does. You know, he's always

607
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:16,440
trying to find new tricks and traps to use. I mean, basic editing is really fine.

608
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,520
You know, making the editing really special all the time doesn't really add that much.

609
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,280
But you know, if the videos I'm working on ever get boring as a result, then maybe I'll

610
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,920
reconsider it. But for now, like, the level of editing skill that I have at the moment is fine.

611
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:37,720
And then I just wanted to get really fast at it. And as of now, I'm pretty much as fast at it as I

612
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,840
need to be. So don't even need to worry about that. So I guess I had gotten kind of bored,

613
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,320
but I didn't even realize it. Like, I'm really content with how videos are going. And when I

614
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,240
got into programming, it was like super exciting. I'm like, this was the most excited I've been

615
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:56,520
since getting into analysis. But when I got into analysis, I was still out of clean windows

616
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,800
almost all day. But this time I get to spend all day every day working on it. And I also got

617
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:07,160
myself a tablet, a drawing tablet, just a simple Wacom bamboo, no screen, nothing fancy like what

618
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,440
Digi has. But Digi getting a tablet and talking about how much he wants to do art, motivated me

619
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,880
to do more art because I'm like, my I have one goal with art, which is to never be less good

620
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:25,080
than Digi. My goal is to always be better at art than Digi is. Because otherwise, that would be

621
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:32,200
embarrassing. So I might have to like just do a whole comic series, just so I can get experience

622
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:38,520
in drawing and stay ahead of the curve, depending on how good he is. So yeah, getting into all these

623
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:44,600
mediums and entertainments, other mediums. I was thinking I was just going to focus more and more

624
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,520
on making videos and watching anime so that I can buff up my anime expert knowledge when making

625
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,880
anime videos. And I'm going to do that. I'm going to be making lots of videos. I'm going to be spending

626
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:01,080
lots of time watching anime for sure. But not as much as I thought I was going to. I thought I was

627
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:08,920
going to be making lots more videos and making lots more money. But really, the way that this job

628
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:15,640
is right now is basically perfect. Because the amount of money I make from the job as of the last

629
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,280
couple months is high enough that I only need to make like three to four, sometimes five videos a

630
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:28,600
month. And that's how much Digi seems to want to be making as well. And it's like that gives me so

631
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:34,600
much more time to do anything else I want with all that free time. On some level, I guess I'm

632
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,040
supposed to feel like I'm cheating people out of their money because they patron Digi and

633
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:43,560
indirectly me. I should be spending all that time and time to make more and more videos, right?

634
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,640
But technically, if I'm making an average amount of videos, three to five, the fact that I get

635
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:55,240
them done so quickly is just because I've worked really hard at getting fast. So I have earned my

636
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:02,280
ability to spend 10 straight days doing whatever I want for the last week or so of December,

637
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,480
which is what I've been doing. So I guess my goal is to get the YouTube work done as fast as

638
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,920
possible most of the time. Make sure it's good. Enjoy it. I do love making videos. Don't get me

639
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:20,200
wrong. I just don't have any I just am not there's just not a whole lot more new stuff for me to do

640
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:26,840
in a way. So really just focus on getting it done as efficiently as possible while still being high

641
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:34,520
quality and then be super speedy on cramming and all these other things I want to do in the meantime.

642
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,480
Again, I thought I was gonna be spending all the free time just getting better and better at videos.

643
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,440
I was just squarely focused on videos for like two straight years. But now I think I've I think

644
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,200
I think I'm basically leveled up as far as I need to be for the most part on videos and I can focus

645
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:56,520
on other things. This is a really big deal for me. Okay. I have been like, I've just obsessively

646
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:01,640
think about videos, how I'm going to do them, how am I going to get better constantly for like two

647
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,360
and a half years now. It's completely consumed in my thought, except for you know, sometimes I'll

648
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,200
be in a video game hole, but then feeling bad for it because I'm still obsessed with videos. I've

649
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,960
just been so completely consumed by writing and the narration and editing and all those things

650
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:23,480
all this time. And now as of just a week ago, you know, I walk back in to watch Nadesco episode

651
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,000
two but decide to not and I've gone on this completely different curveball direction.

652
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:37,160
So I just feel so excited. I feel so phoenixed from the ashes right now. The ashes of having a

653
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:45,880
great time. I didn't burn up. I'm just doing even more good. And then just today, I took another

654
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:53,800
random curveball down the path of memes. I've been getting really into the Shrek butt or

655
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,880
B movie butt meme. What a great concept. You know, I think what makes that meme work

656
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:07,560
is it feels like something that a computer algorithm created. Like throughout the internet,

657
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,800
there's just certain things that like algorithms do that are funny. Like I don't know if you guys

658
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,680
know, but there are certain YouTube channels that YouTube generates itself algorithmically,

659
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:22,360
where it'll take a topic that's popular and then like make a channel out of it like a tag like

660
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:31,480
anime topic or you know, Lord of the Rings topic is a channel that just compiles popular videos

661
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:38,280
that have that tag. That way people can subscribe to that and lots of people do subscribe to those

662
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:44,920
channels as a way to get like a feed of good content from that category. But it's funny because

663
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,480
it's it's done automatically like when YouTube decides that there's a certain topic that's

664
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:55,240
popular, it'll make one. Not like through any human, it's just through a computer. And what's

665
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:01,240
funniest is that the about tab, the about page of these channels is always the first paragraph of

666
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,840
the Wikipedia article, copy pasted in, and it always cuts off randomly at some point,

667
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,800
followed by this channel was automatically generated by YouTube. That kind of stuff is

668
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,440
really funny. And I feel like these, these like, you know, Shrek, but every time Shrek shows up

669
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,080
the video, it speeds up by 10% videos. It feels, it feels like it's a parody of that kind of thinking.

670
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,680
Because there's no humor to the way that it's delivered. You know, it's not like, here's a

671
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:34,040
funny video guys. You know, there's no like text on screen being like, I hope you like it. It's just,

672
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:41,640
it's just exactly what it says it is. You know, like Shrek, but every time Shrek shows up,

673
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:49,560
B movie plays instead, you know, it's as if some algorithm out there decided that this needed to

674
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:57,960
exist for some reason. Hippo made an amazing one. A feat like just yesterday, which is a Shrek,

675
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:05,160
but every time Shrek's face appears, the video ends, which made me giggle so hard. That was like,

676
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:11,240
okay, I need to make one now. So today, I was looking around for something to meme. And I

677
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:15,960
decided, and I had an idea, and so I posted it. So you can go to my channel, Devugos to Saturn,

678
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:23,320
to check it out. It's a, the Ghost in the Shell standalone complex opening, but every time Motoko

679
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:30,280
appears, the Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd century opening plays, which I'm quite proud of, quite

680
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,920
satisfied with. Then they got lunch, and then I was like, I got to make another one, got to make

681
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:41,320
a more challenging one. And I came up with Big Hero 6, but ever, but with all the nouns

682
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,560
replaced with things you can do at Sakurakan. But then when someone dies, the video skips

683
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:53,240
ahead to the end, because I gave up on making it. I spent three hours making like the first 20

684
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:59,000
minutes of it. And then I'm like, okay, I don't have time for another hour and 50 minutes. I'm

685
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:05,160
I'm just going to come up with an excuse for it to end. So it would have been amazing if I'd

686
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:13,480
actually put in all the work, but not quite worth my time. And that made me, uh, yeah, doing that

687
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:21,000
made me kind of burned out. You know, I finally made me like, huh, that was like really exhausting

688
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,480
to do. Like it wasn't hard. It wasn't complicated. It was just tedious, which was interesting,

689
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:32,520
getting something so tedious to do after like six straight days of this programming stuff,

690
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,640
which has been all fun, because I'm not actually making any programs, which can be tedious when

691
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,120
you're like debugging it and like figuring out problems, but just learning it, which is super

692
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:49,880
fun. I totally forgot how fun it is to learn a brand new thing. Yeah. Oh, yeah, suddenly did

693
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:57,640
something tedious and I felt like having a decompression or a rather to compress myself even

694
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:06,840
harder to go crazy, which is why I called this this video what it is. I don't relax by relaxing.

695
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:14,600
I relaxed by going crazier, I guess. I relaxed by like doing something intense.

696
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,880
Like, you know, my goal was to talk softly and slowly during all of this, but I feel like I've

697
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:35,000
been way too fast and loud for that. Not very good at relaxing ever.

698
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,480
I guess I probably just sleep extra long to compensate for it.

699
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,200
Where am I going with this? I guess I'm basically done with my point.

700
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,480
Yeah, that was my idea was to, uh, was to record this because of that,

701
01:10:54,200 --> 01:11:00,440
so to book in this weird turn in the memes I did today and to tell people what's been going on

702
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,960
with me, you know, I haven't mentioned any of this in on my Twitter or anywhere else. I mean,

703
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,640
okay, I've been mentioning that I've been programming, but none of the whole background

704
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:17,560
narrative behind it. I actually, I actually re-recorded the last like hour of this, by the way.

705
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,520
You may have noticed that right around what I'm talking about PowerPoint,

706
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:27,960
uh, the audio made change in sound. That's because the last latter 40 minutes of my original

707
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,880
recording, like just shat itself and died. And I'm like, well, that's weird. But now I don't mind

708
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:41,240
because, uh, like I delivered this all way better and more extensively this time. So it's definitely

709
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:46,840
better as a result. But I guess it was even less like a decompression or a recompression because

710
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:52,200
this was now me putting in a lot of effort to make all the points again. But more succinctly this

711
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:58,280
time, I did a much better job explaining myself this time. Um, now I'm just going to hope that

712
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:08,200
this recording doesn't die on me again. Uh, yeah. Okay. So get relaxed and compressed by the freaking

713
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:17,560
music, man. So long.

714
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:31,560
Yeah.

715
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:57,560
Hey.

716
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,200
You
