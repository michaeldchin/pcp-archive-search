1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Why dance around it? There are bad AVGN rip-offs.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,840
Yeah, but then like they have like two minute intros and it's like he's a guy, and he plays a game.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,840
And it's like just showing like their entire fucking collection of games and just literally like them bringing it up to the camera.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,840
And then it'll just be like, Dragon's League is the game of the day.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
You know exactly what I'm talking about!

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,840
I am Digibro. I'm going to be your host for today, and I have with me my co-hosts and friends.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
Mr. Jesse Wood.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Roast beef and whiskey.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
There you go. Roast beef and whiskey.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Uh, Hippocrit.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Siton.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Uh, the best guy ever, also known as Nate.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Or Guy.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
And the DeVoo.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Aw yeah.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,840
And today we're going to be talking about the subject of reviewer rules.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Now to explain what I mean by this.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
We sure do.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
We are the best.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,840
To explain what I mean by reviewer rules, this is sort of a multi-part subject that we're going to go through one part and then the other.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,840
We're going to be about rules that reviewers have for themselves or that people have for reviewers about how reviews are made.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Rule number one, don't be a reviewer. Do literally anything else creative.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
That's a pretty good rule.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,840
And the second half of this podcast we'll be talking about the rules which reviewers apply to shows.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Like what rules they have about what makes a show good and things like that.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,840
And a lot of this is probably going to be us coming at these rules from a critical perspective of the rules themselves.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:59,840
To start with DeVoo, I wanted you to talk about there's something that you called the reviewer rule that me and you get in our comments all the time and that we laugh about whenever we get it.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Do you remember this?

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Is this like a definition that people post or something?

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
No.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
DeVoo used to always complain because you have to be objective.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Sure.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,840
It's the rule where they say, oh my god, this video is not objective and therefore it's bad or you're not being very objective.

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
You know it's funny about that.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,840
It's a rule that carries over from back in the days of, well the current, it's the still living days of consumer reports.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
They think you're supposed to be a consumer reports guy.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
They think you're supposed to be an interviewer guy on the news media.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,840
It's funny to me that people still make that kind of like demand.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,840
They've sort of popularized like these objective reviews that are, you know, Steven Universe is a 10 minute long show.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
It airs on Cartoon Network.

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,840
It was written by Rebecca Sugar and like, yeah, that's it.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Objective facts, yay.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
And those are funny, but like it's because you don't want that.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
You want their spin on it.

47
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Well yeah, the perfect like criticism of the objective review was done by Jim Sterling.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,840
His perfectly objective review of Final Fantasy XIII where it's just him describing the game.

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
And like making no value judgments at all.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,840
And I think, yeah, there's a lot more people who understand that reviews aren't all about objectivity now.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,840
But yeah, like DeVu said, people treat it like consumer reviews.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,840
And like, yeah, and DeVu would always contact me and be like, oh, I broke the reviewer rule.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
They're telling me I broke the reviewer rule.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Oh, you've come up with all sorts of rules.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Sometimes the rules get very specific.

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Like your roller coaster video is bad because you talk about this aspect of the game first and the other aspect later.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
You're supposed to do it in this specific way, didn't you know?

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Didn't you get the memo?

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,840
And I'm like, no, I didn't.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Yeah, the thing about it, and DeVu, you had made this point to me very well,

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,840
where it's that these people who come to you with these rules, they don't know your goals.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,840
They have their ideas of what you're supposed to be doing.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
That's true.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,840
That have nothing to do with what you think you're supposed to be doing.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,840
People will come out and be like, oh, your reviews aren't very objective.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
And I'm like, well, they're not supposed to be.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
If you want objective reviews, go find another guy.

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Like that's not what I'm doing here.

69
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
You're totally right.

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
That's interesting because I remember the first time.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,840
I really think the first time I got into this at all was when my brother linked me.

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Jesse's, what was it?

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Crystal Empire review, like the Colt Corona one.

74
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,840
I think that was the first review I ever really saw that was way more than just talking about the thing.

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,840
And once I got into that, I got into all this other shit.

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,840
And it totally changed my perspective and made me look for a lot more out of reviews.

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
It was like, holy shit, they can do all this shit.

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
And I like to think that I try to incorporate.

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,840
But you didn't complain that it wasn't the kind of video you're used to.

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,840
I think a lot of these critical people think of themselves.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I didn't get it at first.

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
It took a little while.

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,840
This is a metaphor that Digi came up with in a vlog of his where these people like to think of themselves as they come into a sandwich place.

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,840
And they tell the cook, hey, the bread's a little bit burnt here and there.

85
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
The meat's a little bit dry here and there.

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,840
But really what they're doing is they're going into a sandwich place and saying, this pizza is very weird.

87
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Sure, sure.

88
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Yeah, and they don't get that they're doing that.

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
And they want reviews to be a very specific thing.

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,840
They have a very specific idea of what it's supposed to be in their head.

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,840
And yeah, they come in with their rules trying to apply them to your video.

92
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
And then, but here's the thing, is that a lot of them are reviewers.

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,840
And a lot of reviewers themselves follow these same rules and have these same ideas about what reviews are.

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,840
You know, when you watch people, like everyone seems to have their own ideas about like, this is how you're supposed to score a show.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
And this is like, oh, you have to...

97
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Nothing disgusts me more than like these arbitrary ass calcula...

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Like, you know at Glass Reflections, this is the end of his and he's like, after doing the maths, I have calculated this is like a 2.5 episode.

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
It's like, shut up dude, just say it's pretty good.

100
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Yeah, you know, and I used to have stuff like that when I was younger, like I was obsessed with scoring systems.

101
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:17,840
And I would try to come up with ones that were like, alright, well, you know, in my value system, story is worth this much and characters are worth this much and this is worth that much.

102
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
And I do all that, run all these calculations and stuff.

103
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:28,840
And then in the end, I realized that, A, I'm pretty clearly skewing my scores so that it will produce the result I already want, you know.

104
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Like I watch a show and I'm like, that was like a 9 out of 10 and then I start doing math and I'm like, 8.7.

105
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
No, I've got to, well, I guess the characters were a little better than that.

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
That is a very telling exercise, yeah.

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,840
And those things, you can't just weigh each thing, like how the fuck do you separate characters from story?

108
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Like how do you make those two different scores?

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
It doesn't make any sense, you know.

110
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,840
The story is the characters and vice versa, so it's really weird to try to do that kind of thing.

111
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Do you think it'd be good to go around and talk about what we each sort of like to see in an ideal review?

112
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Yeah, well first I want us to talk about stuff that we've seen other people do that they consider rules that we don't like.

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Do you have any of those things where when other people say something in their review about like how they do it that you think, why are you doing it that way?

114
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:42,840
I think one thing that so many of them do, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it's a lot more interesting when they just leave it out, is the info dump at the beginning where they just talk about all the different things about the game setting it up.

115
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Ben rails against the info dump, yeah.

116
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
It's just not interesting.

117
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Even if I don't know about the game, I'd rather you just like, Davoo's videos are very good, they just get straight to the point and you talk about like a weird thing and I'm like, oh, that's cool.

118
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I don't know anything about this game, but now I want to find out, you know.

119
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,840
I personally struggle with the info dump because I kind of enjoy hearing, if they can do it in a quick entertaining way, I kind of like it.

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Matthew Matosis does it well, partly because his videos are long enough to warrant some establishment stuff.

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
If your video is five minutes long and you spend 30 seconds establishing the facts, wasting time.

122
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,840
It's a matter of like, what am I coming to you for?

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Because again, like you said, the biggest problem is that people think of their stuff as consumer reviews, and it's all like they're trying to sell you something.

124
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:39,840
And so they feel like they have to tell you what the show is and then tell you whether it's good or not based on their ideas, you know, which of course a lot of them don't think of as their opinion.

125
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,840
They think of it as they have specific rules that we'll get into later in this podcast about what makes a show good, you know.

126
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,840
But like, that whole system is like, if I want the summary, I can go get that.

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,840
You know, like if I want to know what in general the anime is about, I can go read the chart and I'll already know.

128
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,840
So when they start off with like three minutes of literally describing the show, I'm like, okay, I want it.

129
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,840
I came to your video to hear your opinion of the show.

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
I already know what the show is about.

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I have a thousand sources for that.

132
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,840
And what's strange is how confident a lot of these people are in the professionalism and informativeness of their content.

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:26,840
And I've just now realized maybe that's partly because the top dog video game YouTubers are first and foremost lets players who don't do a whole lot more than scream.

134
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,840
So they think, well, if I have any, if I even have a script, I'm miles above them.

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,840
And then of course the second tier is the normal boots hidden block people.

136
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,840
And those people just, a lot of them most of the time just play a game and make a bunch of jokes.

137
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,840
They're like, well, if I talk about anything of substance whatsoever, I'm brilliant.

138
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
And I talked to one reviewer who was like...

139
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
On an artistic level, it's true.

140
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:54,840
That's the thing, a lot of people don't really seem to set out to make something like Jesse did,

141
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,840
which is something that's like big and like entertaining in itself and tells its own story.

142
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
A lot of people are just like, I want to talk about the game.

143
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I think people want to hear about it.

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
And it doesn't really matter how I do it.

145
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
And that's fine. You can do that.

146
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,840
But once I learned that there's all this other shit you can do when you're doing it,

147
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,840
it was like, Jesus Christ, everybody's playing checkers, but I've been playing chess for years.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I think there's a sort of mentality among a lot of reviewers where it's just like,

149
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,840
okay, I am a reviewer now and therefore my opinion on...

150
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
I have to give my opinion on everything in my purview.

151
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I am now an anime reviewer, so I must review every anime.

152
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,840
And then it's just sort of they review whatever comes under their purview,

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,840
like a Glass Reflections type, where anything that's big and popular, he reviews it.

154
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,840
And he feels the need to apply the exact same formula to every review and review every show.

155
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Well, I never got the idea that he would thought anything more of himself than just an informative anime guy.

156
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
So I think he's achieving his goals.

157
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Let me double advocate here a little bit, did you?

158
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,840
What is this you speak of? Don't just talk about whatever comes into your purview.

159
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Are you implying that there needs to be, or should be, ideally, some sort of relevance

160
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,840
or point to a video in its context of when it came out and the culture it's in?

161
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Yeah, I think if you make a review, it should be...

162
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,840
I said this, I ranted about this in my Bloodborne Let's Play,

163
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,840
but in episode three, if anyone's curious, because I go on a huge rant and it's awesome,

164
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:39,840
but I was talking about how if your review of a show, like the end of it,

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,840
is that you say that there was nothing interesting about the show, then there's nothing interesting about your review.

166
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I guess you could say why it's not interesting in a very entertaining way.

167
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I don't think you can describe why you don't like something,

168
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,840
but that would make it interesting.

169
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Sure, sure.

170
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,840
For instance, I've done this huge video series on the Asterisk War,

171
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,840
and while my conclusion is that the show is unbelievably boring,

172
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
the way that it's boring is interesting.

173
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,840
The way that they fuck up in everything, the way that everything's done.

174
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,840
But if you watch a show and you're like, eh, nothing about it really stood out to me,

175
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
then it's like, why did you have to tell us that?

176
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
We don't need to know that about the show.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,840
But watch his Bloodborne video for much more and much louder version of this argument.

178
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I just don't get why people feel...

179
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,840
I feel like people decide that I'm a reviewer now and therefore I have to give my opinion on absolutely everything

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,840
and apply the same system to everything.

181
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,840
The way I see it, every piece of art is different and deserves its own...

182
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,840
I guess now we can get into things we want to see from reviews, right?

183
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Here's a big thing I want from reviews.

184
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I want you to watch the show or play the game or whatever

185
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,840
and then talk about it in terms that make sense for that work.

186
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Talk about it in a way that reflects what you're talking about.

187
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Not necessarily that you have to go crazy like my Serial Experiments Lane videos

188
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,840
where it's like this huge experimental video style because it's the style of the anime,

189
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,840
but even if you have a lot to say about one show, write a two-hour video.

190
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,840
If you have a little to say about it, write a two-minute video.

191
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,840
If it's a show that's like a comedy and you don't know how to talk about it

192
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,840
in terms that you would talk about a drama, then don't talk about it in the terms you would as a drama.

193
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Talk about it in new different ways and make each...

194
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,840
That's why all my videos have... there's no structure to them.

195
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
It's all like this one is this long because that's the kind of show it is.

196
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Sometimes I talk about one aspect of a show because it's the only interesting thing.

197
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
And sometimes I talk about the whole show because all of it's interesting.

198
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I think a big mistake that a lot of reviewers make especially at a young age like myself

199
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,840
is let's say they watch a movie and they think, wow, this is a 10 out of 10.

200
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,840
This is my new favorite movie and part of what I love about it is the character interaction.

201
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
And so then they chisel it down in stone.

202
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,840
To be a 10 out of 10, you must have great character interaction

203
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
because after all, how would that movie have achieved it?

204
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,840
But there could very well be a movie that comes out that is a 10 out of 10

205
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,840
just on its ideas, its philosophy, but it may not have very good character interaction.

206
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
So you give that other one a 10 if it excites you as much.

207
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Like, Digi, you give a 10 out of 10 to Ghost in the Shell and Psycho Pass, both cyberpunk shows,

208
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,840
but one has better ideas and the other has a better story and characters.

209
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,840
And we'll get into that particular point later because that's what I want to talk about

210
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,840
with the rules reviewers have about shows.

211
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
But for now, I want to know more about your structural...

212
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,840
You know, one thing that I think is a mistake a lot of people make,

213
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,840
and I'm sure I have too, is, and it's related to what you were just saying before,

214
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,840
it's that thinking that everything they have to say because they made it a video

215
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,840
is inherently going to be interesting, is going to be something worth watching.

216
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
And that leads into my point.

217
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,840
When I watch a review, maybe I'm spoiled now because I've watched so many great

218
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,840
entertaining reviews as art pieces themselves,

219
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm not really interested in just getting information.

220
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm specifically looking for a great piece of art,

221
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,840
a big story told within the context of the review itself.

222
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,840
You know, I'm always searching for my next Anthony C's Cantralot wedding

223
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,840
because not only was that extremely well made in most ways,

224
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Tom's voice sounds like shit just because the recording is bad,

225
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,840
but not only is it great, but it's got this incredible narrative that extends

226
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,840
even beyond it into these previous videos that all tie up in this one punch

227
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
that finally is delivered in that.

228
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
And also, I forget what I was going to say, whatever, it's really, really good.

229
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
And that's what I look for.

230
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
I want more of that.

231
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,840
That is the pinnacle of what, oh, I remember what I was going to say.

232
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,840
It teaches me something that I had no idea about.

233
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,840
It presents this argument that totally changes the way you could view this piece of work,

234
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,840
that, I mean, you could have possibly thought this before,

235
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,840
but it seems like something that he did research and he came up with justifications

236
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,840
that it could be true, and it was delivered in such an entertaining way

237
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,840
that doesn't seem just like a shitty conspiracy theory.

238
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,840
It feels like it could actually be something that was actually planned.

239
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,840
And it's just, it's a perfect storm of all the things that I want.

240
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,840
And I've yet to see a video since that day that really hit me as hard as that one.

241
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
And that video, like, has a narrative of the reviewer,

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,840
but there's also the reviewer can tell the narrative of the work.

243
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I think YMS is the most acclaimed in this regard.

244
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,840
If he does one of his big YMS videos, often he talks more about the narrative of the movie's production

245
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,840
and release more than the narrative of the movie's plot.

246
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Like in his, the one with Will Smith and his son, he goes on for like 15 minutes,

247
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,840
just talked about the context and where it came out.

248
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,840
So when you see a scene in that movie, you're not just thinking about the plot of the movie,

249
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,840
you're thinking more about why Will Smith and Imlight Shamblin put it there.

250
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
And that's a story that doesn't even exist in the movie.

251
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
It only exists in YMS's video.

252
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,840
And that's something that could only be introduced by a reviewer, which is pretty cool.

253
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah, I think-

254
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Use the medium to its fullest.

255
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Boyo?

256
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
That's right.

257
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,840
I think, like, for instance, Jesse Wood here is like kind of the master of having the narrative of the videos

258
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
is more interesting than the subject matter.

259
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Because when Jesse reviews something, I'm not really, I don't care what Jesse's opinion of the thing is.

260
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I care about how, or I guess I should put it, not that I don't care about his opinion of the thing.

261
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Because Jesse always boils his opinion down to like, it was good.

262
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I liked it.

263
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Right.

264
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
And that's it.

265
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
And then it's everything else on top of it.

266
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Yeah, the interesting thing about it isn't so much what I-

267
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,840
I tend to use the thing I'm reviewing as a gateway to analyze myself.

268
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Yes, that's totally true.

269
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,840
And I love that because like, what I'm interested in is not what you're going to tell me about the show.

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm interested in what you're going to tell me about yourself through the show.

271
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Because like, what is a show but a tool with which we learn about ourselves?

272
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Exactly.

273
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Yeah, like, that's the main appeal.

274
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Like, when I do my analysis videos, none of it is trying to get to the heart of what this show is and what it means.

275
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,840
And like, in terms of the creators, like, I do like using creative intent.

276
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Like, I enjoy putting that in, like, I enjoy looking at it and putting it into my reviews.

277
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,840
But like, my goal is not to say how well did the guy who made this accomplish what he set out to do.

278
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,840
My goal is to say like, why do I react to this the way that I do?

279
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Why does this make me feel the things I feel?

280
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Why do people feel- why do other people feel the way they do about it, you know?

281
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,840
And like, because yeah, like you said, the point of art really, like the appeal of it is that it shows us something about ourselves.

282
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Or it shows us something about the world.

283
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:26,840
But you say that because I'm just now realizing the problem with a lot of the reviewers that talk more about the objective stuff and the reason they're not as interesting is because they're not as egotistical.

284
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,840
They don't think that they should make the videos about themselves at all.

285
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Yeah, not even egotistical, but like, self-aware.

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I guess.

287
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Like, introspective.

288
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Well, I don't think I do that at all.

289
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Like, in my videos, I just-

290
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Um.

291
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
I don't think so.

292
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I haven't tried.

293
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
If I have, I haven't planned it.

294
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Uh-huh.

295
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,840
You do incorporate like your specific, I don't know, like your personality totally shines through in your reviews in a really great way.

296
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I think with Hippocrite, I think it's built into the reviews because specifically of what games you talk about.

297
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
That's true.

298
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Because you have exclusively covered like PS2 and PS1 games that are from like a very specific type of era and genre.

299
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
And I think that more than anything speaks, that gives it a narrative.

300
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Because like, when I think of games Hippocrite likes, all I think is like, he's into PS2 platformers.

301
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
You know, like it's all like mascot platformers games like that.

302
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
And I think it inherently creates a narrative out of that.

303
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Like, kind of like how, did any of you guys feel back in the day with Jon Tron, that whenever he talked about a modern game, it was really weird?

304
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Because you were used to him just talking about like Super Nintendo and N64 games?

305
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Yeah, that is weird.

306
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Yeah, and so when he talked about like a new game, it was like, oh, Jon, I mean, I mean, logically you know he must play a new game.

307
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Yeah, it doesn't feel as like Jon Tron when he did his like Final Fantasy XIII.

308
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
I like that.

309
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
I mean, it was great.

310
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Sounds like a straight video.

311
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
It's always a little odd when he cut like a...

313
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
It's not what I expected.

314
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Yeah.

315
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Or that Valiant Hearts video.

316
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
That was the weirdest to me.

317
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
That was weird.

318
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:09,840
It was some random indie game thing that he bought and it's like, oh, you know, I'm used to you talking about like nostalgia and talking about classic games and talking, you know...

319
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,840
That was him like defying his own, like, what he had determined as the reviewer rules for himself.

320
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
That was him going, I mean, not that he had to.

321
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
I'm just saying...

322
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:28,840
I don't mind it, but I'm just saying that like, I just think that he had inadvertently created a narrative out of his videos where if you've seen the...

323
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:39,840
His Top 10 Super Nintendo games, for instance, where he goes on like this long, impassioned speech at the end about like, why these games were so special and why we feel nostalgia for them and stuff like that.

324
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,840
And then like, you look at all the rest of his videos and it's all these nostalgic games and like, it feels like that's what the point is in a way.

325
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,840
And then when he starts talking about like movies, then it's like, oh, I guess you also cover weird movies?

326
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
True.

327
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Now that feels normal.

328
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
But when he initially saw that, it was definitely...it works for him, though.

329
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
That's why Jesse has multiple channels for multiple narratives.

330
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Yeah, but I don't think that's ever really helped.

331
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,840
I think it always helps your...well, I guess it depends on what you're doing.

332
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,840
But in general, I think having him on one channel is helpful, you know?

333
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:25,840
I think it works out for Jesse because each channel has such a distinct personality where it's like, I mean, you can tell they're all him, but like...

334
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,840
My Japanese anime is one type of video and Endless Jazz is not that type of video necessarily.

335
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,840
And by the way, we're not just complimenting each other because we're friends.

336
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
We became friends because we like one other's videos.

337
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
So there's a reason why we're so biased, by the way.

338
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,840
I think all my channels are less connected by content or less distinctive by content in the yard by like, theme or attitude.

339
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
That's very true.

340
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Shit, I forgot what I was gonna go on to.

341
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,840
We could let Gib give his thoughts because I don't think he really gave his about what he has for out of a...

342
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
And Jesse, both of you.

343
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:12,840
What are some things that you see either in other reviews that you don't like or that you wish more people would do in their reviews?

344
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Is there some thing that you wish everyone would gravitate towards?

345
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,840
I hate scores, but we've already kind of talked about that.

346
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Yeah, I don't know.

347
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Most reviewers that are just sort of uninteresting to me, it's because...

348
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
I don't know.

349
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Who are your favorites? Old John Tron?

350
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Yeah, John Tron is pretty great.

351
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
AVGN is probably still my favorite.

352
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Sure, sure.

353
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,840
He was great at creating a narrative out of the video just by where he was.

354
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Davoo has often said that The Nerd's Basement is the greatest location in all of our viewers.

355
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Well, except maybe Jesse's basement.

356
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
That's what I've said, Jesse's basement.

357
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
But The Nerd is a pretty second place.

358
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Right, because with The Nerd, all he would do is show you two pictures of where he is,

359
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,840
and you immediately have this sense of, I'm in that room, I'm playing games with him.

360
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,840
He'll show you the old console, he'll show you the old TV he's playing it on,

361
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,840
he'll show you where he is, and you feel like you're in that room with him playing that game.

362
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,840
And I think a lot of people don't capture that because they try to do the same thing,

363
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
but they have normal looking rooms.

364
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
People are just, yeah, I'm in my room.

365
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,840
With The Nerd, you felt like you were in this place where time has not passed 1985 kind of thing.

366
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,840
He's playing on the old system, on the old TV.

367
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
In an old room.

368
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,840
And a lot of people, yeah, they kind of don't go all the way with that.

369
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,840
They'll just set up a set of Nerd stuff just barely in the frame of the camera.

370
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,840
I get pretty triggered every time I see a millennial standing in front of their Amiibo collection

371
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
and their Zelda poster.

372
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
It's just fucking in my life.

373
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,840
It's just not good cinematography when you can tell all their posters and figures begins and ends

374
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
within the frame of the camera.

375
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Yeah, yeah.

376
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,840
I love, because Jesse will do these things with his set where he'll reorganize all of his posters

377
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
just for the sake of a video.

378
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,840
He built, I kind of copied this myself, but not nearly to the same extent,

379
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,840
where he sort of built each area of his room to be a different theme.

380
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,840
So like, there's a wrestling corner, there's like a pony corner,

381
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,840
there's a, you know, an Evangelion corner, and like, if he's talking about those,

382
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,840
like, go watch the Fuck Blue Ray video where it's like, he'd carefully put all the Eva figures on the desk

383
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
or the wonderful Waifus videos where it'll be like his Waifus corner.

384
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
The Waifus wall.

385
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah.

386
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah.

387
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Very proud of it.

388
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,840
And like, and I like that because I like the idea that it's like,

389
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,840
it's not just that I wanted my collection in the background.

390
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,840
It's that there's a thematic relevance to my collection, you know.

391
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Right.

392
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,840
And there's a video that I'm, we'll say, working on.

393
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I've been trying not to talk about this video because I'm scared it won't get done if I do.

394
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Sure.

395
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,840
But I started it off with like a collection shot, but I had the camera vertical,

396
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
like, because it's on my phone.

397
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,840
So I did like a vertical filming of just one shelf that has like all my DVDs on it

398
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
because I'm literally talking about my DVDs.

399
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,840
And then like, I walk into the frame and then I pan the camera and slowly until it takes up the whole frame.

400
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,840
So like, it's not me standing in front of my collection.

401
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,840
It's like, the collection is the subject of the video, you know.

402
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Sure.

403
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Sure.

404
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
That's of course totally fine.

405
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Quite proud of the way I did that, but I don't know if anyone will see it

406
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
and know exactly what I'm talking about anytime soon.

407
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I do like all that like live action stuff.

408
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,840
But I also do like the some people who just don't go on camera at all, like Matthew Matosis.

409
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Like there's something about the fact that he's just talking about the game

411
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
and there's like nothing really about him.

412
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Occasionally there's like a tiny glimpse into his, his emotions.

413
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,840
You know, I'm with you because that reminds me of something I hate,

414
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
which is arbitrary shots of you.

415
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Like if you don't need to be in the video, like I'm working on a video now that I already recorded a big live action thing.

416
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,840
So like to justify that big ending thing, I need to start it with a live action thing or it'll be weird.

417
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
So it may, you know, it's going to work.

418
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,840
But like when people just start, they're like, hey guys, today we're talking about the new Zelda game that just came out.

419
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
It's pretty good.

420
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Me and my friends have played it.

421
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
And then they end it with like, okay, everybody, thanks for watching.

422
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Hope you'll stay and subscribe.

423
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I got more Zelda videos coming next week.

424
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Fuck Zelda, man.

425
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Fucking.

426
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Yeah.

427
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Actually, I've remembered what I hate the most.

428
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Oh, good.

429
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,840
Attempts at comedy when you're not very funny.

430
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Yeah.

431
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Please stop it.

432
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,840
I mean, I don't hate them for trying, but man, do I hate it when I hear them.

433
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
I hate them specifically for trying.

434
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Trying to force things that you're not good at in general is annoying to me.

435
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Like people start doing reviews and they get off the mindset that like, okay, I need a live action segment and I need a joke here and I need this because everyone else does that.

436
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,840
And then they'll get on camera and it's like, you can tell that they know they don't have the camera presence or the charisma yet.

437
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,840
It's that kind of copying the formula of someone without having the baseline skills.

438
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:39,840
And I do accept that to get good at something, you should probably do it if you want to get good at it, but it's also annoying and you shouldn't fuck you and don't do it.

439
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I think a lot of it's a sign of like a lack of confidence in your own skills because like, this is the fastest way to get me to close out of your anime review.

440
00:28:46,840 --> 00:29:03,840
And a lot of anime reviews in particular are like this because like, basically, I think that a formula got sort of created in anime reviews like early on and then everyone copied it where they all wanted to have like a really, really well produced intro, which is completely useless.

441
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:14,840
No, it's usually more like an artsy looking like, you know, like very clean, like legitimately well produced, but I don't want to see that.

442
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Like I don't need 30 seconds of intro. I just want to know what the point of your fucking video is.

443
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,840
And then they'll always start off, like they'll start talking about the show and then they'll say, this is the number one line that'll make me close your video.

444
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Insert joke about this here.

445
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
That phrase.

446
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Anyone who says insert joke here and I'm like, so in other words, you don't have a joke, but you think you need a joke because you're not confident in your own skills as a reviewer.

447
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
You think that people will only watch a video who has jokes, but you don't have jokes.

448
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,840
So instead, you tried to make a joke out of the fact that you don't have jokes.

449
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
That's something you've encountered multiple times.

450
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Oh my God, all the time.

451
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
I've seen it. I've seen it all the time.

452
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
I don't watch anime reviews that much. I don't seek them out.

453
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Yeah. Well, there was a time where someone on Twitter posted every anime reviewer they followed just randomly and I was like, I'm just going to look at all these guys.

454
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:23,840
And then I just kept all of them had the same, because a lot of them had literally taken template elements that somebody made and everyone had the same DMCA opening screen thing where it's like, this is fair use.

455
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,840
They had the exact same fair use screen on multiple channels.

456
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Create your own review software 2016. Just bad opinions.

457
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Yeah. And then everyone feels like they need to have jokes, but then all the jokes end up being about how they're not funny.

458
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,840
And I'm like, stop. Stop. Take that out. I know you're not funny.

459
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,840
I think this is good advice, not just for reviews, but for anything.

460
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Accentuate your positives and hide your negatives as much as you possibly can.

461
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Yeah. I've been thinking like in the recent scripts I've been writing that I instinctively write a lot of jokes where it's like scream really loud, but I'm not very good at that.

462
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I need to start cutting that down because I've seen stuff like Jesse's content where he screams, it's like, whoa, that's cool. That's really funny. I want to do that.

463
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
But I tried and I can't do it.

464
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:33,840
That process, anytime you do anything that you're going to, because it's great to take inspiration from other video makers or anything from life, but always ask yourself, what is the me version of this going to sound like?

465
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Because when it comes to recording, I do a couple takes and I hate it, so I usually end up cutting it anyway.

466
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Sometimes they get through.

467
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Video editing process. Record something. Hate the whole thing. Trash it all.

468
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,840
This is why we don't get new hypocrite videos, if anyone was wondering.

469
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Speaking of you complaining about insert joke here, I know you also have a beef with pronunciation of a word. How do I pronounce the word?

470
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I don't know how to pronounce the word.

471
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Did you complain about mispronouncing words?

472
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
No, no, no. It's the joke.

473
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Yeah, it's when they go like...

474
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Studio Ghibli? Studio Ghibli? I don't fucking know. I'm a gook. Hilarious.

475
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,840
It's like, and I know why they do it. It's to deflect people complaining about their pronunciation.

476
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Because you've gotten a lot of that in some of your videos. You get that every day.

477
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Yeah, I'm always getting complaints.

478
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Those are fine. You can do that. Just don't dwell on it and just fucking motor past it.

479
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,840
I did one of the monster musume that was pretty much that, but I legitimately did not know how to pronounce that word.

480
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,840
I didn't fucking dwell on it. I just moved along.

481
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Did you eventually just dealt with it and decided to start pronouncing everything right? Because you hate those comments so much.

482
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
That's a good way to go.

483
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Sometimes I pronounce it right.

484
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I have been more and more like, now I've been trying to say niche instead of niche, because people complain every time I say niche.

485
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,840
That's just how I pronounce the word in my everyday life.

486
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,840
But yeah, with the Eva videos that I did, I kept saying Eva and Gelyon, because that's just how I say it, and people were complaining about it.

487
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
In one of the videos I go,

488
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
And no one complained.

489
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Yeah, no one complained, but also nobody got that that's why I was saying it that way.

490
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
It was to show that I know how it's really pronounced.

491
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,840
It is usually funnier to just mispronounce it deliberately.

492
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
That's true.

493
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Hey bonus round, rule for commenters.

494
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,840
If you think someone else has already wrote the comment, either look for the comment and thumb it up or leave. Please.

495
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
We can do a whole other podcast about rules for comment.

496
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,840
That's a teaser for the rules for commenters, which will be probably 7 hours of us just talking about how much we hate everyone.

497
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Yeah.

498
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,840
I think we could get every reviewer ever on board for that podcast. Everyone will have it.

499
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Let's get PewDiePie in here, guys.

500
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Oh god. He's got his own forum for comments.

501
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Well to be honest, these days everyone's got their own subreddit.

502
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,840
We've got our own subreddit, guys. You can go click on it.

503
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Link in the description. Go talk about it.

504
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Alright, here's one that's a little bit deeper that I want to talk about about reviewer rules.

505
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,840
So we were discussing the idea of bringing up this podcast.

506
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,840
It's kind of fucked up that I'm going to do this when he wanted to be here and I didn't let him come on.

507
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,840
But Jeff Do of Mother's Basement was talking about how...

508
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
You didn't let him come in and he wanted to.

509
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,840
He was like, oh, because I said we were going to do reviewer rules and he was like, oh man, I want to be a part of that.

510
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:49,840
But I think he was more under the impression we'd be talking about rules that we want to follow as opposed to where I was thinking this is going to be us complaining about other reviewer's rules.

511
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,840
But he was saying that to him it's important that you either...

512
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:05,840
There's a distinction between recommending things and judging them based on what the creator's intent was.

513
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,840
He was saying a review should be about figuring out how well they did the thing they set out to do.

514
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,840
And I feel the total opposite of that.

515
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,840
And I think it's just not a review. I think that's a critique.

516
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,840
That's an interesting conversation to have, I think, about something.

517
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Yeah, well, because I think a critique of something is where you look at what they tried to do and you judge them on that.

518
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:35,840
And I think the most ideal way to critique something is if it's literally they're in the room with you.

519
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I think I would want something critiqued before I release it.

520
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Let's say someone writes a video and they send it to me and they say, like, what do you think?

521
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Then that's when I'm going to try to figure out, like, all right, well, what are you trying to say?

522
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,840
And here's how well I think you accomplished that.

523
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
And then you can put it out.

524
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,840
And there's an extent to which you can do that in video form where if you know, especially if you know a lot about the creator,

525
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,840
you know a lot about the background of the thing, then you can say, well, here's what they seem to be trying to do.

526
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
And here's how well they did it.

527
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
You can never really know because you're not the one who made it.

528
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
So it's always going to be taken.

529
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,840
And people treat those kind of reviews like those are the objective ones.

530
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
People treat those like those are the best kind.

531
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,840
It's like, oh, I'm judging how well they did their job.

532
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
And it's like, yeah, but you don't really know what their job was.

533
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
You don't really know.

534
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,840
A lot of people fancy the interpretive ones.

535
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,840
This is what that person really means in their life as like the most intellectual highbrow ones,

536
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Aaron's signal, I guess, is doing.

537
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,840
And then he critiqued himself for doing it.

538
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
And I'm like, what the heck are you talking about?

539
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,840
If you don't know what they're like, then don't.

540
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Just talk about what seems obvious and ignore anything that doesn't seem obvious.

541
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,840
And like, I mean, there's an extent to which you can like talk about what you think a creator like.

542
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,840
I did that whole Hidey Echiano video where I had some information to go on.

543
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Right. And constantly throughout it, I'm like, by the way, this is all speculation.

544
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,840
I don't know Hidey Echiano, but here's some interesting things that you might think about him through what he said.

545
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Sure. Or he'd be like taking like Suda51's games.

546
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Be like, oh, he's clearly like misogynistic.

547
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,840
He fucking hates women. He's all about male empowerment.

548
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
He likes to jack off all the time.

549
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Well, you don't fucking know the guy.

550
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,840
I made a pretty long video on Alexey Pajanov, the guy who made Tetris.

551
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,840
And I don't think I said anything about like, he's the kind of guy who would make this kind of game.

552
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I just went down the list of all the games he made and tried to make him seem like a cool, funny guy because he is.

553
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,840
So I just wanted it and I just let him let anyone watching it think about him the way they would think about a normal person.

554
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I didn't inject any of my own interpretation.

555
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,840
All right. Well, here's where I'm going to take this a little bit farther and maybe maybe you guys will contest me on this.

556
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:58,840
But OK, here's I think also that reviewing like, especially with video games, I think that reviewing just the version that came out and that was packaged by the company.

557
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Is less relevant than reviewing the version that people will actually play with all the mods on it and stuff like I agree.

558
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,840
I think like, for instance, to give an example, like Super Bunny Hot made a video about Fallout 4, right?

559
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,840
And he was talking about he was critiquing the game and everything and like going in depth about it.

560
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:26,840
And then he says, like, you know, this game will probably get a bunch of mods that will make it way more interesting and better and playable.

561
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Right. And like one of the things he complained about was the dialogue options and how they don't tell you the correct dialogue.

562
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Right. Well, then like a day later, a mod comes out that fixes that.

563
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:48,840
So anyone who had, like to me, I think the most helpful review of Fallout 4 would be a review that says, hey, if you're going to play this game, download these mods.

564
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Here's my experience now that I've done that, you know, because that's going to be, I think ultimately for, for instance, with a game like Skyrim.

565
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Or like everyone plays it with mods, like no one just plays vanilla Skyrim on PC like past the first couple months that it was out.

566
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,840
And unless they're like someone who's a purist who only wants to play the pure version.

567
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:16,840
But like, I feel like we need the reviewer who comes in and says, all right, here's the version that you guys are actually playing.

568
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,840
And here's why that version is relevant to like culture, you know.

569
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Super Bunny Hop is good about that in that he's not ignorant of that at all.

570
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:31,840
He's very willing to talk about it. And you know, I do actually like your suggestion a lot that he should do another review of it when like all the mods are out.

571
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
I think that'd be a very useful exercise.

572
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:43,840
But you know, really, I don't think that it's useless to do an initial release, but I think his goal for that video, and as he stated, was to talk about the game as it was released.

573
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,840
And I think it's fine to do that, but I just want to see more of both. And he is good about it.

574
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Like he did a, he did his Metal Gear Solid 5 review.

575
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
Yeah.

576
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,840
And Jesus Christ, some fucking loud ass motorcycle.

577
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,840
He did his Metal Gear Solid 5 review and then he came back like two weeks later and did a video just about achieving 100% in the game.

578
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Right.

579
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Because he kept going.

580
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Which is very interesting.

581
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Right. And that's something that not, not everyone's going to do, but a lot of people, that's their version of Metal Gear Solid 5.

582
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
And like he gave voice to those people.

583
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Yeah.

584
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:28,840
I think, I think my biggest problem with video game reviews is that the format of them, and especially with professional ones, like if you work for a review website, then you're encouraged to play this game in like two days.

585
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Right.

586
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Yeah. You'll probably give it a 10 out of 10 because it looks really good on the surface.

587
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:42,840
And the play, the gameplay is super tight, but oh, they fucked up the entire story. Oh, it has no real ending. Oh, it fucks up everything about the lore.

588
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Oh, it's not replayable.

589
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Turns out it's not that good.

590
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Yeah.

591
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,840
You're trying these games at like reviewer events where everything is, you know, set up to make you like the game.

592
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Or if you're someone who has to play a game every week, you know, then like your experience with games is not really what normal people's experience with games is.

593
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:08,840
And so many people critique the reviewer events thing, but they don't realize that just being a reviewer, a professional IGN game spot reviewer already colors your perspective quite a bit.

594
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,840
The funny thing is, you know, you know who those reviews are for? They're for other professional reviewers.

595
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
That's who those are useful for.

596
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Yeah, like, and, you know, I've praised before how I love that Yahtzee, like, admits all of this up front in his videos.

597
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,840
He'll be like, hey, I only have a week to play this game. I didn't get very far in it, and it's not my kind of game.

598
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Where he often will give his Game of the Year awards based on which games actually got him to play it for more than a week after he was done reviewing it, which makes perfect sense.

599
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,840
He says, my attention span has degraded to almost nothing as a result of being a reviewer.

600
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,840
So anything that I keep wanting to play for more than a week must be the best.

601
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:58,840
And like, I think that's great because I don't think a lot of people watch Yahtzee for his actual, like, as a recommendation.

602
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I don't think many people watch him that way. People watch him because he's funny, and, you know, I don't think there's a lot of gamers who have the same taste as Yahtzee.

603
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Like, he's so particular. He likes this certain type of narrative-driven, like, anything that's like Half-Life.

604
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Like, the closer it is to Half-Life, the more he likes it, you know?

605
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Half-Life 1, specifically, I think.

606
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Yeah, both of them. He loves Half-Life 2.

607
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Isn't his favorite game Silent Hill 2? That's his number one, right?

608
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Yeah, Silent Hill 2, Half-Life 1, or Prince of Persia, like, those are like...

609
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah, Prince of Persia 2.

610
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
No, the first one.

611
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Oh, really? Oh, okay.

612
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,840
No, 2 is not nearly as good as 1.

613
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Well, Spider-Man 2, that's what it was.

614
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,840
That's like one of his, like, joke favorite games ever.

615
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
What, Spider-Man 2?

616
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
No.

617
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Yeah, he's like, that's a game that he considers one of his favorites because of the experience he had playing it.

618
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Well, whatever.

619
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
He had a top five list, but he thought it was a joke.

620
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Spider-Man 2 is pretty awesome.

621
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Yeah.

622
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Alright, enough about fucking Yahtzee's favorite games.

623
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Like, the point is that, like, he addresses the way that he plays the games, and I think more people should do that,

624
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,840
and I think we need more reviews that address the way people actually interact with art.

625
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
Yes.

626
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,840
That aren't us trying to say, like, well, here's what the creator and Ten did, and here's how well they did that,

627
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,840
because that's, like, totally irrelevant to any person watching your review.

628
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
Right.

629
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Like, I think what your review should, like, and I mean, I'm not saying that every review should be this,

630
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,840
do whatever you want, you know, like, do whatever you're passionate about,

631
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,840
but I want to see more that are about, like, the cultural context of it,

632
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
and the way that people feel about it.

633
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Like, if your review of Fallout 4 doesn't address the way that most people played it,

634
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,840
and the way that most people feel about it,

635
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
then who is it for?

636
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Because it may be for some, it may be for a niche, it may be for the way you experienced it,

637
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,840
and there may be some people who relate to that, or outsiders who think it's interesting.

638
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Like, I think, like, the Jesse-style, Anthony C-style that's my ideal is a niche thing.

639
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,840
It's not like everyone's looking for, like, epic stories in their reviews.

640
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,840
But Lord knows I want more of it.

641
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Yeah, I just want more reviews that are, like, to me, the interesting thing about art is

642
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,840
how it speaks to the human condition, how it speaks to you personally,

643
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,840
how it affects you, and how you interact with it.

644
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,840
I guess the question is, do we count reviews as art?

645
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
I mean, obviously we do, but do people give a shit?

646
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I absolutely think, and I think it, I think this argument has always been happening for all time,

647
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,840
and that we are on the right side of history.

648
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,840
But like, there's a classic, there's a huge write-up by Oscar Wilde called,

649
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,840
which, you know, this is from, like, 1890 or something, called, like, on criticism as art.

650
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Like, it's a huge fucking thing.

651
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,840
It's presented as a conversation between two guys, where basically one guy is just telling this other guy

652
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,840
in extremely long-winded form that reviews are art, you know,

653
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
and like, he makes all the same points anyone else has made.

654
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,840
So as far as I'm concerned, like, this is a non-issue that's been around since the 1800s.

655
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,840
I gotta read that shit. That sounds awesome.

656
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,840
I couldn't make it through it, because it's very flowery.

657
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,840
I obviously agree that a review can be art.

658
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,840
But I don't think that reviewers should just consider themselves artists as a matter of fact.

659
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
Sure, sure.

660
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,840
It's, I mean, for one reason or another, I don't feel as creatively fulfilled.

661
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,840
In general, I do have a severe lack of respect for criticism in general.

662
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Yeah.

663
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,840
It's a weird thing. If I, like, draw a picture, even if it sucks, I'm like,

664
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,840
yeah, if I make a video, even if it's pretty good, I'm like,

665
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,840
alright, I'm not quite as into it.

666
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,840
It never gives me quite the same high.

667
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:46,840
In order for me to feel like a review has become, has value beyond being a critique,

668
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:53,840
is if it adds anything of its own that's creative or interesting beyond the deep portion of it.

669
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I absolutely regard all of my videos as high art, so.

670
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Well, so do we all.

671
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Well, because I like, like, to me, I enjoy analysis videos almost more than I enjoy media.

672
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,840
You know, like, I spend most of my time watching YouTube analysis videos.

673
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,840
So, like, to me, some of those are some of my favorite things.

674
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Some of those are more rewatchable, you know?

675
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,840
And like, if it was something like Sequelitis, you could make the case like,

676
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,840
yeah, well, it's also funny, and it's got obvious artistic elements.

677
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,840
But then with something like a YMS video, like the After Earth one that DeVu was talking about,

678
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,840
like, that's one of my favorite videos because of what he brought to it.

679
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Like, even though it's just about the movie, it's just about the context,

680
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,840
but the way it's presented, it's basically a documentary.

681
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,840
And I think documentaries are art, you know?

682
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Like, it's about taking the work that exists and then making something out of it.

683
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,840
And I think making art is generally that anyways.

684
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,840
You're taking something that's in your head and you're making something out of it.

685
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,840
You're taking the world around you and you're making something out of it.

686
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,840
I think that's fucking copyright infringement and everyone who does that needs to get shut the fuck down.

687
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
Yeah.

688
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,840
Well, before we move on from the list of things, rules for reviews,

689
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,840
I do have a big list that I jotted down.

690
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
Oh, cool.

691
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
Oh, let's hear it.

692
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
Of things that piss me off in reviews.

693
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
And there's quite a few of them.

694
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,840
I'll get through them all.

695
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
I preemptively apologize.

696
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,840
I'll elaborate on the ones that need elaborating.

697
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:35,840
And before anyone in the comments tries to catch me in some active hypocrisy or contradiction,

698
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,840
I will admit up front that in the past I have been guilty of some of these things

699
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,840
and arguably continue to be guilty of some of these things,

700
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,840
but there's still things that I fucking hate.

701
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Art hypocrites are boring anyway.

702
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
So anyone in the comments section trying to scream,

703
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,840
gotcha, you can blow me, you can all go right to hell.

704
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Okay.

705
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Now that we've primed them for the list, let's hear it.

706
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,840
So the first thing I wrote is jump cuts.

707
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
I hate jump cuts.

708
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
They should never exist for any reason.

709
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
But Jethy, you've done jump cuts.

710
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
I've seen them in your videos.

711
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Yes, you have.

712
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
Come on.

713
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Well, I have a contingency for my use of jump cuts

714
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,840
because I only use them in Man Child Incorporated,

715
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,840
which is specifically designed to have no soul

716
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,840
and to be a satire of soulless channels,

717
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,840
even though I fail at that because I can't make videos with no soul.

718
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Jethy, why didn't you film Horseshoe Finale in one take?

719
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Why wasn't that a one take video?

720
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,840
Your editing was lazy and I think you should step up your game.

721
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
No.

722
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
What?

723
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
No.

724
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
No, shut up.

725
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
One take, Jethy.

726
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
How would he do all the customizing?

727
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,840
First of all, motherfucker, I did film it all in one take.

728
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Every fucking shot in that video is a fucking five minute rant,

729
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
at least, that I did in one fucking take.

730
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,840
The only reason I didn't just cut that all

731
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,840
is because I don't have the power to teleport around my fucking room.

732
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,840
All right, stop arguing with Nate's fake straw man

733
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,840
and get back to your points.

734
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Anyways, jump cuts are obnoxious and alike.

735
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,840
If you jump it around the room, you're just fucking stupid.

736
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,840
If you have a script, you should fucking memorize your script

737
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,840
and put some goddamn effort into it.

738
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
I don't need you cutting every fucking sentence.

739
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,840
Alternatively, there's two easy solutions that get rid of jump cuts.

740
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,840
You do one of them a lot, which is just,

741
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,840
if you don't have to do jump cuts, just cut to not you.

742
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Like, cut, if you can't memorize the whole script,

743
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,840
say the first paragraph on camera,

744
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,840
say the second paragraph on a microphone,

745
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
say the third paragraph on camera.

746
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
You can cut back and forth.

747
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840
You can find creative ways to get around it

748
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,840
without fucking just jumping to yourself from yourself.

749
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,840
Method number two, be somewhere else.

750
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,840
I've done this where I've recorded each paragraph

751
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,840
with a different, like, instead of jump cutting,

752
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,840
I'm just not in the same place anymore.

753
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
It looks like I changed backgrounds

754
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
and now it's a new place and I'm saying the next paragraph.

755
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,840
I guess to be specific, I'm not talking about cuts in general.

756
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,840
I'm talking about specifically...

757
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,840
Well, I'm just saying that cuts are how you get around jump cuts.

758
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
If we take this long to talk about every point,

759
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,840
we're gonna be here all night.

760
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,840
I don't care how long we take.

761
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,840
My points are gold, baby.

762
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,840
It's gonna be as long as it needs to be, all right?

763
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Okay.

764
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,840
I'm leading this discussion, god damn it.

765
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,840
That's true.

766
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,840
The next thing I wrote down is a big one for me,

767
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,840
a big pet peeve, unscripted, stammering, stuttering bullshit.

768
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,840
Jesse, why don't you want people to be real?

769
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,840
Why are you trying to put people in a box?

770
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Just let them be real on camera, Jesse, huh?

771
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,840
If you can't be articulate, you don't deserve to be real.

772
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,840
If you're in front of a camera, like, fucking,

773
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,840
alpha, mega-sin, and every other word out of your mouth,

774
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,840
you can't even form a complete sense.

775
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Yeah, exactly.

776
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Again, play to your strengths.

777
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Don't play to your weaknesses.

778
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,840
Don't be a YouTuber just because you think being a YouTuber is cool.

779
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,840
Do it because you actually are articulate,

780
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
and you couldn't do this.

781
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,840
Not to throw shade on any other YouTubers in particular,

782
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,840
but when I'm going down the list of things I hate,

783
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,840
it's gonna be kind of unavoidable.

784
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,840
Fuck that guy.

785
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
I think it's fine to give an example.

786
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Then people can see what you're talking about.

787
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Yeah, alpha, mega-sin is really bad at that.

788
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,840
His videos always lose me in the first minute.

789
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
I can't get through them,

790
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,840
because he just can't put a sentence together.

791
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,840
Yep, it's bizarre, and that's what people subscribe for.

792
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
He's inarticulate rambling, but whatever.

793
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Let's move on.

794
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,840
The next thing is lack of self-awareness.

795
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,840
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

796
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

797
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Now, I'm a firm believer of anything on this list

798
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
that I'm going to complain about,

799
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,840
you can get away with it if you're self-aware about how stupid it is,

800
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,840
which is something that I have utilized to great effect numerous times.

801
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,840
I do stupid shit in my videos,

802
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,840
but it's always with my tongue in my cheek,

803
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
and that's where your tongue should be.

804
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
You shouldn't...

805
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
Okay, I've explained that one enough.

806
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Yeah.

807
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
The next one.

808
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
Tongue punching the brown eye.

809
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,840
The brown eye, not my ass cheek.

810
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,840
What the fuck?

811
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,840
Yeah.

812
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Dismissiveness of other viewpoints or opinions.

813
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
Ding, ding.

814
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Sorry.

815
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
Oh, man, yeah.

816
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,840
That one, that will kill me.

817
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
You don't have to start every review with,

818
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,840
by the way, this is subjective and it's just my opinion.

819
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
I'm not saying you have to do that,

820
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,840
but don't do the opposite either.

821
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,840
Don't be like, if you like this, you're stupid.

822
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,840
That's gay.

823
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
You're gay to do that.

824
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,840
Yeah, that's pretty gay.

825
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,840
If you like saying, if you like this, you're stupid, then you're stupid.

826
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,840
Oh, and then when you're called out on it, don't own up to it.

827
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Don't just say, oh, I'm just having fun.

828
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
Oh, yeah.

829
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
That's the part of reflection thing that happened.

830
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Yeah.

831
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,840
Yeah, this kind of part of reflection has made this...

832
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,840
This is what I ran to him about in the Blood Board video

833
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,840
if you haven't watched it already,

834
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,840
but he just kind of took potshots at Kayon

835
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,840
and then was like, oh, but I'm sure people like it for a reason.

836
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840
And I was like, dude, what the fuck, man?

837
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,840
You're clearly insulting the people who like this show

838
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,840
and then trying to play it off like they're not.

839
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,840
He was taking potshots at the people who like it for just being weirdos.

840
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
That's true.

841
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,840
He specifically insulted people who liked it, so that's not cool, bro.

842
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,840
Yeah, I mean, you're...

843
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,840
I think any self-importance of that kind is really annoying in a review

844
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,840
where it's like, I'm the arbiter of what taste is

845
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,840
and it's like, dude, you're just some guy who has an opinion.

846
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,840
Your opinion might be interesting

847
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,840
and a lot of people might feel the same way that you do,

848
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,840
but you are not the arbiter of taste.

849
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,840
I mean, this is what that anime snob's entire career is.

850
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,840
Which it goes back to lack of self-awareness.

851
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,840
You should have, as a critic, you should have the self-awareness

852
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,840
to know that your word is not fucking law.

853
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,840
And then act on that self-awareness by acting self-aware.

854
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Don't just be self-aware or claim you are.

855
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,840
No one's gonna know if you are self-aware and just don't do anything with it.

856
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Well, I think that's what Davoo is saying.

857
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,840
It's like that departed reflections guy was like kind of claiming that like,

858
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,840
hey, it's just a joke, bro.

859
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,840
I'm not taking my videos that seriously.

860
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,840
You need to modify your content to make the videos.

861
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Right, right.

862
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Alright, the next one is the big pet peeve of mine,

863
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,840
and even bigger than the last one that was big.

864
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,840
And that's the recap reviews.

865
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,840
And I'm talking specifically about the That Guy with the Glasses Doug Walker formula,

866
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,840
where you're fucking, instead of actually writing a think piece

867
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,840
or an editorial or a fucking opinion about something,

868
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,840
instead you go through the whole goddamn movie,

869
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,840
scene by scene, for 25 fucking minutes,

870
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,840
and just every scene you gotta make some glib comment about,

871
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,840
like, the way that the nostalgia critic does.

872
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,840
Every one copies it, and it's a horrible fucking format.

873
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,840
You know, the only thing...

874
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,840
Yeah, no, you're totally right.

875
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,840
And that was really bad when he would just play footage and do that.

876
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,840
I like that he now does like all live-action reenactments.

877
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,840
That in itself is kind of cool, but the formula is garbage.

878
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Like, I understand that people want to copy him because he's popular,

879
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,840
and everybody starts out copying somebody, but...

880
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Just remember, everyone's copying it because it's the easiest format.

881
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,840
If you're gonna copy someone's format, copy any other format.

882
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,840
That's a terrible way to critique something.

883
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,840
It's an okay format for movies, because John Tron did that with Birdemic.

884
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,840
He just went through it, and he made jokes.

885
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
But he's so funny, you know?

886
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,840
I know, he made up for it with the jokes.

887
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,840
I think, and we kind of discussed this last night when we were just talking,

888
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:25,840
but I think the only value for that is when it's something that no one's heard of,

889
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
then going through the whole...

890
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,840
If you're talking about some completely forgotten piece of 90s garbage

891
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,840
that no one remembers, and then you describe the whole thing...

892
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Because that's kind of what YMS does, is that he'll take a shitty movie that no one watched,

893
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,840
and then he'll break it down every single scene.

894
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
By all means, go ahead and do it.

895
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,840
That was my first introduction to The Room, watching Nostalgia Critic's video on it,

896
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,840
and I loved that video because I had no idea what The Room was, and it was like,

897
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,840
holy shit, this is amazing.

898
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:59,840
I think when you start applying that formula to reviews of shit that people actually are watching,

899
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,840
then it's like, we all know what the movie was.

900
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,840
You're not pulling the veil over our eyes with the way you're describing it.

901
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,840
If Ben were here, he would be screaming about how much he hates it.

902
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,840
And railing against the heavens about this point.

903
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,840
Ben, I'm here for you, brother.

904
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Just like me, do that format. Any actual content is incidental.

905
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,840
Any analytical point will just happen at some random point in the video

906
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,840
based on when it happens in the plot.

907
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,840
At the end, Doug Walker always does...

908
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,840
At the end, he'll be like, wait, I understand now.

909
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,840
It all makes sense to me, and then he'll play the sad music,

910
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
and be like, you know, at the end of the day,

911
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,840
maybe Mad Max isn't about angry men and lesbian women.

912
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,840
It's about being a family, or whatever, you know?

913
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,840
Yeah, some completely obvious conclusions.

914
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,840
And it doesn't even make...

915
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,840
It doesn't logically follow from what happens,

916
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,840
or it's so obvious that there was no need to do any of this.

917
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
So, fuck off, Doug.

918
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,840
Bonus rule, don't make your points more dramatic

919
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,840
and make it out to be more interesting than they are, unless that's the joke.

920
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,840
You have to justify it.

921
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,840
If you're going to play the sappy music, you better have a good fucking reason.

922
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
Something interesting.

923
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,840
Biggest critique I think we all have of Nerdwriter.

924
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,840
This is a good point.

925
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,840
Yes, overly sappy shit when it is not justified is a huge trigger.

926
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Like the Planket Reviews of Star Wars,

927
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,840
he waited until, you know, two and a half hours

928
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
and then really lay down the big...

929
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,840
Yeah, and it was epic.

930
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
The payoff was fucking...

931
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Oh, yeah, it's the best.

932
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,840
And I like to think I achieved something similar

933
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
in my Girl and Login video with its 40 minutes,

934
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,840
and then at the end, it all ramps up to it's like,

935
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,840
holy shit, guys, boom, you've listened to this shit.

936
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Yeah, you know.

937
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Alright, Jesse, continue your list.

938
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,840
Alright, the next one, I needed some clarification for it

939
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,840
because I'm a big doer of this.

940
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
That's a stupid way.

941
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
I'm Alpha Omega Cent right now.

942
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
I can't...

943
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,840
Continuity, specifically high stakes continuity.

944
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,840
Now, I'll explain what I mean by this.

945
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,840
I do continuity in all my videos.

946
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Every fucking thing I put out

947
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
has some kind of connection in it,

948
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,840
because that's what I like, and it's fun and it's cool.

949
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,840
But the storylines or the stories that I'm telling

950
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
are all very low stakes.

951
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,840
They're just about me being an idiot and a crazy person

952
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,840
and living in my own madness here in a fucking basement.

953
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
What I hate is when people, again, no self-awareness,

954
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
they take it so seriously,

955
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,840
like you'll watch a Linkara video or a Nostalgia Critic video,

956
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,840
and some guy comes into the gun,

957
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,840
and he's like, we gotta save the world

958
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,840
by reviewing this fucking movie from 20 years ago.

959
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
It's the only way to stop the evil overlord,

960
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,840
and the evil overlord is just like him in a different hat.

961
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
Yeah, yeah.

962
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
If it's self-aware, it can be okay.

963
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Yeah, there's sort of things that did start as a joke,

964
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,840
but they've kind of become the norm a lot.

965
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Especially with the AVG in it.

966
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,840
They all do that sort of...

967
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
It started with the AVG as a joke.

968
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
There's no reason this should happen, and it does.

969
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,840
Now, we don't have to go too elaborate on stories,

970
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,840
because if you want a definitive, full, complete list

971
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,840
of everything to not do in a review story,

972
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,840
watch the Game Over Thinker episodes 43 through 100.

973
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
That will teach you everything to not do ever.

974
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,840
The Game Over Thinker is the perfect example of don't.

975
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,840
The thing is, I think that continuity can be great,

976
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,840
but each of your videos should be watchable

977
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,840
and comprehensible on its own.

978
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,840
If you're watching them all, unless it's the end...

979
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,840
With the Horseshoe Finale, for instance, that Jesse Wood did,

980
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,840
every video leading up to it made sense by itself,

981
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,840
and then Horseshoe Finale was just the ending of the story.

982
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,840
Horseshoe Finale might not make sense on its own,

983
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,840
but it's also not about anything else other than the story.

984
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,840
It's not an episode review that became a film.

985
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
It is a film about the story,

986
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,840
and it's made for the people who are following it.

987
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,840
I think with Game Over Thinker,

988
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,840
he'll put out a video that's called

989
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,840
Why Mario's Cool, and then you start it,

990
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,840
and there's 10 minutes of him fighting

991
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,840
three evil versions of himself in a CG background,

992
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,840
and you're like, what the fuck?

993
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
What does this have to do with Mario?

994
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,840
I'm all for continuity, I'm all for stories and skits,

995
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,840
but, guys, you are not saving the fucking Earth dimension

996
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,840
from a goddamn ninja by reviewing a fucking movie.

997
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,840
So while we're on MovieBob,

998
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,840
let's talk about something I've been guilty of,

999
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,840
is putting in something in your review

1000
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,840
that makes sense as part of your opinion to you,

1001
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,840
but you don't explain why it's relevant to your review,

1002
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,840
and that's something that MovieBob does a lot.

1003
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,840
Oh, like he sticks to his social justice agenda all the time.

1004
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,840
That was actually the very next thing on my list.

1005
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,840
Intrusive politics.

1006
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
And that one means no explanation at all.

1007
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,840
Your fucking opinions on politics do not belong in a review.

1008
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,840
Well, okay, hold on.

1009
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,840
Unless they do.

1010
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,840
I think it does need clarification.

1011
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,840
That's why I clarified intrusive politics.

1012
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,840
Sometimes the politics are interesting,

1013
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,840
and that's the point.

1014
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,840
With MovieBob, with his really that good videos,

1015
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,840
there's always a point in the video

1016
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,840
where the politics are important,

1017
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,840
where with the Spider-Man video,

1018
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,840
he gets into this 9-11 part,

1019
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,840
and it's like that was relevant to the story of the movie,

1020
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
but then there's parts where he'll just be like,

1021
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,840
you know, and if you're a Republican,

1022
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,840
you're a fucking idiot moving on to the next point,

1023
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,840
you know, and you're just like, what was that?

1024
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,840
Like, why is that there?

1025
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,840
Yeah, like his Independence Day review was like,

1026
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Independence Day came out in the 90s,

1027
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
and now it's, you know, the 2010s,

1028
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,840
and there's lots of things that have happened since then.

1029
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Bill Clinton has been great,

1030
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,840
George Bush has been terrible,

1031
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
and people have been racist against Obama.

1032
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,840
That's all the American history that's happened between them.

1033
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,840
That was the most violent rage quit I've ever had on a video, I think.

1034
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

1035
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,840
Alright, Jesse, next point.

1036
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
Wait, I want to go back to your last point,

1037
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,840
just real quick about the, about the stakes in videos,

1038
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,840
because I want to bring up one of my favorite examples

1039
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,840
of how to do it right ever,

1040
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,840
which is, it was just Pinky Pride.

1041
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Yeah, it was in Pinky Pride,

1042
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,840
and now it also includes the Crusaders of the Lost Mark episodes

1043
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
of My Little Pony,

1044
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,840
where the stakes are like,

1045
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,840
incredibly low, right?

1046
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,840
You don't need to do anything,

1047
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,840
but it's like the tension in the thing is built up

1048
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,840
in such a way that you really, really fucking care about it.

1049
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,840
Everyone should learn from that example,

1050
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,840
but okay, let's move on.

1051
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
After intrusive politics,

1052
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,840
it's intrusive skits.

1053
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Again, I'm all for skits.

1054
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,840
I think they have a place, obviously,

1055
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,840
but they shouldn't overtake the subject of the video.

1056
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,840
I think the best guy who does skits,

1057
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,840
besides me, of course,

1058
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,840
on YouTube is Anthony Fantano.

1059
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
Yeah.

1060
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,840
All of his skits are like only a few sentences,

1061
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,840
and they're just there, and they're funny, and...

1062
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,840
But Anthony!

1063
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
Yeah, exactly.

1064
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Review is, should be,

1065
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,840
ten a thing,

1066
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,840
and you even do everything.

1067
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
Anthony, why you do this?

1068
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,840
Shut up, Cal.

1069
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,840
Anyways, back to the review.

1070
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
Hello, everyone.

1071
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,840
If you want to put skits in your videos,

1072
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,840
why not?

1073
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,840
Put skits in your videos,

1074
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
watch Anthony, and take a note from him.

1075
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,840
He's a good example.

1076
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
They're like little golden nuggets,

1077
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,840
because you never know if there's going to be one in a video.

1078
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,840
Then when you see one, it's like,

1079
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,840
yeah, actually, I kind of,

1080
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,840
sometimes I'll get frustrated when there isn't enough,

1081
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,840
like, Cal, and I'll just be like,

1082
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,840
whatever, fuck this guy, I just want to see Cal.

1083
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
But, yeah.

1084
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,840
And I've taken a page out of the book.

1085
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,840
Since I've started watching Anthony Fantano,

1086
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,840
I've tried to make my skits more to the point.

1087
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,840
Like, if you watch, like, my 2012 shit,

1088
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,840
or my, you know, my old shit,

1089
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
there's a lot of meandering bullshit.

1090
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,840
Sure, sure.

1091
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Fantano highlights something really good

1092
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,840
that reviewers can be, which is unpredictable.

1093
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,840
Because I think some, that guy with the glasses type people,

1094
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,840
they think, well, now that I have

1095
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,840
a certain amount of narrative, I need to have

1096
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
exactly three and a half minutes of skit

1097
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,840
at the beginning of every video.

1098
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,840
Whereas Anthony can be anything.

1099
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
The universe of the needle drop

1100
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,840
is like this unpredictable thing that's breaking.

1101
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
Well, his April Fool's joke spawned this whole saga

1102
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
about how Cal is dead and in hell

1103
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,840
and made a contract with Satan.

1104
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,840
And he incorporated that into his fucking, like,

1105
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,840
pretty serious album reviews.

1106
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
And it was great, everything about it ruled.

1107
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,840
And it matches his editing style, where, you know,

1108
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,840
the editing spazes out to cover up his mistakes.

1109
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Anthony, I made a deal with the daemon.

1110
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,840
I got a burden, my doctor shows.

1111
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,840
Everything about that was fantastic.

1112
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,840
Got to pat the guy in the back.

1113
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Um, the next thing on the list

1114
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
is derivativeness.

1115
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,840
I'm not sure if derivativeness

1116
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
is a word, but...

1117
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,840
Don't be derivative.

1118
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,840
Um, don't...

1119
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Nothing triggers me more

1120
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
than when I find a new guy on YouTube

1121
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,840
who is a blatant rip-off

1122
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,840
in every way of someone else.

1123
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,840
Yo, how about that demo-declone guy, right?

1124
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,840
You know, I was about to bring him up.

1125
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
I actually follow him on Twitter.

1126
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
He actually seems pretty okay.

1127
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,840
Yeah, we all left shitty comments

1128
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,840
on this guy's video one time, because

1129
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
he didn't do much, like, demo.

1130
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
And demo is great. I didn't even hate that about it.

1131
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
It was just, you know, it's like...

1132
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Well, that's the thing.

1133
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,840
The thing about Departed Reflections is that, like,

1134
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
he doesn't necessarily make bad videos,

1135
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,840
with the exception of that K-On one.

1136
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,840
But, like, the worst thing about it

1137
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
is how he's cribbing demo

1138
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,840
and not demo.

1139
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,840
Because demo has an amazing voice

1140
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,840
and a great microphone and a lot of charisma.

1141
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,840
And this guy has none of those things.

1142
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,840
He sounds like he's recording

1143
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,840
like a muffled fucking, you know,

1144
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,840
basically...

1145
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,840
I have a pretty...

1146
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,840
I only watched the 30 seconds of the K-On video,

1147
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
but I have a very specific reason

1148
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
as to why his demo impersonation

1149
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,840
bothers me. It's because he's not doing it

1150
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,840
for the same reasons as demo.

1151
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
Demo does it. I don't know why, for sure,

1152
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
but I infer demo does it

1153
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
because it's an easy way for him

1154
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,840
to sound charismatic

1155
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,840
and fluent and read scripts well

1156
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
because he probably tried reading everything like this

1157
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
and it didn't come out well. He probably tried

1158
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,840
reading everything like this.

1159
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,840
I don't think demo writes any of his scripts.

1160
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
Well, he tried to present himself

1161
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
and that was the way that came out naturally to him

1162
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
and helped him make his point.

1163
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,840
I think the reason that demo sounds that way

1164
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,840
is that only certain sentences are actually written

1165
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,840
and he just kind of sits in front of a microphone

1166
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
and then thinks of...

1167
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,840
Because that's how I did my...

1168
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,840
When I did a demo-style video, the one that's

1169
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,840
Should You Watch Kaiba, there's no script for that.

1170
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,840
I sat in front of a microphone

1171
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
and played something in a really low voice

1172
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,840
and it matched his flow.

1173
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,840
And the flow of his

1174
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,840
of his videos fluctuates based on

1175
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,840
a point he wants to make. Let's just say

1176
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,840
there's a show where a character gets killed

1177
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,840
and it doesn't make any sense.

1178
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,840
So he might say it like this.

1179
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,840
So then she goes up into the cabin

1180
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,840
and then she gets killed.

1181
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
He might speed up all of a sudden

1182
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,840
because that makes the point.

1183
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
Whereas the first 30 seconds of the departed reflections

1184
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
a guy, he goes,

1185
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,840
he's been really busy at work

1186
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
and school.

1187
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
He has this big pause between work

1188
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,840
and school. There's no reason

1189
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,840
you could just say, I've been busy...Demo

1190
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,840
if for whatever reason he was going to announce that

1191
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
would have said, hi guys, I've been busy

1192
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,840
with work and school.

1193
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,840
Alright, you just reminded me of the biggest pet peeve I have

1194
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,840
with all YouTube videos ever. It's when they start

1195
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
their video and they're like, hi guys,

1196
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,840
sorry I haven't made a video in a while.

1197
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Oh god, that's a really busy way.

1198
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
That's really high on my list.

1199
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,840
I don't even know yourself at that point.

1200
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
I don't even know.

1201
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,840
It's just, even if they just say, hey guys,

1202
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,840
no, don't.

1203
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
It's one part that...

1204
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,840
I'm going to extend this a little farther.

1205
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,840
I also hate it when people start off a review

1206
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
by talking about how they found out about the

1207
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
show or what their first impressions

1208
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,840
of it were.

1209
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Unless that story is really interesting.

1210
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Unless it's really relevant.

1211
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
Unless it's really relevant.

1212
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Unless it's really relevant.

1213
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,840
I do think, and I've made a whole video about

1214
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,840
why context matters.

1215
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,840
With my lucky star video where I was saying

1216
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,840
that a big part of the appeal of this show

1217
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
for me is watching it with these people

1218
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,840
at this time.

1219
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,840
But you get so many people who start off their review

1220
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,840
like, when this show first started,

1221
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
I watched the first couple episodes and I thought

1222
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
I'm not really sure if this is going to be

1223
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,840
good or not. I'm not usually into

1224
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
action shows.

1225
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,840
But now that I watched the whole show,

1226
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,840
I realized it actually exceeded

1227
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
my expectations by quite a bit.

1228
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,840
And I realized that maybe I should rethink

1229
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,840
my, I got, shut up!

1230
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Just tell me how the show is!

1231
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,840
Jesus Christ!

1232
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,840
And if you want to see like,

1233
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,840
basically the same list Jesse's

1234
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,840
making that I would have is

1235
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,840
my Attack on Titan review.

1236
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Which was an April Fool's review.

1237
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,840
And it's just me doing all of

1238
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,840
the worst parts of every anime

1239
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,840
review.

1240
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,840
I have listened to that one back many times.

1241
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,840
It is perfect.

1242
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,840
And it starts off with me just like, you know,

1243
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,840
when I first saw

1244
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,840
Attack on Titan, I thought

1245
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,840
my first impressions of it were that at first

1246
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
it seemed like

1247
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,840
the first thing I thought is

1248
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,840
going on and on like that.

1249
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,840
Alright Jesse, you got another one?

1250
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,840
Okay, one more thing to say about derivativeness.

1251
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,840
Obviously

1252
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,840
everyone is going to emulate the people

1253
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,840
they like, especially when they start out.

1254
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,840
But a good way to prevent

1255
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,840
yourself from feeling derivative

1256
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,840
is instead of stealing from one guy

1257
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,840
just steal from multiple guys.

1258
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,840
And that's how you create a stew

1259
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,840
that eventually becomes you.

1260
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,840
And I mean, I am all about

1261
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,840
copying people.

1262
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,840
I'm all about copying people once.

1263
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,840
Like I love doing

1264
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
like I'll find a new reviewer

1265
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,840
and I immediately want to do something

1266
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,840
in their style and I'll do like a

1267
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,840
like I did Your Anime Sucks

1268
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,840
which is a send up YMS.

1269
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,840
Or you're probably the only guy I've seen

1270
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,840
Digi that actually does that

1271
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,840
and it's interesting that you're

1272
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,840
so interested in just like trying

1273
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,840
to do a copy of someone pretty much exactly

1274
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,840
but you know, self-awareedly

1275
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,840
and intentionally.

1276
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
I like it because it's a good way to add

1277
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,840
new things. Like I see someone

1278
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,840
You learn something every time you do something like that.

1279
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
I see someone with a different tool set from mine

1280
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,840
and I'm like I want to learn how to use

1281
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,840
those tools. So I try to make a video that's exactly

1282
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,840
like them and then

1283
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,840
from then on I know how to

1284
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,840
like for instance, the asterisk war

1285
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,840
sucks. Even though it has

1286
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,840
sucks in the title is not supposed to be

1287
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,840
in the style of YMS. But there's moments

1288
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,840
in it that I use his techniques

1289
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,840
where like in Your Anime Sucks

1290
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
that was like entirely supposed to be this is YMS

1291
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,840
but with anime where I went through everything

1292
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
in order. I made jokes about it.

1293
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,840
Does he gain his powers?

1294
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,840
Like Mega Man style baby.

1295
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,840
Yeah and with asterisk war there's certain

1296
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
moments where I'll say like

1297
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
and then she gets hit by lightning

1298
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
we are three minutes into the episode

1299
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,840
and this is all that has happened

1300
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
and like that's a YMS gag

1301
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
and I put that in my head

1302
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,840
I'm just coming up at the top of my head

1303
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
but uh

1304
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
like that's a YMS gag

1305
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,840
and I got that from him but like

1306
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
it's something that can be applied forever

1307
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,840
and even like he probably got that from

1308
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
John Tron from Dai Katana review

1309
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
where he goes like this is the first

1310
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
three minutes of the game

1311
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
it's turtles all the way down everybody's

1312
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,840
copying everybody pretty much forever

1313
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,840
yeah so uh

1314
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,840
I think you should

1315
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
look at other people and try to like figure out

1316
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,840
what they're doing right and copy that

1317
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,840
don't cuz it all comes down to

1318
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
like the surface details

1319
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,840
and that uh that what was the

1320
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,840
film crit Hulk saying um the tangible

1321
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
details where people look at it

1322
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,840
and they go oh well demo

1323
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
uses a low voice and it sounds

1324
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,840
smooth and he stops his sentences

1325
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,840
randomly so I'm gonna do that

1326
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
demo's got the sexiest

1327
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
sounding videos

1328
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,840
on YouTube they're better than Markiplier

1329
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,840
I don't know man I would suck that dudes dick

1330
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
if he was here in front of me

1331
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
I love you demo

1332
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,840
multiple sources basically is what we're saying

1333
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
as the song goes

1334
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
I'm the macho dandy son

1335
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,840
of Randy Savage, Captain Kirk

1336
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,840
and Travis Touchdown

1337
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,840
lots of learn from that folks

1338
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,840
the next one I got my own lyrics wrong

1339
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,840
yeah macho dandy bastard son

1340
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,840
of Captain Kirk

1341
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,840
um the next one

1342
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,840
is a big do as I say

1343
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,840
not as I do

1344
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,840
um

1345
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,840
alcohol

1346
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,840
I'm sick of it

1347
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,840
it's the laziest comedy crutch in the history of reviews

1348
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,840
the whole oh I

1349
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,840
can't even get through this without drinking

1350
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,840
gotta knock back some of that

1351
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
fucking Jim Bean

1352
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,840
it's so fucking

1353
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,840
laid out and redundant at this point

1354
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,840
if you are

1355
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,840
drinking alcohol in the video as a joke

1356
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
fuck you go away and die

1357
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,840
you're not the nerd you never will be and you damn sure ain't drowning in horseshoes

1358
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,840
so don't even fucking bother

1359
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,840
get outta here

1360
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
I think there's a few ways to like

1361
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,840
drinking is a very careful line and I think

1362
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,840
if you're good enough to make it work

1363
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,840
then you don't need us to tell you

1364
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,840
but that's true of pretty much everything

1365
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,840
I love doing like cause

1366
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,840
I think you should do drinking

1367
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,840
is part of your like character

1368
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,840
is that you are an alcoholic

1369
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
if you happen to be a guy

1370
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,840
who drinks fine whatever

1371
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,840
I'm not gonna tell a grown adult not to drink

1372
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
but when it's used as like a crutch

1373
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,840
for like the whole

1374
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
I think it's a problem

1375
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,840
the first time I watched um

1376
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,840
drowning in horseshoes was the first time

1377
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,840
I had been like impressed

1378
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,840
by like somebody just drinking alcohol

1379
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,840
cause like I'd seen the nerd do it

1380
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,840
I mean he does it through that horse head too

1381
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
like the AVGN

1382
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,840
just takes a sip and that's just he cuts there

1383
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,840
but like just he would like

1384
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,840
open the beer

1385
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
through the horse head

1386
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,840
drink the entire thing and then throw it on the ground

1387
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,840
and then there's a sound of glass

1388
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,840
and the smashing it too is like man selling the joke is great

1389
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,840
you gotta do something like that

1390
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
it just goes to that level

1391
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
if people do that then I'd be more interested

1392
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
oh my god is that the origin of the fuck glass

1393
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,840
all those broken beer bottles over the years

1394
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,840
all the broken, all the continuity

1395
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,840
all the shattering beer bottle sounds

1396
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,840
that you hear in my videos are legitimate

1397
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
I go I throw it over

1398
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,840
I've always wondered that

1399
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
but yeah like I think if you can make alcohol

1400
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
a stunt it can work which Jesse always does

1401
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
it's always like something impressive

1402
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,840
it was invented by the nerd

1403
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,840
it was perfected by drowning in horseshoes

1404
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,840
and it was taken to a new galaxy

1405
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,840
by Colt Corona so no one knows

1406
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,840
and if you can make it a good joke

1407
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,840
Nate did a great one at the beginning

1408
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
of growing the gun part one

1409
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,840
he opens three beers and does the father

1410
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,840
the son and the holy ghost and the drinks

1411
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,840
all three at once that was funny

1412
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,840
but if it's just like I can't

1413
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
take this I need to drink

1414
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,840
like for me if I was gonna do

1415
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
cause if I started doing live action segments

1416
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,840
not even alcohol just specifically that joke

1417
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
is the problem I can't take this

1418
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
if I started doing live

1419
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,840
action videos I would drink

1420
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,840
in all of them because I love

1421
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,840
having myself with a wine glass

1422
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,840
because I've kind of become a whino for real

1423
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
but like uh

1424
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
I love that boxed wine have you polished that off yet

1425
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,840
oh I did last night while we were

1426
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,840
having our long ass conversation

1427
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,840
congratulations oh this is my third box

1428
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,840
it's been one this whole time

1429
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,840
anyway um

1430
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,840
I like how I complain about this

1431
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,840
as I'm drinking whiskey

1432
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,840
yeah

1433
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,840
but you're not making a big fucking production of it

1434
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,840
I think it's great

1435
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,840
if the idea is like

1436
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,840
I'm like

1437
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,840
it's like two different ways some people are like

1438
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,840
I have to drink because of this

1439
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
movie whereas for me I think

1440
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,840
it's more I have to this movie

1441
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
because I drink

1442
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
I think that's a better way to do it

1443
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,840
I'm an alcoholic who's lost my mind

1444
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,840
and is trapped in my room watching anime

1445
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
that's funny you see that's a new

1446
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,840
spin on the joke and that's way funnier

1447
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,840
yeah definitely that's what I

1448
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,840
that's what I want my persona to be

1449
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
is I mean if you look at all my iconography

1450
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
on my channel and everything there's always alcohol

1451
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
so forget this

1452
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,840
alcohol is not the problem drink if you want

1453
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,840
just write better jokes

1454
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,840
yeah okay what's next

1455
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
the next one is

1456
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,840
obnoxious overly long intros

1457
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,840
we already did that we already went through that one

1458
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
don't make a fucking long boring intro

1459
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
to every video

1460
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
but there's an addendum to that

1461
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
specifically heavy metal intros

1462
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
yeah

1463
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
unless you're medox

1464
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,840
and you're gonna play it through the whole video

1465
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840
everyone loves heavy metal

1466
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
it's great and we all love it

1467
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,840
but something about

1468
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
putting heavy metal in the intro

1469
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,840
as a part of your gimmick just seems so desperate

1470
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,840
to me

1471
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
I have never really watched much of Spoonie's content

1472
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
I know a lot of you guys are fans but I went back

1473
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
and watched the beginning of some of his Final Fantasy 8 ones

1474
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
he's got this really shitty animation

1475
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
and this like horrible

1476
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,840
metal intro that goes on for like

1477
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,840
a minute and it was like a nightmare

1478
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
I could barely sit through it

1479
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,840
but like that at the time I'm sure it was like awesome

1480
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,840
this was like holy shit he's got an animated intro

1481
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,840
this is fucking insane but like now

1482
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,840
with the standards we have today it was not good

1483
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,840
every metal intro

1484
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
I don't think he has a metal intro

1485
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
well it was rock and roll at the very least

1486
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,840
every metal intro is always like just a chugging

1487
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
like basic ass riff

1488
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,840
like yeah

1489
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
what I'm basing this off of is

1490
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
one of the worst ones that I ever saw

1491
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
was back in the

1492
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,840
that guy with the glasses forum days

1493
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
and there was this guy called the Hardcore Kid

1494
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,840
and his

1495
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,840
sounds amazing

1496
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,840
he had this long intro

1497
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,840
like the entire song

1498
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,840
Kickstart My Heart by Motley Crue

1499
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,840
and the intro had like explosions

1500
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
and like he was like slow motion

1501
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,840
dude what a badass

1502
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,840
like him putting on the leather jacket

1503
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,840
putting on the sunglasses

1504
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,840
that's another one

1505
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,840
did he evolve into Razor Fist later on

1506
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,840
he might have lost some weight and became

1507
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,840
Razor Fist

1508
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,840
I'm just gonna go ahead and set down a fucking rule

1509
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,840
when it comes to intro songs

1510
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,840
if it's more than 5 seconds long

1511
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
then here's the rule

1512
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
it has to be an original song

1513
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,840
made by a professional musician

1514
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,840
not an original song that you made

1515
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,840
or that some guy made

1516
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
here's the best intros

1517
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,840
that are more than 5 seconds long

1518
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
John Tron's intro is incredible because it's iconic

1519
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,840
and the intro is important to the videos

1520
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
because he uses different versions of the opening

1521
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,840
theme throughout the video

1522
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,840
to create emotional moments

1523
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
you'll hear the sad version with something sad happening

1524
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,840
it's amazing right?

1525
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,840
dude that's why I need to make a fucking intro song

1526
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,840
so I can get that emotional pay off later

1527
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,840
number 2 guy

1528
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,840
we all need intros

1529
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,840
number 2 guy

1530
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,840
the cinemasticist

1531
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,840
he got Perturbator

1532
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,840
the guy who does the music for the fucking

1533
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,840
hotline miami games

1534
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,840
and made him an intro

1535
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
his videos are about

1536
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
sleazy 80s action movies

1537
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,840
and a guy whose entire career is making games

1538
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
out of sleazy 80s action movies style

1539
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
made him a soundtrack

1540
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,840
the more I think about this rule

1541
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
the more I fuck it

1542
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
and number 3 guy

1543
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,840
there's only one guy who's done the metal intro

1544
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,840
justifiably

1545
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
and that's Good Bad Flicks

1546
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,840
because the band Psycho Stick made him an intro

1547
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
and they actually know how to play that style

1548
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,840
and here's a rule for intros that I have

1549
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
especially if your song is loud

1550
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
and energetic is how it then

1551
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
fades out like in the middle of a verse

1552
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
well that's unacceptable

1553
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,840
that just completely throws me off

1554
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,840
the song should be made for

1555
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,840
the song should be

1556
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
an intro song

1557
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,840
it should not be a song that was written for any other purpose

1558
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
it should just be an actual

1559
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
intro song that's 20 seconds

1560
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
like John Tron's song is an intro song

1561
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
none of these rules should be

1562
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,840
taken as set in stone no matter what

1563
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,840
there's always exceptions to all of them

1564
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,840
the cinematicist has always had great intros

1565
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
the angry video game nerd

1566
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,840
is so iconic and so perfect

1567
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
it's the greatest intro of all time

1568
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,840
even though he hates it

1569
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
he hates it

1570
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
which is sad

1571
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,840
well I don't know if he hates it but he's gotten very sick of it

1572
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
well of course

1573
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,840
you're doing it for 10 years

1574
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,840
whatever

1575
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
guys if you disagree with any of our rules

1576
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,840
prove us wrong

1577
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,840
no you don't have to

1578
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
prove us wrong because they're not set in stone

1579
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,840
in any way

1580
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
just go against the grain

1581
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,840
alright Jesse you got any more?

1582
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,840
oh I got tons more

1583
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,840
oh my god how

1584
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,840
we might have split this into two different podcasts

1585
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
cause I also wanted to talk about

1586
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
rules that reviewers have about shows

1587
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
and the longer we go the more we run the risk of technical failures

1588
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,840
so we should probably split that up

1589
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
we're about halfway through my list

1590
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,840
is anybody at risk of technical failure?

1591
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,840
who knows anyone might lose power

1592
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
their computer may lock up

1593
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,840
I'm not worried about that Jesse continue to do that

1594
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,840
alright the next thing on the list

1595
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,840
is guys who only do negative reviews

1596
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,840
and or shows

1597
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,840
based around just cynicism

1598
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
in general

1599
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,840
that's why the mysterious Mr. Enter

1600
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
is the greatest creator

1601
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,840
on YouTube

1602
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,840
actually I don't even know if he's

1603
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
to be fair he does do videos

1604
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
on good things as well

1605
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
if the basis of your show

1606
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,840
is I'm Mr. Angry Hate Guy

1607
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,840
I hate everything and I

1608
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,840
I hate everything guy

1609
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,840
yeah I mean I actually

1610
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,840
haven't watched any of his videos that weren't about the Daddy Derek shit

1611
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,840
so I don't know

1612
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,840
oh yeah see if I hate everything

1613
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
don't have an avatar that looks completely hideous

1614
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,840
and no one wants to have a look at it

1615
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,840
don't have a disgusting repulsive avatar that's a good rule

1616
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,840
yeah don't do that

1617
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
even though he's doing well despite it

1618
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,840
it's ironic the best I hate everything

1619
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,840
video is the one video that's

1620
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
I love everything and it's for Star Wars

1621
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,840
where he's actually being positive

1622
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,840
maybe that's a personal thing I don't know

1623
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
I just much prefer positive videos

1624
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,840
maybe it's a prodigal son sort of thing

1625
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,840
where like you get used to him hating everything

1626
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,840
and then he finally does a positive and it's like oh yes

1627
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,840
I just think that negativity

1628
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
as a gimmick is played out

1629
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,840
I think you should

1630
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,840
I think what it does

1631
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,840
is like if you're someone like the angry video game nerd

1632
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,840
it worked for him because

1633
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,840
like it was all these weird games that no one's heard of

1634
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,840
and it wasn't really him reviewing

1635
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,840
like there was no sense that

1636
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,840
you were watching his videos because you needed to hear his opinion

1637
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,840
on this game it was about

1638
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,840
the game you know

1639
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,840
most part his anger was deserved

1640
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,840
like it was an actual frustrating experience

1641
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,840
right but I think guys like

1642
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
JonTron and stuff like they do well with that

1643
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,840
because JonTron mostly plays

1644
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,840
shitty games or watches shitty movies

1645
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
but it works out because of the fact that

1646
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
it's about the thing

1647
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,840
it's not about the review

1648
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,840
it's not about his opinion of it

1649
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,840
and if you're an opinion reviewer like I hate everything

1650
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,840
then it's like we don't have any metric

1651
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,840
for what you actually value

1652
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,840
you know like if you only review

1653
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
bad things

1654
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,840
what I love about YMS about your movie sucks

1655
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,840
is that he makes so many quickies

1656
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,840
where like he reviews every movie

1657
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,840
so like

1658
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,840
if you were just watching your movie sucks reviews

1659
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,840
those are funny and all but like

1660
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,840
you really gain context when you see what movies he likes

1661
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
when you see like

1662
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,840
what he gives the 10 out of 10 to

1663
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,840
and he makes those top 10 movies of

1664
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,840
2014 like those are the

1665
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,840
necessary antithesis

1666
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,840
to the negative reviews to make you appreciate

1667
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,840
what he values

1668
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,840
otherwise those reviews would be nothing

1669
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,840
he would say like this movie is shit and you'd be like

1670
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,840
well I don't know what you like so I don't you know

1671
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
and now that I do know what you like

1672
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,840
then I can take it all with a grain of salt

1673
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,840
a good review for negative reviews is

1674
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
keep in mind just because you dislike something

1675
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,840
doesn't necessarily it makes you mad

1676
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,840
don't pretend to be mad in your video unless

1677
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
you actually are mad as a result of the work

1678
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,840
there are plenty of things that can be like a 1 out of 10

1679
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
or a 3 out of 10 that you're just bored of

1680
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
don't go oh it's terrible

1681
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
just be like oh I hate it

1682
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,840
I think it's pretty clear that the only times

1683
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
that I've made negative reviews is when there's

1684
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
like a strong emotion there

1685
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,840
it's like this this

1686
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,840
show made me really mad

1687
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,840
and I have to talk about it

1688
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,840
the entire asterisk and even then try to downplay

1689
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,840
your anger unless you're funny and you're charismatic

1690
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,840
like James Rolfe

1691
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,840
you can do whatever be negative about shit

1692
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,840
but you know just don't do it all the time

1693
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,840
you gotta make it work

1694
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,840
if you're mad through the whole video

1695
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,840
then it loses impact

1696
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,840
in your whole asterisk war series you scream just one time

1697
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
just once

1698
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
it's like when I reached the end of my rope

1699
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,840
because most of the time I try to be like

1700
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,840
sarcastic, snide like oh this is like this

1701
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,840
but then there's those moments where it's like

1702
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
well this is actually a real problem

1703
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
so now we have to get serious

1704
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
you know like or this is actually real frustration

1705
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,840
so now we have to be frustrated

1706
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,840
like understand the emotions of your script

1707
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
don't flat line the emotion

1708
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,840
because then it's just gonna get tiring

1709
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
and it'd be fair Doug Walker does a

1710
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,840
pretty decent job with that he usually creates

1711
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,840
like a narrative out of his escalating anger

1712
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
or conflicting emotions it's just that everyone

1713
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,840
imitates him does it wrong which is another rule

1714
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,840
try to out do your idols

1715
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,840
try to do better than them

1716
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,840
you won't succeed

1717
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,840
but if you try to think of as your ultimate

1718
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,840
pine in the sky dream is to be almost as good

1719
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,840
as them you're always gonna be shit

1720
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,840
so just make it your goal to be better

1721
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,840
that's fair that's good advice

1722
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,840
alright Jesse next one

1723
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
next one adherence to formula

1724
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,840
sure yeah

1725
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
we were kind of talking about that

1726
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,840
if you're doing reviews every couple of reviews

1727
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,840
change it up don't just be doing

1728
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,840
the same shit for fucking five years

1729
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
yeah all my videos are different

1730
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,840
I'm the greatest of all time

1731
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,840
unless your formula is so loose

1732
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,840
that it like

1733
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,840
well in that case you're changing it up intrinsically anyways

1734
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,840
like with someone like YMS all the videos

1735
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,840
are like you know it's always 20 minute chunks

1736
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,840
and we're going through the movie but like

1737
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
he'll work the context in a different

1738
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,840
ways you know it's never like

1739
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,840
here's the part right talk about the history

1740
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,840
and here's the part right talk about this it's like

1741
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
it's all each video is its own

1742
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,840
unique animal and you know if you have

1743
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,840
like a formula that you stick

1744
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
to real hard then okay

1745
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,840
then people are gonna watch you for that

1746
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,840
but if you ever change things

1747
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,840
you run the risk of them like not giving a shit

1748
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,840
about you and then just being like well fuck this

1749
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,840
isn't what I signed up for I'm out you know you're not getting

1750
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
them attached to you as much as

1751
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,840
your content everybody go watch

1752
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
my Super Mario

1753
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,840
Brothers 3 review

1754
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,840
Sim City review and my Hello Kitty review

1755
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
3

1756
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,840
totally different kinds of videos

1757
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,840
and they're all great

1758
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,840
well I just want to I just want to make it clear

1759
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,840
that like even like even mother's basement

1760
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
does like even though he'll do like

1761
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
what's in an OP and every video is just about

1762
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,840
an anime opening and it's 10 minutes long

1763
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,840
but they're all very

1764
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,840
different where he'll cover it like he did

1765
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,840
the Dragon Ball Z opening and like most of them

1766
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,840
will be like sometimes he'll say like welcome to the

1767
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,840
NHK it's like an analysis of like every

1768
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,840
image and what it means and how it's relevant

1769
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,840
to the story but then he did like DBZ and

1770
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
it's about the cultural context it's about

1771
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
what the show did to anime openings

1772
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,840
or the one punch man one which is like

1773
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
literally a game theory video for the one

1774
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,840
punch man OP and he's like calculating

1775
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
how strong the punch is and stuff like

1776
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,840
those are all changes to

1777
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
the formula where it's not every single

1778
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,840
video is the same thing even though they are all

1779
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
about OP's and they're all about the same length

1780
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,840
you know but I mean

1781
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,840
obviously formulas will meet you with success

1782
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,840
depending on what kind so there are

1783
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
certain types of things where you can always be the same

1784
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,840
you know the needle drop always has very similar

1785
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
elements to every video zero punctuation

1786
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,840
always has similar elements every video

1787
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,840
these are not rules carefully selected

1788
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,840
elements these are not rules that will

1789
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,840
make you all these are not rules that will

1790
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,840
make people successful video creating

1791
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,840
you know what you know what this reminds me

1792
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,840
of there's this book that me and Ben read

1793
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,840
called how not to write a novel

1794
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
and all it like no one no one in the world

1795
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,840
agrees on how to write a good book but there are

1796
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,840
tons of things people agree on to never ever

1797
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,840
do if you want your book to sell book one

1798
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,840
and like this is I think

1799
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,840
I think the thing is like I think

1800
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
when formula becomes dangerous is when

1801
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,840
it's specific like if you do

1802
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,840
your videos where you talk about

1803
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
the story and then talk about the characters

1804
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,840
and then talk about this

1805
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
and you try to apply that to everything

1806
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,840
you fail and I hate my anime

1807
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
list reviews because they encourage that like the

1808
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,840
format of the website is that you score

1809
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,840
each element and then your overall score

1810
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,840
is meant to be like the the the the

1811
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
summation of those and and I've written

1812
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
a lot of reviews in this style back in the day

1813
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
so I know exactly where it's

1814
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,840
it's failings are which is that

1815
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,840
again you can't apply it to every

1816
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,840
show you can sometimes

1817
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
you can really talk about each

1818
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,840
individual thing and and they're all pretty

1819
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,840
separate but like if if

1820
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,840
if talking about the aesthetics

1821
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,840
of the show informs

1822
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,840
talking about the characters of the show then

1823
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,840
separating them into different sections won't make any

1824
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,840
sense you know if part of

1825
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,840
if part of my review of the visuals is that

1826
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,840
this character looks this way and that informs

1827
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
their personality in these ways and like I've

1828
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,840
already broken formula and fuck it

1829
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
you know so yeah

1830
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,840
Jesse more points

1831
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
the next point is posturing

1832
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
and the worst defender

1833
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,840
of this one I have to say is

1834
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,840
razor fist

1835
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
the main thing that drives

1836
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,840
me crazy about his videos

1837
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,840
is that he's never willing to be

1838
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,840
the punchline he never laughs

1839
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,840
at himself he always

1840
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,840
has to be the cool guy making for a guy

1841
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,840
that serious that's gonna cause problems

1842
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,840
I mean laugh at yourself

1843
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,840
again it goes back to like self-awareness

1844
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,840
a lot of

1845
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,840
most of my jokes most of my

1846
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,840
videos are centered around me

1847
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,840
being the punchline

1848
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,840
you're you know I'm making

1849
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,840
I'm making light of the fact that I'm a big

1850
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,840
dumb idiot loser and

1851
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,840
that's the that

1852
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
to me is more funny

1853
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,840
than trying

1854
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
to seem like I'm the best guy ever

1855
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
not not throwing shade

1856
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,840
at Nate

1857
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,840
but well Nate's videos do the same thing

1858
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,840
it comes off as insecure to me

1859
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,840
to try to posture

1860
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,840
like you're the best guy

1861
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,840
Nate's videos always the idea

1862
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,840
of it is that it's all

1863
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
fake posturing that like

1864
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
at some point he pulls back the curtain

1865
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,840
and it's actually some nerd

1866
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
you know where like the idea

1867
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,840
the girl in the gone video is like I used to be

1868
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,840
this weak piece of shit and then I watched

1869
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
the show and it made me the best guy ever

1870
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,840
and like that's sort of the joke

1871
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,840
I connect way more way easier

1872
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,840
with people who

1873
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
show that they can laugh at themselves

1874
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,840
Nate are you still there you didn't have

1875
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,840
any reaction to us talking about you

1876
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
he's dead I killed him

1877
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,840
oh no

1878
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,840
you didn't have enough self-awareness

1879
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
alright Jesse

1880
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
next point

1881
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,840
over reliance on memes

1882
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,840
memes are a tool

1883
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,840
they can be hilarious use them sparingly

1884
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
alright do you mean

1885
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,840
memes as in memes from other things

1886
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,840
or like just you know

1887
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,840
memes or is it okay to keep

1888
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,840
your own meme like create your own meme

1889
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,840
oh man creating your own memes is awesome everyone should

1890
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,840
cause I love those

1891
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
well if you watched all the nostalgia critic

1892
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,840
you would understand how those can be abuse

1893
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,840
okay well never mind don't do that either don't do anything

1894
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,840
yeah uh yeah

1895
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
don't use too many memes or too many references

1896
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
yeah a well placed

1897
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,840
reference can be the funniest fucking joke

1898
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
ever but if your script has them

1899
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,840
oh yeah I think

1900
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,840
they're like a

1901
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,840
like a very special silver bullet

1902
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,840
like if you can put just the right

1903
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,840
reference at the right moment it can blow

1904
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,840
everything wider

1905
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
a lot of things that people

1906
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
I want you to talk about whenever you want to

1907
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,840
talk you should

1908
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,840
um what was I saying

1909
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,840
something about references yeah

1910
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,840
a lot of the time

1911
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,840
I see people making references as

1912
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,840
jokes in and of themselves

1913
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,840
just like uh like I'm drawing attention

1914
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,840
to the fact that I know about this thing

1915
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,840
and that's the biggest one that comes to mind

1916
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,840
is I Love Can Possible

1917
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,840
yeah yeah you know

1918
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,840
like it's just it's

1919
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,840
meaningless but it does oh man

1920
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,840
it does get the views it gets the kids all happy

1921
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,840
they're like oh you know my thing

1922
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
of all of these rules that we've been

1923
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,840
like where Jesse was saying these won't necessarily

1924
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,840
make you a famous youtuber they'll make you a good one

1925
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,840
this is the number one rule to break

1926
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,840
if you just want free hits

1927
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
yeah make references to everything

1928
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,840
load your video with memes

1929
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,840
and all the fucking

1930
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
put sans and papyrus in the thumbnail

1931
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,840
of every fucking video

1932
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
regardless of whether you're talking about it

1933
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,840
just any good measure

1934
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
anything that's popular or noteworthy

1935
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,840
sans papyrus and shrek

1936
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,840
throw it in there and then

1937
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,840
and some illuminati triangles in there

1938
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,840
the reason it works is because for some reason

1939
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,840
people don't understand

1940
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
internet is a place where everything you like

1941
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
a thousand other people

1942
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,840
like as well for some reason everyone

1943
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,840
thinks that if you make a reference to something

1944
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
and they get that reference it's like a special

1945
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
connection like oh my god

1946
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
you referenced a meme I've heard of and it's like

1947
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,840
yeah everyone's heard of it

1948
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,840
that's why I like to think and I take pride

1949
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,840
in the fact that many of my references

1950
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,840
are so obscure

1951
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
that only three people will get them

1952
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,840
yeah well the only thing about good references

1953
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,840
is like a good reference

1954
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,840
can make sense even if you have no idea

1955
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,840
what it means or what it means in context

1956
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,840
it just is a thing that you said

1957
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,840
and it's cool

1958
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
there's one other rule about doing references

1959
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,840
that when I explain it

1960
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,840
it seems so obvious but the nostalgia critic himself

1961
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
continues to break it at least

1962
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,840
a couple years ago back when I was still watching him

1963
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,840
in general

1964
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,840
don't set don't

1965
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
this is what a lot of nostalgia critic does

1966
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,840
he will show a clip and be like wow

1967
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,840
that's just like such and such

1968
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,840
and then show such and such

1969
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,840
you're not even doing the structure

1970
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,840
of referencing something correctly

1971
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,840
if you explain it first

1972
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
just throw that out there

1973
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
while we're on the subject of references

1974
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
this is just a flash forward

1975
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,840
to what the future of this conversation will be

1976
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,840
I'm in a nightmare it's still going

1977
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,840
one of the rules that a lot of people apply

1978
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,840
towards the things that they review

1979
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,840
is that reference comedy

1980
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,840
is somehow the lowest form of comedy

1981
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,840
did anyone else get cut off

1982
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,840
you said

1983
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,840
what am I here

1984
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,840
your hand if you would please

1985
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,840
okay what I was going to say

1986
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
is for some reason people think

1987
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,840
that reference comedy is the lowest form

1988
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
of comedy and they never explain

1989
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,840
why it's just

1990
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,840
something people seem to think right

1991
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
and I think that like Lucky Star

1992
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
proves that that's not true

1993
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
and there's a great scene where

1994
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,840
it's an initial D reference

1995
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
suddenly the animation style

1996
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,840
comes initial D and the characters start racing down the road

1997
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,840
if you have no idea what it's referencing

1998
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,840
it's still hilarious

1999
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,840
because for some reason the animation style

2000
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,840
completely changes

2001
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,840
they went in on that joke so hard that you're going to appreciate

2002
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,840
no matter what it's not like they just cut to an initial D clip

2003
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,840
and it was like isn't it funny we're doing

2004
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,840
something sort of similar to that right now

2005
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
if you've never seen initial D you'll still be like

2006
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,840
what the fuck is happening

2007
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,840
the animation style is totally different

2008
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
the music is totally different this is hilarious

2009
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,840
but if you have seen initial D then you're like

2010
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
oh multi trap drifting

2011
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,840
holy shit

2012
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
I think references

2013
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,840
not only can they work on multiple levels

2014
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
but also for the people who do get

2015
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
the reference it can be fucking hilarious

2016
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,840
people are always like

2017
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,840
oh references the lowest form of comedy because it relies on

2018
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,840
another work and not everyone gets it

2019
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
and it's like yeah but if you do get it

2020
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,840
guess what here's what's good comedy

2021
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,840
if it makes you laugh

2022
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,840
it's good comedy

2023
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,840
if it doesn't

2024
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,840
a reference has the ability to make people laugh

2025
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,840
for like totally different reasons

2026
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,840
so if you do it well that's pretty cool

2027
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,840
the worst thing

2028
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,840
about every review of comedy

2029
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,840
is for some reason everyone thinks

2030
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,840
that comedy has all these

2031
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,840
really strict rules and every time someone

2032
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
does a comedy review they're like

2033
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,840
comedy is the hardest thing to get right

2034
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,840
we all saw that king of the hill episode

2035
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,840
where bobby goes to school to try to

2036
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
learn how to do comedy by the book

2037
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,840
and it doesn't work out folks

2038
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,840
nobody laughs everyone thinks

2039
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,840
every fucking video

2040
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,840
where someone reviews a comedy they always have to have

2041
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,840
this long speech about how comedy

2042
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,840
is so different from drama and you have to judge it on

2043
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
a different scale and this is the right kind of humor

2044
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,840
this is the wrong if it makes you laugh

2045
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,840
it's funny

2046
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
and it's good comedy there's a million

2047
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,840
ways that you can accomplish that

2048
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,840
but trying to be like

2049
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,840
oh well this kind of comedy

2050
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,840
is never funny except

2051
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
it is all the time references

2052
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,840
are often funny

2053
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,840
the easiest one to fuck up

2054
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
but they are very often hilarious

2055
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,840
family guys' references are funny

2056
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,840
they animate ridiculous shit

2057
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,840
the hardest I've laughed so far this year

2058
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,840
was jesse's

2059
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
in a analysis video

2060
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,840
or review jesse did the video

2061
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,840
about the christmas specials

2062
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,840
and he has this long lead up

2063
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,840
I won't even spoil the line

2064
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,840
but it's too

2065
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,840
you'll know it if you see it

2066
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,840
what was this involving I don't remember the

2067
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,840
alright fine he was telling this whole story

2068
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,840
about Helga in the christmas special

2069
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,840
of hey Arnold and the whole thing

2070
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,840
is she's trying to get these shoes

2071
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,840
and then like she has this whole moral

2072
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,840
conundrum about whether she should give the shoes

2073
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,840
to this other person or keep them for herself

2074
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,840
and like jesse

2075
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,840
frames this whole thing and then he says

2076
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
she is truly drowning

2077
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,840
in footwear and like

2078
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,840
the way it all led up to it was so perfect

2079
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
I was very proud of that one

2080
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,840
a well constructed

2081
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,840
bit in a well constructed video

2082
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,840
and it's a reference and if people haven't been around

2083
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,840
on your channel long enough to know what drowning

2084
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,840
in footwear is then they won't get it

2085
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,840
but like it's not intrusive

2086
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,840
it's just something

2087
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,840
that you'll get more if you know the reference

2088
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,840
and it's fucking hilarious

2089
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,840
and even if you don't get the reference

2090
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,840
I added in that few seconds of like wind howling

2091
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,840
and like the air enhancing

2092
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,840
like that's not fucking funny

2093
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
even if you don't get it then that's also part of the joke

2094
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,840
that's how

2095
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
that's what it means to be a comedy genius

2096
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,840
people

2097
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,840
you gotta bang on all cylinders

2098
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,840
somebody mentioned kim possible

2099
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,840
which made me add a new one right on the fly here

2100
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
which is having editors

2101
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,840
edit your own shit god damn it

2102
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
have some pride in your fucking art

2103
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,840
and edit your god damn

2104
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,840
own videos

2105
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
there is

2106
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
except for me

2107
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,840
that's the thing though

2108
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,840
kim it's like

2109
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,840
when we talk about i love kim possible a lot

2110
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,840
you can't judge like her content

2111
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,840
as if it's like her just making it

2112
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,840
you can't say like wow kim makes great videos

2113
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,840
you have to say like her videos on her channel

2114
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,840
are clearly the work of a lot of people

2115
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,840
putting in time to make a video

2116
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,840
here's what it comes down to for me

2117
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,840
I hate editing more than anything

2118
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
in the god damn world

2119
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,840
but the reason I do it is because

2120
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,840
I have so much pride

2121
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,840
and vision in my work

2122
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,840
I can't do it

2123
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,840
I can't trust it

2124
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,840
there's been times I said devu edit a video for me

2125
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,840
and he's like okay and I'm like no wait never mind

2126
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,840
I'm doing it myself fuck it fuck it

2127
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,840
and then the video never come out

2128
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,840
I can't even finish it

2129
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,840
it's just a matter of I don't think the rule should be

2130
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,840
don't have editors it should be have editors

2131
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,840
who you're working closely with

2132
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,840
and who are communicating the same thing you are

2133
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
and play what you try to do

2134
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,840
I don't think I could possibly ever make a video

2135
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,840
and have someone else edit it

2136
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,840
somebody who wants and gags that come

2137
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,840
from the editing process

2138
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,840
that you think of during that

2139
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,840
but at the same time sometimes you're

2140
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,840
to me it's not a matter of

2141
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,840
like I'm handing off my

2142
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,840
my thing to someone else and they're doing something

2143
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
it's more like I mean if you're a musician

2144
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,840
and you're in a band and you don't play all the

2145
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,840
instruments then that means

2146
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,840
that every song is the collaborative effort

2147
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,840
of you and three other people

2148
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,840
and like with my videos

2149
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,840
cause I hate editing

2150
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,840
and I will just

2151
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,840
not make the video as good as it should be

2152
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,840
because I don't want to edit it

2153
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,840
I just won't do it like if there's something

2154
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,840
that I know that if I spent

2155
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,840
40 hours on it it could be fine

2156
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,840
but like there's no way I'm going to spend 40

2157
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,840
hours on it then you know

2158
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,840
I won't write my videos in a way that requires that

2159
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,840
but I know that the DeVu

2160
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,840
can take like he finds

2161
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
the jokes that I don't even

2162
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
take the time to look for you know

2163
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,840
cause he'll see the show so many times

2164
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
he'll edit the video in such a way where he'll make

2165
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,840
the characters make certain facial expressions

2166
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
when I say something that always is hilarious

2167
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
and it's something I would never have looked out for

2168
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,840
I would never have found so like

2169
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,840
I think taking

2170
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,840
editors is fine if they are

2171
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,840
better than you and they

2172
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,840
are like

2173
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,840
they understand your vision

2174
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,840
like just as well as you do

2175
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,840
and can or if you just like

2176
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,840
I like DeVu's videos that

2177
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,840
he edits for me more than I like

2178
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,840
videos that I edit for me so like

2179
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,840
I would rather he edits them

2180
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,840
I have an editor if it's clear that you're using it

2181
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,840
to make your content better or bigger

2182
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,840
or more voluminous like you know

2183
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,840
I guess it's impossible it just feels lazy but

2184
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,840
I think you guys are trying too hard to justify

2185
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
using an editor you can use an editor for whatever

2186
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,840
you want to be anytime

2187
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,840
I mean it's just about what you want your

2188
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,840
shit to be if you just want to have people

2189
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
make your shit for you and you just want to produce

2190
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
collaborative works that's fine I completely

2191
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,840
understand Jesse not wanting other people to edit

2192
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,840
his videos because the editing is often

2193
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,840
hilarious and has great stuff in it but like

2194
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,840
if you're like me and you

2195
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,840
are just not good at editing

2196
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
then maybe consider having someone

2197
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,840
who is good you know doing it with

2198
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840
you know I mean I think most of us

2199
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,840
agree that I'm one of the better editor amongst us

2200
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,840
and even I'm willing to say

2201
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,840
that I don't if I I don't think

2202
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
it's necessary to I don't even think

2203
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,840
I was gonna say like you do you don't

2204
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,840
have to have the best video

2205
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,840
it could possibly be all the time

2206
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840
like I don't yeah I definitely have been

2207
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,840
moving away from putting too much effort in this

2208
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,840
like especially on YouTube we're incentivized

2209
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,840
to make fast content here we go

2210
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,840
Jesse how about this how about this

2211
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,840
for the rule earn your

2212
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,840
editor how about that

2213
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,840
sure or at least pay them

2214
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,840
well you gotta pay your

2215
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,840
if you're making money well yeah if you're making money

2216
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,840
you should be paying them but what I mean by earn them is

2217
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,840
I don't think KP does any work

2218
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,840
on her videos I think the editors do all the work

2219
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,840
that's true that's what I think

2220
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,840
specifically watching a video going well at least

2221
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,840
this is well animated what I what I hate

2222
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,840
is like how I hate how

2223
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,840
popular she personally

2224
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,840
seems to be for her videos that clearly

2225
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,840
aren't her she didn't do it she wrote

2226
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,840
the script and read it fucking

2227
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,840
not very well let's let's be honest

2228
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,840
alright Jesse do your next point

2229
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,840
let's move on fuck I had

2230
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
something else to say but I can't even

2231
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
someone's gotta edit this

2232
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
we gotta cut cut that out I don't want to

2233
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
nobody here listen to what I said

2234
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,840
ignore that the next

2235
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,840
one is things that everyone

2236
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,840
has already fucking reviewed redundancy

2237
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,840
don't write it

2238
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,840
that's just don't do it

2239
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,840
and the next like four points are

2240
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
all actually redundant in themselves

2241
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,840
I'm gonna go shit he's a hypocrite

2242
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,840
yeah I'm

2243
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,840
grouping these together blank is

2244
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,840
overrated reviews

2245
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,840
controversial opinion reviews

2246
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
audience straw man

2247
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,840
bullshit just in general

2248
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
basing your review on other people's

2249
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,840
opinions don't do it

2250
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
it's not just an escape

2251
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,840
you're a fucking review should be

2252
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
your thoughts and no one else's

2253
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
I actually had a video

2254
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,840
that was gonna come out about this same subject

2255
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,840
but I got to the editing process

2256
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
and I didn't feel like doing it and I refuse

2257
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,840
to hire either I realize

2258
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
another another one that I want people to do

2259
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,840
which is um

2260
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
no shit I lost track of it oh yeah

2261
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
don't do this thing where

2262
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,840
you're afraid of having your opinion

2263
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,840
polluted by watching other people's reviews

2264
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,840
oh yeah watch everyone else's reviews

2265
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
right because if you do like people always

2266
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,840
say like oh well I I guess I get it

2267
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,840
for like a guy like Yahtzee where

2268
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,840
again like it's really about his like

2269
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,840
very carefully curated

2270
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,840
style of opinion then like

2271
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,840
if if you're watching the video

2272
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,840
because you want to hear that guy's

2273
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,840
thoughts and like nothing but that

2274
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,840
then I could see it but like

2275
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,840
if it's if someone

2276
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,840
puts out a review

2277
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,840
five years late for a show

2278
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,840
or even five months late for a show

2279
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
five weeks if everyone else

2280
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,840
has already reviewed it watch all of their reviews

2281
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,840
and make sure that someone hasn't said what you're about to say

2282
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,840
right or else you're just wasting everyone's

2283
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
time especially your own like have something

2284
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
new to say don't just say the same thing everybody else

2285
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,840
and you know what it's I'm glad we brought this up because

2286
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,840
this was a big reason why I was inspired

2287
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,840
to make my Gernlogan video because

2288
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,840
every single video I ever saw

2289
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,840
has these disgusting little

2290
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
like oh you know it's it's

2291
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
it's good but like there's all this

2292
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,840
there's all this obviously unnecessary shit

2293
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,840
there's all these little like it's not that smart

2294
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,840
and all the the ironic thing is

2295
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
these people weren't that smart because they couldn't see the

2296
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,840
incredibly obvious shit that all of us

2297
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
did when we watched it and so

2298
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,840
I this was this was an example of having

2299
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
to do something like this show is is loved

2300
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,840
but still vastly underrated

2301
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,840
for what it actually accomplishes

2302
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,840
which is bizarre to me and had to be corrected

2303
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,840
so that's exactly why I started doing

2304
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,840
my like with Eva and Gelyon

2305
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,840
like I was so worried for a long time that

2306
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,840
I was like everyone's already talked about Eva

2307
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
and it's not going to be worth it unless I either

2308
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
say absolutely everything or say

2309
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
something new and then it was sort of like

2310
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
gradually realizing

2311
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,840
that there was a lot less Eva analysis

2312
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,840
out there than I thought you know

2313
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,840
and like trying to come at it from like somewhat new

2314
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,840
angles or just sometimes it's just like

2315
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,840
representing something that's not in that medium

2316
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
like I'm willing to do a video on a

2317
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,840
subject that I've read a lot of

2318
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,840
reviews about but no one's made a video

2319
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
out of it because I think that people

2320
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,840
don't go back and don't read text

2321
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
you know sure yeah like there's a few like

2322
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
ghost lightning posts that I outright just want to

2323
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
adapt into video because like

2324
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,840
it'll exist in this medium now

2325
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,840
I think that's a good idea they'll probably

2326
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,840
get a lot more exposure that way anyway

2327
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
alright so Jesse you finished off your list right

2328
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
no oh jeez how many more

2329
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,840
my list is eternal it's endless

2330
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,840
like me

2331
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,840
alright well let's do the next one

2332
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,840
next one is

2333
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,840
blatantly missing the point of what you're talking

2334
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,840
about example

2335
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,840
sure sure example is

2336
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,840
Avon Gillian sucks because the characters are

2337
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,840
unlikable fuck you

2338
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,840
you dumb shit yeah I mean

2339
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,840
I don't like reviews that are obviously wrong

2340
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,840
not a fan like you could say

2341
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,840
the characters are unlikable dot dot dot I know

2342
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,840
that's the the intention but I don't like

2343
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,840
it then that's fine

2344
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,840
well I have a problem in general of people saying

2345
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,840
this character is bad

2346
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,840
so the show is bad

2347
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,840
well that's going to get us into part two

2348
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,840
of this podcast so

2349
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,840
part two people having

2350
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
my list god damn it

2351
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
no your list is going to apply to this as well

2352
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,840
I think okay part two of this podcast

2353
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,840
people's rules

2354
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
about shows

2355
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,840
like that one that like

2356
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,840
here's here's the one that bothers me the most

2357
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,840
and this is what made me want to do this

2358
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,840
podcast in the first place

2359
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,840
my trigger is when someone

2360
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,840
says that the pacing

2361
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,840
is bad and then

2362
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,840
doesn't explain why

2363
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
that is my number one trigger now

2364
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,840
in an analytical video

2365
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,840
is because people have

2366
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,840
taken for granted that

2367
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,840
a piece of work is supposed to

2368
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,840
be certain things that it's

2369
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,840
supposed to be paced a certain

2370
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,840
way that it's supposed to present its

2371
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,840
narrative in a certain way the characters

2372
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,840
supposed to be a certain way and the only times people

2373
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
break from their their pre-interpreted

2374
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,840
formula of what it's supposed to be

2375
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,840
is when it's obviously

2376
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,840
not supposed to be that right sure because

2377
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,840
everyone loves art house movies and stuff

2378
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,840
where like you look at it and you go oh

2379
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,840
well they obviously paste it differently because

2380
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,840
it's it's sending a message but then

2381
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,840
when that's not obvious people are

2382
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,840
like it's just badly paced you know

2383
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,840
yeah and that drives me insane

2384
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
because it's like you're so close to getting it

2385
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,840
and not like you clearly understand

2386
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,840
that every work is trying

2387
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,840
to do something different and that you should judge

2388
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,840
them on their own merits but then you're trying

2389
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,840
to put all of them into a box at the same

2390
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,840
time and it's like certain things are just

2391
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,840
the exception because you can tell its art

2392
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,840
you know like oh well obviously

2393
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,840
Ava's trying to do something different

2394
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,840
because it's Ava whereas like

2395
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,840
if some you know late night

2396
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,840
TV at a bay that's like really weird

2397
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,840
and no one gets why

2398
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,840
and they're just like yeah it's just

2399
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,840
I should just I should rephrase

2400
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,840
the wording of this rule

2401
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,840
instead of missing the point of what you're talking

2402
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,840
about the rule should be

2403
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,840
saying anything negative

2404
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,840
about Evangelion ever for any reason

2405
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,840
or disagreeing with me

2406
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,840
about anything

2407
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,840
you know that's an important point

2408
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,840
to remember when interpreting

2409
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,840
the intentionality of a work is that

2410
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,840
most almost any every single

2411
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,840
detail was intentional whether or not

2412
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,840
the intention was smart oh god

2413
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,840
there you go there's another huge one

2414
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
this is another one that like immediately

2415
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,840
pisses me off is when reviewers

2416
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,840
think that they are smarter

2417
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,840
than the creator

2418
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,840
that's what I was trying to say

2419
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,840
what said stupidly

2420
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,840
the worst game designer

2421
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,840
is categorically a more

2422
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,840
fulfilling artist than the best reviewer

2423
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
that's my emotional opinion

2424
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,840
that's my emotional opinion

2425
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,840
that's how I feel

2426
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,840
I think that a lot of bad

2427
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,840
art gets made in full

2428
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,840
self-awareness

2429
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,840
I think that a lot of stuff

2430
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,840
there are some cases where obviously

2431
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,840
the person just doesn't know what the fuck they're doing

2432
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,840
like if you look at like Birdemic or The Room

2433
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,840
where like the creators really thought they were

2434
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
making like a masterpiece and really came out

2435
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
and said that and then people were like

2436
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
you're insane like this is no

2437
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,840
this is not good you know right that's a different story

2438
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,840
there's obviously a reason why he picked

2439
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,840
the individual gifts for the birds

2440
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,840
like he's like well this one is pointing in this direction

2441
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,840
which will make more sense than that direction

2442
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,840
yeah but I mean I'm talking about like in the broad

2443
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,840
sense you can tell the guy

2444
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
doesn't appreciate what's bad

2445
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,840
about his movie until people told him

2446
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,840
you know but I think that a lot

2447
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,840
of creators make stuff

2448
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,840
like especially professionals like if we're talking about

2449
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,840
like an anime show gets made right and like

2450
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,840
the plot is full of plot holes

2451
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,840
the guys who wrote it probably

2452
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,840
know that like they are professional

2453
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,840
writers who are in the industry

2454
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,840
they're not trying to write a 10 out of 10

2455
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,840
every time they're trying to write something

2456
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,840
and like you know okay like I have

2457
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,840
this video series on the Astroscore right and there's

2458
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,840
a bunch of parts in there where I talk about how

2459
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,840
like I like my problems with A1 Studio

2460
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,840
but my problem is never that

2461
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,840
I think they're ignorant of these issues

2462
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
I think they know exactly

2463
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,840
what they're making and they just

2464
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,840
they have to because it's

2465
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
it's just their job you know like

2466
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
they're doing it and if you look at

2467
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,840
like if you listen to a lot of interviews

2468
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,840
with like Japanese creatives and stuff

2469
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,840
they very often make it clear

2470
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,840
that like everything was intentional

2471
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,840
like the style of story

2472
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,840
like Japan is very like demographically

2473
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,840
driven and very like

2474
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,840
genre driven where like

2475
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,840
if they're making a show about beautiful girls

2476
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,840
it's a beautiful girls show

2477
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,840
you know like they'll call it that

2478
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,840
like that's the concept they went at it with was

2479
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,840
oh we wanted to make a beautiful girls show

2480
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,840
so we came up with a story and here's what it is

2481
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,840
you know and like everything else

2482
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,840
is kind of incidental to the fact that it's a beautiful girls show

2483
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,840
you can make a great

2484
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,840
show on that basis like

2485
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,840
something like Girl in the Gone they went at it like

2486
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
a sex show or

2487
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,840
or Ereka 7 which was we wanted to make a video game

2488
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,840
that had an anime tie in

2489
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,840
and here's what we made you know

2490
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,840
wait did they do that

2491
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,840
yeah a lot of anime

2492
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,840
is based on it being a franchise

2493
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
where like they

2494
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,840
like with Ereka 7 it was like

2495
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,840
we want to make a video game and an anime

2496
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,840
with this robot designer so let's come up with them

2497
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,840
you know I didn't actually play the first

2498
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,840
video game of that I didn't know it was like

2499
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,840
I thought it was just a derivative work afterward

2500
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,840
no but it's the thing is that like

2501
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,840
it's different teams working on each right

2502
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,840
and like the people who made the game

2503
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,840
didn't make an amazing

2504
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,840
game that will remember for all time

2505
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,840
but the people who made the anime did you know

2506
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,840
but like it just happens that

2507
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,840
like I think everyone knew what they were doing

2508
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
everyone works on these things just like well

2509
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,840
maybe it'll be good and then they make something

2510
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,840
and sometimes it just happens to come out really amazing

2511
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,840
and they're like sweet and we actually did it

2512
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,840
and here's how you put it in one of your old videos

2513
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,840
one of the best points in your really old

2514
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,840
videos was nothing is made

2515
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
thoughtlessly it's just that some things

2516
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
are made with stupid thoughts

2517
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
but it wasn't like they didn't even think

2518
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
I mean every single problem

2519
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840
in My Little Pony for instance

2520
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,840
has been acknowledged by the writers they

2521
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,840
they're completely aware they're like

2522
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,840
yeah we had to do that because Hasbro

2523
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,840
mandated it or yeah we had to do that

2524
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,840
because we didn't have time

2525
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,840
to fix it you know like

2526
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,840
like the episode 15 of season 1

2527
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,840
of Feeling Pinky Keen

2528
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,840
the one where she's got the powers

2529
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,840
like the writer of that

2530
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,840
like he had written

2531
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,840
the episode no it wasn't that episode

2532
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,840
it was one that's in season 3

2533
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,840
or an even better example magical mystery cure

2534
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,840
where Emmy Larson came out and admitted that

2535
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,840
everything I said was correct

2536
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:01,840
right yeah you wanted to be two episodes

2537
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,840
you just couldn't fit in it

2538
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,840
he specifically said drowning in horseshoes

2539
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,840
the greatest reviewer in history

2540
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,840
but I'm not just talking about like studio mandates

2541
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,840
there was one where it was the guy who wrote

2542
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,840
this one episode that was

2543
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,840
something from season 3 but it was a really shitty episode

2544
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,840
where the ending was like really confusing

2545
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,840
and backwards and I asked the writer

2546
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
on Twitter like what was up with the

2547
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,840
ending and he said like it was just a mix-up

2548
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
in the scripting and we couldn't fix it in time

2549
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,840
I wonder if you could

2550
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840
evaluate all the reviewers and get

2551
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
like a robot to calculate which

2552
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,840
reviewers most often neglect

2553
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,840
the context of the fact that the writers are human

2554
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840
oh here we go

2555
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,840
mysterious Mr. Enter that's my biggest problem

2556
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,840
and then test to see

2557
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,840
if those reviewers who are more

2558
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,840
likely to do it don't make any art

2559
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,840
of their own outside of these youtube videos

2560
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,840
like if they're not the kind of kids who made

2561
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,840
you know drawings that much

2562
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,840
I wonder if that's what they are

2563
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,840
about the few mysterious Mr. Enter videos that I've seen

2564
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,840
is that he will

2565
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,840
he really focuses on the writer and he'll be like

2566
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,840
Megan McCarthy

2567
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,840
how could you make this shitty episode

2568
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,840
and I'm like I am absolutely

2569
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,840
sure that she knows all the problems with it

2570
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,840
she wrote it no one is

2571
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,840
more intimately familiar with their flaws

2572
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,840
than the creator and we all

2573
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,840
I think we can all attest to this right every flaw

2574
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,840
in all of our videos we know what it is

2575
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,840
like I know many problems

2576
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,840
that people don't interpret as problems we do

2577
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,840
see them as problems

2578
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,840
every video I've ever made there's a take to heart

2579
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,840
we know better than you what the

2580
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,840
fuck is wrong with her every single time

2581
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,840
I flub a word in my script I find

2582
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,840
it because I edit the video

2583
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,840
so like you know I record this long script

2584
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,840
and I edit it together and then I hear

2585
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,840
where like I skipped a word at one part

2586
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,840
and I'm like oh fuck and then every time I watch the video

2587
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,840
all I can think about is that

2588
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,840
sometimes we just don't get

2589
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,840
around to fixing the problems and I think a lot

2590
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,840
of like really professional

2591
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,840
stuff it comes from that place

2592
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,840
like with anime especially because it's all churned out

2593
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,840
on like a schedule you can't just go back and fix it

2594
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,840
you have investors there's people

2595
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,840
a time slot picked out you know

2596
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,840
if you get to episode 12 and you're

2597
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,840
writing and you don't have time to fix the

2598
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,840
slot hole then it's just fuck it we're shipping it

2599
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,840
like we can't not you know it's

2600
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,840
it's too far along and I think

2601
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,840
so few people appreciate that and they act

2602
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,840
like oh this writer is such

2603
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,840
an idiot how could you do this thing it's like

2604
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,840
I assure you they're aware of it

2605
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,840
that's true that's true you shouldn't assume

2606
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,840
those things but you should still of course

2607
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,840
incorporate those into your thoughts

2608
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,840
on the overall show

2609
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,840
he's felt bad about a lot

2610
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,840
of his old reviews and is like taking them down

2611
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,840
I think because it's good he should take down

2612
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,840
his whole channel fuck him

2613
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,840
I think as I've said

2614
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,840
oh shit

2615
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,840
I lost my train of thought because you brought up

2616
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,840
Mr. Enter and I forgot what I was going to say

2617
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,840
this is what Mr. Enter does to the community

2618
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,840
well speaking of Mr. Enter

2619
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,840
the next item on my list happens to be

2620
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,840
overly complex

2621
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,840
scoring systems

2622
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,840
get the fuck out of here with your

2623
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,840
well it gets a 3 out of 5

2624
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,840
sound design and a 2 out of 5

2625
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,840
for voice acting a 4 out of

2626
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,840
5 for graphics

2627
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,840
I don't know what piece of media

2628
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,840
has those criteria

2629
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,840
yeah

2630
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,840
fuck that just talk about the thing

2631
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,840
and uh

2632
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,840
here's what bothers me about rating systems

2633
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,840
is that they should always be fluid

2634
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,840
and therefore they should never be in a video

2635
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,840
like if I watch a show

2636
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,840
that's a 10 out of 10

2637
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,840
and then a month later I watch a show

2638
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,840
that I consider to be much better

2639
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,840
and that's now my 10 out of 10

2640
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,840
the old score is completely irrelevant

2641
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,840
I'll put it this way

2642
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,840
if I

2643
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,840
if I have sex with a hot girl

2644
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,840
and I'm bragging all my friends about it

2645
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,840
which happens often

2646
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,840
as these guys get a test too

2647
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,840
oh yeah

2648
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,840
but if I had sex

2649
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,840
well that's what I'm about to do

2650
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,840
if I have sex with a hot girl

2651
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,840
and I'm bragging about it

2652
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,840
like a douchebag as I am

2653
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,840
I don't go

2654
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,840
5 out of 10 but her butt

2655
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,840
wasn't 6 out of 10

2656
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,840
and then

2657
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,840
I give her one numerical value

2658
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,840
and only one for the whole package

2659
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:07,840
because people are not a bunch of separate

2660
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,840
compartmentalized things

2661
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,840
people are wonderful beautiful creatures

2662
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,840
even when they're like a 6 out of 10

2663
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,840
you gotta

2664
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,840
but her pussy game man

2665
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,840
10 out of 10 on that shit

2666
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,840
here's what I think that

2667
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,840
every scoring system falls apart when you try to do it that way

2668
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,840
cause at some point

2669
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,840
on my anime

2670
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,840
list one of the scores that

2671
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,840
it's like sound, video, character story

2672
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,840
and then enjoyment

2673
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,840
and enjoyment

2674
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,840
is such a weird thing

2675
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,840
because like overall

2676
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,840
the music but overall enjoyment was pretty shit

2677
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,840
but here's the thing

2678
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,840
to me enjoyment really means context

2679
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,840
and like here's the thing

2680
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,840
if I watch a show like let's say Lucky Star again

2681
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,840
and the context is super important to why I like the show

2682
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,840
and then another show

2683
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,840
that I still think is amazing but there's like

2684
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,840
no context into why

2685
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,840
what if I watch a show with all my best friends

2686
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,840
and I give it a 10 out of 10

2687
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,840
versus someone else who watched a show like alone

2688
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,840
and they had just been shot and they're currently bleeding out

2689
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,840
like okay my German was a 0

2690
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,840
didn't like the show

2691
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,840
I think that's another one of those cases

2692
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,840
of like being so close to getting it

2693
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,840
but not quite where it's like

2694
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,840
you get that there's an ephemeral

2695
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:19,840
factor to why you like stuff

2696
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,840
and you try to then define that

2697
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,840
and it's like those scores

2698
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,840
mean nothing

2699
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,840
like the context

2700
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,840
should not have a score

2701
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,840
it should just be a part of why you like the thing

2702
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,840
you know like the context is inseparable

2703
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,840
from the work but like

2704
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,840
I don't think like if I

2705
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,840
if I watched like Kaiba

2706
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,840
and it didn't have any special

2707
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,840
additional context score

2708
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,840
so that's just a 0

2709
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,840
and then Lucky Star it's a 10

2710
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,840
against the other like am I supposed to go

2711
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,840
story 9 characters 9

2712
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,840
art 9 sound 9

2713
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,840
context 0 and then take the

2714
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,840
average of that and it completely

2715
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,840
fucks up the score it's like no

2716
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,840
it's indefinable

2717
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,840
getting towards something about

2718
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,840
just the general consumption of media

2719
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,840
and sorting your feelings on it

2720
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,840
that has been like one of the best things

2721
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,840
that you've indirectly taught me is

2722
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,840
do not hold on to your opinions

2723
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,840
don't hold them as precious

2724
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,840
don't flip at the drop of a hat

2725
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,840
because it's way way more

2726
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,840
oh man that's also another

2727
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,840
once someone especially

2728
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,840
an amateur reviewer give something a 10

2729
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,840
they feel an obligation

2730
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,840
I used to feel an obligation

2731
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,840
to make sure that I always

2732
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,840
continue to like it and if there was any doubt

2733
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,840
I would start rationalizing to myself

2734
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,840
no it has to still be a 10

2735
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,840
it has to be nothing is worse to me

2736
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,840
than when someone has

2737
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,840
a narrative opinion

2738
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,840
that has clearly

2739
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,840
been like too long

2740
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,840
in the works like when you like you said

2741
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,840
like they have their favorite anime

2742
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,840
that they watched like five years ago

2743
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,840
and they continue to compare everything to that

2744
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,840
even though if they watched it again

2745
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,840
then they have to select I've seen it

2746
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,840
where people like rewatch something

2747
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,840
and immediately realize they don't love it as much

2748
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,840
as they did before but

2749
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,840
because they gave it a 10 once

2750
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,840
they don't want to admit they were wrong before

2751
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,840
and so they keep talking about it

2752
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,840
as much now but I mean it's still the greatest thing

2753
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,840
well I think part of it

2754
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:17,840
is feeling like they don't want to be wrong

2755
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,840
but I think more importantly it's the feeling of

2756
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:21,840
they have an obligation to be loyal

2757
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,840
they don't want to abandon it

2758
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,840
for example you did a full playthrough

2759
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,840
with your brother on Sonic Adventure 2 battle

2760
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,840
and it was your favorite game as a kid

2761
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:31,840
a lot of people remember that game very fondly

2762
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,840
even though it's objectively shit

2763
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,840
you have no

2764
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:37,840
you have no trouble

2765
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,840
reconciling the fact that you think it's a terrible

2766
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,840
game now but you thought it was an amazing game

2767
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,840
then and you can simultaneously appreciate

2768
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,840
your nostalgia for it while also hating it

2769
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,840
you don't have to

2770
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,840
continue to say it's good in order to

2771
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,840
enjoy your nostalgia for it

2772
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,840
and it's so much more satisfying

2773
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,840
to just let your favorite stuff change

2774
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,840
constantly like moviebob's favorite game is still

2775
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,840
Super Mario Brothers 3 and I'm like are you fucking

2776
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,840
kidding that's...

2777
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,840
I don't care that you have your favorite game

2778
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,840
forever the idea that your favorite

2779
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,840
to change constantly is way more

2780
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,840
interesting I think it's both possible

2781
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,840
and probable to actually have a

2782
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,840
favorite forever if it's just something that's

2783
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,840
so special to you

2784
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,840
and that's why letting you

2785
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,840
like I think that did you if you were

2786
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,840
to rewatch any show you gave a 10 and you didn't like

2787
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,840
it as much you would have no trouble

2788
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,840
no hesitation giving it an 8 or a 7

2789
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,840
and you would totally take things

2790
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,840
off your favorites list rearrange it which is

2791
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,840
why the fact that Kaon has been

2792
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,840
at your top for like 5 years is so

2793
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,840
impressive it has not been up there for 5 years

2794
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,840
but it's faltered here in your

2795
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,840
it's been a little while it's been for 3 or 4 years

2796
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,840
it wasn't even when I first watched it I didn't even consider

2797
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,840
my favorite show of that year

2798
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,840
well however many years

2799
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,840
it's very impressive that it actually

2800
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,840
has managed to regain that position

2801
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,840
yeah it's a yeah

2802
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,840
and like yeah I change stuff

2803
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:55,840
up so much but yeah like I think that it's possible

2804
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,840
to have a favorite because of the context

2805
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,840
around it and like that that it's been

2806
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,840
with you for so long that that's why it's your favorite

2807
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,840
but again it has to be

2808
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,840
genuine like my friend

2809
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,840
Ghost Lightning his favorite anime has been

2810
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,840
Super Dimensional Fortress Macross for like

2811
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,840
27 years or something like that

2812
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,840
but he rewatches it all the time

2813
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,840
and like reaffirms his feelings

2814
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,840
and finds new reasons that it's his favorite

2815
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,840
and like recontextualizes it

2816
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,840
and like has all these different reasons

2817
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,840
whereas everything else in his favorites list

2818
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,840
changes all the time you know it'll be like

2819
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,840
oh I just watched Utena and now that's

2820
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,840
my number 2 because I can't believe it's real

2821
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,840
you know you have to ask yourself a question though

2822
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,840
is it possible that that show

2823
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,840
he could learn something about it

2824
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,840
or that something else would like beat it out

2825
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,840
considering all the investment he's now

2826
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,840
put into loving that show

2827
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,840
that's the thing I think that's valid though

2828
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,840
like I don't think it's that he's blind

2829
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,840
like he's very openly admitting

2830
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,840
like I don't expect anyone else to feel this way

2831
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,840
but here's why I feel this way

2832
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,840
it's not like you're not allowed to do that

2833
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,840
like there's so much to why he likes it

2834
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,840
that he can go on and on and on all day

2835
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,840
like I've listened to him talk for hours about

2836
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,840
this is a more recently

2837
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,840
exacerbated problem when

2838
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,840
fan communities show up on Tumblr

2839
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,840
oh god let's not even get into fan communities

2840
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,840
that's a whole other

2841
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,840
well the point is it makes people even more invested

2842
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,840
and it means that like people have to keep

2843
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:15,840
it's that much harder to get out of it

2844
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,840
like Undertale is a single player game

2845
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,840
with a few different story paths

2846
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,840
and once you're done you could probably put it down for a year

2847
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,840
and come back to it but because

2848
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,840
so many people just draw comics and no one cares

2849
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,840
but then they draw stands crying and people care

2850
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,840
and now they have to care about Undertale forever

2851
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,840
like mage says currently it's her favorite game ever

2852
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,840
would it be without Tumblr? no definitely not

2853
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,840
what would be my favorite game though

2854
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,840
it's a matter of you get trapped

2855
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,840
you get trapped in the idea that you're a fan

2856
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,840
of this thing and that's like

2857
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,840
I think the problem is just people

2858
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,840
taking things as their identity

2859
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,840
like identifying themselves as a fan

2860
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,840
I think that's how so many of those

2861
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,840
nostalgia things stick around for so long

2862
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,840
is like that uh

2863
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,840
cause my ex-girlfriend was pretty bad about this

2864
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,840
like everything she liked as a kid was still

2865
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,840
perfect to her because she liked it

2866
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,840
as a kid but then I would like literally

2867
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,840
watch her like re-watch something with her

2868
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,840
and like see the realization

2869
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,840
that I don't care about this anymore

2870
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,840
but then she couldn't like admit it to herself

2871
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,840
because she'd identified it

2872
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,840
you know that was rough for me when I re-watched Poo's Grand Adventure recently

2873
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,840
that's a movie that had a lot of

2874
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,840
meaning to me and kinda shitty

2875
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,840
kinda not that good

2876
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,840
people just don't get it which is why they

2877
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,840
when you stopped being interested in my little pony

2878
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,840
that much people were like

2879
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,840
you are betraying your identity

2880
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,840
you are betraying the thing

2881
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,840
you are betraying our entire religion

2882
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,840
if you no longer like

2883
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,840
this my little pony show that much

2884
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,840
it's not a matter of fear

2885
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,840
everything we knew about you must have been a lie as well

2886
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,840
you must be losing your grip on your sanity

2887
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,840
they couldn't understand that you just move on

2888
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:45,840
to a different show

2889
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,840
I've had so many people think that I became

2890
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,840
a depressed and different person

2891
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,840
just because I don't watch the same cartoons anymore

2892
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,840
alright Jesse what else is on your list

2893
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,840
let's see

2894
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,840
the next one is flash

2895
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,840
over substance

2896
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,840
John Tron

2897
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,840
what have you become

2898
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,840
these days he's the prime example of that

2899
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,840
I'm gonna say

2900
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,840
it's not just flash over substance

2901
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,840
because I think John Tron was always mostly like

2902
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,840
flashy jokes

2903
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,840
but do it right

2904
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,840
if you're gonna have

2905
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,840
take into consideration

2906
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,840
what your production values mean

2907
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,840
like I've been saying this a lot

2908
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,840
how John Tron his set

2909
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,840
does not look like a house anyone would live in

2910
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,840
and therefore you do not have

2911
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,840
it's like a creepy dark brick

2912
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,840
fucking fortress

2913
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,840
it's literally a set

2914
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,840
when you watch John Tron's videos before

2915
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,840
the idea was he's in his apartment

2916
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,840
playing video games

2917
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,840
when you look at him on the set you just think

2918
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,840
why the fuck are you playing video games on a set

2919
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,840
why are you doing that

2920
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,840
completely undoing all the

2921
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,840
comfiness of his old stuff

2922
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,840
he's got this slave extra he hires

2923
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,840
and he's got people coming in

2924
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,840
through the door and dressing these fancy costumes

2925
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,840
it's like what the

2926
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,840
I actually like the Ethan Klein Kool-Aid thing

2927
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,840
that was a good joke that was funny it was simple

2928
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,840
it hit the point that was everything that was good about John Tron

2929
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,840
he'll do these

2930
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:09,840
he'll use these HD cameras

2931
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,840
and have them

2932
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,840
do these slow pans across

2933
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,840
pans are not funny

2934
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,840
wide angle shots are not funny

2935
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:19,840
the close up shaky cam zoom in

2936
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,840
on the face that's funny

2937
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,840
that's good stuff

2938
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,840
nothing will ever be funnier than

2939
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,840
oh my god

2940
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,840
and the camera just zooming in on him

2941
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,840
making this facial expression

2942
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,840
the face is funny the camera

2943
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,840
mimics the joke

2944
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:37,840
having a slow panning shot of you

2945
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:39,840
in a weird set in HD

2946
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,840
it's like this is what

2947
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,840
I would expect from a product shoot

2948
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,840
a fucking comedy video

2949
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,840
here's basically how it works

2950
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,840
the more details your joke has

2951
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,840
the more every single detail has to be perfect

2952
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,840
if your joke is bare bones

2953
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:55,840
but if you're going to be complex

2954
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,840
you have to be an absolute master

2955
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,840
in every single medium

2956
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,840
John got to this place

2957
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,840
by doing the opposite of what he's doing now

2958
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,840
and now he's trying to apply that same formula

2959
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,840
and it's not working at all

2960
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,840
it's totally wrong

2961
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,840
if you're going to up your production

2962
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,840
he can't be doing what he's doing now

2963
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,840
if he's going to have all these high productions

2964
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,840
he needs to do like, I don't know

2965
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,840
something else

2966
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,840
you can't just have a set

2967
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,840
because it looks expensive

2968
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,840
have a set because the joke involves a set

2969
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:27,840
I get so mad when I think

2970
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,840
about how much money he's wasting on this

2971
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,840
only to make much worse content

2972
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,840
it furiates me

2973
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,840
it really hit me when

2974
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:37,840
he had a small

2975
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,840
horse pony on the set

2976
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,840
and the joke was

2977
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,840
I have a horse

2978
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:45,840
and it's doing things to my set

2979
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,840
it would have been a hundred times funnier

2980
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,840
if he had one of his buddies in a shitty horse costume

2981
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,840
that would have been so much better

2982
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,840
not cost a thousand dollars for a day

2983
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,840
and the whole video wasn't about horses at all

2984
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:57,840
it was just he had the opportunity to buy a horse

2985
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,840
I could never do this

2986
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,840
how much funnier would it have been

2987
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,840
if the joke had been

2988
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,840
it was a guy and a horse

2989
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,840
and he was dressed as a horse

2990
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:09,840
it's now and then it's a guy in a horse costume

2991
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,840
that would have been much fun

2992
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,840
it's like some letterman shit

2993
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,840
they bring out celebrities

2994
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,840
and do retarded dances

2995
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,840
it feels alien

2996
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,840
do you think it's possible that

2997
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,840
beatum has deliberately avoided buying good audio equipment

2998
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,840
to create a narrative that he's some random asshole

2999
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:27,840
throwing together something in a movie

3000
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,840
in this case no

3001
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,840
I think he's just cheap

3002
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,840
he clearly doesn't prioritize you

3003
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,840
I don't think that's the only reason

3004
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:37,840
that he's considered getting good audio

3005
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,840
he's like well if I keep it shitty

3006
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,840
then I continue to look like a total jerk face head

3007
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,840
and you know like

3008
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:45,840
I don't think he really concerns himself

3009
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,840
with his own YouTube narrative

3010
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,840
there's three more things

3011
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,840
there's only three more things on the list

3012
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:53,840
this one is reviewing

3013
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,840
people

3014
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,840
don't do it

3015
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,840
aren't we doing that right now

3016
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,840
I mean like specifically

3017
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,840
guys like Sargon of Akkad

3018
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,840
really does is like pick out people

3019
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,840
and that leads me to the next one

3020
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:09,840
this is the main part of it

3021
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,840
that annoys me

3022
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,840
response videos

3023
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,840
that pause to make a glib comment

3024
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,840
about every fucking line

3025
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,840
oh shit

3026
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,840
Sargon of Akkad

3027
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,840
even Thunderfoot kind of does it

3028
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,840
he's better than most

3029
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,840
amazing atheist, Shuwon head

3030
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,840
all of those fucking people, TLDR

3031
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,840
it is the laziest

3032
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,840
whole way you can possibly do it

3033
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,840
sometimes it's funny, I admit it, I've watched a lot

3034
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,840
sometimes they're funny, especially like when I agree with them

3035
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:39,840
and I'm like hey yeah fuck those guys

3036
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,840
they're completely wrong, I don't give a shit about their opinion

3037
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,840
like it feels good

3038
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,840
but it's intellectually bankrupt

3039
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,840
to act like the other person is just

3040
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,840
you're just mischaracterizing everything they're doing

3041
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,840
you're acting like your opinion is the only one that has

3042
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:53,840
any value and the other people are obviously

3043
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,840
objectively wrong

3044
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,840
it's smug and like self-satisfied

3045
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,840
and all these people are like shooting

3046
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:01,840
over 100,000 subscribers because people

3047
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:03,840
eat it the fuck up

3048
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,840
it's like the way that children communicate

3049
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,840
like you take everything a person says

3050
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,840
you interrupt them and go child issues

3051
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,840
second piece of shit

3052
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,840
if you're gonna do it, one format that's especially bad

3053
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,840
is anytime you're

3054
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:17,840
talking it's represented by a still image

3055
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,840
of your OC

3056
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,840
everyone does that

3057
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:23,840
one like 11 year old kid

3058
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,840
made that for my roller coaster

3059
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,840
tycoon 3 video

3060
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,840
I commented so politely that he

3061
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:31,840
deleted the video, deleted all of his videos

3062
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:33,840
that were liked and apologized

3063
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,840
and I'm like good on you

3064
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,840
great example, I hate everything

3065
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,840
we were talking about that the other day

3066
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,840
if you do the still image

3067
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,840
of your OC

3068
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,840
YouTube is a fucking visual medium

3069
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,840
you lazy goddamn hacks

3070
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:49,840
everything is especially funny

3071
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,840
because he's talking about Derek saying

3072
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,840
I'm actually a decent person and I don't hate everything

3073
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:55,840
and I love my work

3074
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,840
even if you're on screen

3075
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,840
and I also want to say

3076
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:01,840
I hate any

3077
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,840
dehumanizing arguments

3078
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,840
even if someone says

3079
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,840
something that you completely disagree with

3080
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,840
they probably have a reason

3081
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,840
and a background

3082
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,840
and a reason that led them to that

3083
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:15,840
and I understand being angry at people for being wrong

3084
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,840
and spreading misinformation

3085
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,840
but we're trying to

3086
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:21,840
the way forward is conversation

3087
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,840
insulting people

3088
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,840
making them look like idiots

3089
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,840
is not going to bring us closer to

3090
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,840
like, YMS's response to Daddy Derek

3091
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,840
was perfect because he was explaining

3092
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,840
to him, here's the things you said

3093
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,840
that are wrong, he has this very calm

3094
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,840
demeanor like, I'm trying to explain it to you

3095
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,840
he didn't just assume that everything was

3096
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,840
obviously wrong, he didn't even need to explain it

3097
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,840
he took the time and thought it out, it was good

3098
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,840
he clearly came from the perspective

3099
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,840
but YMS obviously thought Daddy Derek

3100
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,840
just is ignorant

3101
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,840
he didn't come at it like, this guy is an

3102
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,840
evil monster who's trying to fuck us

3103
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,840
out of our money, it's more like

3104
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,840
Daddy Derek, you are ignorant

3105
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:59,840
you don't understand what you're doing to us

3106
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,840
having seen a cool cat save the kids

3107
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,840
it's very understandable

3108
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,840
so I think a great example of this

3109
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,840
that happened to us just yesterday is

3110
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,840
the gaming badger who was

3111
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,840
railing on DeVoo and Jesse Wood

3112
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,840
just because they said things that he doesn't agree with

3113
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,840
and therefore he presents them

3114
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,840
like they are fucking idiots

3115
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,840
and we talk about it

3116
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,840
we're all proud that Jesse blocked him on Twitter

3117
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:23,840
and it's like, dude

3118
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,840
you haven't, you have dehumanized

3119
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,840
your opponent

3120
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:29,840
have fun being proud of the fact that you're an annoying moron

3121
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:31,840
and somebody hates you enough to block you

3122
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,840
have fun, go ahead and frame it

3123
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,840
on your fucking wall

3124
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,840
I want you to fucking frame it so that you can look at it

3125
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,840
every day and it can fucking remind you

3126
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,840
what a stupid piece of shit you are

3127
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:43,840
you dumb motherfucker

3128
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,840
the day that Endless just

3129
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,840
blocked you for you

3130
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,840
was the most important day of your life

3131
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:51,840
and for me, it was Tuesday

3132
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,840
motherfucker

3133
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,840
wait, who are you talking about?

3134
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,840
it's a gaming badger

3135
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:59,840
let's move on real quick

3136
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,840
I don't hate everybody

3137
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,840
who does that, I just think their videos

3138
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,840
are vapid

3139
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,840
they're playing the game man, they're hustling

3140
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,840
so do what you gotta do

3141
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:11,840
great minds discuss ideas

3142
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,840
average minds discuss events

3143
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,840
small minds discuss people

3144
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,840
like Ellen Roosevelt or something

3145
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:19,840
I think it was Ellen DeGeneres actually

3146
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,840
in her leading role as Dory

3147
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,840
alright, Jesse

3148
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,840
and the final

3149
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,840
the final thing on my list

3150
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,840
the number one worst thing

3151
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,840
that a reviewer can do

3152
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,840
listening to jerks on the internet

3153
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:35,840
tell you how to make your videos

3154
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,840
oh, shit

3155
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,840
oh, it's a mom shall be

3156
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:41,840
and that's an excuse

3157
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:43,840
you all failed

3158
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,840
I think Jesse would self-aware

3159
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,840
kind of joke right there

3160
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,840
that's why he gets all the subs

3161
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,840
that's why he gets the big ones

3162
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,840
although

3163
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,840
word of advice, take everything we've said

3164
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,840
in this video very seriously

3165
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,840
and please consider it, because I don't want to have to watch

3166
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,840
more shitty reviews

3167
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:03,840
I bet there are people who already sucked

3168
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,840
if they tried to follow this advice

3169
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:07,840
for some reason it'll get even worse

3170
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:09,840
if they aren't true to their crappy selves

3171
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:11,840
I'm not saying

3172
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,840
let this inform your overall idea

3173
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,840
of what a review is

3174
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:17,840
it's all part of the artistic process

3175
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:19,840
you put out the ideas that you think might work

3176
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,840
you see how they do, and then you adjust

3177
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,840
and you find out what works

3178
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,840
and better yet, just rip off all of us

3179
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:27,840
because we're all great

3180
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:29,840
and that's the only reason

3181
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,840
like DeVu said earlier

3182
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:33,840
the reason that the five of us are friends

3183
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,840
is that we all love one another's videos

3184
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,840
the reason this friendship happened

3185
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,840
is because each of us were very big fans

3186
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:41,840
of what the others were doing

3187
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,840
and so we all sort of became

3188
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,840
this group

3189
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,840
and the reason that

3190
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,840
it's just that we all have the same ethos

3191
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,840
and we all sort of understand reviews in a similar way

3192
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,840
and we've even kind of tried to introduce

3193
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,840
other people that weren't

3194
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,840
that and just put them in here

3195
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,840
and it just doesn't work out, they just leave

3196
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,840
because I think you really need

3197
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:03,840
if you want to impress

3198
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,840
us specifically

3199
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,840
please follow the rules we've talked about

3200
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,840
and maybe you'll become our best friend

3201
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,840
in the world

3202
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:13,840
you could be in the procrastinators next time

3203
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:15,840
that's your incentive to make videos that I want to watch

3204
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,840
that's going to decentivize them

3205
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:21,840
don't want to be with these fucking assholes

3206
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,840
the egos are getting

3207
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,840
ridiculous right now

3208
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:27,840
I think this is our longest video

3209
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,840
beating out episode one now

3210
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,840
maybe only by a little bit

3211
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,840
we pretty much covered what I wanted to say about

3212
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,840
reviewers having rules

3213
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,840
I guess my rule is

3214
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:39,840
don't

3215
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,840
just don't apply the same logic to everything

3216
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:43,840
everything is made

3217
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,840
for its own unique purpose

3218
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,840
and you should be looking for

3219
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:49,840
what is interesting and unique about that work

3220
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,840
if you can watch a show

3221
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,840
and be like well the pacing sucked

3222
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:55,840
it's like by what metric

3223
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:57,840
what are you comparing it to

3224
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,840
what's the grounds here

3225
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,840
I don't like it when people have a very specific

3226
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:03,840
this is what a show should be

3227
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,840
it's so narrow minded

3228
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,840
and puts everything in such of a same formula

3229
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:09,840
and box that it really

3230
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,840
disturbs me

3231
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,840
you need to talk about why what it attempted to do

3232
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,840
either succeeded or failed

3233
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,840
and it's one thing to say in pacing

3234
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:19,840
or in passing rather

3235
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:21,840
the pacing bothered me

3236
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,840
but if you're writing a reviewer analysis

3237
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,840
you have to justify that

3238
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:27,840
you have to justify that belief

3239
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,840
because that's the point of a reviewer analysis

3240
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,840
is not to state your opinions

3241
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:33,840
because I don't give a fuck about your opinions

3242
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,840
it's to justify your opinions

3243
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,840
that's the purpose

3244
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,840
yeah

3245
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:41,840
to just want to say

3246
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,840
if you haven't

3247
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:45,840
if you've always wanted to

3248
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,840
do reviews and stuff

3249
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:49,840
don't let us like all these rules

3250
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:51,840
intimidate you into not trying

3251
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,840
you're allowed to make a lot of mistakes

3252
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,840
and make a load of shitty videos

3253
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,840
the only way to make good videos is to make a lot of shitty videos

3254
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,840
eventually if you keep trying to improve you way

3255
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,840
I think

3256
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,840
for the number one thing is

3257
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,840
just don't send them to me

3258
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:07,840
make all those shitty videos

3259
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:09,840
just don't make me watch them until you're confident

3260
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,840
sure

3261
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,840
I mean I know it's obvious

3262
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,840
but you know do the videos you want to do

3263
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,840
like if you want to have an ultimate example

3264
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,840
the new storyteller makes videos for himself

3265
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,840
and him alone and he clearly really likes

3266
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,840
doing it is that that sonic guy

3267
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,840
no he's a guy who does that

3268
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,840
Thomas the Tank engine

3269
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,840
that guy

3270
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,840
yes

3271
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,840
what was his name said again

3272
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,840
the new storyteller

3273
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,840
well over 10,000

3274
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,840
Thomas the Tank engine

3275
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,840
he's the most prolific person ever

3276
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:43,840
he makes like three a day

3277
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,840
and they're long

3278
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:47,840
they reach like two hours

3279
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,840
so do what you want

3280
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,840
because I think a lot of people just really like making boring videos

3281
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:53,840
and if you just want to come to peace

3282
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:55,840
to terms with that

3283
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,840
oh I have no qualms with anybody

3284
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,840
who does something just because they want to

3285
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:01,840
like just because it seems like

3286
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:03,840
I have problems with people who want to be famous

3287
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,840
or they want to be in the reviewer circles

3288
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:07,840
or they want to be just like their idols

3289
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,840
and then they completely misinterpret it

3290
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,840
well because you see for me the number

3291
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,840
one of my biggest incentives for being on this

3292
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,840
for what I'm talking about here is there's this guy who does

3293
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,840
really basic videos

3294
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:19,840
very basic videos that tell me nothing

3295
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:21,840
but then he also feels bad because he can't come up with ideas

3296
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,840
and he doesn't understand

3297
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:25,840
and he's not

3298
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,840
he's like unsatisfied with his videos

3299
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:29,840
but he's not trying to pursue

3300
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:31,840
something interesting

3301
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:33,840
what do you do with people like that dude?

3302
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,840
you tell him just like keep trying

3303
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,840
there was a great Ernest Hemingway

3304
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,840
that I just saw on Twitter today

3305
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,840
which was

3306
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:43,840
if you think you want to be a

3307
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,840
it was anyone who wants to be a writer

3308
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:47,840
but doesn't write doesn't

3309
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:49,840
sure

3310
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:51,840
if you think you want to be a writer

3311
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,840
if you don't like writing don't try to write

3312
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:55,840
and that's exactly what happened to me

3313
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:57,840
we were discussing this last night

3314
02:17:57,840 --> 02:17:59,840
that I didn't you know for a long time

3315
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,840
I thought I was going to be a filmmaker

3316
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:03,840
I thought I was going to be a novelist

3317
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:05,840
and I really for like years put myself in that mindset

3318
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:07,840
that that's what I was going to do

3319
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:09,840
and then I just didn't write

3320
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:11,840
and at some point I woke up to the fact that

3321
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:13,840
if I'm not writing like everyone who is a good writer

3322
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,840
who writes professionally

3323
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:17,840
all they like to do is write

3324
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:19,840
Stephen King pumps out a book every year

3325
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,840
literally all he likes doing

3326
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,840
if it doesn't come

3327
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,840
like if it's not something that you

3328
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,840
innately want to do

3329
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,840
then maybe it's not for you

3330
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,840
like if it's something you have to force yourself

3331
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,840
and you don't even enjoy it

3332
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,840
and you just feel like you have to because it's obligated

3333
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:37,840
you know

3334
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:39,840
because this shit is hard fucking work

3335
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,840
this takes a long ass time to make something

3336
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,840
like all of my videos are completely out of like

3337
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,840
I can't live with myself not sharing these opinions

3338
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,840
you know

3339
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,840
especially Jesse is the most like

3340
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:51,840
I can't do anything but make videos

3341
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,840
and therefore that's what I'm going to do

3342
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:55,840
guy you know

3343
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:57,840
yeah like if your only way to make

3344
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,840
like let's say by default you make your videos

3345
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,840
shittily like they don't have good production values

3346
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,840
but if

3347
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,840
by making the videos well produced

3348
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:07,840
and following these rules that we've outlined

3349
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,840
makes it completely not fun for you

3350
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,840
like obviously making the videos good

3351
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,840
takes a lot of work and it gets really tedious

3352
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:15,840
but if the work

3353
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:17,840
really drains your

3354
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:19,840
enjoyment of it

3355
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,840
then just make shitty videos

3356
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,840
because then those videos would have more soul

3357
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,840
and soul counts for something

3358
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:27,840
make shitty videos and don't complain that you're not popular

3359
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:29,840
and don't send them to people

3360
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,840
don't complain that we're making fun of you

3361
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:33,840
the number one golden rule everybody

3362
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:35,840
the only one that is really important

3363
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:37,840
the only audience that

3364
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:39,840
matters is you yourself

3365
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:41,840
fuck everyone else

3366
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,840
the audience is always wrong

3367
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,840
everyone can go fucking take a long walk

3368
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,840
off a short pier

3369
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,840
anyone who tells you what to do

3370
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,840
or fucking fuck them all

3371
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:53,840
fuck them the golden rule

3372
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,840
as always

3373
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,840
doctor horseshoes golden rule

3374
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,840
fuck them

3375
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,840
alright that's it everybody

3376
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:03,840
see you next time on the procrastinator's podcast

3377
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,840
hopefully you gained some insight

3378
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,840
into this or just enjoyed the catharsis

3379
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:09,840
of listening to us beat up on

3380
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,840
people

3381
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,840
just some real shit

3382
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:15,840
as soon as you said your big point

3383
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,840
it was your skype

3384
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:19,840
I just laid down the most inspirational shit

3385
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,840
and no one will ever hear it

3386
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:23,840
but it'll be in the recording though

3387
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:25,840
rest easy

3388
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,840
my friend

3389
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,840
you're gonna get the recording it's gonna be like

3390
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,840
remember

3391
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,840
alright let's all stop our recording

3392
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,840
alright everybody say goodbye

3393
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,840
goodbye

3394
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:43,840
bye B

3395
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,840
I'm just making fun of myself at this point

3396
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:13,840
frankly
