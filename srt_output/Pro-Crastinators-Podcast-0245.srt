00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Welcome to another Pro Crastinators Podcast, Ben Saint. And who else is here?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There's me, Gibbontake, and we've got Tom Oliver.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Henshinagogo, baby. Wow.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we've got our buddy, our lord and savior, our master of disaster drawing.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Kaiju Koon.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Kaiju Koon.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You used to be called Nexus Mania, some people might know you as Nexus Mania.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The artist formerly known as Nexus Mania.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, no. I don't know who that is.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, deal.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's me, yeah. I made it. I'm here.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You made it.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you do, Kaiju Koon?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What's your fucking deal?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's my fucking deal?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's your fucking problem?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I draw cartoons.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What a degenerate.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I guess that explains it.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I do art. I'm actually opening commissions today.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I do comics. I work as a video editor and I breathe.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're very prolific.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure about that last one.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Not for long. By the end of this podcast, that last one might not be true anymore.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, no.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're very prolific. You feel like you draw pretty fast.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You put out a lot of pieces.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's cool. It's pretty good.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You've done a lot of PCP related fan art, which would be very embarrassing,

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
if not for the fact that you've drawn so much that you've drawn plenty of other stuff too.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Much more other stuff, so it's not weird.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's not weird or anything.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Imagine as my whole deal was just a PCP fan artist.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Imagine how your deal was just on PCP.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That'd be pretty kind of based, though, actually.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You would have gotten on this show a lot faster if that were the case.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So you've really shot yourself in the foot.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So here it's January 10th, 2021.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's going on?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's on everyone's docket for this week?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, Ben, you said to me that you wanted to talk about the Mr. Boop ending.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, that's right.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Because last week you hadn't read it.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I hadn't read it.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So you've read it now.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I have read it.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, what did you think about?

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wait, Nexus and Tom, have you read Mr. Boop?

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tom, you have.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, Kaiju.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't use the dead name, Ben.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I apologize.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Have either of you read Mr. Boop?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Who's read Mr. Boop?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have not read Mr. Boop.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't even know what it is.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I remember mentioning it to you, Tom, what it was, and it was like the concept is a guy

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
is drawing a comic where he is in the comic and his wife is Betty Boop and she's hot

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and she loves him.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And it's like.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That did sound like the greatest thing ever.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is like an absurdist sort of comic.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It goes into a lot of interesting places.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And some of the lines are just, some of the comics are like so stupid that they can't,

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
like they're genius.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The early ones are really, have just a really iconic, like really funny bits like, I don't

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
know, I want you to, I want you to take this gun.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh no, no, what is it?

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Like, are you the, is this the divorce attorney?

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We don't usually call it that, but yes.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I want you to take this gun and if I ever try to divorce my wife, Betty Boop, I want you

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to shoot me through the head.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Amazing.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's, it's so, so what did you think of the ending, Gib?

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I, I thought it was okay.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There was something about it.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I agree.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was already.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Big spoilers.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Big spoilers.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They get a divorce?

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, no, no.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, lots of things happen, but the ending is a video with Neon Genesis.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's the, comes to Sir Todd?

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Where have you say it?

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What, one of those songs?

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, you said it right.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you, why are you pretending that you don't know how to say it?

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I thought you had a funny accent.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're supposed to say it with an accent.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't know.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Has that music playing the classic like Ava music and the, in the comic, in the comic,

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
there's like, it's just a mishmash of like, well-known characters from other media, like

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Peter Griffin from Family Guy.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want to reiterate.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,480
I really want to say, if you have not read Betty Boop, I really don't want to spoil it

107
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
for anyone.

108
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
You mean Mr. Boop.

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Mr. Boop.

110
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
What did I say?

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Betty Boop.

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
You said Betty Boop.

113
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,240
If you have not read Mr. Boop, I really think you'd be better off reading it instead of

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,240
getting spoiled here, and it won't take you very long to read.

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Damn.

116
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I would like to read it, but I'm in the show.

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
What should I do?

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Should I kill myself?

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
You should, you should kill yourself.

120
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Just, just honestly, honestly, if you want to like mute, if you want to mute your fucking

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
headphones.

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Let's go, let's go on another chat.

123
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Let's talk about Garo.

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I can, I can at you guys when we're done, if you, if you want.

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
I don't know.

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm willing to accommodate you on this, but I want to talk about it.

127
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,080
If, how much do you want to talk about it though, in spoiler territory?

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,800
You know what, we don't have, we don't really have to spoil it that much.

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,480
I just want to say about the ending, that like, okay, yeah, it is, it is a big, it is

130
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,200
a big Ava reference.

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,200
And uh, I didn't, I'm not telling, I'm not, I'm not answering that question.

132
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
And like, it's kind of funny.

133
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,400
It's not like, it's not, it doesn't blow me away or anything.

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,000
It's just like, yeah, okay, ha, ha, they ended it with a big Ava reference.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,200
Like the conceit of the ending is fine and it works and it makes sense and it's all right.

136
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,400
Uh, uh, and it's like, okay, and, and, and I'm, and I'm happy that it does have like

137
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
a satisfying ending that makes sense.

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,320
It doesn't suck like the ending of Homestuck, but it's not like, it's, it doesn't really

139
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
end with a bang either.

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
It just kind of is like, okay.

141
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
We told the story, we draw it to a satisfying conclusion.

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah.

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,960
What it feels like to me is like a boomer that is, is, is like trying to be hip and

144
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,840
they've learned about like over 9000, but they're using it a little bit too late.

145
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
That's what it feels like.

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Really?

147
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
That's, that's harsher than I would be.

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, not in a, like a horrible way.

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Like I agree with you.

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,920
It's like, that was a pretty good ending, but like, I don't know.

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:03,440
I feel like the Ava sort of thing, maybe he's played out, but I don't know why I think

152
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
that.

153
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,240
I feel like he could, like, I, the, the ending being a video, the ending being in video format

154
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
is fine and it works.

155
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,800
I think that I, this, oh God, we're, it's, it's back to the classic thing of like I

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,680
don't like pastiche and I think that references are lame.

157
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,160
I think this reference was like not super great and didn't add like a ton to it and

158
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,360
it probably could have been something else.

159
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Yeah.

160
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,240
Honestly, the fact that the ending is just a giant Ava reference is kind of like, well,

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,840
but Betty, Mr. Boop is, is great on its own.

162
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,480
Like it's sort of like, oh, it ends with, I know that's isn't the case, but it almost

163
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,760
feels as though the entire comic was just leading up to a big Ava reference and like,

164
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,440
but I don't think that's not, okay, that's why I think it doesn't work.

165
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,880
Like I don't actually think that.

166
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,680
That's just kind of how it feels when the entire like climax is an Ava reference.

167
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,080
It's like, eh, did it really deserve that?

168
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
Is it, does it merit that level?

169
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I don't know.

170
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Yeah.

171
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,920
I'm being, I'm being a little more critical than I think.

172
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Well, it's only, it's only because the comic up to that point was so good that it's like,

173
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,600
yeah, the ending doesn't feel bad.

174
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,040
It just feels like, like, okay, sure, I wasn't expecting that, but I, whatever.

175
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,120
I think it's kind of a safe ending.

176
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,880
You could kind of see where the ending was going.

177
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,360
It's pretty quirky though.

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,680
You could, it was pretty easy to see how it was going to end, like while you were reading

179
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,080
Act 4, like it was like, it wasn't really subtle about where it was going.

180
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:49,640
So you know, but you know what, it came, it had its run, it ended, and that's all the

181
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,480
ending really needed to do and it did it.

182
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,800
So, you know, thumbs up, 10 out of 10.

183
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Yeah.

184
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,760
Glowing review of Mr. Boop, Reed, it'll take you like an hour at most, maybe.

185
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,520
Oh, maybe, yeah, not very long.

186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Nice.

187
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,960
It's like, what is it, maybe like 200, 200 strips, maybe not even that many.

188
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,760
Yeah, 200, four panel strips or something like that.

189
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Yeah.

190
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,240
Yeah, comics.

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,360
Nothing, nothing can top Dr. Sonic the Hedgehog though.

192
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Oh, yeah.

193
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

194
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes.

195
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:36,040
Okay, I want, I do want to update everyone on something of much greater importance than

196
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
that.

197
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,000
I just want to let everyone know where I'm at mentally and where I'm at mentally is

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that I have been watching Bitcoin just go off a fucking cliff.

199
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
Morning.

200
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
It's so bad.

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
No, it was like, it was doing pretty decent and then it was doing like, okay, it's just

202
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,320
kind of hanging on and then just today obliterated.

203
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,680
So literally, just today I literally watched like all my games just go up in flames.

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,560
You fool.

205
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
No, you fool.

206
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
You fuck.

207
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I hate you.

208
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I fucking hate you.

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
How dare you?

210
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
How dare you fucking criticize me?

211
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Oh, yeah.

212
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,360
Oh, it's not for the, what is the Teddy Roosevelt thing about the doer of deeds?

213
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,760
I'm the doer of deeds.

214
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,040
You're over here on the sidelines going, you could have done better.

215
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
You could have invested here.

216
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
It's because it's true there.

217
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,200
You could have made more money.

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,360
You could have made more money, you know, you're the fucking nerd.

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
No, you're the fucking bitch.

220
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,280
I'm calling you a fool for doing anything at all.

221
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm technically haven't lost money.

222
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
So there's that.

223
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,800
Like last time I checked you were saying like, oh, I've made like technically like a thousand

224
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
dollars.

225
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Yes.

226
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Two, if I had sold two days ago, I would have been, I would have turned like a thousand

227
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
dollar profit today.

228
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm up like a hundred dollars, but you know, it is what it is.

229
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Easy come, easy go.

230
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Am I right gamers?

231
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,880
That's, that's just, it's way too stressful for me.

232
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,240
Yeah, I need, yeah, this has been my week.

233
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,960
This has been my week just, you know, watching fucking queue people storm the capital and

234
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:18,520
watching Bitcoin just bounce around, uh, sad, sad times for Ben saying it.

235
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,560
Yeah, I guess did we, the last PCP episode that it hadn't happened yet.

236
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,160
Do we want to talk about the insurrection at all?

237
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,840
It's sort of like a bigger thing that happened.

238
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,400
We should probably, I mean, probably, yeah, you could say something about it.

239
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
You could say that.

240
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,920
Oh, you know, that was, that was a pretty big gamer moment.

241
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
Not gonna lie.

242
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,080
That was a pro real, a major, major gamer moment in American history right there.

243
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,920
I was like watching it live, like before we started streaming on the, before we started

244
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,560
streaming on Shekels for Hekels Gib, I, like I had like someone's video feed from the thing

245
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,360
opened and I was like watching them live as they were like, as the first as they were

246
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,520
like, you know, like rushing the police barricades and then like storming up the steps and then

247
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,400
like pounding on the big iron door at the front of the Capitol building.

248
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Like I was watching all that happen live and I was like, oh, this is neat.

249
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
This is interesting.

250
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Yeah.

251
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,200
The time it was just sort of like, wow, huh, strange, like I'd never heard of something

252
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
like that happening.

253
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Yeah.

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Man, these guys really want a PS5, like really bad.

255
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
They had all of them.

256
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,680
They could have forced Sony to make more.

257
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
That's what they were.

258
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,920
Nancy Pelosi was scalping all the PS5s and they had to go get them.

259
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to play Steven Jones.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,640
All these, all these fucking private military contracts.

261
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,440
She's like in there with like hundreds of boxes like we have to pay back the deficit

262
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
somehow.

263
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,880
All these like all the, all these fucking like petite bourgeois, like fucking like jet ski

264
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,880
dealership owners and like glazier contractor standing outside just like we're, you know,

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,520
it's for the man who's got everything.

266
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,640
What's the only thing they don't have is a PS5 and they know, they know where the supply

267
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
is.

268
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:30,680
It feels kind of stupid to talk about because I'm like, I know I'm not like on the level

269
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,200
of a political commentator and then all I can really say is like, Dan, that's fucked

270
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,560
like that's stupid.

271
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Why would I bring it up?

272
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
Why did I do that?

273
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
But I don't know.

274
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,760
It like started happening and it's like, oh, that's pretty stupid.

275
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,360
And then I went to bed and then I woke up and it was still going on like, oh, that's pretty

276
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
stupid.

277
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,760
And then I just went about my day.

278
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
You know what?

279
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,480
I'm, I'm happy at the time I was looking at it and I was like, oh wow, this is just happening

280
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,120
and like nobody's doing anything about it.

281
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,720
It seemed for a minute there that just like nobody was going to do anything about it.

282
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,120
But now it's like a big fucking deal.

283
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,480
And that's, and I'm glad, I'm glad they got in trouble with the, with the authorities.

284
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm glad I see like a few people like with their mugshots, like they're being the people

285
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,680
like that guy who had the, the podium, he was like, haha, I got the podium.

286
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,640
Like he's in jail or at least is convicted of something.

287
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Yeah.

288
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
We know what it is.

289
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,160
I hope he made the same face for his mugshot that have been a good meme.

290
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,840
No, it's the opposite.

291
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
It's like the opposite.

292
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,640
It's a smile on optimism, optimism gun.

293
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,040
I thought storm in the capital and stealing shit would not lead to this, but I unfortunately

294
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
who?

295
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Yeah.

296
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Yeah.

297
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Yeah.

298
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:55,080
Um, oh God, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm just distracted this Bitcoin is still, it's gone even lower

299
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,200
while you've been talking and I'm upset.

300
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,040
You want to know how to instantly make Bitcoin go, go to the moon, sell it, look at your

301
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,720
keyboard, hit alt, then press F4 and all of a sudden all your problems will be over.

302
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,760
Go to make Bitcoin, to make all the Bitcoin problems, go to into your hard drive and delete

303
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,440
system 32 and then, and then just live your life and just live normally from then on.

304
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Oh, it's plummeting.

305
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Oh no.

306
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
I'm upset.

307
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,080
It has, it has to stop.

308
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,720
It has to stop sometime, right?

309
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,920
Like this can't continue.

310
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,160
Like this, this, uh, uh, uh, someone call, call the police, call the police and, and

311
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
put a stop to this.

312
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,480
No, Ben, you need to stop.

313
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
You got to buy low.

314
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Oh, that was your mistake.

315
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
You didn't buy low.

316
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,800
I was, I was supposed to buy low and sell high.

317
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,960
Oh, easy to get those mixed up, but you know.

318
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Okay.

319
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,640
Well, I mean, wait, if you had it wrong way around, surely it plummeting would be a good

320
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
thing in your mind.

321
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,560
It has, it has officially crossed the point, it has just crossed the threshold wherein

322
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,440
I have just started to lose money.

323
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
That's good.

324
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
That's good.

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
That means you can buy.

326
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
As opposed to having, having turned to profit.

327
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Now's the time to buy.

328
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,120
So to go back up and you'll make money.

329
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Hmm.

330
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,760
Don't give him ideas.

331
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
He's actually considering it.

332
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
No.

333
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
It's okay.

334
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
That's, that's a great point.

335
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
That's a great point.

336
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Oh, it's good.

337
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
It's going to happen again.

338
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,560
So the cycle never ends.

339
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Okay.

340
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
The real demon souls is this.

341
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,760
You have to understand we're on, this is a new year.

342
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,880
We're on the cusp of, of, of, you know, boring, old, trite, been there forever.

343
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,400
Socialist Ben St is finally going to die.

344
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Capitalist Ben St is being born before our eyes.

345
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
It's going to be an amazing year.

346
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
Hmm.

347
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,440
You know, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,240
So is, is fat, is fat been like the beginning of the arc?

349
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Yeah.

350
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Yeah.

351
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Yeah.

352
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah.

353
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
You have to be a fat cat capitalist.

354
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Right.

355
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
He has the fat part down.

356
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Yeah.

357
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Now he's going to get the cat part down.

358
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
When, when's catburn coming?

359
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Hmm.

360
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Sooner than any of us would like.

361
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Yeah.

362
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
But about that.

363
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I really should probably stop looking at it.

364
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm, I'm, I'm okay.

365
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I'm, I'm actually going to just not look at it for a little bit.

366
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Cause I think that the thing that was getting me most is not like what happened and the

367
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,240
you know, of like how it occurred and all that.

368
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,240
It's the people responding on Twitter and, and places where I keep seeing really, really

369
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,560
discouraging, depressing arguments from people who just don't understand anything that's

370
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,600
happening in front of their eyes, defending it, thinking that it's Antifa that did it,

371
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,000
even though it clearly isn't just, it's, it's, it's, it just adds to all of this like annoying,

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
like nobody, nobody gets it anymore.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay.

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I've seen, I've seen the people claiming that it was Antifa, but it doesn't really seem

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
like anyone buys it.

376
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It, it, it doesn't really seem like that is a narrative that is going to like stick and

377
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
people.

378
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Sure.

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It just, I don't know.

380
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,320
It's, it's, it's not even just like the, the outrageous stuff is the um, I don't know,

381
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,320
the implicit like, like, I don't really care about this.

382
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,320
And I would rather point out how BLM was like, that more buildings were burned in that one.

383
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Like, like the implication being that, I don't know, this was good at all.

384
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Yeah.

385
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
This wasn't, this wasn't actually bad at all.

386
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Or, or if it was bad, it was less bad than that other thing that those other guys did.

387
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,320
And it's just, yeah.

388
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
That's all right.

389
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,320
I've been a bit like recently.

390
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Yeah.

391
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Good.

392
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Let the rage consume you.

393
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Get radicalized.

394
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
But I'm not, but I'm not good at yelling and throwing Molotovs.

395
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
I'm not good at that.

396
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Um, it's okay.

397
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
You can throw Molotovs inside.

398
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,320
You just got to throw Molotovs in Animal Crossing.

399
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,320
That's going to make YouTube videos talking about these things.

400
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
That's, that's how you do it.

401
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
That's the secret.

402
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Hello.

403
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Welcome to YouTube.

404
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
You're already here.

405
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,320
And here's my opinion on the things that are happening.

406
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,320
That's real activism right there.

407
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah.

408
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Fuck.

409
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
It's never enough.

410
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
It's never enough to do the bare minimum.

411
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,320
I sure wish it was enough to do the bare minimum and even less than that.

412
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
In fact.

413
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Hmm.

414
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Well, all of that stuff is fun.

415
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,320
But all I did this week was buy PlayStation one games.

416
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
And you know what?

417
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
That was time and money well spent in my book.

418
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Yeah.

419
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
True.

420
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
It's going to be pretty sick.

421
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
I got vagrant story.

422
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Oh, resident evil two.

423
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,320
I got dino crisis.

424
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
I got mega man legends one and two.

425
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Uh, did you know that they had like a first party like dual flight stick for PS one?

426
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
I got that and it works with descent, which is one of my favorite games.

427
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
So you can like fly around in a ship.

428
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Oh, it's going to be great.

429
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
The capitals getting in like fucked up, but I'm going to be playing descent with a flight stick.

430
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
It's all good.

431
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Wow.

432
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Life is good.

433
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
It's great.

434
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
It's going to be a great time.

435
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
It's for sure.

436
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Hell yeah.

437
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Well, yeah, games are pretty good.

438
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Yeah, I miss the PS one.

439
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Dude, PS one.

440
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
I do.

441
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
I never had a PS one as a kid.

442
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
This is all new to me.

443
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I've never played any of those games before.

444
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
I've never had a PS two.

445
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I haven't played any single PS two game besides Metal Gear.

446
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,320
I've said it before and I'll say it again, but it's all been downhill since the Super Nintendo.

447
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Wow.

448
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Imagine.

449
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Don't laugh.

450
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Don't laugh.

451
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm not joking.

452
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Don't laugh at me.

453
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
No, I'm laughing.

454
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
I'm laughing.

455
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
I'm serious.

456
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
That was a good joke.

457
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
You might be serious, but...

458
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
You're still wrong.

459
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
All right.

460
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,320
I can buy the idea that it's all downhill since the Super Nintendo, because I never had one.

461
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,320
It may be even better than the PlayStation one and two, but the PlayStation one and two

462
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,320
are still incredible and so fucking good.

463
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:13,320
It didn't dip down to the depths that we currently live in, at least with AAA development.

464
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,320
It wasn't like Bitcoin today or anything.

465
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Shattering the glass floor, just dragging me down into the poor house.

466
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
It wasn't anything like that, is what you're saying.

467
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Do they have glass floors in those analogies?

468
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Well, I mean, you understand what I mean.

469
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I know.

470
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
It's a volatile market.

471
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Everything has to be made of glass.

472
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Glass walls.

473
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Everything's made of glass.

474
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Yeah.

475
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Yeah.

476
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
When it goes up, it shatters the glass ceiling.

477
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
When it goes down, it shatters the glass floor.

478
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,320
When it stays the same, it's exploding all of the glass walls around it.

479
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
It's the same.

480
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Just smashing left and right with glass shots flying everywhere.

481
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Always shattering.

482
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Always remember to wear your goggles, otherwise you get permanent blindness.

483
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Bad advice to throw stones in your glass house.

484
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,320
It's all one interconnected metaphor.

485
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,320
Those who use Bitcoin shouldn't, because you'll get glass in your eye.

486
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,320
She is right.

487
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
She is right.

488
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Okay, no more looking at Bitcoin.

489
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Close the tap.

490
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I do kind of like cryptocurrency conceptually as the torrent of currency, because you can't

491
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
block torrents.

492
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,320
It's just like a function of computers.

493
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,320
You can block the sites, but the torrent files is a way to share things that you can't...

494
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,320
It's the capacity for email.

495
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:51,320
There's not a company that can own the torrent and then stop people being able to get things.

496
00:22:51,320 --> 00:23:01,320
In that way, it can't be fucked with as a currency Bitcoin, like real currency.

497
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
That's what they say.

498
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,320
That's why they say you got to hodl it.

499
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
There's something happening.

500
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,320
People were trying to make money.

501
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,320
I know it's like right-wing media, people, pundits, and Trump, and everything getting

502
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,320
banned off of all these things.

503
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
People are saying, oh, that's bad.

504
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
It's bad for free speech.

505
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,320
I'm like, it's good that he and they are gone.

506
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Free speech was already...

507
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:41,320
It's not good that they have such control and such a interconnected communication that

508
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
they can't even do that.

509
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,320
I just agree with what they've done this time.

510
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Yeah, absolutely.

511
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:54,320
It is bad that they have the power to ban anyone they want, and that they've basically privatized

512
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
our town square, basically, is what someone on Twitter says.

513
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
I just wish they were honest about it.

514
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Because Twitter finally pulls the plug on Trump.

515
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,320
And then just like with Alex Jones, everyone in the media is like, oh, well, now all of

516
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,320
a sudden, yeah, it's R against R terms of service too.

517
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
It's like, all right, you were just waiting for someone to fire the first shot.

518
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
You just wanted to get rid of something you didn't like.

519
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
I would have much more respect.

520
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
You're just like, you know what?

521
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,320
We kind of just fucking hate this guy, so now he's gone.

522
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Just be honest with me, please.

523
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
You're not fooling anybody.

524
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Just be honest.

525
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Just be like, orange man was bad, and we didn't like it anymore.

526
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
Just say that, please.

527
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:40,320
It's like, yeah, they shouldn't be able to do this kind of thing to anyone.

528
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,320
I would prefer it if it were publicly owned and like a public asset and common property

529
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
that everyone could use equally.

530
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,320
But if it is a private company and they are going to bring the hammer down as they see fit,

531
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,320
then yeah, I would prefer it if it came down on people that I think are worse.

532
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Yeah, I mean, I've watched this Valsh.

533
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I keep saying his name's stupid.

534
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
It's Valsh.

535
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
Valsh.

536
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Valsh.

537
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Valsh.

538
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,320
It's Valsh Stream like yesterday where he was talking about this, and there's like people

539
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:27,320
who translate thinking that Donald Trump being banned is good with I support these giant corporations

540
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
when the two things happening are different.

541
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:40,320
It's bad that the corporations can do this on such a completely, like all over the place,

542
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,320
like they have all over the internet.

543
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Like if they wanted to silence you, they could from as many possible things, including like credit cards,

544
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,320
like Mastercard and Visa or whatever, stopping people being able to pay you if they really wanted to,

545
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
which is why Bitcoin is cool.

546
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
But like, it's bad that that can happen.

547
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,320
But it's good when a bad person is blocked from a social media application for doing bad things,

548
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
which is a different question.

549
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
It is a different question.

550
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,320
So I've seen a lot of people saying it's hypocritical to think those two things at the same time,

551
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
and it really isn't.

552
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
No.

553
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,320
I just wanted to say it on my platform, the Procrastinators podcast.

554
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I guess my only concern with banning Trump and all this shit is that you've basically just,

555
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,320
this entire narrative with Q is basically just like you're giving them all the ammo they need to like quintuple down

556
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
on everything they think.

557
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I know what you mean, but like, you can't just let them have their way just because, oh, it'll upset them if we stop them.

558
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Yeah.

559
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Well, I'm not even saying that.

560
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,320
It's just that you've just, you're just going to, I guess like the problem is that these,

561
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,320
everything that's happening right now, and it seems like it's inevitability that it's just going to result in like a complete fracture of society.

562
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,320
And there's just going to be two alternate spheres of reality going on at the same time, you know, because like they've,

563
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
they already had this big movement on Parler.

564
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Now Parler is being shut down by everything.

565
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,320
So like all these people are going to go somewhere else.

566
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,320
And then there's just going to be two narratives going on where both sides believe they're right and the other side's wrong.

567
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,320
And it's just like, okay, well, we're getting, we're just inevitably leading to a point where like society breaks down.

568
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Because it's like, okay, there's just two different versions of literally, because like my dad is like a conservative and believes everything.

569
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,320
He believes that the Antifa were there, like all that shit.

570
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,320
And it's just like, okay, well, like there's nothing, it's just, what are you going to do?

571
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Well, that's the thing.

572
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Like there's no convincing people.

573
00:27:50,320 --> 00:28:01,320
This, yeah, in the case of it not convincing people, it already hasn't like, I think the, like it's true that has been going this way for a while.

574
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,320
And that banning Trump is not going to, you know, make anything any better on that front necessarily.

575
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Maybe some extremely casual, right-leaning people would be like, oh, he's not on Twitter anymore.

576
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
I guess I'll forget about it.

577
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,320
I don't know how many people like that there are, but that's the only difference.

578
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,320
The thing is just like, his Twitter was still there the whole time and it was continually getting worse.

579
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,320
People were still getting in the bubbles despite having, you know, all this.

580
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I think it's just sort of, it's wrongheaded to think that banning them, like it is too little too late.

581
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,320
But like banning them doesn't necessarily, it doesn't do much, but that doesn't mean that having them is a good thing either.

582
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
Well, it just gets them out of your way, I guess.

583
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
And like maybe that's like not the grace thing because like every time Trump says something stupid on Twitter,

584
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,320
like we could see it and be like, wow, that's fucking retarded and like know that there was that dumb shit.

585
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Now it's just going to be on some site.

586
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
None of us go on.

587
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
And so the next stupid thing that happens, none of us are going to know about.

588
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,320
And who knows how it's going to spiral out of control when there's not like people like calling out the bullshit as it happens.

589
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
So I don't know.

590
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
I'm not, I'm not sold on it.

591
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I guess I'm just like, I've seen, like it's been out in the pub, out in the open for so long anyway.

592
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Like they were planning this, this insurrection thing on, on Facebook openly.

593
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,320
And it's like, nothing ever gets done about it, despite us knowing about it ahead of time.

594
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
So like, what does it matter?

595
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,320
If we, if we agree that like the kind of rhetoric that like Trump's rhetoric is like, is like dangerous,

596
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,320
is like the equivalent of like yelling fire in a crowded theater, right?

597
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:49,320
If, if we agree on that, then I don't buy that like, oh, banning it will just drive it underground or it confessed her in secret.

598
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
It's better to have it out in the open.

599
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
I don't think that's true.

600
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,320
I think it's, it's worse if it's more public.

601
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,320
It's more emboldening to people who agree with it.

602
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,320
So that's my thinking on that.

603
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
But I'm confused.

604
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm a little confused about like, okay, I, if Twitter wants to ban Trump, you know, that's, they can do that, I suppose.

605
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,320
And what's the, like, what's the reason why, like, all these other accounts are getting suddenly deactivated?

606
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Is it just because it's like-

607
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
I think it's just a knock-on effect.

608
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,320
I think everyone was just waiting for someone to fire the first shot.

609
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
The same thing with Alex Jones, you know?

610
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
It's like-

611
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,320
What do you mean, like, do you mean like, the different right-leaning people?

612
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:36,320
You mean to say that Twitter, that Twitter was waiting for Trump's presidency to end to like defund, to like, or not defund,

613
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,320
to like ban people, like, the quartering and like, stone toss and stuff?

614
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Like, I don't, that doesn't make any sense.

615
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,320
I just think this is, this is like, this is, this is the, um, this is the incident that like, was the straw that broke the camel's back.

616
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,320
And they're finally just like, trying to wipe everything out.

617
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
And just like, you know what, I don't, we don't want this shit anymore.

618
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
And they're getting rid of it.

619
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
And I don't know-

620
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
I guess-

621
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I think what it is.

622
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Once the dam's been broken, it's easier to just keep the fucking momentum going.

623
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
It's not so much a political thing.

624
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I don't know, I feel like-

625
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,320
From the perspective of these companies, I don't think it's like, we've wanted to get rid of Donald Trump for a while because we're politically against him.

626
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
And now is the perfect time.

627
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:25,320
I think it's more that this incident has made right-leaning things, like, obviously bad to the point that they're going to lose money.

628
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
And it's all about money.

629
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
So like-

630
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,320
I guess, I guess it wasn't all those like, mass shootings that have happened before.

631
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,320
It's like, let on by exactly the same stuff.

632
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Well, hasn't-

633
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:42,320
I think this is just, this is more like, in the minds of the average person, this is more clearly like a Trump and a right-leaning thing.

634
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Conservatives did this to the Capitol building to try and overturn democratically elected, whatever.

635
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
So it's like, wow, that's so blatant.

636
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,320
There's no way that that isn't going to look bad if we keep it up.

637
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I guess they must have had some sort of like, they were in the discord call, like just like this one.

638
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,320
And they were saying these things like, hmm, I just want more money, so I'm just going to get rid of them all.

639
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Like the optics were just too bad, you're saying.

640
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,320
It's like, it's suddenly became apparent that like, okay, keeping these people around is now too much of a liability.

641
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Yeah, I think it's more about money than it is about individuals at the top caring about Trump.

642
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I mean, it's never really been about that.

643
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
It's always been about money.

644
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:37,320
I mean, that implies that implies then that they were keeping like track of like who is like spouting conservative, like like like ultra like nationalist rhetoric.

645
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:48,320
But they had a list of like, okay, there's Trump and like here, here's a here's a list of people who are like in that camp and we can ban them if we decide they need to go and now they've decided they need to go.

646
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Yeah, that means that they've been like keeping tabs on it.

647
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
That's the scary.

648
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
I don't like that.

649
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Yeah, I agree.

650
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
It is scary.

651
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Big tech is really scary.

652
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
That's that's one thing.

653
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,320
You know, you got to hand it to them.

654
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,320
You got to hand it to these fascist psychopaths when they're right, they're right.

655
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
And big tech is scary.

656
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,320
That's that much I can agree with.

657
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,320
I mean, I do agree that like giving like having this consolidation of all this power with these like handful of companies is fucking terrible.

658
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:27,320
It just really sucks that any time you try and make an alternative to it, you're naturally just going to attract the worst possible actors because they're the ones who have to use it.

659
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:33,320
And so those spaces are ruined and nobody is going to want to use them because you're surrounded by fucking psychopaths.

660
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,320
And so the monopoly continues because no one wants to go hang out with Nazis.

661
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Yeah, because it's the it's the people that got it's the people that got banned from the mainstream platform.

662
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
It's like bit shoots a great fucking concept.

663
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,320
It's a peer to peer YouTube alternative.

664
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
That's great.

665
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Too bad everybody on there is like fucking terrible.

666
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,320
And it's like, I want to talk about my little pony down there.

667
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
I'm talking to fucking fly.

668
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
I guess maybe it will.

669
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
It's been cheap.

670
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
There's apparently a bunch of Nazis who are into ponies now.

671
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
So I don't fucking know.

672
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
So so I've heard.

673
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Yeah.

674
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Bitcoin.

675
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Bitcoin update.

676
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Bitcoin update.

677
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
It's bounce back.

678
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Close the tab.

679
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
It's up.

680
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
It's up from the profit line.

681
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
It's a little bit up from the profit line.

682
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
I'm in the green, baby.

683
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Eleazar, I want you to edit in a chart of the Bitcoin live going up and down.

684
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
Yeah, live.

685
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Yeah, live.

686
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,320
I should be screen recording right now.

687
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Honestly, maybe next episode I will.

688
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
If you haven't gone broke by then.

689
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Pretty fuck.

690
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Yeah, true.

691
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
If I'm not in the poor house.

692
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Hey.

693
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Hey.

694
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Hey.

695
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Hey.

696
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Our guest.

697
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Hey.

698
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
When am I getting more bunny wave?

699
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Let's talk about something that's not gay.

700
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
When's more bunny wave?

701
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
My favorite web comic.

702
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,320
So hey, that's what's going on with the world, huh?

703
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I've been like living like a hermit.

704
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,320
I just stopped watching social media.

705
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
I stopped talking to people.

706
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
I stopped everything.

707
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
No.

708
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
My entire life is just work.

709
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Nothing else.

710
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Just work and consume books, comics and movies and stuff like that.

711
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
What a fucking God on ironic.

712
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Then what do you post about?

713
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,320
He posts the work that he does instead of looking at Bitcoin all day.

714
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah.

715
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Oh, Pasha.

716
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Pishposh.

717
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
It's right now.

718
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Why work?

719
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Why work when you can just invest in Bitcoin and accrue capital gains, you nerds?

720
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Gross.

721
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,320
The fucking Bragg chat channel in my Patreon Discord server is lit up constantly with

722
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,320
Kydric and posting new things all the time that make me feel like, man, I should probably

723
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
work harder and then I don't because I suck.

724
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
I feel bad.

725
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,320
That's basically every post there is mine.

726
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
Yeah.

727
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,320
You've taken it over and I just want to let you know I have no problem with that.

728
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,320
I feel a little bit of a little pang of guilt every time you post and it makes me get like

729
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
3% closer to actually doing something.

730
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
So keep going.

731
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,320
In like two months, I might have actually created something like one piece of artwork.

732
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Well, the thing is, I've been working in a lot of comics and just not posting anything

733
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
about it.

734
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,320
And right now, I'm redrawing some bunny chapters.

735
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Redrawing?

736
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Yeah.

737
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
You're doing a remaster?

738
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Yeah.

739
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Why?

740
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,320
I'm redrawing the entire chapter two and I'm going to redraw some panels from chapter

741
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
three.

742
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Doing like the Blu-ray touch-up version?

743
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
No, it's more like that.

744
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,320
It's like, you know, I have another character that is called Wolf.

745
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Yes.

746
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,320
So this character is now part of the bunnyverse and there's another character in the bunnyverse

747
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
that looks exactly the same.

748
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,320
So I'm changing all his panels and making him look different.

749
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Like, I gave him like a new complete look.

750
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Also, chapter two, it looks terrible, so I ended up like changing the whole pages.

751
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,320
So I'm about to be done with the redrawing.

752
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,320
If you think it looks terrible, if you say it looks terrible, then...

753
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
Yeah, it looks shit.

754
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I will just have to take your word for it.

755
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Super shit.

756
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Yeah, I hate it so much.

757
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,320
I can't even sleep just thinking about it that chapter two was published.

758
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Can we like post the original version versus the redrawn version of one of these?

759
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Can we get those edited in and sound off in the comments?

760
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Well, you can actually find those posts on a website which is called patreon.com.

761
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Where you can see the comparison between the old ones and the new ones.

762
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Which is quite the difference.

763
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Gotcha.

764
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Very good.

765
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm also working on more original comics with a friend of the show, I believe.

766
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Which is called Doon Koon.

767
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Yeah.

768
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Yeah, he's writing a really cool story right now.

769
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,320
He already wrote an entire story for me to one shot.

770
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
And it's going to be pretty fun to draw.

771
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I intend to draw that this year.

772
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Is she Doon Koon's a she now?

773
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Oh, really?

774
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
See, that's what I'm telling you.

775
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I'm so disconnected from the entire world.

776
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I don't know anything.

777
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Tragic.

778
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
See, this is why.

779
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
This is why you got to say plugged in and jacked in like me at all times.

780
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
No.

781
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,320
So you never say, you never get canceled for something like that.

782
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Yeah, actually, I'm un-canceling.

783
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
But if you're unplugged, like Kaiju Koon is you don't have to worry about being canceled

784
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,320
because you're not even on to be canceled in the first place.

785
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
You're just in your own shit.

786
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Unplugging from social media is just the first step on the, you know,

787
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,320
engaging in IRL is just the first step towards becoming a Nazi.

788
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
That's the IRL to fascist pipeline.

789
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
It starts there.

790
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
It starts with not posting and getting off Twitter.

791
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
That's how they get you.

792
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:07,320
It starts with you stop like not like live tweeting your Bitcoin reactions on Twitter every five minutes.

793
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Because of idle hands of the devil's workshop.

794
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,320
And if I hadn't been live tweeting my Bitcoin gains and losses,

795
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,320
I would have been in the Capitol building, storming it, knocking down the doors.

796
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,320
You chain down.

797
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Getting that PS5.

798
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
If I hadn't invested in Bitcoin, I would have a PS5 now.

799
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh, well, that sounds like a good trade to me.

800
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
I guess I'm problematic after all.

801
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Big problem.

802
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Big problem.

803
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Fuck.

804
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,320
I used to make comics once upon a time.

805
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Wow.

806
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Wow.

807
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Making comics.

808
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Wow.

809
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Can't imagine it.

810
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Right now I'm doing my mysterious construction.

811
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,320
My special project, my secret week.

812
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,320
And that is taking my attention away from comics because it's not a comic.

813
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:11,320
That's the one special knowledge nugget that you have now that is not a comic that is my secret special thing.

814
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Everybody has secret projects.

815
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
My secret project is...

816
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Secret project is the best way to live.

817
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Because that way people say, so what is it?

818
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
It's like a secret and you don't have to say anything.

819
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Yeah.

820
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Nobody's asking me like, when is it going to be done?

821
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Because nobody expects anything.

822
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Nobody knows what it is.

823
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Because I haven't told anyone.

824
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:39,320
I've only, I've alluded vaguely to something and nobody knows what timeframe to expect it in.

825
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Ben, is it a...

826
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Is it a nuclear bomb, Ben?

827
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Is it a super weapon?

828
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Perhaps.

829
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
It's just a big...

830
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Metal gear.

831
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
The kid.

832
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,320
The day comes and I'm just like, it's Bitcoin.

833
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
It was just Bitcoin all along.

834
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
I was just accumulating one Bitcoin.

835
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Mass unfollow of Ben's.

836
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,320
And I roll out the giant Bitcoin from behind the door and I'm like, there it is.

837
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
And then I pose for it with a photo op.

838
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Ben makes the PC pending review.

839
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Yes, I've been developing my own crypto.

840
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,320
What if it was, what if it was a custom cryptocurrency?

841
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
What if I was making slime coin real and that was what it was?

842
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
You did, you made them real.

843
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
I have one right now.

844
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Right.

845
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,320
But when I say real, I mean publicly traded on the blockchain.

846
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
They're already real, but how do we get them on the blockchain?

847
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
On 3D print them.

848
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
You 3D scan them.

849
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Put them in the scanner.

850
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Kaiju-kun posted.

851
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
What?

852
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
It's an image.

853
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
It's page.

854
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Why would he do that?

855
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Why would he post?

856
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
I don't know.

857
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
What we're talking about pages.

858
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
You just posted cringe.

859
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Kaiju, you're really good at drawing and that's all I have to say.

860
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,320
That's some damn good composition right there.

861
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
That's the word I was looking for.

862
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Damn good composition.

863
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,320
We were talking about bunny and the page took a while to export because there's a lot of shit in there.

864
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
My God.

865
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,320
That's one of the redrawn pages.

866
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Do you work at like super high resolution?

867
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Yeah.

868
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
What resolution?

869
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,320
I mean, it's not that high.

870
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
1200 DPI.

871
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
That's 600.

872
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
600 is pretty high.

873
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
That's a lot of pixels.

874
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,320
600 is like bare minimum for print, I think.

875
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
That's a good print resolution.

876
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
That's the thing.

877
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,320
I'm trying to do two books of bunny.

878
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Are you doing digital toning now?

879
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Because this doesn't look like...

880
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
You're not still cutting tones, right?

881
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Yeah, I'm doing everything digitally now.

882
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Alright, thank God.

883
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,320
The man was manually cutting out fucking tone dots and shit for the pages before,

884
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:14,320
which I can't even believe anyone born after 1990 even knows that's an option.

885
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Incredible.

886
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
It took me a while to figure out.

887
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,320
I thought, like, there's no way you could cut it and then stick it down,

888
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
and then it would look good.

889
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
There would always be a little bit...

890
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Because I used scissors before.

891
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,320
I used little knives, scalpels to cut things out.

892
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
It never looked good.

893
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
There's always wrong shape.

894
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,320
How'd you guys get that magical power of just making good shit?

895
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
I re-opened...

896
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I remade my YouTube channel and I uploaded a video I made way, way back in the time

897
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
where I tried like...

898
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:58,320
I blocked this one piece Hiroda DVD that comes with the man himself drawing.

899
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
And there's a lot of exercises.

900
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:06,320
So in the video, I follow all the steps and all the exercises trying to do drawing.

901
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,320
And you can see me there just cutting those screen tones with the knife and all that stuff.

902
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I can't believe you would cut screen tones with an actual knife.

903
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
That's so bizarre.

904
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
That's the way you do it.

905
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,320
That's how you get good, Ben.

906
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,320
The results speak for themselves.

907
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
No, shut up.

908
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,320
I had a book of how to draw a mango when I was a kid.

909
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,320
And it was like, yeah, you can buy these screen tones, you can cut them with a knife.

910
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,320
And I was like, what the fuck am I looking at?

911
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I mean, I've never seen such a thing in an art store.

912
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Maybe I just wasn't looking in the right places.

913
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,320
It just seemed so esoteric.

914
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,320
I remember just missing that out of hand, being like, that's a lot of work that I'm not going to do.

915
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,320
They're really hard to find and they're also incredibly expensive.

916
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Yeah, exactly.

917
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,320
No idea how expensive they could be.

918
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Jesus.

919
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
You know why?

920
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Because manga artists actually earn a lot of money.

921
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
What?

922
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Yeah.

923
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Impossible.

924
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Impossible.

925
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
The good ones, the top ones, the 1%.

926
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Not me, Ben.

927
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Okay.

928
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
The bougie.

929
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Yeah, not you.

930
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,320
We need to redistribute Oat as well, because what I'm hearing right now.

931
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
That's right.

932
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
I'm going to get his ass.

933
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,320
All this time, One Piece was Oat as well from making One Piece.

934
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,320
That's it.

935
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,320
The real, I guess the, well guys, the manga's over.

936
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,320
I guess the real One Piece was all the money I made along the way.

937
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Oh, that's why Roger reacted that way.

938
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Yeah.

939
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah.

940
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,320
He saw the end and it was just like a, what's that?

941
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
What's that?

942
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,320
What is it called when you look into a mirror infinitely?

943
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
The recursion.

944
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Recursion?

945
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Like he's watching himself as like, oh, One Piece is One Piece.

946
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,320
Oh, lol.

947
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,320
He starts reading, he gets to the bit where he laughs and he laughs again.

948
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:20,320
What if, what if they, what if they get to Raftel and they find it and it's all just a bunch of books and it's all just One Piece, the manga and it's meta.

949
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,320
The real One Piece is literally the manga series One Piece from the real world universe.

950
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Oh, that just draws himself in like photo realistic style.

951
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,320
Yes, he photo bashes himself into this fucking.

952
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,320
No, it would be like the fake straw hats from Shibaldi.

953
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Shibaldi.

954
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
Yeah, sure.

955
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
We got to bring those guys back.

956
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Underrated.

957
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,320
Fan favorites.

958
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,320
Well, that would be the worst possible thing to ever happen in manga history, in my opinion.

959
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
That's why it's going to happen.

960
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Yeah.

961
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Okay.

962
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,320
I really, I really admire your, your skill level next.

963
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Kaiju.

964
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Kaiju.

965
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Excuse you.

966
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Excuse me.

967
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,320
I haven't said it out loud a lot.

968
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,320
But yeah, it's, it's impressive.

969
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:17,320
I was, I was looking back at my own like Clarissa thing and I'm like, sucks, sucks so bad.

970
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Even though it was like, it was good in the time that I made it, like it like time wise.

971
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
But I'm looking at it and I'm like, oh fuck.

972
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
It was really fun.

973
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,320
It was, I liked the comic.

974
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
I should finish it.

975
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:39,320
I feel like, I feel like remaking it would be like a, at least right now with my skill level

976
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,320
basically exactly the same would be like an exercise in futility.

977
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,320
I'll just finish it and then put it out and I'll be like, whatever.

978
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,320
Oh, all redrawing is an exercise in futility.

979
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Sorry.

980
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
This page looks pretty good.

981
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Well, it's a character design.

982
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
You could have just thrown a different page that good.

983
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
Yeah, but like, look at that composition.

984
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
I'm kind of about it.

985
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Yeah, I kind of, I'm just, I've been learning a lot of manga, manga and comic composition.

986
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,320
That's why I've been reading a lot of shit these weeks.

987
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,320
And that actually helps a lot with motivation stuff.

988
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,320
If it's, I mean, if it's to change, if it's because you need to like change what a character looks like to make the story make sense.

989
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,320
I think that makes sense is perfectly, perfectly reasonable.

990
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,320
Now he looks like an actual character.

991
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Yeah, he looks like, he looks like the kid from the, the world ends with you.

992
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,320
The white hair kid.

993
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
You ever play that?

994
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
Oh yeah.

995
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
That guy.

996
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
Yeah.

997
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Now he has to redraw it again, Ben.

998
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Thanks a lot.

999
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,320
Wait, what?

1000
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Huh?

1001
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
What?

1002
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
What happened?

1003
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
What did I do?

1004
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
You compared him to a character that exists.

1005
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,320
So now he's got a scrap.

1006
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Yeah.

1007
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,320
You kill.

1008
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,320
You kill myself, Steve, Ben.

1009
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
I can't draw anymore.

1010
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,320
Oh, no, Mike.

1011
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,320
Why is that a thing that happens?

1012
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:09,320
A character, he's got, he's got like a sort of similar hairstyle and he's wearing a common type of shirt.

1013
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
Well, it's, it's goes in the trash.

1014
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
It's a rip off.

1015
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Might as well just be fucking copyright infringement.

1016
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
You know, it's all over.

1017
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
I guess to be fair.

1018
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
I don't know why I've never run into that issue.

1019
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,320
To be fair, that's a cool uniform.

1020
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,320
So it's not like a regular shirt.

1021
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1022
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,320
It has to be that shirt.

1023
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,320
That's, so you're saying it has to be copyright infringement.

1024
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,320
You had no choice.

1025
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Yeah.

1026
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
I was a retired officer.

1027
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
Was no other way.

1028
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,320
Your honor.

1029
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:42,320
See the trick, the trick is to like have character designs that are so lame and like lacking

1030
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
of information.

1031
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,320
Nobody else would have ever made them before.

1032
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Whatever I've made right.

1033
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Nobody would have had a character like red man.

1034
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
It's the first of his kind.

1035
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,320
It's literally true.

1036
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
He's just red.

1037
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
He's just red.

1038
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
But it's so good.

1039
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
So fucking flawless.

1040
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
Oh man.

1041
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:07,320
Like people who get their art stolen and put on t-shirts like by a bot on Twitter.

1042
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,320
I see sometimes like, it's like bots that look at Twitter artists, download the thing

1043
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:17,320
and then they like cut off the name, like the signature or whatever.

1044
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,320
And then they post it on a t-shirt and then they link it in the thing.

1045
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,320
It's like, hey, buy it on a shirt and it's like stealing money and all that.

1046
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,320
Nobody would ever do that for my stuff.

1047
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,320
It's a foolproof plan.

1048
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Yeah, but what you need to do is you need to start going to every like regular store

1049
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,320
like Target and Marshall's and JCPenney and just start copyright claiming every red t-shirt.

1050
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,320
Just be like, that's my original character.

1051
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,320
You can't sell a red t-shirt.

1052
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
That's copyright.

1053
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
I have a patent on that.

1054
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
Tom Scott in jail.

1055
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Exactly.

1056
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:53,320
I want, I want, I want you guys to, I want to, I want to show you.

1057
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,320
Okay.

1058
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
I've been, I've been teasing this.

1059
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,320
I've been teasing this for a while, but I want you to actually see what I've been experiencing over here.

1060
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:07,320
I am going to mark, I'm going to mark the, the, the, the profit line here.

1061
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,320
And I'm going to, and I'm going to show you what has transpired in the course of this episode.

1062
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:16,320
Just, just so you have a little context into, into what I'm going through.

1063
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Oh, it was bouncing back.

1064
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
It did bounce back.

1065
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,320
But as you see, that's that the peak, the big peak over on the left there, that was two days ago.

1066
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:34,320
And then it's just been kind of, and then today has been the, look how fucking low it did.

1067
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,320
That's okay.

1068
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,320
I'm, I'm okay.

1069
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
No more Bitcoin talk.

1070
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,320
We got to put, we got to put, take, take your Bitcoin and just put it on the shelf.

1071
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
Just put it on the shelf, leave it for a rainy day.

1072
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,320
Okay.

1073
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
I'm sorry.

1074
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,320
I'm, I'm, I feel like I'm, I feel like I'm crossing a line into being legitimately.

1075
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Yes.

1076
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
So to speak.

1077
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Okay.

1078
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,320
Anyway, and Eleazar, delete everything I said on this episode.

1079
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
Delete everything before this point on the episode.

1080
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,320
So yeah, delete, give from this episode.

1081
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Thanks.

1082
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,320
Okay.

1083
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,320
No, no.

1084
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
Double buy.

1085
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Like copy, copy, paste.

1086
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,320
Now it's just me and Kai Jakun.

1087
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
We can probably talk about guns.

1088
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
Snap, snap my fingers.

1089
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
What I've been waiting for.

1090
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Give snaps her fingers and I dissolve.

1091
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
No, no, no.

1092
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Take, take my audio and then like make a new track.

1093
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,320
And then copy, paste my audio and then offset it by like half a second.

1094
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,320
And then there'll be like two of me.

1095
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,320
Now the episode is un-listenable.

1096
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,320
This is just multiplying.

1097
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,320
No, but like slightly different pitch.

1098
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:43,320
That could be, like, and like, and like they're all different sizes.

1099
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:48,320
There's like a, there's like, there's like, give number two is like a little higher pitch

1100
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
and she's like smaller.

1101
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,320
And then give number three is like a lower pitch and she's just bigger.

1102
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
And they're just like a sort of cluster.

1103
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,320
New bonus episode harmonies.

1104
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,320
We have to have our voices harmonizing with other tracks of ourselves the entire time.

1105
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
What was that called?

1106
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
Auto tune.

1107
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
We all have auto tune on.

1108
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,320
Everybody has to download the IMT paying app from 2008 and we all have to speak into

1109
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,320
that for the entire episode.

1110
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
Speaking of bonus episode.

1111
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:21,320
Eleazar said that there is now almost an hour's worth of a bonus content of secret

1112
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,320
unreleased blooper content, so to speak.

1113
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Should we, should we make that?

1114
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Do we think?

1115
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
The cutting room floor stuff?

1116
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
Yeah.

1117
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,320
Yeah.

1118
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Eleazar said they've got, he's got 50 minutes.

1119
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,320
And I said an hour, but I feel like 50 minutes is pretty good.

1120
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,320
Yeah, yeah.

1121
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,320
We could get the bits from this maybe.

1122
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,320
There might be some bits.

1123
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
Okay.

1124
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
All right.

1125
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
I'll tell Eleazar that yeah, it's time.

1126
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,320
It's time to pull the trigger.

1127
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,320
It's time to go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators to get that sweet, sweet cutting room floor

1128
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,320
pieces, a bonus clip show secret content unreleased behind the scenes.

1129
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,320
All the content that was not good enough for their normal episodes that we released for

1130
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
free.

1131
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
You can now pay to listen to.

1132
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
What a value proposition.

1133
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,320
Can you imagine?

1134
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,320
It's secret.

1135
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,320
It's never before seen or heard words out of our mouths, bad ones.

1136
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:22,320
It's like when you, it's like when you are a wild animal and you have to shit, you go

1137
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
shit somewhere that no one can see.

1138
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Well, now you, the listener can go and see that secret place that we put our shit in

1139
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,320
so we wouldn't have to smell it.

1140
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
This pitch is getting even worse.

1141
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,320
This is what we have on offer.

1142
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
I changed my mind.

1143
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Ben, go back to looking at Bitcoin.

1144
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,320
Clearly having your full attention is not working out for the episode.

1145
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,320
Okay.

1146
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,320
I apologize.

1147
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,320
38173 38181 38176.

1148
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
Shut up.

1149
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
Okay.

1150
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:02,320
I want to say that are you, do you have something to say to Kaijuku?

1151
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
What?

1152
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
No.

1153
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
I thought you were going to say something.

1154
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
I thought you were saying something too.

1155
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:16,320
So the last few months of last year, I was like, it was like very bad.

1156
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:22,320
And I was not doing anything at all of the time of the days of the weeks of the months.

1157
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
I was felt like shit.

1158
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,320
And that is all gone.

1159
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,320
And I'm suddenly extremely busy.

1160
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,320
The exact opposite problem.

1161
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,320
I'm getting so many little things going on that I have to keep track of.

1162
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
What?

1163
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
What the fuck is going on?

1164
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,320
I don't understand.

1165
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,320
Well, it's like, well, the writing work came back.

1166
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,320
So now I'm doing writing stuff while my secret project is happening.

1167
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
Okay.

1168
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:59,320
And because I'm doing stuff now, I'm more like get up and go attitude about getting things

1169
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,320
done.

1170
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,320
Therefore, like every day I'm getting something done.

1171
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,320
Kind of a Goku get them attitude.

1172
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,320
I did my taxes the other day.

1173
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I cleaned the bath because it needs cleaning.

1174
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
Like things that I have on my calendar.

1175
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
I'm like, okay, I got to do this this day.

1176
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,320
But my fucking sleep schedule is still like the worst it has ever been.

1177
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:27,320
So I'm waking up at like 4pm and I have a full day of like no time.

1178
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,320
So yeah.

1179
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,320
That's like hyperbolic time chamber for like getting your shit done.

1180
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,320
If you can get all your stuff done in like half of a day.

1181
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,320
That's like when you take the weighted clothes off.

1182
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,320
When you get up early, all of a sudden you just become a productivity God.

1183
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
So maybe this is like training.

1184
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,320
Maybe, but it's it feels like being stupid and I should just figure out how to.

1185
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,320
You'll be like when you're fighting Gar, you just wake up at 8am, you drop those weights

1186
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,320
and everybody just flips shit as like the entire stadium fractures in half.

1187
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,320
That'll be all.

1188
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,320
That was good shit.

1189
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:05,320
You might say he who carries the sharpest blades always hungers lasts.

1190
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Wouldn't you agree?

1191
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,320
You agree?

1192
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1193
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:20,320
For context after last was it last episode of the one before that after the after that episode

1194
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:27,320
we we were in the call like doing our audio stuff and I think and I mentioned this Twitter account that I follow called

1195
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:33,320
chock and smirk or at beanie Tuesday and you two were like looking at the tweets

1196
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:41,320
and you posted that one posted in the chat the one of the like every every every.

1197
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Every guilty gear character versus every tech and character.

1198
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Right.

1199
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Yeah.

1200
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,320
Jimmy was like Jimmy.

1201
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
Jimmy from second.

1202
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,320
Get ready for a knuckle sandwich.

1203
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,320
Oh, it's a classic.

1204
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,320
Show it on screen.

1205
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Yeah.

1206
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Pause the video and enjoy it.

1207
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,320
Just soak up every last glorious deep.

1208
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,320
Finding it well.

1209
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
No, keep keep keep talking.

1210
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Keep keep going and entertain the people.

1211
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,320
Shit.

1212
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
No, I can't do it.

1213
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
It's too hard.

1214
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
It's dude.

1215
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Guys, guys, we've done this like 200 and almost 250 times.

1216
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,320
It's still really hard guys hard to beg to a podcast.

1217
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Talking difficult.

1218
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
I don't understand.

1219
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,320
I don't understand what a podcast even is.

1220
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
What is a podcast?

1221
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
That's a good.

1222
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,320
That's a good.

1223
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:47,320
From the word from iPod cast iron shackles and you shackle yourself to the iPod and the iPod

1224
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:53,320
looks into your eye and puts peas from its pod into your eye and you talk about that.

1225
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,320
And that was the first podcast.

1226
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,320
Oh, that sounds way more wholesome than I was expecting.

1227
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,320
God God invented the first podcast.

1228
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,320
God had the first podcast in the Garden of Eden.

1229
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Adam and Eve listened to it.

1230
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
No, no, no.

1231
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
What happened is the garden garden of Eden.

1232
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:19,320
The God was like, you have your entire this entire garden, but do not touch the tree of Apple podcast.

1233
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,320
As soon as you do that, you will have the knowledge of good and evil.

1234
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,320
It would be cast out for my kingdom.

1235
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
No.

1236
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,320
And the snake comes up and puts the earbuds and ears and Eve's ears like you need to listen to this political podcast.

1237
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,320
And it was all downhill from there.

1238
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:38,320
I'm saying that was that was the first podcast ever was was when God said, hey, don't eat that Apple Bros.

1239
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,320
And that was it.

1240
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:44,320
And it was and then history history ever since has just been a long procession of podcasts.

1241
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,320
Remember that time?

1242
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,320
Remember when like Abraham Lincoln gave the speech after the Battle of Gettysburg?

1243
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,320
That was a great podcast.

1244
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Yeah.

1245
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,320
Great podcast of history.

1246
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,320
Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream podcast was a classic.

1247
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,320
Indeed.

1248
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,320
Lamal.

1249
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,320
I like the simple the simple little podcast that you have with your friends on the school ground.

1250
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,320
Every day just talk like podcasting to them.

1251
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,320
And then you have that podcast with your teacher.

1252
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,320
Yeah.

1253
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:20,320
You had the student teacher podcast every like twice a twice a semester when they would discuss your

1254
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,320
progress.

1255
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,320
That's why they call that's why they call groups of school kids pods because they're all just getting

1256
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,320
together, talking to each other, casting, if you will, casting their ideas around.

1257
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,320
That's that's a Canadian thing.

1258
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:44,320
By the way, I'm pretty sure in like Canadian public schools, kids are like grouped into

1259
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,320
pods.

1260
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
And I know.

1261
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,320
And I know this and I know this only because in that.

1262
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
Remember that show My Life Me?

1263
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,320
No.

1264
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,320
No.

1265
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,320
We've talked about My Life Me.

1266
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,320
I have gone on tanges about my life.

1267
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,320
Okay.

1268
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,320
Ben.

1269
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,320
I will have to show you.

1270
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
Yeah.

1271
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,320
Shut up.

1272
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,320
No, you do.

1273
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,320
You do.

1274
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,320
I promise.

1275
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,320
Okay.

1276
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
You just screenshot of My Life Me.

1277
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
Oh, it's so fucking cool.

1278
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,320
It's so fucking epic.

1279
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,320
It's this this Canadian like pseudo anime.

1280
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:21,320
It's it's like a it's like one of those flash animated cartoons, but it's like an early one.

1281
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,320
It's like really.

1282
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,320
Oh, I can tell it's an early one.

1283
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Yeah.

1284
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
Yeah.

1285
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
It's fucking how to draw mangas.

1286
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,320
Yeah.

1287
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,320
They read the same books I did.

1288
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,320
But but like the whole like these kids in the show, they're not like friends.

1289
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,820
They're pod mates because in school they're all like they've all been like arbitrarily

1290
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,320
sorted into this pod and they just have to like do all their assignments together, even

1291
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,320
though like they don't even like each other that much.

1292
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:53,320
That one on the left is pretty crazy with his straight jacket and putting his foot on

1293
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,320
the hands instead of this hand.

1294
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,320
That's yeah.

1295
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,320
What is happening?

1296
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,320
Oh god.

1297
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,320
That's so weird.

1298
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,320
This image is overselling his wackiness.

1299
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
Well, that's unfortunate.

1300
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,320
He's he's he's not like other humans.

1301
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,320
He's not actually he's not actually a menace to society.

1302
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,320
He's he's just kind of a normal goofy dude.

1303
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,320
He doesn't I would personally I would unshackle him given the choice.

1304
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,320
He's kind of unhinged though.

1305
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,320
No, he's good.

1306
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
He's wholesome.

1307
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,320
He's a good boy.

1308
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
The goth ones hot though.

1309
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
Yeah.

1310
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,320
Like I'm big 12 true.

1311
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,320
Cartoons don't have ages even when they canonically do.

1312
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Twitter might disagree.

1313
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,320
Anime characters don't look like they're any particular age.

1314
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,320
They they're a mere suggestion of a person.

1315
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,320
That's all art, Ben.

1316
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
Yeah, I'm I'm not touching.

1317
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
Okay, that's true.

1318
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,320
I guess that I guess that it's merely a suggestion of reality.

1319
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,320
What if it looked like this and you were watching it or reading it?

1320
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:07,320
Yes, accurate, accurate and true and good and based and and democratically

1321
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,320
elected Joe Biden 2020.

1322
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,320
2020 is over and so is Joe.

1323
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,320
I've still got I've still got hashtag Lisa Simpson 2020 in my tag in my

1324
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,320
in my Twitter handle and I think I'm going to leave it there for the

1325
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
foreseeable future.

1326
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,320
The dream still lives, you know, the dream still lives.

1327
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,320
I mean, Biden hasn't been inaugurated.

1328
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,320
A lot can happen.

1329
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,320
A lot can happen between now and then.

1330
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,320
It's it's always it's always 2020 somewhere.

1331
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,320
You know, that's true.

1332
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
God willing.

1333
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,320
There's a little there's a little 2020 in all of us.

1334
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,320
You can take the you can take the the the boy out of the out of 2020,

1335
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,320
but you can't take the 2020 out of the boy.

1336
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,320
It's like they always say hindsight is 2020.

1337
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:00,320
They did they say that now it's true.

1338
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,320
That joke.

1339
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
My whole life.

1340
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,320
I've waited for that joke and then it came and everyone made it and I was

1341
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,320
like, oh wait, this isn't funny.

1342
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,320
I think it was funny enough for one more go.

1343
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,320
Now that now that I've exhausted it though, no one can do it.

1344
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,320
Future side is 2030.

1345
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,320
Oh, shit.

1346
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,320
Just an arbitrary increase on the number.

1347
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,320
Do you imagine having like a hundred, a hundred eyesight?

1348
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,320
That would be pretty good.

1349
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,320
Doesn't it get worse as the numbers get bigger though?

1350
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,320
Or am I totally making that up?

1351
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,320
Wait, what does what does they refer to then?

1352
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,320
If you have one one eyesight, do you see things for how they truly are?

1353
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,320
That's that's God.

1354
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,320
You see you see all the atoms individually.

1355
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,320
That's that's what Superman sees, you know.

1356
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,320
I don't know.

1357
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
I don't know what the numbers mean.

1358
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
I don't know.

1359
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,320
And I don't know what my I don't know what my eyesight is and I don't know

1360
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,320
what my prescription is.

1361
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:03,320
No, I'm fucked up and that's fucking punk.

1362
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,320
I'm so fucked up.

1363
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,320
I'm so fucked up.

1364
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:10,320
I say looking down at my hands, but my I'm holding my glasses in it, you know,

1365
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,320
that fucking graphic that Jim Sterling made that now that's punk thing.

1366
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,320
Have you guys watched Jim Sterling at all?

1367
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
Yeah, yeah.

1368
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,320
I'd watch him sometimes, but I don't know.

1369
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,320
I don't know the image you're talking about.

1370
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,320
Like ever since like the whole cyber punk thing blew up, like he got somebody to

1371
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,320
do this like really cheesy, but hilarious looking.

1372
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,320
Now that's punk graphic and every time someone says punk now, that's all I think

1373
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,320
about because it's perfect.

1374
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Well, I haven't I binged some sterling like a month ago, but I haven't really

1375
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
touched it.

1376
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
I don't like I don't like keep up with them.

1377
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,320
I'll just like, yeah, go back and watch his catalog once in a while.

1378
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
It's kind of what I do as well.

1379
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,320
If there's a big video game, I always go to see what's he got to say about this

1380
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
one?

1381
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Yeah.

1382
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
No, you got to go to you got to go to angry Joe.

1383
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,320
He's he's the game reviewer for the everyman.

1384
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:03,320
For the for the for the white working class for the aggrieved white working

1385
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,320
class.

1386
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,320
Shout out to my boy skill up.

1387
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,320
He's he's he's the guy.

1388
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
Aside.

1389
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,320
Aside from like angry Joe being kind of stupid a lot of the time, his game

1390
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,320
reviews are all right.

1391
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,320
I kind of like them.

1392
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,320
Like I have like no opinion about him whatsoever.

1393
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,320
Joe is like he he's not.

1394
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,320
I feel like he doesn't really try and be like a critic.

1395
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,320
He's just like, I'm a dude who plays video games.

1396
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,320
And this is what I think like his stuff is like kind of it is like it's

1397
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,320
like unironically in every man kind of approach like, you know, you watch a

1398
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,320
lot of critics are just like, this is like a professionally researched

1399
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,320
like in depth, like talking about the industry as I know it.

1400
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
Joe's just like, game fucking sucks.

1401
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,320
Or it's fucking rules or it's fucking dope.

1402
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,320
It's the actual it's the only he's the only actual reviewer in the

1403
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
world.

1404
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,320
No one else actually reviews things.

1405
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,320
They always like they're like stuck with the reviews.

1406
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,320
Everyone else tried to elevate it to like analysis and commentary and critique

1407
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,320
and all that shit and video essays.

1408
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,320
Joe is just like, I'm going to get a cheap five dollar costume.

1409
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,320
Do an opening skit.

1410
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,320
No, those games.

1411
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,320
Good.

1412
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,320
The skits are so bad.

1413
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,320
They are bad.

1414
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,320
It's really I go to angry Joe.

1415
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,320
The skits.

1416
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,320
I go to angry Joe when I just want to know like, what is this?

1417
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,320
This big thing I've heard so much about.

1418
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,320
Is it good?

1419
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:31,320
We're angry Joe would usually say if it is or not.

1420
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,320
Did they don't fuck it up?

1421
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,320
Well, I mean, like, what did he have on the last of us two?

1422
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,320
I can't remember.

1423
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,320
Like he had like his issues with the story stuff.

1424
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:47,320
And I know that is a bit like blown out of proportion because of the leaks that

1425
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
happened.

1426
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,320
And people, you know, there's a whole big thing with that.

1427
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:56,320
The game itself, I've heard from many different sources that is actually

1428
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,320
quite good.

1429
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,320
And I don't know.

1430
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,320
Like he has his emotional issues with certain things.

1431
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:09,320
But like generally speaking, if you just want to know what is in a game and

1432
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,320
he'll tell you.

1433
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,320
It's not the best guy.

1434
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,320
I just like I find him like the first time I watched him, I was like, this is

1435
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,320
stupid, but I guess it's all right.

1436
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,320
And I feel I feel obliged to defend him a little bit, even though that doesn't

1437
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,320
really need any defending at all.

1438
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,320
In fact, I hate him.

1439
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,320
Fuck him.

1440
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,320
Yeah.

1441
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,320
Yeah.

1442
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,320
Agreed.

1443
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,320
Much, much better.

1444
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,320
I'm glad you came around the only reasonable conclusion.

1445
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,320
I'm glad we've cleared that up.

1446
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:42,320
A character development tick for give and take now hates angry Joe fucking

1447
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,320
stupid idiot.

1448
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:49,320
That's that's Gibbs whole character now is that she hates angry Joe.

1449
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,320
Yeah, it seems to throw the rest out in the garbage.

1450
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,320
I'm on a epic quest to dislike every YouTube or ever.

1451
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:00,320
One other project is just hating on it.

1452
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,320
But they're also likeable.

1453
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,320
No, it's that's what they want you to think.

1454
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,320
They're also charismatic and unproblematic.

1455
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,320
They would never do anything bad because they made me laugh that one time.

1456
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:18,320
They made me laugh and they made me pee my pants and shit myself laughing.

1457
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,320
And I just enjoy that moment in my memories.

1458
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,320
No, no, I liked it when they groomed me.

1459
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,320
They would never groom me in like a in like a bad a bad way.

1460
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,320
They groomed me in a bad way.

1461
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,320
They groomed me like apes groom each other like a communal grooming.

1462
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,320
They washed me.

1463
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,320
They washed my feet.

1464
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,320
They anointed me with sacred oils.

1465
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
All right.

1466
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,320
They sent me on my way.

1467
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,320
What?

1468
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,320
All the YouTubers.

1469
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:53,320
I went I went I went to YouTube headquarters and all the YouTubers were there.

1470
01:09:53,320 --> 01:10:00,320
Quinn reviews was there and Matthew Matosis was there and PewDiePie was there.

1471
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,320
And, you know, it's so on in that order and they all were just like stripped stripped down.

1472
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
We're going to we're going to oil you up.

1473
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,320
But it was in like a but in like a sacred sort of way.

1474
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,320
And then they did it.

1475
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,320
And I was like, thanks.

1476
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,320
He just walked out of the building.

1477
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,320
And nothing bad happened.

1478
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,320
So don't tell me.

1479
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:28,320
So don't you tell me that my favorite that my favorite Internet content creators are,

1480
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,320
are, are, you know, flawed.

1481
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,320
Shout out.

1482
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Okay.

1483
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,320
That's it.

1484
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,320
That's the bit.

1485
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,320
Bits over.

1486
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,320
Bits over.

1487
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,320
No more.

1488
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,320
I don't know where the bit ends and starts.

1489
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,320
This whole podcast is a bit podcast is a bad bit.

1490
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,320
Godzilla versus Kong coming out in a few months.

1491
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,320
Will it suck?

1492
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,320
Yes or yes?

1493
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,320
I'm worried about the movie.

1494
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,320
I mean, I'm not worried about the movie.

1495
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,320
I just want the two guys beat the living shit out of each other.

1496
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,320
They're going to make Kong.

1497
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,320
They're going to make Kong win.

1498
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,320
The guy who's making directing the movie is a big Kong family.

1499
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
They're going to make the monkey beat Godzilla.

1500
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
I'm going to make me really mad.

1501
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
Yeah.

1502
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,320
I'm really curious about if they're going to give Kong electricity powers.

1503
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
Dude, that would be sick.

1504
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,320
Like the original one.

1505
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,320
That would be unironically based.

1506
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,320
That will be super funny.

1507
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,320
They have like a toy coming out where they give Kong his big giant axe.

1508
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
He has an axe.

1509
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,320
If he has an axe in the movie, that'd be so fucking sick.

1510
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,320
Unironically.

1511
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
Maybe I'd switch to Team Kong.

1512
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,320
He has an axe.

1513
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,320
It just beats the shit out of Godzilla with a giant fucking monkey axe.

1514
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,320
Godzilla has a tree.

1515
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Don't you remember that scene when he grabs a tree?

1516
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,320
And that's really funny.

1517
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,320
King Kong is a primate.

1518
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
He's got opposable thumbs.

1519
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,320
He can make tools.

1520
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,320
So he could definitely make an axe or a gun.

1521
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,320
Dude, yeah.

1522
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,320
Kong with guns?

1523
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,320
All right.

1524
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,320
Now we're talking.

1525
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,320
All he would have to do is find a giant 3D printer and then he could just 3D print himself

1526
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
a giant gun.

1527
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
He doesn't even have to know how to make one.

1528
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,320
He just needs the schematics.

1529
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:09,320
And then he can storm the capital to get on the PS5.

1530
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:16,320
He makes a giant 3D printer out of mountains.

1531
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:24,320
He makes a 3D printer out of a volcano into a mold, like the magma coming out there.

1532
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:32,320
King Kong has had enough of these pedophile elites and they're adrenochrome harvesting

1533
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:39,320
and he is going to Washington D.C. to make his voice heard and do something about it.

1534
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,320
It's a people's revolution.

1535
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,320
Yeah, but when they say like four people died, Kong was all four of those people.

1536
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,320
Did you see, wait, I have to mention this because I didn't see this.

1537
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,320
Like I saw like one tweet about this and that was it.

1538
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,320
And I feel like people aren't talking about it.

1539
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:57,320
Did you see the clip of that woman who's like, they pushed me down and maced me.

1540
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,320
We're storming the capital.

1541
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,320
It's a revolution.

1542
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
Do you know what I'm going to say about it?

1543
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:08,320
I have seen that clip edited in a funny way, but I don't know what the original was.

1544
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,320
Okay.

1545
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:14,320
Well, I saw a tweet pointing out that if you look, it kind of looks like when she's like

1546
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,320
rubbing her face in her hand with it has the towel on it that she's wiping her face with.

1547
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:27,320
She seems to be holding an onion and is like rubbing her face with an onion to like fake that she's been maced and like

1548
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,320
make herself cry and make her like eyes, eyes inflamed.

1549
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,320
Yeah.

1550
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,320
So weird.

1551
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,320
I saw that.

1552
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,320
There's a couple of frames in it.

1553
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,320
You could see she's like, she's rubbing on her face and then she puts it down.

1554
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:43,320
And there's like this white round thing that she's holding and it looks exactly like the resolution is not amazing,

1555
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,320
but it really looks like an onion.

1556
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,320
And yeah, some people are saying I was just a little blown away.

1557
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
It's so weird that someone would do that.

1558
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,320
Yeah.

1559
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:58,320
Some people were saying in the comments that like for some reason there's like a myth that like an onion can help with tear gas like

1560
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,320
like rubbing with an onion will help like not like tear gas.

1561
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:08,320
I don't know if that's real or not because like that's never a problem I've ever had to consider.

1562
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,320
I mean, obviously it doesn't work.

1563
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,320
I don't know if that's like a common misconception or not, or if that was just something people on Twitter were saying.

1564
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,320
That's really weird.

1565
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,320
That's something special is like tear gas.

1566
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,320
If it was, you know, if it was something like that.

1567
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,320
Okay, okay.

1568
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:31,320
I could, I could see that, but like one thing I don't buy that this woman would have brought an onion like in preparation for

1569
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,320
she got tear gas because these people were not expecting to be with police resistance.

1570
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,320
Because it was impromptu, right?

1571
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,320
Why would you bring an onion to a Trump rally?

1572
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,320
I mean, I don't know if it was impromptu.

1573
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,320
They were not expecting to meet with police resistance.

1574
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
They were not expecting to get maced and shot.

1575
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:51,320
There were definitely people who came to that thing with equipment and like were prepared to do certain things.

1576
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:57,320
There's that image of that one guy had those like a ziplock ties to like handcuff people with.

1577
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,320
Oh, yeah.

1578
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,320
Yeah, true.

1579
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,320
Yeah, true.

1580
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
I got, I said I got maced.

1581
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,320
I didn't really get maced, but I did breathe some tear gas one time.

1582
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,320
Just like, just like, I was just on the periphery of the cloud.

1583
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,320
I got like the barest little whiff of it at one time.

1584
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,320
That was enough for you.

1585
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,320
You went home.

1586
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:22,320
I went, I wanted more, but they were like, the cops are just like, leave us alone.

1587
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,320
Stop asking us to gas you.

1588
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
I need the cloud, please.

1589
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,320
I need it to weed.

1590
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,320
The cloud?

1591
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,320
Oh, the cloud.

1592
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,320
The cloud, the clouds for cloud.

1593
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,320
That's, that's the new, the new nonprofit events.

1594
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:41,320
That was, that was when I went to the, the, the counter protest for the straight pride parade last year.

1595
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,320
Oh man.

1596
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,320
The one that Milo was at and they had one float.

1597
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:51,320
They had one Trump float and Milo was on it just waving and it was, it was pretty sad.

1598
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,320
Honestly.

1599
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,320
Wait, straight pride.

1600
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,320
He's not even straight.

1601
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,320
Is he?

1602
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,320
No.

1603
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
That doesn't make any sense.

1604
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,320
But he's just, you know, he's just, but he's, he's there to be a provocateur because,

1605
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,320
because he knows, because he knows that this is going to trigger the libs.

1606
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,320
And you know what?

1607
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,320
It did.

1608
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,320
So good for him.

1609
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,320
He did it.

1610
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,320
The system works.

1611
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,320
Mmm.

1612
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,320
Good times.

1613
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,320
Oh, those are the days.

1614
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,320
Oh, those are the days of going outside.

1615
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,320
Oh yeah.

1616
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,320
That's right.

1617
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,320
Imagine, I forgot.

1618
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
I forgot all about the before times.

1619
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,320
I am.

1620
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,320
No, keep them.

1621
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,320
Keep them in your heart.

1622
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,320
I'm like, keep them in your heart.

1623
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,320
So lost.

1624
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:35,320
Should I reconnect myself with the world to understand what you guys mostly talk about?

1625
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,320
No.

1626
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,320
Here, I'm going to save this.

1627
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,320
All right.

1628
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
Here's something that you don't need context or world understand.

1629
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,320
I found, and I found, I mean, someone showed me the greatest, the greatest shitpost of

1630
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,320
our time.

1631
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,120
It's called flex air five.

1632
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,320
Everyone needs to watch flex air five.

1633
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,320
I tweeted it.

1634
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,320
If the link will be in the description.

1635
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,320
It says this is like video and available.

1636
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,320
Get a VPN.

1637
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,320
Find a way to watch.

1638
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,320
Another upload.

1639
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,320
Wait a minute.

1640
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,320
It's the most incredible shitpost I've ever seen in my life.

1641
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,320
It's like a full 3D animation, like kit bash shitpost.

1642
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,320
I can't even describe it.

1643
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,320
It's multimedia art of the highest caliber.

1644
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,320
It's amazing.

1645
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,320
It's like a sequel.

1646
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,320
It's like this is a whole series.

1647
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,320
There is.

1648
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,320
There is a series.

1649
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,320
There's four others before this.

1650
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,320
I did see this or maybe I didn't see this one, but I saw something like this, like, or

1651
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,320
maybe just a clip of it somewhere.

1652
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,320
I saw Saver Swag did a stream and he like showed this and I was just happened to catch it.

1653
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,320
And that was like a week ago.

1654
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,320
I can't stop thinking about this video.

1655
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,320
It like changed my life.

1656
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,320
It's so good.

1657
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:44,320
It's just the funniest, like the amount of effort that went into this for nothing is just

1658
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
incredible because like,

1659
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
Well, it's not for nothing.

1660
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:54,320
I guess saying nothing is a bit like hyperbolic, but just like, it's just a meme.

1661
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,320
It's a meme.

1662
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:02,320
It's a meme compilation taken to like a like an unexpected extreme, which makes it a whole

1663
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,320
other layer of joke.

1664
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,320
Yeah.

1665
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,320
I think I've seen bits of this.

1666
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,320
Yeah, this is really.

1667
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
There's there's a lot going on in this.

1668
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,320
This is amazing.

1669
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,320
And every time I watch it, I notice something new.

1670
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,320
Like the last time I watched it, I realized, oh, the like speedometer in Shrek's car is

1671
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,320
an RTX 3080 graphics card with like little dials put on it.

1672
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,320
Like, why would you do that?

1673
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,320
I don't know.

1674
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
Okay.

1675
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,320
It's incredible.

1676
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
Hmm.

1677
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
What's the, I don't know.

1678
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
Is there like a story behind?

1679
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,320
I don't know.

1680
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,320
There is it.

1681
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
Well, it's just a series of meme videos.

1682
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,320
This guy's done.

1683
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
This is the fifth one.

1684
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,320
He's been doing them for like a year and change and fucking know.

1685
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,320
Dude, it's so good.

1686
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,320
Everything about this is my favorite thing.

1687
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,320
Yeah, it's incredible.

1688
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,320
It's so powerful.

1689
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:53,320
I mean, I want to ask why, but I have one question.

1690
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,320
It's too good.

1691
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,320
Hmm.

1692
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,320
Look at the Ricardo Milo's.

1693
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,320
It's just, it's just so the drop is the most powerful moment in cinematic history.

1694
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,320
Yeah.

1695
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,320
It's like a base drop.

1696
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,320
Yeah.

1697
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,320
Yeah.

1698
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,320
Wait, I might have skipped past it.

1699
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,320
It's not like one minute 40 or something like that.

1700
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,320
I think it's the guy in the bus tub with the.

1701
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,320
Yeah.

1702
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,320
When the bathtub.

1703
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,320
I'm on that part.

1704
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,320
Yeah.

1705
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,320
Yeah.

1706
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,320
It's like 214.

1707
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,320
It's like 214.

1708
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,320
214 is when the base drop hits and it's just.

1709
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,320
Oh boy.

1710
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,320
It's good.

1711
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
Oh, oh, there he goes.

1712
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,320
Okay.

1713
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:38,320
What's that cat's name?

1714
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,320
Is that I've seen that cat.

1715
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,320
I don't remember where.

1716
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,320
It's not bongo cat.

1717
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,320
Is it?

1718
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:51,320
It's the one, it's the one just from that GIF where it's just kind of like.

1719
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,320
Yeah.

1720
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,320
It's bongo cat.

1721
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,320
Okay.

1722
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,320
Okay.

1723
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,320
You played the bongos and then people made it do other things.

1724
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
I don't think I saw this one.

1725
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
I think I must have seen like an earlier one.

1726
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:10,320
You know, the most impressive part about this is the cutting out of every frame of all of

1727
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,320
these videos of these things.

1728
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,320
Right.

1729
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,320
And the way they.

1730
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,320
The anime as well.

1731
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:20,320
There's like subtle little tweens on like, on like the live action characters that they're

1732
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,320
not doing to make them kind of look like they're doing things like when Ricardo Dards dodges

1733
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,320
the bullets, like the way there's like the, the.

1734
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
Is that the guy in the bandana, Ricardo?

1735
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,320
Yeah.

1736
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,320
Yeah.

1737
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,320
The way, the way that like he moves to kind of look like there's like some momentum to

1738
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,320
like him dodging bullets.

1739
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
I just saw that dance.

1740
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,320
It's so like you go all the way to the end.

1741
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,680
Like there's the anime girl is just standing there in the final shot, but he like adds

1742
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,680
a subtle like breathing animation with like a tween that didn't need to be there, but

1743
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
it is.

1744
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,680
There's just, it's masterful.

1745
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,680
It's like actual art.

1746
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,680
I'm floored.

1747
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,680
I'm stunned.

1748
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,680
It's, it's, I can't stop thinking about this video and how powerful it is.

1749
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,680
This guy must.

1750
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,680
I don't know.

1751
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,680
I don't know what software he uses, but.

1752
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,680
Everything uses every.

1753
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,680
Lots of things.

1754
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,680
Wow.

1755
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,680
I just think it's so dense.

1756
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:12,680
Every frame has so much going on.

1757
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,680
It's true.

1758
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,680
Damn it.

1759
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,680
God damn it.

1760
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,680
If it ain't the truth.

1761
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,680
Yeah, that was incredible.

1762
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,680
Why is Carl dressed like Megumin?

1763
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,680
I don't understand, but he's just there.

1764
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:31,680
And I don't, it's a mystery, but someone made a full 3D model of Carl dressed as Megumin.

1765
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,680
And then it's happening.

1766
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,680
It's in this.

1767
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,680
I'm like, all right.

1768
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,680
I, nah, I could have made that.

1769
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,680
Oh, okay.

1770
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,680
I could have made that, but better.

1771
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,680
I mean, that's fair.

1772
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,680
No, no, no.

1773
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,680
I was commenting more on the fact that it even exists in the first place, not to the skill in which it was created.

1774
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:53,680
No, I was actually, I was actually going to make this exact video, but I decided like, nah, that'd be stupid.

1775
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:54,680
Nah, I could do better.

1776
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,680
Well, jokes on you.

1777
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,680
It's got over three and a half million views, buddy.

1778
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,680
So, nah, those are shit views.

1779
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,680
Pretty sure he's made more money with those views than you have on your crypto.

1780
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,680
Those views.

1781
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,680
Oh, you fucking.

1782
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,680
That's on today of all days.

1783
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,680
That's hitting below the belt.

1784
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:21,680
You never, you never insult a man's crypto.

1785
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,680
I would have been checked on my fucking Ethereum's doing.

1786
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:33,680
Well, I have a feeling that it probably has gone up for a while and just had a pretty big dip today and then recovered.

1787
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:38,680
So I've had it for like almost two years and I've never looked at it once.

1788
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,680
I know that it's there.

1789
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,680
Wait, really?

1790
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,680
Yeah.

1791
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,680
Okay.

1792
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,680
Well, okay.

1793
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,680
I'm going to take a look.

1794
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,680
You've had it for two years.

1795
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,680
I think so.

1796
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,680
About that.

1797
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,680
This is all I care about.

1798
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,680
All I care about anymore is cryptocurrency.

1799
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:55,680
As soon as the opportunity to talk about cryptocurrency comes up, I'm like, I'm like, I'm there.

1800
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,680
We made it.

1801
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,680
Okay.

1802
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,680
So let's say if you bought it in like 20, if you bought it in like 20.

1803
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,680
Like the middle of 2018, something like that.

1804
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Middle of 2018?

1805
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,680
Yeah, something like that.

1806
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,680
So you bought it like at the peak.

1807
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,680
I didn't buy it.

1808
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,680
I was gifted it from MDOT.

1809
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,680
He just was giving out Ethereum.

1810
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,680
Wait, how many Ethereum did he give you?

1811
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,680
Oh, I don't fucking remember.

1812
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,680
Not a lot.

1813
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:26,680
It was like, at the time, I think it was like 50 to 70 bucks worth of Ethereum.

1814
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:32,180
I mean, if it was early 2018, then it has probably worth about the same.

1815
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:35,680
If it was like late 2018, then it's like quintupled in value.

1816
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,680
Yeah.

1817
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,680
Well, I have no idea.

1818
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,680
Yeah.

1819
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,680
Yeah.

1820
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
Yeah.

1821
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,680
Ben is turning into Brent Garlinghouse.

1822
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,680
Yeah.

1823
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,680
No, it's not true.

1824
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:53,680
The fan theory that Brent Garlinghouse was Ben from the future in an alternate timeline

1825
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:56,680
makes more and more sense in every passing day.

1826
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,680
No, no, it's not true.

1827
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,680
It can't be true.

1828
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:09,680
We had the time traveling technology from Homestuck where you can talk to people in the past on

1829
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,680
your computer.

1830
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:19,680
You send an email to Nate Bestman with the virus on it.

1831
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,680
I sent it.

1832
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:26,680
That's how Brent Garlinghouse was created, actually, from the time paradox.

1833
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,680
He just spawned out of the e-fair to complete the loop.

1834
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:38,680
Did you see that post that I put in the Discord about like Brent Garlinghouse posting all these

1835
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,680
like, let me address the current allegations.

1836
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,680
I don't know what it is.

1837
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,680
I guess Ripple is in trouble.

1838
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,680
I guess XRP is in trouble for something.

1839
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,680
Ripple XRP is so...

1840
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,680
I mean, nobody talks about it.

1841
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,680
So I feel like it's not like a big enough thing.

1842
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,680
It doesn't seem like a big...

1843
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,680
It doesn't seem like a big thing at all.

1844
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,680
And yet I'm sure it's worth like billions of dollars.

1845
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,680
Like for some reason, I don't know.

1846
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,680
I don't know what it does or what the point of it is.

1847
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:14,680
Well, you had all those viruses going around to take over people's YouTube channels.

1848
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:21,680
Not that I don't know whether he was necessarily behind that, but like whatever.

1849
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,680
There's something shady going on with him.

1850
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,680
Oh, oh.

1851
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,680
Whoa.

1852
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,680
Oh no, XRP.

1853
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:35,680
Dude, XRP like cratered today.

1854
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,680
Oh my God, XRP went to like...

1855
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,680
No, zero joke.

1856
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:48,680
Yes, in the space of today, the value of XRP went from over 35 cents, almost 40, to like less than three.

1857
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:54,680
So like one tenth of its value in one day.

1858
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,680
I'm not kidding.

1859
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,680
I don't understand these things.

1860
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,680
Holy fuck.

1861
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,680
Like this, wait.

1862
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,680
What the fuck?

1863
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,680
This can't be true.

1864
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,680
This can't be true.

1865
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,680
This would mean...

1866
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,680
No.

1867
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,680
The fact that the golden promise of a digital border-free currency

1868
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,680
has been reduced to just being a speculative trading asset is really depressing

1869
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,680
and shows how humanity will never progress forward.

1870
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,680
We'll never have starfleet at this rate.

1871
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,680
No, I'm wrong.

1872
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,680
It didn't go to...

1873
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,680
Sorry, I was misreading.

1874
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,680
It went from like 35 to like 30.

1875
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,680
So it's like, it's gone down.

1876
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,680
That is so much more boring and uninteresting.

1877
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,680
I'm sorry.

1878
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,680
I know.

1879
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,680
I thought I was seeing the death of Ripple, but...

1880
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,680
I thought our diss track actually did something.

1881
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,680
And now I just feel like we're just never part in the wind.

1882
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:47,680
Yeah.

1883
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,680
It's true.

1884
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,680
It's true.

1885
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,680
We're never going to be a threat.

1886
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,680
About the...

1887
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,680
What were you saying about the currency?

1888
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,680
I mean, everybody who has Bitcoin is like...

1889
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680
I'm in it for the long haul.

1890
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,680
The point of Bitcoin is not to speculate on the point of Bitcoin.

1891
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,680
That's all anybody does.

1892
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,680
Let's not even kid ourselves.

1893
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,680
Not the people on R slash Bitcoin.

1894
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,680
They're all just there like, I'm holding until the day I die.

1895
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,680
Bitcoin is the wave of the future.

1896
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,680
Bitcoin is going to...

1897
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:23,680
In a free market, the most stable currency always wins,

1898
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,680
and Bitcoin is the most stable currency or whatever.

1899
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,680
That's not even slightly true.

1900
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,680
Well, I mean...

1901
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,680
Well, it's the most...

1902
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,680
In that you don't...

1903
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,680
It doesn't have any operating costs associated with it,

1904
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,680
is what they mean.

1905
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,680
Well...

1906
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,680
Not that it's value.

1907
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,680
It's not stable.

1908
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:47,680
But as a store of value, it has no...

1909
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,680
Entropy associated with it.

1910
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,680
Like a thief couldn't break in and steal the Bitcoin?

1911
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,680
No.

1912
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,680
No.

1913
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,680
To transfer it doesn't cost anything,

1914
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,680
and to hold it doesn't cost anything,

1915
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,680
whereas other things do.

1916
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,680
It's free as in freedom.

1917
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,680
You literally have to pay money just to store gold,

1918
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,680
or to transport gold, right?

1919
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,680
That's the way in which the value is not stable.

1920
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,680
Yes, I never really think about that,

1921
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:16,680
but it is tied up somewhat in physical stuff.

1922
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,680
Yeah, and that's what they say about Bitcoin,

1923
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,680
is like, this is the way of the future,

1924
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,680
because it doesn't have any of that,

1925
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,680
and that means it's guaranteed to win out in the long run,

1926
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,680
and any Bitcoin that you own now

1927
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,680
is going to pay for the rest of your life

1928
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,680
in 10 years from now or whatever.

1929
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,680
That's what they say anyway.

1930
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,680
But who knows?

1931
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,680
But who knows?

1932
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,680
Never know.

1933
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,680
Nothing is certain in this life.

1934
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,680
COVID-2 is right around the corner, actually.

1935
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:48,680
COVID-2 is actually transmitted through Bitcoin,

1936
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,680
so sorry.

1937
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,680
You're fucked.

1938
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,680
Good job, Ben.

1939
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,680
Fuck it up again.

1940
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,680
I'm sorry.

1941
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,680
I didn't mean to.

1942
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,680
And yet, you did it anyways.

1943
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:09,680
Well, what do you think about voicemails?

1944
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,680
I think they suck,

1945
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,680
but I think we should listen to them.

1946
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,680
You know, I agree on both cats.

1947
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,680
Sure. Obviously, you're right.

1948
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,680
Okay. Nexus?

1949
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,680
Cut that out.

1950
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:25,680
Kaiju.

1951
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,680
Yes.

1952
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,680
Anything, do you have any last words?

1953
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,680
Any last words before we fucking execute you

1954
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,680
and go to voicemails?

1955
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:35,680
Any objections?

1956
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,680
Am I not allowed to listen to voicemails?

1957
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,680
Oh, dang.

1958
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,680
No, that's not what I mean.

1959
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,680
I mean, do you want to bring up anything

1960
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,680
before we do that?

1961
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,680
Oh, like a topic or something?

1962
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,680
Nah.

1963
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,680
Sure.

1964
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,680
I have no life.

1965
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,680
Okay.

1966
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,680
Nah.

1967
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,680
Alright.

1968
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,680
I just draw every fucking day.

1969
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,680
Patreon.patreon.com.

1970
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,680
Yes.

1971
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,680
Yes.

1972
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,680
Eleazar.

1973
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,680
I want you to go back in time

1974
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,680
to when the episode started

1975
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,680
and just put like a flurry

1976
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,680
and just put like a whole flurry of like Nexus art.

1977
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,680
Just have it.

1978
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,680
When Nexus introduces...

1979
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,680
Who?

1980
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,680
Kaiju.

1981
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,680
When Kaiju introduces...

1982
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,680
And I'm going to kick your ass.

1983
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,680
Just have all the...

1984
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,680
I'm sorry.

1985
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,680
I'm so...

1986
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,680
God, I'm so stupid.

1987
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,680
God, I can't do anything right.

1988
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,680
Fuck.

1989
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,680
You know what?

1990
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,680
At least your software.

1991
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,680
Kaiju should...

1992
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,680
You know what Kaiju should be on?

1993
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,680
Should have my spot on the podcast.

1994
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Kaiju should be the new Benz Saint.

1995
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,680
Clip that.

1996
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,680
Clip that.

1997
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,680
We're going to need that for level.

1998
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,680
God, I should...

1999
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:35,680
I should...

2000
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,680
I should resign.

2001
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,680
I should resign.

2002
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,680
And Kaiju must take up my position.

2003
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,680
Can...

2004
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,680
Wait, wait.

2005
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,680
Can I take your patrons too?

2006
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:47,680
No.

2007
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,680
Aw, fuck.

2008
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,680
No, sorry.

2009
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,680
You work for me now.

2010
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,680
You're the face of BenzSaint.com.

2011
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,680
Okay.

2012
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,680
The first...

2013
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:01,680
First voicemail is from...

2014
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,680
How do you say it?

2015
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,680
Ctole?

2016
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,680
I think that's how you say...

2017
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,680
Ctole, yeah.

2018
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,680
Yeah, actually...

2019
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,680
God, I feel like login to all of this and everything.

2020
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,680
Who was...

2021
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:17,680
Oblivionfall sent me this audio file and was like,

2022
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,680
yeah, Ctole recorded this as a voicemail,

2023
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,680
but the quality wasn't good enough.

2024
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:27,680
So they re-recorded it in, like, high quality, high fidelity.

2025
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,680
And this is that high fidelity version.

2026
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,680
Wait, is this not on Speakpipe then?

2027
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,680
No, it...

2028
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,680
Well, Kaiju can't listen on Speakpipe.

2029
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,680
Oh, right, right.

2030
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,680
So we have to do it in the Discord.

2031
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,680
I posted it in the general room.

2032
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,680
Okay.

2033
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,680
It says Protesta.

2034
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,680
All right.

2035
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,680
Pro...

2036
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,680
P-R-O-T-E-S-T-A.

2037
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,680
Three, two, one, play it.

2038
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,680
We've made it.

2039
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,680
We've made it into the Capitol building.

2040
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,680
Yes.

2041
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,680
We're going to take back...

2042
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,680
We're going to take back this country.

2043
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,680
Go, go.

2044
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,680
We're not going to stand for this photo squad.

2045
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,680
Go, go.

2046
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,680
In Arizona.

2047
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,680
Get her.

2048
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:07,680
Whoa.

2049
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,680
Aris.

2050
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,680
Aris.

2051
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:10,680
Aris.

2052
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,680
Aris.

2053
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,680
Aris.

2054
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,680
Aris.

2055
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,680
Aris.

2056
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,680
Aris.

2057
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,680
Aris.

2058
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,680
How does it feel to be a part of history?

2059
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:25,680
You know, I've never thought hearing a woo echo around the halls of the Capitol building

2060
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,680
would be so...

2061
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,680
The Arizona Capitol building.

2062
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,680
Why Arizona?

2063
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,680
Huh?

2064
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,680
Well, I mean, that was also being attacked.

2065
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:40,680
Those who control the Arizona I.S.T. production control the world.

2066
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,680
All right.

2067
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,680
All right.

2068
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,680
They were storming cap...

2069
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,680
They were storming capitals all over the dang place.

2070
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,680
I forgot.

2071
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:55,680
I forgot because the DC one is just so dang iconic.

2072
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,680
Congratulations.

2073
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,680
Where we go when we go all?

2074
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,680
It's funny.

2075
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,680
Someone pointed out in the last episode that I made a...

2076
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,680
That I said where we go when we go all.

2077
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:07,680
I made a Q reference and it was like, ooh, that timing.

2078
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,680
Ooh, right before.

2079
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,680
It's almost like I knew.

2080
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,680
It's almost like I hid inside her information.

2081
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:17,680
It's almost like I was the Antifa instigator on the inside the whole time.

2082
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,680
Right, right, right.

2083
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:19,680
But it's not that.

2084
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,680
All it took is one.

2085
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:26,680
One thing's seen and then they riled up beyond compare.

2086
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:31,680
It was literally just me like retweeting people saying like, socialism's good actually.

2087
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:35,680
Bernie should have won the primary and it just made the right wing so angry that they stormed

2088
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,680
the capitol building and that's what did it.

2089
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,680
And you know what?

2090
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,680
No regrets.

2091
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,680
Okay.

2092
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,680
Fuck.

2093
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,680
Where did I put that freaking...

2094
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,680
Where did I put those freaking voicemails?

2095
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,680
This one is called...

2096
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,680
This one is called rat.

2097
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,680
Three, two, one, play.

2098
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:57,680
Fuck you, Ben Sainte.

2099
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,680
You are a rat.

2100
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,680
A rat and I hate you.

2101
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,680
Hey, Gib.

2102
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,680
Hey.

2103
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,680
Hey.

2104
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,680
Cool.

2105
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,680
Yeah.

2106
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,680
That was a quality voicemail.

2107
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:16,680
Honestly, honestly, I support the idea of people literally just giving us a call in a voicemail

2108
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,680
just to like say hi.

2109
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,680
Just do it.

2110
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,680
Just fuck it up.

2111
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,680
You know, just fuck it up.

2112
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,680
Who cares?

2113
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,680
Here we go.

2114
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,680
Next one is called...

2115
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,680
Let me see.

2116
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,680
The next one is called a video game gem you've probably never heard of.

2117
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,680
Three, two, one, go.

2118
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,680
Hey, guys.

2119
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,680
Don't mind me.

2120
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,680
I'm just playing this underground game.

2121
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,680
You probably haven't heard of it before.

2122
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:45,680
It's called Pokemon Heart, Gold, and Soul Silver.

2123
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,680
Okay.

2124
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,680
Yeah.

2125
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,680
Pretty not well known.

2126
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,680
Underrated.

2127
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:50,680
Now listen to me ramble for a minute.

2128
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:56,680
As I list all the mechanics that everyone lists when they talk about this obviously popular

2129
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,680
game.

2130
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,680
Yeah.

2131
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,680
That's definitely worth your time.

2132
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,680
I wonder if I'm trying to make a point about something.

2133
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,680
That was actually bad.

2134
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,680
It was so bad.

2135
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,680
You ever heard of Radiohead?

2136
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,680
You ever heard of The Beatles?

2137
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,680
Yeah.

2138
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,680
It's pretty underground.

2139
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,680
Yeah.

2140
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,680
This sucks.

2141
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:12,680
Anyway.

2142
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,680
Honestly.

2143
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,680
Black lives matter.

2144
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,680
Gay rights.

2145
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,680
Yeah.

2146
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,680
You know.

2147
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:18,680
Cool.

2148
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,680
This is becoming like an arc.

2149
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:25,680
Kaiju, I can't believe you're so bigoted that he would say black lives matter and you

2150
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,680
would laugh.

2151
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,680
Like this is no laughing matter.

2152
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,680
This is a story by surprise.

2153
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,680
Civil rights are no laughing matter and you need to, and you need to, and you need to,

2154
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,680
you need to own your privilege.

2155
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,680
All right.

2156
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,680
You need to check your privilege at the door.

2157
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,680
And you are fucking canceled.

2158
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:43,680
Oh my God.

2159
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,680
No.

2160
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:45,680
What if I did?

2161
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,680
Can I kill myself?

2162
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,680
Can you, I will allow you to kill yourself.

2163
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,680
Yes.

2164
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,680
Thank you.

2165
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,680
Okay.

2166
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,680
Spooker yourself to retain your honor.

2167
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,680
Um, yeah.

2168
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,680
I like that.

2169
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:04,680
Like, like I agree that that hardcore Soul Silver voicemail was pretty like, hey guys, this

2170
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,680
is an underrated game.

2171
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,680
Lol.

2172
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,680
Like the most fucking popular game in the whole series.

2173
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,680
Uh, uh, I like that.

2174
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:14,680
Like this person was so mad about it that they had to do it like even two weeks out.

2175
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,680
They still had to make a voicemail just to say fuck back.

2176
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,680
The second week they were like, I just, I just got to let it go.

2177
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,680
But then it's week two.

2178
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,680
They were like, ah, I have to do it.

2179
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,680
They're still mad about it.

2180
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,680
They're still mad about it.

2181
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,680
Like I just have to get this off my chest or else it'll never, it'll never go away.

2182
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:29,680
Uh, based.

2183
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:30,680
Okay.

2184
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,680
The next one is called, um, okay.

2185
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,680
The next one is called skip if Tom isn't on.

2186
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,680
So there it is.

2187
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,680
Skip it.

2188
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,680
Three, two, one, go.

2189
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:50,680
Tom, what 3D engines are you thinking about doing low poly pixel crunched games?

2190
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,680
It's incredibly easy to do in Unity.

2191
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,680
There's a bunch of resources, free packages for cell shaders and pixel perfect cameras.

2192
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,680
Plus Unity now has its own blueprint node based programming tool that you could use.

2193
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:07,680
Blueprint programming would be a slight workflow change from construct, I think, but it's all

2194
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,680
about programming logic in the end.

2195
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:15,680
Check out a short hike for an example of a low poly pixel game built in Unity.

2196
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:16,680
Yeah.

2197
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:21,680
I know there's like a pre built shader that does like the low poly thing in Unity, but

2198
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,680
Unity sucks.

2199
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,680
Every time I try and use Unity, it's just like a bloated garbage.

2200
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:30,680
Like I did like a tutorial on Unity where it's like, Hey, here's a baby intro to using

2201
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,680
Unity.

2202
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,680
I'm like, okay.

2203
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,680
And you download Unity, it's like 15 gigs and all this fucking bullshit and it has to

2204
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,680
install like visual studio and like rape your computer with all.

2205
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,680
Oh, I can't say that infects your computer with all this fucking shit.

2206
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,680
Right.

2207
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:43,680
Okay.

2208
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,680
And then it's like, here's, here's how to like drag a model into a scene.

2209
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,680
And this is how the editor works.

2210
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,680
I'm like, okay.

2211
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,680
You finished the tutorial.

2212
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:54,680
Would you like to pay $50 to add assets to your game you just made?

2213
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,680
I'm like, I didn't do shit.

2214
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,680
Fuck you.

2215
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,680
Yes, please.

2216
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,680
It's just like so gross and bloated and crappy.

2217
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:00,680
I'm probably going to use Godot.

2218
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,680
There's a, there's a low poly shader for Godot as well.

2219
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,680
And it's like literally like 70 megabytes of space and launches instantly and doesn't

2220
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,680
sell you anything and is completely free and doesn't have a splash screen.

2221
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,680
You have to pay $500 a year to get rid of.

2222
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,680
Do you know, do you know a short hike?

2223
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,680
I'm aware of a short hike.

2224
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:24,680
The game that I always think of when I think of like visual programming in unity is the

2225
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,680
last tree.

2226
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:31,680
It was made by one guy who had a film background and he used, not not that one.

2227
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,680
It's really cool.

2228
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:37,680
He just, he's, he did like everything was models from the asset store that he modified.

2229
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:42,680
And he did the whole thing in using what's it called not, it wasn't both, which is what

2230
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,680
I'm assuming he was referring to with the visual scripting.

2231
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,680
He did it with playmaker, which is like an even simpler version, but not as extensible.

2232
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,680
So that's pretty cool.

2233
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,680
And that like that game sold like gangbusters.

2234
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,680
You made a ton of money off of that.

2235
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,680
So it's definitely doable, but I want to suffer.

2236
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,680
So I have to use a niche tool that doesn't feel bloated because those are things I care

2237
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,680
about apparently.

2238
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,680
Hell yeah.

2239
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,680
Wow.

2240
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,680
Plus, plus pythons easier to learn than C sharp.

2241
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:13,680
This, I mean, this doesn't look anything like, this doesn't look anything like a short

2242
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,680
one.

2243
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:15,680
Yeah.

2244
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,680
It's, it's a different aesthetic.

2245
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,680
Yeah.

2246
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,680
Right on.

2247
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,680
Okay.

2248
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,680
Sick.

2249
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,680
Next one is from God.

2250
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,680
I tapped, I tapped over.

2251
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,680
What was I thinking?

2252
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:30,680
Next one is from all pronouns are gender neutral in China.

2253
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,680
Wait, there it is.

2254
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,680
Okay.

2255
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:33,680
Okay.

2256
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,680
Three, two, one.

2257
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,680
Go.

2258
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:40,680
We can fix that.

2259
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,680
Be like me.

2260
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,680
Eat a bunch of mushrooms and embrace Xi Jinping thought.

2261
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,680
America's failing.

2262
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,680
China's limiting poverty.

2263
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,680
Planning trees.

2264
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,680
It's the future defect.

2265
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,680
America has nothing for you.

2266
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,680
Move to China.

2267
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,680
Teach English.

2268
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,680
It's the best.

2269
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:01,680
Is I Jen Guilos?

2270
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:04,680
Okay.

2271
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,680
Why are they?

2272
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:11,680
I mean, if China, if China is ascendant and is going to win, why do we even need?

2273
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:13,680
Yeah, what are they?

2274
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,680
No, that's not what I'm saying.

2275
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,680
I'm saying they don't need us to go there and speak English.

2276
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,680
We need to start teaching each other, each other, Chinese.

2277
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,680
I took Chinese in college.

2278
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,680
It was actually pretty cool.

2279
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,680
Did you?

2280
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,680
Yeah.

2281
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:25,680
I didn't know that.

2282
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:30,680
It was, I found it easier to learn than like other languages like Spanish and German,

2283
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,680
which I took before because it's, you don't have any.

2284
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,680
There's no like reference to English.

2285
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,680
Like when you look, when I look at like German or Spanish or something like that,

2286
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,680
my brain thinks of it in English terms.

2287
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:43,680
So when you look at Chinese, it doesn't, there's no frame of reference to English.

2288
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,680
So you just kind of engage it on its own terms.

2289
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,680
And I found it easier to learn for that reason.

2290
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:51,680
America is failing.

2291
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,680
China may well cannibalize us.

2292
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,680
I don't think that's a good thing.

2293
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:02,680
I don't think China is good.

2294
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,680
If China like fucking, okay, if that happens and like,

2295
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,680
if China like becomes the new dominant superpower,

2296
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:12,680
that means the one would replace the dollar as the, as like the world's reserve currency,

2297
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:16,680
which means all of our debt would like immediately like fuck us over.

2298
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,680
And we'd like fall into a massive recession.

2299
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:19,680
We'd all be fucked.

2300
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:21,680
Let's not do that.

2301
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,680
Wait, if the dollar became worthless,

2302
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:27,680
then wouldn't that just mean that like our debt was worthless?

2303
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:31,680
No, because we would still owe, we would still owe that money.

2304
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,680
To other, because we, from what I understand,

2305
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,680
like we owe debt not in like American dollars,

2306
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,680
but like we owe a certain value that like is like converted.

2307
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:47,680
Like we owe X amount of dollars to like China or other countries,

2308
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,680
but like as our currency of changes in value, that number would change.

2309
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,680
Oh, you mean the national debt?

2310
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,680
Yeah.

2311
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,680
We would be fine.

2312
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,680
Like me and you, we could just like, oh,

2313
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:59,680
I guess I just won't eat my slice of bread today and I'll pay off my student loans

2314
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,680
because we're all billionaires now because the currency is worthless.

2315
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,680
That would be pretty based, but that,

2316
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,680
that high would wear off pretty fucking quick.

2317
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:10,680
I don't understand anything.

2318
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,680
Me neither.

2319
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,680
I probably, everything I said was probably wrong.

2320
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,680
I can't wait for the voicemail next week when someone's like,

2321
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,680
hi, I'm like a fucking PhD in economics.

2322
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,680
Actually, the yuan is a notoriously inelastic currency

2323
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:24,680
and the United States dollar is robust and this that in the way is

2324
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,680
and what you just said never happened.

2325
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,680
I make podcasts on the internet.

2326
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:28,680
I admit that I'm stupid.

2327
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,680
Okay, I'm talking out of my ass.

2328
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:34,680
Imagine having technical knowledge in a subject

2329
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,680
and thinking that anyone gives a shit to hear what you have to say.

2330
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,680
No, listen to us.

2331
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,680
Listen to us.

2332
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,680
The podcast guys.

2333
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:46,680
The sad fact is more people will listen to us than the person with the knowledge.

2334
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,680
And for that, I'm sorry.

2335
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:51,680
Just, just like in Bitcoin, you got it on the ground floor.

2336
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,680
We established that base and now,

2337
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,680
and now it's just smooth sailing to the end of time

2338
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:00,680
because the currency of the future is posts

2339
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,680
and the ultimate form of posting is podcasting.

2340
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,680
The future currency is PS5s.

2341
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,680
Oof.

2342
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,680
Oof.

2343
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,680
Oh, no.

2344
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:15,680
Why was I trading in Bitcoin when I should have been storming the capital?

2345
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:19,680
Next one is called this is a really good idea.

2346
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,680
Three, two, one, go.

2347
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,680
It did you.

2348
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:28,680
I just had this really good idea.

2349
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,680
Nice.

2350
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:30,680
Okay.

2351
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,680
Why would you think Digi would be on though?

2352
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:36,680
Seems like you got to manage your expectations there.

2353
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,680
You got to send the voicemails to content if you want to talk to Digi.

2354
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:44,680
Unfortunately, Digi will never know what a great idea you had.

2355
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,680
Unlike the rest of us.

2356
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:51,680
Next one is called Apple's missing headphone.

2357
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:52,680
Jack.

2358
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,680
Three, two, oh God.

2359
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,680
Oh God, it's a minute 20.

2360
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:57,680
Christ.

2361
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,680
Three, two, one.

2362
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:00,680
No, wait, hold on.

2363
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,680
Before we even listen to this voicemail, I just got to say,

2364
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:07,680
listeners, voicemailers, if you think that you have a minute's worth

2365
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,680
of things to say that are worth listening to, you're wrong.

2366
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:12,680
I promise you, you do not.

2367
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:15,680
You are not worth listening to for an entire minute.

2368
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,680
Don't send long voicemails.

2369
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,680
We hate them.

2370
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,680
Anyway, let's listen, shall we?

2371
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:24,680
Three, two, one, go.

2372
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,680
Time and worms.

2373
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,680
Time and worms.

2374
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:28,680
Time and worms.

2375
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,680
Time and worms.

2376
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,680
Time and worms.

2377
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:33,680
Time and worms.

2378
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,680
Applejack.

2379
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:37,680
Worms and beetles and dirt and so on, death and hell and Satan.

2380
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,680
Heaven is not real, but hell is.

2381
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,680
Heaven is not real, but hell is.

2382
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,680
Outer space, outer space, outer space, outer space, outer space.

2383
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,680
Outer space is the place for me.

2384
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,680
Burying me under an outer space tree.

2385
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,680
Let me tell you a story about a skeleton.

2386
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:53,680
The skeleton was lonely so he adopted a puppy.

2387
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,680
The puppy is a metaphor for another skeleton.

2388
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,680
The skeleton is also you.

2389
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:58,680
Everything is bones.

2390
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:01,680
When your heart stops and your poop shoot loosens,

2391
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,680
corrosion begins.

2392
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,680
Bones become dust and meat becomes a nursery for maggots.

2393
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,680
To the maggots in the corpse, the corpse is the universe.

2394
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,680
To the worms in your casket, the casket is the cosmos.

2395
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,680
Heaven, can we be so sure about our reality?

2396
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,680
This message has been brought to you by Burger King.

2397
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,680
I love Burger King.

2398
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:21,680
I love skeletons and Burger King and Lucifer.

2399
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,680
I'm so excited to meet Lucifer in hell.

2400
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,680
Well, Ben, it's been a minute.

2401
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:25,680
What do you have to say?

2402
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,680
I was wrong.

2403
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:27,680
I was wrong.

2404
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:28,680
I can't wait to adopt a skeleton.

2405
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:30,680
This is my British voice.

2406
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,680
Feed me bangers and mash.

2407
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,680
You wanker.

2408
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,680
I'm deeply terrified of death.

2409
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:36,680
I think about death too much.

2410
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:37,680
Feed me death.

2411
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:38,680
Feed me death.

2412
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,680
Feed me death, you wanker.

2413
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:44,680
I can't wait to meet Justin Bieber in Burger King.

2414
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:50,680
I was wrong about everything.

2415
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,680
No, to be fair, none of our listeners said any of that.

2416
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:58,680
That was Applejack, which is a guest appearance and a totally different concept entirely.

2417
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,680
True.

2418
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:01,680
Also, that was scripted.

2419
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,680
That was scripted.

2420
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:06,680
If Applejack, if it had been one of the listeners, though,

2421
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:09,680
that would have been a voice grail for them.

2422
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:12,680
Unfortunately, Applejack gets the voice grail instead.

2423
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,680
Can we put Applejack in the voice grail?

2424
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,680
I think Applejack.

2425
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:15,680
I think we can.

2426
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,680
Okay.

2427
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,680
Applejack is right in the voice grail.

2428
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:18,680
I'm finding that Applejack and the rest of the main six

2429
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,680
weren't already in the voice grail by default.

2430
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,680
Okay.

2431
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,680
Okay, though.

2432
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:26,680
Was that a reference to something?

2433
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,680
I feel like it was.

2434
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:32,680
The thing about time and worms and soil and death and Satan,

2435
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,680
I know I've heard that somewhere before.

2436
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,680
That's a Jesse thing.

2437
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:38,680
Okay.

2438
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:39,680
I think.

2439
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,680
He might have copied it from somewhere else.

2440
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,680
I feel like, yeah, it was maybe in one of the...

2441
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:44,680
Like a horseshoe finale.

2442
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:45,680
Yeah.

2443
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,680
Yeah.

2444
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,680
God.

2445
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,680
But it was maybe somewhere else too.

2446
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:53,680
It was taken from somewhere.

2447
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:57,680
Time and worms and time and worms and death and soil and Satan.

2448
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,680
Yeah.

2449
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:04,680
Because that whole thing was not like from a horseshoe finale.

2450
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:05,680
No.

2451
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,680
So the rest of it was something else.

2452
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:09,680
Okay.

2453
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,680
Anyway, whatever.

2454
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,680
Either way, voice grail.

2455
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,680
Applejack.

2456
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:15,680
It's so nice to have some horse representation in the voice

2457
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,680
grail.

2458
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,680
It's a red letter day.

2459
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,680
Next one is called...

2460
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,680
Where is it?

2461
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,680
Here we go.

2462
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,680
Next one is called...

2463
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,680
She mentioned you...

2464
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,680
She's mentioned you like six times.

2465
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,680
Three, two, one, go.

2466
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:38,680
Hey, Ben, you should fuck Asterios Coconos' girlfriend.

2467
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,680
Okay.

2468
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:40,680
Repeat.

2469
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,680
Ben.

2470
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,680
Deal.

2471
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:47,680
You should fuck Asterios Coconos' girlfriend.

2472
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,680
Yeah.

2473
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,680
Or at least go on their show.

2474
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:51,680
Okay.

2475
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,680
You mean Serrancha.

2476
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,680
Okay.

2477
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,680
Okay.

2478
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:58,680
This is called...

2479
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,680
She's mentioned you like six times.

2480
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,680
I mean, like I've met her in person.

2481
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,680
I met her at BronyCon.

2482
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:07,680
And like we've talked before.

2483
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:12,680
So when you say she's mentioned me, I would like to know where specifically you mean.

2484
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,680
But like that sounds true.

2485
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,680
And I'm supposed to be on...

2486
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,680
I've been...

2487
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:21,680
Like I've been supposed to be on an episode of...

2488
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:22,680
What is it?

2489
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:23,680
They do...

2490
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,680
They do like a Kris Chan.

2491
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,680
They do like a Kris Teri podcast.

2492
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,680
I think it's just called Kris Teri.

2493
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:29,680
And I'm supposed to be on it.

2494
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,680
And I've been supposed to be on it for like a year.

2495
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,680
But it hasn't happened yet.

2496
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,680
But like I'm sure it will at some point.

2497
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,680
So...

2498
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,680
So there you go.

2499
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,680
Thanks for the tip.

2500
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:44,680
Cool.

2501
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,680
Okay, next lol.

01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,680
I'm here.

2505
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:52,680
I'm doing something funny.

2506
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,680
No.

2507
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,680
Watching Flexio5 again.

2508
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:00,680
Well then why am I not laughing?

2509
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:03,680
You'll laugh eventually.

2510
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:04,680
In voicemail though.

2511
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,680
In voicemail.

2512
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,680
Okay.

2517
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:19,680
Okay.

2518
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,680
Three, two, one, go.

2519
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,680
After your pizza is carded, you can go...

2520
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:27,680
Then take your pizza and put it down for a pizza.

2521
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,680
After you do that...

2522
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,680
I wanna make sure I cat out of it.

2523
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:45,680
Pache, I'm going to fucking kill you

2524
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:51,680
if you ever show your face around here again.

2525
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:54,680
Get the pizza now.

and I had to like look around my room.

2529
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,680
That actually like spooked me.

2530
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:07,680
I'm a little embarrassed to admit but it's true.

2531
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,680
But it's true and I'm all about that emotional honesty.

2532
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,680
It's all about the pizza.

2533
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:15,680
It's all about communication.

2534
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:18,680
It's all about letting your partner know how you're feeling

2535
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:22,680
and your feelings are valid.

2536
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:23,680

01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:20,960
listen to the committed suicide the and then he the production valley though yeah

2580
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,240
yeah it was like the Michael Bay voicemail you know I was going on but the

2581
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:33,840
production value is really good yeah and then like a minigun started firing it like

2582
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:38,560
any good piece of art it's open to interpretation I mean you can you can

2583
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:44,520
commit suicide and figure out yourself maybe that's something that happens maybe

2584
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,640
that's maybe it's a piece of art that's acting as asking a question as opposed to

2585
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:55,240
providing an answer yeah no it's not it's it asks a question and my answer is

2586
01:55:55,240 --> 01:56:07,480
voice jail I kid I kid next one is called Ben heads when Nate returns okay

2587
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,800
three two one go

2588
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:39,200
I don't like these they upset me those there's some weird vibes going on

2589
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:46,520
yeah okay I'm glad I'm not the only one that could have been like seven seconds

2590
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:53,160
and been funny but 23 seconds was was too long man I'm like shift I'm like

2591
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:58,680
shifting in my seat like yeah yeah okay all right now it's good no no the next

2592
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:04,960
one will be good I promise next one is called where is it here we go next one

2593
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:11,480
is called more like pootex face of poo champ oh we didn't talk about no the

2594
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:15,800
biggest the biggest story of the week was the downfall of gootex as pog champ

2595
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:20,400
oh that's true well we can talk about it after this voice mail I will did you see

2596
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:26,920
I actually watched the the Quentin reviews video about it it was what I

2597
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:31,040
just didn't expect there to be a video about it already but yeah it's it's

2598
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:35,240
surprising he's apparently he's been working on a gootex video for like

2599
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:40,080
weeks and like just so happened that like this thing with pog champ just

2600
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,600
happened now like by total coincidence which is like incredible timing if true

2601
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:48,440
oh my god bitcoins go to the moon bitcoins going to the moon to the moon

2602
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:55,480
386 34386 46386 50 it's like it's like more than halfway back up to where well

2603
01:57:55,480 --> 01:58:00,240
no that's not true well from today from today it's like almost halfway back up

2604
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:04,040
it's gonna be okay it's gonna be guys we're gonna be fine we're gonna make it

2605
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:10,000
we're gonna make it okay yes anyway more like pootex face of poo champ three

2606
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,920
two one go so I really hate when people signal boost Nazis and I don't

2607
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:18,720
understand how getting rid of pog champ from twitch is anything but that like

2608
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:24,200
Pog has become the most ubiquitous thing on the internet for like the past year

2609
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:28,760
or more I don't even I don't know for however long like everyone says Pog but

2610
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,920
you know gootex the face of Pog is orders of magnitude smaller like yeah so

2611
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:38,920
few people who use Pog actually know who he is or anything about him he doesn't

2612
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:42,600
even look like the same person he may as well not be the face of Pog so when

2613
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:47,240
twitch then says like oh we're gonna get rid of Pog champ because you know gootex

2614
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:51,000
said some stuff that was like sympathetic towards the domestic terrorists at

2615
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,920
the Capitol like I can understand the motivation there I can understand it but

2616
01:58:55,080 --> 01:59:02,360
all you've done is raise you signal boosted his like his message with the

2617
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:07,640
sheer ubiquity of Pog by set doing this and now we're gonna have the whole thing

2618
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:13,480
of like it kind of similar to Pepe where that was a dog whistle for as long as

2619
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,240
people continued to say and believe it was a dog whistle and people you know

2620
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:20,920
people on the all right did use it as a dog whistle and it's gonna be the same

2621
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:24,680
thing with Pog champ now but if you look at twitch now Pepe is

2622
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:29,160
ubiquitous again and no one cares no one says that it's racist like he's just

2623
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:32,440
fine no one gives a shit and it's gonna be the same thing with Pog champ he's

2624
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:36,680
just gonna come back in however many years so like why why what's the point

2625
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:39,960
of all this what is the point of all this all you've done is signal boosted a

2626
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:47,640
Nazi okay a couple couple point okay I understand I understand the point here

2627
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:57,400
I don't think I agree uh one I mean Pepe is a cartoon and like not a real person

2628
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:03,560
like Gutex is a real person who is like pro uh who is like pro maga insurrection

2629
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:09,480
uh uh that's that's different from like the image of Pepe which was which was

2630
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:16,760
co-opted by you know uh like the 4chan kekistan people but was not like there

2631
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:21,960
was nothing inherently political about it like originally I think I feel like yeah I

2632
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:29,320
feel like it's different um and the other thing is I I would I mean I I guess I can see what he's

2633
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:37,400
saying that like had twitch not removed the Pog um people would not have felt the need to like

2634
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:44,120
say what why Gutex who's that looks him up finds out I don't know whether that is like an argument

2635
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:50,760
that people will then become like if anything people will be against the insurrection more

2636
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:56,600
because Pog was deleted because of it because nobody would be happy that Pog is gone and if

2637
02:00:56,600 --> 02:01:01,880
it's Gutex's fault they'll hate Gutex I I don't know I don't feel like it's too much of like a

2638
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:09,880
a platforming of him I think in a in a way that no I mean I think in the short term yeah

2639
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:16,520
it has made some people be who who otherwise would have no idea be like wait the Pogchamp face

2640
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:22,760
is gone wait why oh because a guy named Gutex said something oh this guy Gutex was the Pogchamp guy

2641
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:27,880
okay well what did he say like what's I'm in the short term yeah I think that is you could maybe

2642
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:34,840
call that platforming him but I mean I think in the long term it's probably better to not have him

2643
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:41,160
be the face of this like thing that's very famous on twitch uh if you if if we're talking like okay

2644
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:46,840
sure you you can you can call that platforming him if you want by drawing attention by taking this

2645
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:53,080
action but like is it not platforming him to like make his face the face of this thing that

2646
02:01:53,080 --> 02:02:01,240
everyone knows I don't I don't I don't think that you can you don't like like yeah yes if

2647
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:06,440
the argument I feel like that I feel like I feel like that's a big thing yeah I feel like him

2648
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:11,720
keeping him as the Pogchamp guy is platforming him more I think so if the goal is to not platform him

2649
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:19,480
I feel like this is the right move I guess I just I would agree that nobody who looks at the Pogchamp

2650
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:27,000
face really gives a shit about finding out who it is at all yeah it's so much more like it's like

2651
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,560
say like nobody really cares who drew the troll face initially then nobody's looking that up

2652
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:39,400
yeah yeah I mean I don't know when it when it's a face of a real person though like an actual

2653
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:45,160
I guess I'm gonna be a little bit of an actual human's face I think that Quentin Quentin said

2654
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:50,360
something like basically we should just we should just keep using it in like a knot and like reclaim

2655
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:55,000
it I think he did say like the same way like we should reclaim it like we reclaim Pepe

2656
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:00,840
and we probably maybe maybe you're right maybe you're right that like the fact that it's his

2657
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:10,680
face doesn't actually matter um I don't know I think for Twitch in specific to make him not

2658
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:20,920
their Pogchamp face I think makes sense in broader terms in general maybe just continuing to use it

2659
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:26,600
and like not giving a shit who the what the guy is like is fine and the thing to do I don't know

2660
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:32,200
makes sense I agree with everyone maybe we're all right maybe we all win

2661
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:44,600
I'm we're alt right haha okay uh next one is called um emphasis on the poo

2662
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:51,560
three two one go although goo tax is the actual piece of shit here why am I why would I focus

2663
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:55,160
on twitch I mean they just wanted to distance themselves and that's perfectly fucking fine

2664
02:03:55,160 --> 02:04:02,680
so you know what I was wrong I'm stupid okay cool after all that uh I you know what appreciate

2665
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:10,120
I preach I'm not I'm not sure you were entirely wrong um but yeah okay I appreciate I appreciate

2666
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:14,680
the willingness to self-reflect and consider and consider and for change possibly change

2667
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:25,800
look at just use the the give and take Pog the brup because it's it's it's fun you're looking anyway

2668
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:28,440
true and it was Pog before Pog

2669
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:38,120
um I mean maybe maybe Pog needs to become more of like a diaspora like anything can be a Pog

2670
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:44,680
you know like any anyone making that face is a Pog face yeah there's not it's not just

2671
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:51,560
this is not just the one um oh my god if bitcoin hits 39 if bitcoin hits 39 again

2672
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:56,600
I will I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna clap I'm literally I'm literally gonna clap I will do it

2673
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:03,800
I will I will clap on on show don't think I won't do it uh next one is called um

2674
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:13,320
innocent android three two one go I hate the procrastinators podcast I fucking hate it

2675
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:19,400
I can't get through a single point without literally every single host constantly like

2676
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:31,000
try and jump on me and cannibalize my point to the point where it's unrecognizable

2677
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:40,760
uh oh I don't uh why are the voice mails cursed this week they are cursed

2678
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,720
and I don't I don't mean I there's a glitch there's a ghost in the shell there's a glitch in the system

2679
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:52,200
I'm I'm actually not sure what that one was saying that the we cannibalize their point what

2680
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:58,600
I don't know what does that mean oh maybe it's like maybe it's like the the voice mail is being

2681
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:04,360
said and we're talking over it while it's being said and then we miss it oh I don't know

2682
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:09,080
I don't fucking know I wasn't paying it I just was maybe maybe we talked over maybe we talked

2688
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:45,240
points about these people storming a governing building to show that he's satisfaction instead of

2689
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:50,360
looting their neighborhood zen setting fire to black owned business

2690
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:56,280
uh insurance he also pointed out how these people were made with much less violence

2691
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:02,200
than black lives matter protestants and that's why four of them are dead I I mean is he talking

2692
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:06,520
about me thank you for sharing your opinions man you are very insightful when we're informed and not

2693
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:12,280
just stuck in a social media free black bloop free black bloop is this guy serious I can't

2694
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:20,600
remember when you're accusing Biden of fraud when he fucked over bunny me neither uh Gib you're very

2695
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:28,360
brave to say normalize calling people morons when they support fucked up shit when the only chance

2696
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:34,920
we ever get to do that was when more logic was here and you just stayed silent you guys are very

2697
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:43,160
brave very stunning very talented smart funny young artists and I'm very lucky I did feel

2698
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:48,760
bad about how I did cool more logic in here you guys political commentary kept going that's what you

2699
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:54,200
guys should be dedicated in your time too this hey what was the first thing you said this is the

2700
02:07:54,200 --> 02:08:00,120
most cursed voicemail of all because it hurts my feelings what was the first point he had the first

2701
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:07,080
point was that Ben oh hold on it was it was a bunch it was that I okay he said the thing about oh

2702
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:12,920
people accused people accused uh uh the democrats of voter fraud when Bernie lost the primary

2703
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:21,240
which not not to the same extent a lot of great points about

2704
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:31,240
okay okay well he's he's okay his first one I completely disagree with he says that like oh

2705
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:36,680
ben saint you've made a lot of great points against basically he's he's drawing a comparison between

2706
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:43,320
these people storming the government building to to uh versus like blm like burn it's the stupid

2707
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:47,480
like oh they've burnt down cities shit okay I thought I thought he was saying that but I wasn't

2708
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:55,480
sure uh that's just completely stupid I've I if okay obviously this guy obviously this guy uh

2709
02:08:55,480 --> 02:09:00,360
follows our twitter's so if you've been following my twitter you've seen me retweet stuff that is

2710
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:04,680
like I'm not against like riots and I'm not against like storming buildings I'm not against

2711
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:11,000
direct action I just I think it's good when it's for good things like blm and fucking communism

2712
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:17,400
and bad when it's for bad things like fucking QAnon okay that's the difference that's the

2713
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:23,080
fucking difference it is really just as simple as that like the amount of buildings burned or like

2714
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:31,240
businesses like like the whole conversation about blm not being a good thing because some

2715
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:36,120
bad things happened in it like yes it's not good it's not good that someone's business was burned

2716
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:47,400
down in in in the chaos but the movement to like get black um like uh rights rights like rights

2717
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:54,760
rights on the same level right and and for and to like d d overreach and such like to make the police

2718
02:09:54,760 --> 02:10:02,280
less powerful and less like able to get away with fucking over black people like that's I've been

2719
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:07,560
very mad no I've been very measured on twitter I have not called out I did I did refer to them as

2720
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:13,800
terrorists one time but I was like sort of like half joking I have not been like oh these people are

2721
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:17,720
you know this this kind of thing is unacceptable like we need to have a crackdown we need to crack

2722
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:21,240
down on these people and send them all to jail I haven't been like that I've been like

2723
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:28,120
the this isn't this is a this is bad because it's I mean I definitely think they should get

2724
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:33,960
incarcerated for I mean in the same in kind of the same way in kind of the same way that like

2725
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:41,000
yeah I think it's bad that I think it's bad that twitter can just ban anyone from the discourse

2726
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:46,520
but it's not bad in particular that donald trump has been banned because like it's not like the rest

2727
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:52,440
of us aren't subject to that in the same way I think like no it's it's not great that like um you

2728
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:59,960
know the cops fucking shot that lady no I'm proud but it's but you know it's going to happen to

2729
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:04,520
ever if it's happening to everyone else like if other people get if people are getting shot for

2730
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:11,560
protesting well you know am I am I sad that it happened to you also not particularly that's my

2731
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:16,600
fucking feelings on that and was the other thing the voter fraud thing about biden okay people were

2732
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:21,800
talking about like the dominion machines and the Iowa caucus the Iowa caucus was a shit show

2733
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:27,240
there's videos of like the the fucking Iowa caucus being like really weirdly managed and like the

2734
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:31,720
rules to it are like esoteric and like deliberately hard to understand but there was not like a

2735
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:37,640
conspiracy on the level on the like it wasn't to the same level as like this whole the whole like

2736
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:42,520
stop the steal thing like it's really stupid it's just not even it's not even comparable

2737
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:47,880
so fuck you but thanks for following me on twitter though I love you

2738
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:54,440

2739
02:11:54,440 --> 02:12:01,880
more logic enough during at the time I'll give him that I I at least told him that his story was

2740
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:08,040
terrible you did I was I was a bit like god I didn't know this was gonna happen I wasn't prepared

2741
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:14,680

2745
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:38,520
catch us in like hypocrisy or something is this is it okay does this does this guy agree with us

2746
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:43,480
but just don't think we take it we go far enough or does this guy disagree with us and is like

2747
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:49,240

um and like there's a charge for of like 99 cents just like whatever oh my god so like

2774
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:48,760

2779
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:21,720

2780
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:27,400

2781
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:36,440
has grown or shrank um well it's grown what time did you buy it like like 15 20 minutes ago 50 oh that's

2782
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:44,280
you should you should have bought it give you should have bought it at uh uh uh at at 3 27

2783
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:51,800
p.m eastern standard time uh 20 minutes ago okay okay yeah yeah yeah there was a little jump

2784
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:56,920

2786
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:06,520
I'm looking I'm looking at the thing I'm looking at the thing yes yes okay good and I bought it at

2787
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:15,400
uh 9 59 p.m GMT so you don't have to change that oh oh you actually you at yeah yeah yeah okay like

2788
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:25,160
at 9 59 yeah at like at at uh at 10 o 3 at 10 o 3 it suddenly started jumping up and it went from

2789
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:32,120
like 379 up to 3 80 up to 3 88 yeah so that was actually a pretty good investment has already gone

2790
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:38,280
like one penny two penny three penny dude I got pennies more than I had before you've almost you've

2791
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:47,800
almost you've made back like three percent of the 99 pence three fucking feed to buy in so you know

2792
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:53,640
my my my strategy will be this I will come on the pcp I will listen to ben sainte scream about

2793
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:58,280
what is happening in bitcoin and then I will look so I don't actually have to look myself and then

2794
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:02,760
if it's a good time to sell I'll sell if it's a good time to buy I'll buy and then I'll continue

2795
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:08,920
like that just like two pounds at a time well I'll do a bigger one next time I just did this for

2796
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:13,480
the joke for the mean but like a few months all right well I hope so all right yeah buy buy and

2797
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:19,560
now buy and now when the value is high no it's uh when it's I'm gonna wait for it to crash again

2798
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:25,000
it'll never crash again this was the this was literally the last time it'll ever do I don't

2799
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:30,600
know I just need to I just need to hear for like the ben sainte cry the ben sainte scream and then

2800
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:38,120
probably okay now it's time to buy it did not it did not hit three oh wait no it did it did it

2801
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:44,680
just barely hit three nine sometimes it does this thing that like actually concerns me quite a bit

2802
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:50,040
where it like gets right to a milestone it gets right to like a like a something that ends with

2803
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:54,920
a few zeros and then it like stops there and I don't know why that happens and always makes me like

2804
02:19:54,920 --> 02:20:01,720
concerned it was it was right at three thirty nine k for like two minutes and then it dipped like

2805
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:09,720
down to like eight three eight eight okay enough enough of that um well shit guys this has been a
