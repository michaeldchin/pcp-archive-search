1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That son of a bitch.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay, so right now it starts.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now this is the official beginning of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,920
I am Ben Saint and I have to introduce myself because as who are these podcasts tells us

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,520
if you do not have a theme song and the hosts do not introduce themselves, that is a Cinema

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,920
Sins ding on your podcast because that's what podcasts are supposed to do.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,920
I have with me today a reborn pyro from Shreddit.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Hello.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,480
Hello everyone.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,920
And Advil also from Shreddit?

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
No.

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Advil from Advil.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Advil from Advil.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm sorry, excuse me.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Pardon me.

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Pardon.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,920
You guys want to introduce yourselves again for anyone who doesn't know?

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Yeah, so my name is Reborn Pyro.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,920
I am one of the four hosts of Shredditors along with Aspoy, Lumia, and Kai the Kitty Lewis.

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Yes, you were on one other time.

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
A few months ago, I think.

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
We make fun of Reddit and that's about it.

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
I mean, we have a new guest every week, a new wacky Zany guest.

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,920
It brings a lot of diversity to the table, unique thoughts, unique pallet of cringe,

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
and every week we tear into a new subreddit.

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Yes, I was on the one about the cheating, the r slash cheating subreddit about people

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,920
who are like, oh man, ever since I discovered cheating on my wife, my life has just been

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
so much cooler.

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Why didn't anyone think of this before?

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
The new meta unlocked.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Or that one lady who was like, I put an upside down pie up with my shopping cart.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Why am I not getting laid?

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Yeah, it's a universal symbol.

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,920
What was the other episode that I was on?

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Confessions.

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Just confessions in general?

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Yeah, where the guy had a dream about calling Obama the n-word.

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Wait, actually?

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Yeah, that one was like, he's like, hey guys, I'm like liberal, I swear.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,920
But I keep dreaming, having dreams where I call Obama the n-word.

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm not racist or anything.

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
What does this mean?

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
That guy needs to get off cod, I swear.

55
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,920
He needs something for sure.

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,920
It sounds like I'm implying something, but I genuinely don't know what it is.

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
A therapist?

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Perhaps, I mean, who among us couldn't use a little therapy once in a while?

59
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
That is 100% fair.

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Yeah.

61
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Yeah, so the shreddit, funny shit over there.

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
What's going on? What do we want to talk about?

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,920
What do we got on the docket to discuss this week for PCP stuff?

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
What do you guys want to talk about?

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I'll throw the ball to you.

66
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,920
We should let Advil introduce himself.

67
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Oh, did I not? Ah, shit, sorry.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
No, you're cool, man.

69
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm Advil.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
No, it's not okay.

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm so stupid.

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,920
That's what I thought.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
That's what I thought, yeah.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,920
No, I'm Advil, I make commentary-esque videos.

75
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,920
I like devolving into a topic that a lot of people have talked about or researched

76
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,920
and then just kind of finding out stuff about people who have a specific image.

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Okay, commentary, commentary, gotcha, gotcha.

78
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,920
My next video is about shreddits, so make sure to stay tuned.

79
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Are you going to roast shreddit?

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah, A, Reborn Pyro.

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Are you going to cancel Reborn Pyro?

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Oh no, oh no.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Yes, finally.

84
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Finally, someone's got to take him down a peg.

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
No.

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Pyro said you were like the social media manager?

87
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
No, that was Marin.

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Marin we were going to have on.

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Oh, yeah, you're right.

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Yeah, that's right, that's right.

91
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
We stole two employees from the PC.

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Marin was going to be on, but he couldn't make it.

93
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,920
We have stolen two employees from you.

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,920
We stole Nate's editor and we have stolen your Minecraft guy, Gitfuckdab.

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Nate's editor is no need, bro, right?

96
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Yes, he is also our editor.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Well, you know, fucking SaberSpark64 also stole Eleazar.

98
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Oh shit.

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:20,920
And the editing scene for YouTube channels that have PCP members on them

100
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,920
sure is just a big incestuous like everybody's fucking editing for everybody clusterfuckdab.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,920
You guys are the mob bus.

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,920
You just kind of disperse equally against like every YouTube channel out there.

103
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
I think so.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
It's like your people.

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,920
They had, yeah, the SaberSpark64 was getting edited by, it was Eleazar,

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,920
DuneCoon from the Proanon, KaijuCoon of being an artist fame,

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,920
and there's one other one.

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,920
I think there was another one who I'm forgetting, but it's another person who is in the sphere.

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I just thought it was really funny that they poached our editor.

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Oh, and I think maybe No Need Bro was the other one.

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Yeah.

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Fuck.

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Sorry.

114
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I lost the thread.

115
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
What's happening?

116
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Where am I?

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
All right.

118
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
So one of my shows called the PCP.

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Yeah.

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Yeah.

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,920
So we were talking about this before the episode started, but I just want to bring it back up.

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Oh yeah.

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Riley is a fucking coward.

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I do not give a shit.

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I made you delete your tweets, you little fucking rat goblin.

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Run to Trixie and tell her about how the big mean shred it made you delete everything.

127
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Fuck you.

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You fucking...

129
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,920
So he was...

130
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Let's back up a little bit.

131
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
All right.

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Let's give a little context for this.

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:03,920
This was in the fallout of Trixie's, I would say, instant classic post about her appearance on

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,920
The Who Are These Podcasts, in which she appears on the show to bring up the PCP.

135
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,920
They are very on procrastinator's podcast as a subject of ridicule and mockery, and

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,920
spends like 20 minutes, 20 plus minutes or so, trying to convince the hosts that like,

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
the PCP fucking sucks, man.

138
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:37,920
The PCP is fucking stupid as hell.

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,920
There's a lot of angles to this thing that happened.

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,920
There's the angle of the fact that even the hosts who seem to be friendly with her and

141
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:56,920
seem to know her from outside the show, even they don't seem impressed and at certain times

142
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,920
they just make fun of her and tell her like, you're not being funny, please be funnier.

143
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
God fucking imagine being told that.

144
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Complain funnier, quote, complain funnier was what he told her.

145
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Holy shit.

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Yeah.

147
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,920
He said, are you zugocking the podcast?

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,920
And I think zugock is a reference to some other guests that they had that everyone agreed

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,920
wasn't funny and just had an axe to grind.

150
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Are you zugocking the podcast?

151
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Please complain funnier.

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,920
And then there's the aspect of what she actually said.

153
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Her complaints were all like, they were all like extremely like minor and like huge reaches.

154
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Like she said like, Ben literally can't speak.

155
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
And like, okay.

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
And then you?

157
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't know.

158
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
I don't know anymore.

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
So confused.

160
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Advil, do you watch the PCP?

161
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
I mean, are you familiar at all?

162
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Yeah, I'm, I watched.

163
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,920
So I got, I got told that I was going to come on here.

164
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,920
And so I was like, okay, I'll just, I'll watch a few episodes while I'm editing.

165
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Okay.

166
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,920
And I watched, oh fuck, I completely forgot that guy's name, but I'll try to figure it out.

167
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
But yeah, I watched a few.

168
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Wait, which guy?

169
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
The, um, let me try to find it.

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I completely, I think I watched the fit emcee one.

171
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Oh, that's a pretty old one.

172
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Yeah, because I just really like fit.

173
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Oh, sure.

174
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Makes bangers.

175
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
But, uh, okay.

176
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I found it.

177
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I watched another one.

178
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I forgot, but yeah.

179
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Fair enough.

180
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Fair enough.

181
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Good shit.

182
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Thank you.

183
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Um, it's, uh, uh, what was it?

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
What was it going to say?

185
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Oh, yeah.

186
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Okay.

187
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,920
The, the other aspect was like that, like so many of the things that Trixie brings up

188
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,920
on who are these podcasts to like call us bad at are things that like notably she is worse

189
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
at than us.

190
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,920
For instance, there's a, there's much made about the fact that I joke about only reading

191
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,920
that Henry Kissinger book one page at a time while I'm shitting.

192
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,920
And she's like, Ben doesn't read.

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Ben doesn't know how to read books.

194
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,080
And then later on Gibb, we're talking about cowboy towns and like, where do people live

195
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,360
in the cowboy, in, in old Western cowboy towns?

196
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
And Trixie makes a big deal of like, why did they bring this up on the podcast without

197
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
reading a book?

198
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Why don't they just read a book about it?

199
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
Why wouldn't they read a book about it before they say something stupid when, you know,

200
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,360
like anyone who knows Trixie from, from, you know, a while back at least will remember

201
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,440
that like kind of a whole thing about her was that she refused to read books and that

202
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
she said like, I'll never read a book.

203
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
I just want a YouTube video to summarize it for me.

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,960
Oh, she forgot her character.

205
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Oh no.

206
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,760
Like everybody, like everybody knows, everybody who knows her knows that she is like that.

207
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,160
And yet here she is.

208
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,560
She says, okay, she brings up the old like, she brings up the old thing about like, haha,

209
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,920
everybody quit the, everybody quit the show because Ben and Gibb are such insane leftoids.

210
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,240
And like, she knows why she quit the podcast and she knows that it, that's not the reason.

211
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,280
But she's bringing it up as like a, I really think she's bringing that one up just because

212
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,760
she thinks these guys will not like that because these are like Dick show adjacent, like rightoid

213
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,720
libertarians or whatever.

214
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,560
And so, so there's all the, so there's like so many of the things she brings up are hypocritical,

215
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
which is very weird.

216
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,720
And then the last thing that's notable is she starts right off the bat with a, with a jab

217
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,160
at like Gibb's voice and how Gibb's voice like doesn't pass.

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,480
She says something like, or she, she says it doesn't pass.

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
She says something like, like, yeah, Gibb is a trans woman, though you'd never know from

220
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
her voice.

221
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,800
And she's like, chuckles about it.

222
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:59,520
And, and this, and that's another like one, why would you say that two, like glass houses,

223
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,800
three, fuck you.

224
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,320
And then on everybody, everybody noticed this on Twitter and everybody called her out and,

225
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,280
and she like, she couldn't keep her story straight.

226
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,680
Once sometimes she would say, oh no, I wasn't trying to be insulting.

227
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,160
No, that wasn't an insult.

228
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,280
That was just me clarifying.

229
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
So the host would know.

230
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,080
And then to other people who were like, that's a hurtful thing to say.

231
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,800
She said, no, no, no, I only meant, I only, I meant to hurt Gibb's feelings, but I only

232
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,960
meant to hurt Gibb's feelings.

233
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,560
If you're trans and like you, you were offended by that, like fuck you, like you don't get

234
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,440
to be offended because I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

235
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
I only meant to hurt Gibb's feelings.

236
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
So, you know, just lying about it on Twitter.

237
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,040
So basically she posts this, this podcast appearance on Twitter.

238
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Everybody dog piles her ratioed completely.

239
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,720
Gibb says like fuck you on Twitter and gets like 10 times the, the like ratio on her fuck

240
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,160
you reply.

241
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,800
It's a big, it's a big shit show.

242
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,980
So this, then this, this past week we recorded immediately I call an immediate emergency

243
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:10,220
bonus episode where we do the live, live, like line by line, listen and respond thing

244
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
with Simsie.

245
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,860
And we recorded that and we released it right away.

246
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,140
It's up on the, the Patreon right now.

247
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,020
So that was a very funny thing that happened this week.

248
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,940
And that is what sparked a bunch of arguments on Twitter, including the one between you

249
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
and Riley.

250
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,260
So that's, that's the background for why Riley and you were having a, a big, oh, because

251
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,540
you, right, because you went on Twitter and you said like, yeah, Trixie is no longer invited

252
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,780
on the, on the, on Treaded, which is very funny.

253
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Very, very funny.

254
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,300
And Riley was very upset.

255
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,980
This really ruffled Riley's feathers because if there's one thing, you know, his, his pride

256
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,700
as a, as a producer does not allow for any of his connections to like fall through upon

257
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,180
each other.

258
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,660
This is, this is, this is a big, a giant, a massive blow to his personal brand.

259
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,980
So for context, there, there is some deep lore here.

260
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Okay.

261
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:06,380
A few months ago, or actually almost a year ago now, we were approached by somebody with

262
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,220
a me, Barry Coffey company.

263
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,100
And they apparently had, they apparently had already sponsored Riley and YGG on some extent.

264
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:25,380
I don't know exactly, but they mentioned that, uh, I, yeah, I, um, I just, I just want to

265
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,460
say, I, I, uh, yeah, what could, I, how can I be delicate?

266
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,540
Um, I'm sure that, I'm sure that they said they did that.

267
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,300
Well, okay.

268
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,300
I was going to say that they said that, well, because I asked, you know, if you're sponsoring

269
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,620
them, have they ever heard of our show?

270
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,820
And they said, actually, you guys were one of the ones they suggested I reach out to.

271
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
So, okay.

272
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,260
So I was like, oh really?

273
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:59,860
They were like, yeah, um, uh, I guess you're actually the guys from Shreddit.

274
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,540
Um, cause originally I'd been told by Vale to reach out to them.

275
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,420
They were like, I'm surprised you guys reached out to me because I was going to reach out to you.

276
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,300
Um, that's very, that's very strange, actually.

277
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,580
That's very curious, but share.

278
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,860
Uh, so going by that, we've always kind of joked that, uh, you know, they, if they

279
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,660
suggested, uh, that person reach out to us and they must watch our show.

280
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,540
And so it was a funny meme, like, oh, you know what, Trixie's being a bitch on Twitter.

281
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,260
So, and on this, uh, on this guest appearance.

282
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,300
So, you know what I'm going to do?

283
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,260
I'm going to post on Twitter telling her she's never allowed on Shreddit.

284
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,820
Hmm.

285
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,540
It's, and I really liked it.

286
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,180
The funny, the funny thing about the fact that Riley, like, got really mad and

287
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,940
started, like, complaining at you about it is like, it literally, it had nothing to do with him.

288
00:15:59,540 --> 00:15:59,860
Yeah.

289
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:07,660
He, he, like, he was not involved at all, but he just had to be like an insult, like

290
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,780
any, an insult against Trixie is, is an insult against him in his mind for some

291
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,540
reason that I genuinely do not understand.

292
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:22,060
Um, I mean, dear God, it's so weird because he kept, you

293
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,780
know, trying to make it some kind of movement, like every other tweet saying

294
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,740
something like, you guys are all SJWs.

295
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,780
You're trying to censor free speech.

296
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,780
This is a movement.

297
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,060
And he kept going on and on about it.

298
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,900
And so I quote, he kept comparing it to like, like you guys also want to cancel

299
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,140
black comedians.

300
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,700
Yeah, like he kept, that's what you also want to do.

301
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,620
And it's the same thing.

302
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,500
When you say that Trixie making fun of a trans woman's voice and claiming it

303
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,380
doesn't pass and laughing at it is transphobic.

304
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,980
What you're basically doing is saying that like black comedians like Dave

305
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,700
Chappelle shouldn't be allowed to have to be, to work in this town ever again.

306
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,460
Yeah, I mean, what is that comparison?

307
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,500
I don't know.

308
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,380
It's fucking stupid.

309
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,740
That's the biggest leave I've ever heard.

310
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,740
Like, I know what he means, but it's fucking dumb.

311
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,740
And it's, it's dumb.

312
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,140
I think in specific context, that argument can be like good.

313
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,620
But the context of, hey, this, I mean, I'm going to be a little

314
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,780
transphobic and say that this trans person doesn't sound like a woman.

315
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,900
Yeah.

316
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,580
Is, and then when you get called out for it, well, actually you're racist.

317
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,940
So, I mean, it's, it's basic.

318
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,980
I mean, yeah, like it's the fact that he, the fact that he's bringing it.

319
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,860
Like nobody, nobody mentioned that.

320
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,180
Nobody was talking about that.

321
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,020
It's basically a completely separate issue, but he brings it up as like,

322
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,860
you are also responsible for this other thing.

323
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,540
Yeah, it's like his trap card.

324
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,420
No, you found their trap card.

325
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,380
So, so what I ended up doing is I quote, tweeted him saying that it was

326
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,820
a big free speech movement with a screenshot from one punch man where

327
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,220
Satama says, here's a guy with free time and he's holding a letter.

328
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,660
Classic reaction, classic reaction.

329
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,620
And I was like, you know, no one's ever brought up a movement or free speech.

330
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,500
We're a show that makes fun of Reddit.

331
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,540
Trying to make us political with something is a very Reddit thing to do.

332
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,300
Right.

333
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,860
And then after that, he just deleted a lot of the political tweets.

334
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,940
His, yeah, his political takes in that thread were very cringe.

335
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,140
I will say, I will say this.

336
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,140
He seemed very caught up.

337
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,060
He seemed very caught up with the idea that it is like insane, like insane

338
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,100
in his mind to suggest that a trans person could ever be transphobic.

339
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,380
Like the very, the very idea of that like completely defeats itself in his mind.

340
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,780
It's a total contradiction.

341
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,740
Say, you know, same.

342
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,180
I mean, I don't do I have to explain how like that's fucking stupid.

343
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:02,380
I mean, like, of course, anyone can be anything no matter what, you know,

344
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,820
follow your dreams.

345
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,900
If you want to be a big anyone can do yeah, you can do it.

346
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,900
Hey, if I can do it, anyone can.

347
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
You want to make fun of trans people, go for it.

348
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,620
That's going to get me canceled.

349
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Oh, yeah, you're out.

350
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,500
Please, not again.

351
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,180
Yeah.

352
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,100
So that was the that was that story.

353
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,060
That was the big funny drama that happened on Twitter this week.

354
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,300
Stay, stay tuned for more.

355
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,260
We're just just just really funny seeing her post that and just get completely

356
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:45,540
ratio on Twitter literally just made us money because we turned it into a bonus

357
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
episode and a bunch of people pledged.

358
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,780
If you if you pledge to hear that our response to that, thank you very much.

359
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,660
And I hope you enjoyed it was a fun.

360
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,340
It was a fun to record that I went into I went into it.

361
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,740
I deliberately avoided listening to it so that I would not have heard it when we

362
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,460
did the bonus episodes, why but have a fresh reaction.

363
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,500
I'd be hearing everything for the very first time.

364
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,220
I was I was pretty pretty baffled by some of like the weird like the weird

365
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,380
stretches and the weird like she knows this isn't true, but she's saying it

366
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,060
anyway, because she knows these podcast hosts don't know us and she can get away

367
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,300
with like pretending that she thinks it's true about us.

368
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,980
Like set like saying like saying that like I would that like I would like

369
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,940
freeze up and like not be able to function if someone like approached

370
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,140
me in public and talk to me as you know, like that's that's yep.

371
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,500
That's me, I guess.

372
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,660
Anyway, good, good, good times.

373
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,020
Yeah, good times this week.

374
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,740
Great times.

375
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,020
Yeah.

376
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,220
So OK, OK, OK.

377
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,140
The reason why we're on.

378
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,660
Have you seen the Antunes video?

379
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,500
Oh, no, I didn't.

380
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,700
You posted for me.

381
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,660
I didn't get around to watching it.

382
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,540
OK, I do know who Antunes is.

383
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,740
All right, that's that is a perfect jumping off point, though, like knowing who he is.

384
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,660
Let me I talked to a few about the syndiems, but you don't have any

385
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,460
memories about someone named Daft Pina being in the PCP fan community, right?

386
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,540
No, no, I I may have heard the name Daft Pina around somewhere,

387
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,100
but I know that I know I think the first time I heard of him was when you had

388
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,300
some falling out with him or something like that.

389
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,780
That's why.

390
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:40,340
So the reason why they bring that up, there was a old tweet that I found

391
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,180
it's deleted now, but it was him posting a picture of an airport and saying

392
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,900
I wish I was landing for Radcon and I don't remember who we tagged.

393
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,620
But I know we tagged like two or three members of the PCP in it.

394
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,580
Mm hmm.

395
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,220
And wait, wait, wait, what was the tweet that he tagged some of us in?

396
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,420
He said he took a picture of an airport and he said I was I wish I was landing for Radcon.

397
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,220
You know, like you want to know this.

398
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,020
I think it was multiple years ago, like it wasn't a recent tweet.

399
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,020
OK, so so so Daft Pina is familiar with Radcon.

400
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,820
That's pretty funny.

401
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:26,220
Um, it's also funny that he used to be a fan of old school PCP back when it was a lot edgier.

402
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,620
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,420
Oh, man, do you think he's a do you think he's a Yig head?

404
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,820
Oh, I hope not.

405
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,220
There's no there's no way.

406
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,820
There's like there's no way there's like there's like six.

407
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,820
There's like six real Yig heads and they're all like and they're all like very

408
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,220
like obviously insane and mentally ill on Twitter.

409
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,420
Lamal, that's right for you, but to tell to tell what's going on here.

410
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,620
I got into a little squabble with Mr.

411
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Penis. I'm sorry, Mr. Pina.

412
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Pina.

413
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,220
Gotcha. OK.

414
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,340
So basically, he made a video on a theory on art.

415
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,580
And at the time, I thought the video did a good job.

416
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,700
Can you explain who a theory on art is?

417
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,580
A theory on art is a very big Twitter artist.

418
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,100
He is very good art. OK.

419
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,300
He has been on my show, Shreddit, three times, not since the video, of course.

420
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,380
But, you know, at the time there came out of video canceling them for saying,

421
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,740
you know, racial slurs and the F slur and all this.

422
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,940
OK. At the time, I thought, you know, the video was good.

423
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,900
It canceled a bigot.

424
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,140
Um, OK.

425
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,140
But the issue is he used clips from Shreddit three times in a show,

426
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,500
which is fine credit them, right?

427
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,300
Well, the first two, he cut off our names so you couldn't see whose videos it was.

428
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,060
And then and then the third time he called us the r slash podcast.

429
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,660
And that's funny because that's not a very popular podcast.

430
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,220
That feels more like a jab than a credit

431
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,900
because the r slash podcast is just a text to speech robot reading reddit post.

432
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,620
Hmm. Well, why would he do that?

433
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,580
I don't know.

434
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,820
I politely asked in a server and he says,

435
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,420
well, in the third time I show, you know, a clip from your show,

436
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,900
the name is in the bottom.

437
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,980
I don't care that I miscredited it.

438
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,460
I just, you know, if people really want to find you, they can.

439
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
OK.

440
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,100
And it's like, well, OK, so I understand what you're saying,

441
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,420
but you've made several videos calling out artists for tracing

442
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,980
and, you know, not crediting their work.

443
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,220
OK. OK.

444
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,620
So you feel you feel you were improperly credited.

445
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,260
Well, I mean, we got called the wrong name.

446
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,460
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,260
And I mean, yeah, it sounds like he just he sounds like he just fucked up

448
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,620
and then wouldn't admit it.

449
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,020
Yeah, especially for like a 200 sub channel, you know, show or whatever.

450
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,340
Having someone because he has over 100,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel

451
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,780
and the theory on video got over well over the like amount of

452
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,140
like subscribers he has.

453
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,100
It has like 200,000 now.

454
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,140
And there's like a bunch of videos about a theory on, et cetera.

455
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,380
And having like that, like if he went, by the way,

456
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,020
like if you at least just put in the description,

457
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,100
it would just help at least like a little bit gain a bigger audience.

458
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,540
You know? Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,740
I mean, of course.

460
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,460
No, I think I think there's merit to what you're saying.

461
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,540
He gets worse, though.

462
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,140
Yeah.

463
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,540
So a history of like not not crediting

464
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,020
anyone in his videos.

465
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,860
The most he does is credit the the people that

466
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,620
like voice at like, you know, retweets or whatever at the end of the video.

467
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,260
He like does that, but he doesn't credit any of his sources.

468
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,300
He doesn't like give like full context

469
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,060
interviews to like whenever he interviews someone.

470
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,020
So it's purely just his word against, you know,

471
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,900
it's just his word against the viewers, you know,

472
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,340
it's his word against everyone else's and he goes off like,

473
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,980
you know, his his fans believing whatever it is.

474
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,060
Yeah. I mean, sure.

475
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,780
I don't make sense.

476
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,980
But like I was saying, so, you know, I was very polite.

477
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,140
I was very professional.

478
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,060
I was like, listen, you know, you call artists out for this.

479
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,620
I understand that, you know, you might be busy.

480
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,140
But if you could just, you know, please credit me, right?

481
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,780
And then I get a ban warning from his discord server for that.

482
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,900
Like super nice, super professional.

483
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,540
Um, OK, so then I start talking

484
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,660
because people in a server start reaching out to me.

485
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,340
I start talking with them.

486
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,740
And did I get another warning?

487
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,900
And the second warning reads like a schizo

488
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
post and it's full of misspellings.

489
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,740
From from who?

490
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,300
From Pina.

491
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,940
Because he has a he types out messages for a bot to DM people.

492
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,540
And the reason why I know he typed this out

493
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,460
is there are multiple misspellings.

494
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,340
He types out messages for a bot to DM people.

495
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,020
Like, like whenever you do something,

496
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,540
you can get a message in your DMs.

497
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,540
Oh, yeah, you broke rule number one, two, et cetera.

498
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,100
And then it gets like a very vague reasoning.

499
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,820
Gotcha, gotcha.

500
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,820
All right.

501
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,740
OK, and here I'm pulling it up.

502
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,420
OK, yeah.

503
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,820
And the second the first warning

504
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,740
was for asking him a second time in VC, you know,

505
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,300
just trying to have a back and forth conversation about,

506
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,420
hey, you know, it's really not cool of you specifically

507
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,660
to not credit people.

508
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,500
Um, but the second warning was you were warned

509
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,180
in armchair critics for you were warned

510
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,380
because you were persistently in violation of the rules.

511
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,980
You were not threatened with a ban.

512
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,500
Past being warned, you continued to instigate arguments

513
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,620
and use mistrust and attempt to rally members of this server.

514
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,020
And he spelled this wrong.

515
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,940
The feature creator, Daft, address your question in Q&A

516
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,340
and past his response, you have continued to instigate

517
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,300
and falsify the situation.

518
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,940
How is asking to be credited at instigating

519
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,700
and falsifying a situation like it's not complicated?

520
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,740
It sounds like he's just mad.

521
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,140
It sounds like he's just mad.

522
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,300
It's just big mad.

523
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,980
As you stated before, you were simply asking Daft

524
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,020
to credit you, yet you are now claiming Daft

525
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,180
with stealing assets and refusing to credit.

526
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,220
Well, he did play.

527
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,500
I mean, those are the same thing.

528
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,540
Those are the same thing.

529
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,860
Yes, and he did straight up refuse to credit me.

530
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,980
Like...

531
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,820
Yeah.

532
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,620
Yeah, get your story straight.

533
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,140
You say he refused, he took your content without crediting,

534
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,620
but now you're saying that he took your content

535
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,460
without crediting?

536
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,300
Oh, no.

537
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,140
Okay, I see.

538
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,740
And the funny part was before I got this,

539
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,260
I have an app called Better Discord.

540
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,340
I can see hidden voice channels that the public can not.

541
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,420
I can't see into locked text chats,

542
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
but I can see who's in calls

543
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,860
and what the chat rooms are called.

544
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,780
Okay.

545
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,660
He had, at the time, a PR manager.

546
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,260
Him and that PR manager were in call for four hours

547
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,780
before I got the second warning,

548
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,180
and then the second I got it, they both left call.

549
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I have confirmed with the old PR agent

550
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,540
that the entire four hours was discussing

551
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,740
how to handle this.

552
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,420
Why does it take four hours to discuss

553
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,220
if you should credit somebody or not?

554
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,100
I see.

555
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,060
To give context, it's not like 100% certain

556
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,780
that it was the PR manager.

557
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,140
It was, well, no, no, it was the head moderator,

558
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,140
but they claimed that the PR manager bit was just a joke,

559
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
but also, who knows?

560
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,180
Yeah.

561
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,020
Okay.

562
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,060
Either one works.

563
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,620
All right, so, so.

564
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,460
It's still not good.

565
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,980
All right, so it sounds like a weird stupid shit fit

566
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,660
and he threw a tantrum and gave you some weird

567
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,180
fucking bullshit about some legalese nonsense

568
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,540
because you wanted to be credited,

569
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,780
and he was like, well, actually,

570
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,820
here's why I shouldn't have to do that and fuck you.

571
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,700
Whatever, he flipped out about the fucking stupid shit

572
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,620
that he should just say sorry for and fix.

573
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,820
That was it for my end.

574
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,820
I mean, I made a tweet on Twitter

575
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,900
because I thought it was really messed up.

576
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,380
Yeah.

577
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,940
The reason why I said I used to agree with his video

578
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,260
on Ethereum is Ethereum actually,

579
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,860
he came out as a black gay man,

580
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,500
and he says that he has the right to use those slurs,

581
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,020
how he sees fit.

582
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,860
Wait, wait, wait.

583
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,740
Ethereum did?

584
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,940
Yes, Ethereum is.

585
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,060
Oh, that's right, that's right.

586
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,140
Oh, that was the guy who was like.

587
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,980
Yeah.

588
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,500
Yes, I'm black and gay, so it's okay.

589
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,300
And he said that, and nobody knew that before.

590
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,340
Was he lying about that?

591
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,540
No, no, everyone was like,

592
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,940
he said, by the way, I'm gay and black, Lil.

593
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,420
And everyone was like, cap, cap, you can't be black, cap.

594
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,500
Yeah, Defpina posted the meme of why would someone

595
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,220
go on the internet and just tell lies.

596
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,060
Yeah.

597
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,660
And then Ethereum posted a video of himself.

598
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,340
Being black and having sex with another man.

599
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,180
Well, anyone that's known,

600
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,940
anyone that's known Aether for a very long time knows

601
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,900
that if you bring up feminine men in the call,

602
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,860
he will go off on rants about how much he loves feminine men.

603
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,220
The homosexual part was never in doubt,

604
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,140
but nobody knew that he was black.

605
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,900
Yeah, okay.

606
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,700
He's posted like a lot of videos of him

607
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,660
like going through his old notebooks and stuff,

608
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,340
like where you could just see his hand flipping through pages,

609
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,900
unless he just has like an incredible budget for like,

610
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,420
faking truths, I'm pretty sure he's black.

611
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,260
Jesus.

612
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,180
Okay, all right, understood, understood.

613
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,020
Yeah.

614
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,020
So, okay, I think I understand all of this crap that happens.

615
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,580
So where does it stand now?

616
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,980
Did Defpina eventually just like say fuck you,

617
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,380
get out of my server and that's it?

618
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,140
He actually did because, okay,

619
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,700
so behind the scenes for the last month,

620
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,860
there have been a lot of people collaborating

621
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,900
on anti-pina projects, let's say.

622
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,220
Advil here is one of the ones-

623
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

624
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,300
Defpina, I want to say, okay,

625
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,940
the one thing I did see of Defpina was,

626
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,860
you remember Cheezy's big Twitter artist

627
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,740
who follows you tweets about,

628
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,180
you know, those comics about like,

629
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,260
when big Twitter artists like your tweet

630
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,540
don't give you the retweet boost, right?

631
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,380
Yeah.

632
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,220
Yeah, I remember-

633
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,820
Oh, he's had a fuck going, actually.

634
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,540
Defpina was one of the guys,

635
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,020
was one of the big people on Twitter who replied,

636
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,740
this is, actually, nobody owes you a retweet

637
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,860
and you just look petty

638
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,700
and it's just going to ruin your reputation

639
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,940
if you just complain about people not retweeting you.

640
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,940
And it was one of those,

641
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,100
it was one of the loser responses from someone who is big

642
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,380
being like, I hate when people,

643
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,820
I hate when people want anything from me.

644
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,940
I hate when smaller content want a boost.

645
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
Just get better at all.

646
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,620
There were many cringe responses to that,

647
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,740
but that particular one of being a big artist

648
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,340
and being like, you shouldn't expect anything from me,

649
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,620
peasants, was like one of the more cringe ones

650
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,740
and he did it, so that did not leave a good impression

651
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,820
in my eyes.

652
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,720
So, okay, that's my context.

653
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,460
Continue.

654
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,300
So, yeah, a lot of people reached out.

655
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,540
Antunes is one of them.

656
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,300
Antunes had a lot of personal beef with Daft.

657
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,620
Oh, well, Antunes is much worse.

658
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,740
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

659
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,700
So, a lot of their beef response comes down to

660
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,740
pettiness, like Daft refusing to give him the recording

661
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,660
he made of Antunes in their interview

662
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,260
and just a bunch of stuff like that

663
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,900
because he was interviewed for the video,

664
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,500
he did know about it, but it's the way Daft handled it.

665
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,340
For which video?

666
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,540
For the Antunes video?

667
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,780
Yeah, he made a video on Antunes.

668
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
Okay.

669
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,460
And he recorded-

670
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,700
I mean, fuck it, fuck Antunes.

671
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,740
Nothing, no treatment is too bad for Antunes.

672
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,460
Regardless of how you think of Antunes,

673
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,500
I still think his handling of the whole situation

674
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,180
was not the best because he-

675
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,020
Doubt.

676
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,860
He doubted.

677
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,700
No, no, no, no, no, no.

678
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,740
There's nothing you could do to Antunes

679
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,580
that I'd be like, ooh, he didn't deserve that.

680
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,340
Not on like an Antunes personal level,

681
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,580
like I don't care how you feel about any of the people

682
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,460
I'm making my video with or like on or whatever,

683
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,940
but going like-

684
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,780
Are you making videos?

685
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,860
Are you working with Antunes?

686
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,060
I asked him for an interview and that was really it.

687
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,900
I asked him for information.

688
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,500
Okay, okay, I mean, that's one thing.

689
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,340
But like, is it technically working with?

690
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,140
I can never say that.

691
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,980
Okay.

692
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,380
No, interviewing someone is not working.

693
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,740
No, it's not unless you're like both making money off of it.

694
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,820
Okay, then yeah, I'm not gonna make money off the shit,

695
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,620
but the, I feel like from like a general creator sense,

696
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,180
I don't know if I just have like this self-righteous

697
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,380
like belief on how a commentary YouTuber should handle it,

698
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,740
but it seems like even though Daft tries to stir away

699
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,820
from the commentary spectrum,

700
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,420
even though he's collabed with the right opinion

701
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,220
and Turkey Tom, the way he handles himself,

702
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,500
like online and on his own channel,

703
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,060
even is very unbecoming of a commentary YouTuber.

704
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,660
He's very sensitive.

705
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,980
He doesn't work.

706
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,740
He's very, he's besmirching the good name

707
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,700
of commentary YouTubers across the board.

708
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
He is tarnishing.

709
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
We have standards, dammit.

710
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,580
Well, I feel like there should be.

711
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,260
I feel like a lot of times commentary channels

712
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,780
just like, they're just so fucking stupid sometimes.

713
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,620
Of course.

714
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,900
I don't wanna be like the police of YouTube

715
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,740
because that's cringe as shit.

716
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,420
But like, I feel like it should be more like journalism

717
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,820
instead of like just talking shit about someone

718
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,180
and ruining like their reputation

719
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,780
without any actual evidence

720
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,220
or even like giving them a chance to defend themselves

721
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,120
or giving them a fair like trial, you know?

722
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,900
That's how I feel about commentary.

723
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,940
I think, ah.

724
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,580
I'd rather talk like, like if I'm gonna make a video.

725
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,060
I don't know if I entirely agree with you.

726
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,740
I don't know if I entirely disagree with you either.

727
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,580
I mean.

728
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,540
At least the way I wanna make my commentary videos

729
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,460
is I wanna find a topic that is either like unknown

730
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,940
and see how truly deplorable it is

731
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,780
and talk to as many people as the other side

732
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,940
and on the side that's like talking shit about them

733
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,220
and see what the truth is

734
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,020
because both sides gonna fucking like,

735
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,460
like, you know, be completely unfair to the other side,

736
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,540
you know?

737
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,380
And, and-

738
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,220
Yeah, sure.

739
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,420
And what people like Daph will do,

740
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,860
they'll like talk to one person on the other side

741
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,220
and completely cut out any context that they had

742
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,060
to make it a fair, you know, video or a fair anything.

743
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,460
And he doesn't even like cite his sources for why,

744
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,420
like, he won't even like put, he has a second channel

745
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,180
and he won't even put like a full interview on there,

746
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,380
which is something that like, like a technicals does.

747
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,980
Like, I feel like that is a very good,

748
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,380
like just like a safe thing to do.

749
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,580
And he doesn't even do the most bare bones commentary thing

750
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,220
is, do you watch commentary at all?

751
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
What?

752
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,660
Do you watch like commentary videos at all?

753
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,540
Uh, I mean, I give me, what's an example?

754
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,500
Like Turkey Tom, Leafy, those types of people.

755
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,700
I have probably seen a few,

756
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,140
but I don't like regularly watch them or anything.

757
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,940
So the most bare bones thing you can do

758
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,780
is just put a disclaimer at the beginning,

759
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,020
which is, hey, don't harass these people.

760
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,380
This is just either my opinion

761
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,500
or I'm just giving you like the facts,

762
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,780
but don't harass these people.

763
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,260
He's never done that in a single video,

764
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,780
not in a single tweet.

765
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,460
He hasn't said that like in his YouTube description.

766
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,500
So it's very just like unspoked, you know?

767
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,460
You think, okay.

768
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,300
You think that Daph Pina,

769
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,980
you think that his conduct is unbecoming.

770
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,060
Yes, exactly.

771
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,740
Of the honorable title of commentary YouTuber.

772
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Yeah, it's a nightly manner of being a commentator.

773
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,100
I kind of get what you're saying.

774
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,060
I get what you're saying.

775
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,900
I get what you're saying.

776
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,580
I guess because I grew up on commentary,

777
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
I just have like this nice image of it,

778
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,660
because I know it is pretty dog shit to be honest.

779
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,140
Like I know like it is probably the most cancer part

780
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,420
of the entire internet, but I just-

781
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,620
I don't know about that.

782
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,460
Oh yeah, true.

783
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,700
But like I just want it to be like,

784
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,700
I want it to be as fair as it can be to, you know.

785
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,940
That's, okay, yeah.

786
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,460
I mean, fairness is good.

787
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,660
Fairness is good.

788
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,900
And I understand what you're saying.

789
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,660
I mean, yeah, if you've got two sides of a story,

790
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,900
yeah, both sides of any story

791
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,860
always claim something different.

792
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,420
And so like the best way to do it is to get both

793
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,260
and then try and figure out like who is lying about what,

794
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,140
who is being honest about what,

795
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,660
what is the real story?

796
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,180
Because it's usually somewhere in the middle.

797
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,020
Yeah, yeah.

798
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,180
And like generally the more people you ask about something,

799
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,540
usually you can kind of suss out the truth

800
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,660
if you get enough different people to explain it to you

801
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,940
and you kind of like pick out the commonalities.

802
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,860
So I, I have, yeah, that's, that's good.

803
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,260
I get you, I get you.

804
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,660
You don't, and you don't think Daft does that.

805
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,020
The most he does is allow, so I grew up, or not grew up,

806
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,900
but I used to watch a lot of Daft Pina

807
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,820
while I was trying to figure out my style.

808
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,140
And I was like, yeah, this guy's,

809
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,980
this guy's pretty cool.

810
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,860
Cause I never seen like a lot of commentary YouTubers

811
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,980
like give interviews to, you know, people.

812
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,260
And he was like the first guy, I saw that I would do that.

813
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,860
But then, and then I started to research it a little bit more

814
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,740
and he didn't like include the full context.

815
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,860
So he would just like cut out context.

816
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,660
He would like change it to fit a narrative,

817
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,460
which is fine, I guess, but like if you're,

818
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,540
if you're going through all the trouble of create,

819
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,420
like going to have a interview with someone

820
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,220
and going to cut context,

821
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,420
at least use the entire interview on something.

822
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,900
Cause no one's going to like check the original interview.

823
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,180
Okay. Yeah.

824
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,860
I feel you.

825
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,220
Yeah, I feel you.

826
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,740
If I felt like someone was like deliberately leaving stuff out,

827
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,540
as they're trying to explain something to me,

828
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,620
I'd be like, well, well, fuck you.

829
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,500
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

830
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,860
But I mean, I was saying before a lot of people

831
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,020
reached out to me and shredded in general

832
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,340
to ask us about what happened there.

833
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,220
Multiple people wanted the story.

834
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,380
Antunes included because Antunes was a,

835
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,620
Antunes has a personal grudge with Pina.

836
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,300
I'm sure, I'm sure he does.

837
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,140
I'm sure he does.

838
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,100
But Pina has made a very large amount of enemies

839
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,060
and I didn't know that cause I knew nothing about Pina

840
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,900
prior to this.

841
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,020
To me, it was just some guy who stole my content.

842
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,860
Now I have a lot of people reaching out to me

843
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,820
because apparently he tends to step on a lot of people's

844
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,660
toes.

845
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,980
Sure.

846
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Like a good example recently is his fight with Tina Fey

847
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,820
on Twitter, who was an artist that was pretending

848
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,220
to be female.

849
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,780
Oh yeah, okay.

850
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,100
Not Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live.

851
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,940
Yeah.

852
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,260
No, no, not that Tina Fey.

853
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,740
Okay.

854
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,100
That would be funny.

855
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,020
But so he was basically saying,

856
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
I know you're a dude.

857
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,300
I have your Facebook.

858
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,340
I sent you a friend request.

859
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,820
And then he said later, I had people email me

860
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,740
your information.

861
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,220
So he has people that email him the docs

862
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,260
of people he has beef with.

863
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,460
Well, what happened is he,

864
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,420
so he tweeted out that he's working on a video

865
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,660
on Tina Fey, right?

866
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,660
And what happened is he included an email

867
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,180
that was like, if you know any information

868
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,220
about this person, please let me know.

869
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,540
And so people were emailing him and some,

870
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,780
like a group of people, I guess,

871
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,420
were emailing Tina Fey's docs,

872
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,340
like their name, their face, all that stuff, right?

873
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,380
Yeah, but he didn't condone that.

874
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,820
I mean, he didn't condone that, he condoned it.

875
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,900
Instead of being like, what the fuck?

876
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,740
Why would you give me this?

877
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,540
This video isn't about their docs.

878
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,340
He was like, really, send me more.

879
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,260
I need to know who this person is.

880
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,460
Okay.

881
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,180
It was just a very uncomfortable situation.

882
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,700
And he made it worse by tweeting at Tina Fey,

883
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,500
like in an unhinged rant, or not even a rant,

884
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,100
just tweeting at them, like unhinged being like,

885
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,020
hey, I've gotten private information.

886
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,740
Tina was kind of like taunting him and being like,

887
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,380
you're cutting out context.

888
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,740
We should get a call, bro, and we can discuss this.

889
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,460
And Daft tweeted it, and was like,

890
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,900
yeah, I found your personal information.

891
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,460
I hacked your Google accounts.

892
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,780
Let's talk, bro.

893
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,300
Follow me on Twitter at my Discord.

894
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,780
That reminds me of someone.

895
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,060
Did somebody else do that?

896
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,100
Did somebody else, was that like,

897
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,780
maybe someone in the big, like,

898
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,740
monkey drama from a few years ago,

899
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,980
be like, I have your personal information

900
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,780
as like a bargaining chip?

901
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,340
Damn, I remember someone in some big drama

902
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,300
I was following doing some similar shit.

903
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,660
Der.

904
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,500
Probably Keemstar.

905
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Well, it probably happens all the time.

906
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,140
Probably Keemstar, to be honest.

907
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,220
You know what?

908
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,460
Yeah, oh wait, I might be actually

909
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,300
drinking a Keemstar in the Wings of Redemption story.

910
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,140
Oh, it was Wings of Redemption.

911
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,340
Okay, so just Destiny.

912
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,740
Do you know who just Destiny is?

913
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,580
No.

914
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,660
Completely sidetracked,

915
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,700
but he's a commentary YouTuber who got called out

916
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,700
by like this like 13 year old.

917
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,420
He threatened to sue him,

918
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,500
and then Keemstar found his docs

919
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,220
and was about to like docs him,

920
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,060
even though it wasn't him.

921
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,820
I think I am thinking of Keemstar, actually.

922
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,100
Yeah, it wasn't him at all,

923
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,220
but he was like, I found this guy's docs.

924
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,580
Let's chat, bro.

925
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,180
Gotcha, okay.

926
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,020
Imagine.

927
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,060
Well, so all right,

928
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,700
I understand what you're saying about Daft Pina.

929
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,260
So what are you gonna do about it?

930
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,580
Well, Advil here also reached out.

931
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,300
He is making a video,

932
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,180
and a lot of the people involved

933
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,660
are going to push that video.

934
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,980
I hope so.

935
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,500
So you're making a Daft Pina exposed, basically.

936
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,860
Yeah, and I'm trying to keep it up

937
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,340
to the commentary standard, you know?

938
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,100
You have exacting ethical standards.

939
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,900
I have CSGO gameplay, vaporwave intros.

940
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,140
This is everything, the commentary video.

941
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,540
This is how to make a correct commentary video.

942
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,380
Okay.

943
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,780
I start off like, hey, what's up, guys?

944
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,300
Welcome back to another commentary roast.

945
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,700
Pretty much everything you need.

946
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,620
Yeah, well, one of the reasons why,

947
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,020
one of the reasons why I agreed to talk to Advil,

948
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,740
and I signed on for this as well.

949
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,580
That's cool.

950
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,180
Uh, no.

951
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,020
Okay.

952
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,820
Well, no, he does seem to have actual ethical standards.

953
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,820
But also, it's, you know, I looked it up,

954
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,860
and there's no video that really

955
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,780
puts all the pieces of the Daft Pina pie together.

956
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,820
You know, like his beef with Jaden animations

957
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,300
and Odd Ones Out, no one mentions that.

958
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,220
You know, there's no actual exposed video on the guide,

959
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,420
despite him doxing people

960
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,020
and just doing a lot of shady shit.

961
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,260
Like, do you know what he did to Jaden animations?

962
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,420
Uh, I don't.

963
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,900
He said, has a fan, you're at,

964
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,420
and I'm watching this video,

965
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,580
you're faking your mental illness.

966
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,620
Hmm.

967
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,220
What happened is she made this video

968
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,580
about her experience with Interrexia,

969
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,500
called Why She Doesn't Have a Face Reveal.

970
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,340
And it was like, it was just her telling her,

971
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,940
like experience through Interrexia,

972
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,580
but she was using her video and like, you know,

973
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,980
sounds and all that stuff, too,

974
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,660
to make the audience, like, understand her point.

975
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,500
And it was like an old video.

976
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,180
He's already, like, semi-apologized for this,

977
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,180
which I don't have, like, I'm glad that he apologized,

978
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,140
but he was just like, he was like,

979
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,420
why would you need to pad out the video this much?

980
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,820
Honestly, it seems like you are fishing for content,

981
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,140
and Daft Pina talks like, like he's a bit slow.

982
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,780
So he goes like.

983
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,620
Okay.

984
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,460
So he was like, you're padding out the video,

985
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,820
you're probably bipolar, schizophrenic,

986
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,540
like all that stuff, and he was just like, calling her,

987
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,140
all this like shitty stuff.

988
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,660
He called her, he said she did have,

989
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,980
like other mental illnesses?

990
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,180
Yeah, but not, but probably not Interrexia.

991
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,300
You're faking this one.

992
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,140
Yeah.

993
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,980
You probably have different ones.

994
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,780
Yeah, because you're fucking insane.

995
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,620
That's what he said.

996
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,460
Okay.

997
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,540
And then a couple months later,

998
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,820
he made a video about her music video with Boy in a Band,

999
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,900
about her bulimia, right?

1000
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,900
And he basically did the same thing.

1001
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,140
He said that because she didn't donate to the charity,

1002
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,340
like a bulimia charity,

1003
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,340
that she's just been profiting off like bulimia

1004
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,300
without like giving back to the community or whatever.

1005
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,260
First of all, fucked.

1006
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,100
Okay.

1007
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,940
Second off.

1008
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,780
Okay, I get it.

1009
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,300
Yeah, and then he apologized for the first video,

1010
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,260
but still kept the second one.

1011
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,420
And he's still profiting off the second one,

1012
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,780
even though he did the exact same thing.

1013
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,620
Yeah, sounds, I mean, I don't want to,

1014
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,620
I don't want to stick my neck out too far

1015
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,620
for Jayden animations.

1016
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,020
I don't really care if someone goes after Jayden anime,

1017
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,500
but it sounds like he's,

1018
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,780
I mean, it sounds like he was being a bit of a shitter

1019
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,020
in this situation.

1020
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,340
Yeah.

1021
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,580
And so, yeah.

1022
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,420
All right.

1023
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,940
That sounds like a bit shit.

1024
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,780
Yeah.

1025
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,420
He probably should have apologized for some of that.

1026
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,860
Okay.

1027
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,620
So what were we talking about?

1028
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,060
Oh, I was talking about how Pina has made a lot of enemies.

1029
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,500
He's done a lot of shitty things.

1030
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,500
There are a lot of people co-signing on this video

1031
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,980
to be made in the first place

1032
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,620
because it's a common consensus.

1033
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,620
You're in the process of talking to people.

1034
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,100
If you talk to Antunes again,

1035
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,700
tell him that I, Ben Saint, say, fuck you.

1036
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,100
Shut the fuck up, you fucking mutant.

1037
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,620
Tell him he's a sub-human mutant for me.

1038
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,340
I'll let him know.

1039
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,940
Actually, put that in,

1040
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,740
okay, when you make the video

1041
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,500
and you have Antunes in it,

1042
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,260
make sure to include an addendum of me, Ben Saint,

1043
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,100
saying, hey, by the way,

1044
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,420
the person you just listened to is a fucking idiot

1045
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,020
and you shouldn't believe anything they say.

1046
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,300
They're big liar, big racist,

1047
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,060
big, big fucking jackass and fuck him.

1048
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,860
And that gets the PCP seal of approval.

1049
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,300
There you go, Advil.

1050
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,460
This is important, all right?

1051
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,300
There you go.

1052
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,140
This is important context.

1053
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,260
You would be leaving out context.

1054
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,100
I'm sorry.

1055
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,380
You wouldn't be getting all sides of the story

1056
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,980
if you didn't include this, so you better fucking...

1057
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,420
Yes, sir, Mr. Sains, yes, sir.

1058
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,860
Yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.

1059
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,020
That's right, I say jump.

1060
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,380
You say hi, okay, good.

1061
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,700
Yes, sir.

1062
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,940
The publisher you want me to try to Antunes,

1063
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,340
please, please, I need your approval.

1064
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,340
I will begrudgingly give it to you.

1065
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,300
Okay, all right, I'm glad we've sorted that out.

1066
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,020
So, all right, well shit,

1067
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,780
I don't fucking know anything about Daft Pina

1068
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,380
except for what you guys have told me.

1069
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,220
Oh, okay, he's like a...

1070
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,540
So maybe I'll check the video out

1071
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,060
and then maybe I'll know a little something after that.

1072
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,900
See?

1073
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,740
It releases tomorrow.

1074
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,580
Is that good?

1075
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,420
That's why I'm comfortable with talking.

1076
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,980
Hey.

1077
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,660
Hello.

1078
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,540
You're an hour late.

1079
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,860
Yeah, the clocks went back

1080
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,460
and I thought it was now.

1081
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,220
That's my excuse.

1082
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,060
Wait.

1083
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,900
So it is daylight savings.

1084
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,740
Wait.

1085
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,580
In the UK?

1086
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,860
No, it is daylight savings.

1087
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,300
That's really stupid

1088
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,700
because daylight savings time in America starts next week.

1089
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,580
Why wouldn't they just make it the same week?

1090
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,660
I have no idea, but it's a consistent problem every year.

1091
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,620
I always forget.

1092
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,740
Yeah, that's a good excuse though.

1093
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,580
Yeah.

1094
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,740
That one kind of makes sense.

1095
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,180
That one kind of makes sense.

1096
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,460
Okay.

1097
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,660
Sorry, we were talking about...

1098
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,460
Right, Gabe, you know Reborn Pyro from Shreddit.

1099
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,300
This is Advil who was just telling us

1100
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,180
about his Daft Pina exposed commentary video

1101
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,540
that he is in the process of making.

1102
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,460
Yeah, and it's a right way to make commentary.

1103
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,460
The correct, holy, sanctuary way.

1104
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,780
Right, the holy...

1105
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,460
The sanctimonious.

1106
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,820
We need ethics, we need ethics in commentary.

1107
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,420
We need a court, and we need a court of commentary.

1108
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,580
Sure.

1109
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,420
Exactly, yeah.

1110
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,260
Why not?

1111
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,100
Oh, we need to make laws.

1112
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,620
Why shouldn't there be a grand council?

1113
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,700
Exactly, yeah.

1114
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,100
We should...

1115
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
So wild west out there.

1116
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,460
I'm trying to...

1117
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,220
I'm trying like, how can I make this

1118
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,580
like a funny like Holocaust analogy?

1119
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,980
No, how can I imply,

1120
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,660
how can I imply some kind of horrible war crime

1121
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,460
is being committed or some sort of human rights violation?

1122
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,460
I mean, it is what's happening.

1123
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,460
Antunes is getting decimated by Daft Pina.

1124
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,820
That's what I want to happen.

1125
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,420
That's what I want to happen.

1126
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,220
So it's not a war crime if I like it.

1127
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,100
I have no idea who them are.

1128
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,420
I think I've conduct Pina before.

1129
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,780
What do they do?

1130
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,140
They make commentary videos on the art community.

1131
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,940
Oh, yeah.

1132
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,860
Call it a lot.

1133
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,860
And Antunes posts racist comics on Twitter.

1134
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,740
Also known as He's Baste.

1135
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,260
I'm sorry, okay.

1136
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,100
I'm sorry.

1137
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,620
And then he posts racist cartoons on Twitter

1138
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,700
and makes weird...

1139
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,180
Okay, his cartoons are like the funniest thing ever,

1140
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,620
but not because they're like funny,

1141
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,260
but because it's like amazing that these like exist.

1142
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,100
He makes...

1143
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,100
Okay, he makes these animations

1144
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,820
where he like traces cartoon characters

1145
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,220
and he traces them into...

1146
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,060
Deathbed.

1147
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,260
Of them like standing around another cartoon character's

1148
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,300
deathbed and all like mourning

1149
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,260
as like they die in a hospital bed.

1150
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,780
Yeah, I have to be honest.

1151
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,620
That's what he did.

1152
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,380
That's his whole thing.

1153
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,380
No, I'm glad.

1154
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,700
I don't fucking get it.

1155
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,940
But he's made like dozens of them.

1156
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,660
No matter what I think about Antunes.

1157
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,100
If he asked me what I think about them,

1158
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,380
which he definitely won't,

1159
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,100
because why would he care about my opinion?

1160
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,340
But if he did, I would tell him,

1161
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,820
I don't understand why that got you

1162
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,020
to a million subscribers.

1163
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,380
Is that bad to say?

1164
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,340
I'm not trying to show him the guy or anything, but like...

1165
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,740
That's literally what I'm saying.

1166
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,100
So no, I don't think it's bad.

1167
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,500
Yeah, he's the muppet guy.

1168
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,420
I think I've seen something with him

1169
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,460
being a idiot before on Twitter.

1170
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,260
He's awful.

1171
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,300
He's an awful, awful person.

1172
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,580
But...

1173
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,780
Yeah, he like was...

1174
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,460
He had like a million sub YouTube channel, I think.

1175
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,620
Or like maybe 900K or something.

1176
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,100
Just because he made these weird like traced,

1177
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,180
like fucking Homer Simpson's deathbed video.

1178
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,940
And you know, there's no like commentary.

1179
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,220
He is not involved in the channel.

1180
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,740
Nobody knows like what he's like,

1181
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,900
just that he has this channel,

1182
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,660
that he makes these deathbed videos.

1183
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,940
And then he started getting involved in Twitter drama.

1184
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,740
Yeah, it's kind of like the Yo Mama channel.

1185
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,940
Like no one knows anything about the Yo Mama channel.

1186
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,540
Oh, right.

1187
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,660
Right, yeah.

1188
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,180
And then he did kind of try to use his YouTube channel

1189
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,940
as like a platform to be like,

1190
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,060
these people are being rude to me on Twitter

1191
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,820
and I'm being deplatformed on Twitter.

1192
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,820
And like nobody cared,

1193
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,860
because like nobody's there,

1194
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,620
nobody's at the YouTube channel to like hear him say stuff.

1195
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,900
They're there because they want to see Marge Simpson

1196
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,380
like mourning the death of Fred Flintstone or whatever.

1197
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,900
Yeah, it is the weirdest pair.

1198
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,940
I think it's like purely same channel,

1199
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,380
like same like network stuff.

1200
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,700
Cause it'll be like Mordecai from regular show,

1201
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,620
mourning the death of like Finn.

1202
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,540
It should have been Twilight.

1203
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,460
Oh my God, he missed an opportunity.

1204
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,900
That's a missed opportunity.

1205
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,660
That's a missed opportunity.

1206
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,300
Okay, I'm going to scrap the interview with him

1207
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,460
and ask him why he didn't make it Twilight.

1208
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,300
All right, got it.

1209
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,060
Look at this, it's WikiTube here

1210
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,220
and he's got like the contents and it's like content.

1211
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,700
There's three things.

1212
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,580
And then controversies is one, two, three, four, five, six,

1213
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:35,260
seven, eight things, subheadings.

1214
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,540
Lamau, this guy, oh God.

1215
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,300
Seven point to a minor, huh?

1216
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,500
Antunes made a commentary video, god damn.

1217
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,900
Yeah, he's made some fucking shit.

1218
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,900
Well, it was like a review on like rubber hose style

1219
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,260
and has over 12 million views.

1220
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,740
What the hell?

1221
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:01,780
I don't know, he made a review on rubber hose style?

1222
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,620
Yeah, like the cartoon,

1223
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,860
like the animation style of rubber hose,

1224
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,900
like we're like old Mickey Mouse was rubber hose.

1225
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,780
He reviewed cuphead style animation.

1226
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,220
Yeah, he like talked about it,

1227
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,820
like gave the history about it.

1228
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,460
Okay.

1229
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,700
12 million is not bad though.

1230
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,020
I know, it's a big number.

1231
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,100
If this daffy had got to 12 million,

1232
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,300
I would probably just sit there.

1233
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,780
We'd all love a video to get to 12 million.

1234
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:43,620
I wish, should I just start making death bed videos?

1235
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,980
Is that the meta?

1236
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,460
I don't think so, I don't think so

1237
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,260
because the market is, I feel like it's a saturated market.

1238
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,380
Okay, what if I do reincarnated bed?

1239
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,860
What?

1240
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,660
Reincarnated bed.

1241
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,060
Oh, he did one with, ah, boom.

1242
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,500
He did one with Freddy Fazbear.

1243
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,620
Okay, I don't care about this.

1244
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,460
I don't care about this.

1245
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,020
I got completely distracted.

1246
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:14,500
Instead of, oh, like they come out of like a death bed

1247
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,460
but they wake up.

1248
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,460
Birth, I believe birthing bed would be the opposite.

1249
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,540
No.

1250
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,980
Or a homestuck God tier bed, you know.

1251
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,980
It's still like, well, I mean, it's like, you know,

1252
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,980
it's like all the cartoon characters gathered

1253
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,500
in the manger, like the three wise men,

1254
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,060
like for the birth of, you know,

1255
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,260
I don't know, Tom from Tom and Jerry or whatever.

1256
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,340
I don't know, I don't know what the equivalent would be.

1257
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,900
That'd actually be really funny.

1258
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,700
I wouldn't mind watching it.

1259
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,660
I mean, it's the same, it's the same like weird,

1260
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,580
like fixation thing that like made like, you know,

1261
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,020
pregnant Elsa, you know, Spider-Man, like popular.

1262
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,900
So it's like, it's like some weird like quirk

1263
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,220
of human psychology that maybe like children

1264
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,060
are clicking on these videos for some reason.

1265
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,500
It definitely is, and I can't even be mad at them

1266
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,540
because I would do the same thing if I was their age.

1267
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,020
The content's not offensive, it's just bizarre.

1268
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,780
Yeah, I, it's not like, yeah, indoctrinating.

1269
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,700
It's just like a bit weird,

1270
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,540
but I can't blame anyone for watching them

1271
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,220
because if I was a kid, I would watch them too.

1272
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,060
Like 100%.

1273
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,660
I don't think, I don't think I would have ever seen

1274
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,500
the appeal, but whatever.

1275
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,860
I was an idiot when I was a kid, so I probably would.

1276
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,020
That was fair, that's reasonable.

1277
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,860
Um, Gib, what's, what's up?

1278
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,700
What's up?

1279
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,020
Well, obviously Halloween has passed

1280
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,100
since, while you're listening.

1281
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,220
No, it's today.

1282
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,740
No, I know it's today, but like two for the viewers.

1283
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,580
Halloween's over.

1284
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,540
Oh yeah, I didn't even mention that it,

1285
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,060
we're recording this on Halloween.

1286
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:51,900
This is Halloween days.

1287
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,020
Oh, this is a spooky episode.

1288
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,020
No, it's not, it's a week later.

1289
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,220
And there's, all the skeletons are dead,

1290
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,820
but today I carved a jack-o'-lantern

1291
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,260
and that's, that's it.

1292
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,580
I hadn't really, I walked the dog,

1293
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,860
I carved a jack-o'-lantern,

1294
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,820
and then I forgot that the podcast was happening.

1295
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,420
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

1296
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,260
Dirty.

1297
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,740
That was the real scary.

1298
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,060
That's cool, I did not carve a pumpkin

1299
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,260
and I don't intend to.

1300
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,060
I love carving pumpkins.

1301
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,060
You know, it's fun.

1302
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,140
It's like sculpting.

1303
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,540
I do not particularly like Halloween.

1304
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,180
I just, I tolerate it.

1305
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,780
Do you like Halloween, Gib?

1306
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,860
I can appreciate the aesthetic,

1307
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,460
but I don't particularly like scary things,

1308
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,860
like actually scary movies or games.

1309
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,620
They make me pee my pants in my runway.

1310
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,220
But like things that are like, ooh, spooky ghosts,

1311
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,300
but it's not scary at all.

1312
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,020
It's cute, in fact.

1313
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,860
That's okay.

1314
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,460
It's not that interesting,

1315
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,660
but I don't mind it.

1316
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,860
What about you, Reborn?

1317
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,900
I like, you know, I like the witch outfits,

1318
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,060
you know, they're nice.

1319
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,220
I love trick-or-treating as kids,

1320
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,260
because you know, I'm a fat ass,

1321
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,460
so I love that candy.

1322
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,620
Fair.

1323
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,500
And yeah, I also like it as an excuse to drink.

1324
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,340
Dab, dab.

1325
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:26,460
Yeah, as an excuse to hang out with friends or whatever,

1326
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,260
like it's as good as any other.

1327
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,380
So that's fine.

1328
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,460
I appreciate that.

1329
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,580
The real scary part of this episode, though,

1330
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,260
is when viewers find out

1331
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,860
that the first 40 minutes is YouTube drama talk.

1332
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,940
Oh, no!

1333
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,340
I mean, what else are we gonna do?

1334
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,020
Right, you know, fuck it.

1335
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,860
We could talk about Twitch drama.

1336
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:48,900
Twitch drama?

1337
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,180
Yeah, it's not YouTube drama.

1338
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,260
There we go.

1339
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,100
Oh, okay.

1340
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,820
No, it sucks.

1341
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,020
I hate drama, and the drama boys.

1342
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,700
Who eat it up.

1343
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,380
Yeah, I hate, yeah, I would never.

1344
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,620

01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,700
on Who Are These Podcast, link in the description.

1349
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,340
I mean, I wasn't particularly excited

1350
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:19,780
to like live react drama gossip about Trixie,

1351
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:23,220
but she attacked me viciously with a knife.

1352
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,060
That's true.

1353
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,860
I'm called for.

1354
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,580
Yeah, I mean, that's definitely true.

1355
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,900
Not actually with a knife.

1356
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,740
I will admit.

1357
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,820
Just in case anyone's not aware,

1358
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,020
but you gotta listen to the bonus episode to find out.

1359
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,940
I mean, while it is, she definitely started it,

1360
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:38,860
so that's true.

1361
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,260
However, I will personally admit

1362
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,900
to relishing the opportunity,

1363
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,340
not merely as an attempt to defend myself,

1364
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,860
but as a...

1365
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,380
Means to dunk on someone.

1366
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,540
As an offense, yeah, as the means to launch

1367
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,980
an offensive salvo of my own.

1368
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,820
Yeah.

1369
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,780
See, this is the same one in commentary videos.

1370
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,620
See, I get it.

1371
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,220
I make fun, but I can't really judge anyone.

1372
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,740
I get the appeal.

1373
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,700
It's just sort of, I see drama happening every so often,

1374
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,260
and it's like somebody I've never really heard of.

1375
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,500
Oh, this guy's a pedophile.

1376
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,300
Oh, this guy was racist.

1377
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Oh, that person did this and that,

1378
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,740
oh, there's a thing, there's a whole big thing going on,

1379
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,460
and there's these people who are keeping track of it

1380
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,820
and posting updates and being like,

1381
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,540
oh my God, you've seen this thing?

1382
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:32,780
And I'm just like, I don't like that.

1383
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,660
I'm so done with any drama.

1384
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,340
It just doesn't interest me as like a topic.

1385
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,060
I may have mentioned this before.

1386
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,220
I'm too far gone.

1387
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:46,220
Every single person online sucks.

1388
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,340
Learning that they suck more isn't that interesting.

1389
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,420
I may have mentioned this before.

1390
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,060
Someone linked me a video that I tried to watch

1391
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,740
because it sounded like some drama

1392
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,500
that I might be interested in.

1393
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,140
It was two people like,

1394
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,620
okay, I didn't watch the video,

1395
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,980
so I can't confirm any of this,

1396
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,620
but supposedly it was a video about how Vita,

1397
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,740
remember Vita from Pony Days?

1398
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,780
Yeah, vaguely, yes.

1399
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,260
About how Vita was a pedophile and was a predator

1400
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,060
and was being, and they were like, we're here to cancel him.

1401
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,580
And I started watching the video,

1402
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:22,460
and it's these two total charisma vacuum bronies.

1403
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,580
Just start back and forth.

1404
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,660
They start trading off, they're talking about it.

1405
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,420
It's like a 40 minute video,

1406
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,500
and I'm like 10 minutes in, maybe not even that much.

1407
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,700
And they've spent the entire time, thus far,

1408
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,980
not even getting to the point of like,

1409
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:40,900
Vita abused a child or has an underage girlfriend

1410
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,060
or whatever the fuck the accusation was supposed to be.

1411
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,100
They've spent the entire time being like,

1412
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,220
yeah, Vita would like harass the mods

1413
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,460
in this Discord server.

1414
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,020
Yeah, like Vita gained access to one of our other servers

1415
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,860
and like, you know, deleted the whole server

1416
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,980
just out of spite.

1417
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,060
And it's all a bunch of stupid Discord drama

1418
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,260
that is supposed to like,

1419
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,460
it's just them airing their grievances

1420
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,900
in a way that is maybe supposed to prime me

1421
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,300
to like think like, oh yeah, this guy is an asshole.

1422
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,860
I'm ready to hear you tell me why he's a pedophile.

1423
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,140
But like, God, fucking lead with it, right?

1424
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,940
Like, I don't give a shit that you made him

1425
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,740
the mod of your server and then he like,

1426
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,620
he like did some shit with the permissions you gave him.

1427
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,980
I don't fucking care.

1428
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,780
Like, tell me what the actual problem is.

1429
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,100
I'm wasting my fucking time, right?

1430
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:25,940
Sometimes.

1431
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,740
That's probably the, usually the problem

1432
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:31,220
is that it's small potatoes and it's petty.

1433
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,060
Usually.

1434
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,940
When it's petty, when it's petty,

1435
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,500
just like strictly between two individuals,

1436
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,020
personal shit, small potatoes, shit,

1437
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,220
that's like, that's awful.

1438
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,500
Yeah, that's so bad.

1439
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,060
I could never hear about it

1440
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,620
and it wouldn't affect anything.

1441
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,460
Yeah.

1442
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,740
And that's, if there's like, oh, you could see

1443
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:53,340
the story being told turned into like a real documentary

1444
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,180
that would.

1445
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,940
You gotta convince me right off the bat

1446
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,900
that this person is out, like, is victimizing people.

1447
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,060
If you're leading with like,

1448
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,740
he was a mod in my Discord server

1449
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,180
and he did not behave appropriately

1450
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:10,260
in terms of the role.

1451
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,380
He made, he deleted roles that I liked

1452
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,180
and he banned people that I didn't want banned

1453
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:21,180
and it's like, shut the fuck, I don't, nobody cares.

1454
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,140
I like commentary, but only the,

1455
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,620
not the reaction commentators,

1456
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,940
which are like the gameplay commentators

1457
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,220
or tea channels.

1458
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,820
I just like find some random ass tweet

1459
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,180
and just run with it.

1460
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:38,420
I prefer, I think the best commentary

1461
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,940
are people that actually take time

1462
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,700
and they don't have to care about the topic,

1463
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,420
but like put actual effort.

1464
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,980
Everything else, it kind of sucks.

1465
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,940
Not how I think about it.

1466
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,380
I have watched a couple of the right opinion videos before.

1467
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,820
He's pretty good.

1468
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,580
I thought they were pretty okay.

1469
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,980
A lot of people call me boring, but I can say that.

1470
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,180
I often find.

1471
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,860
I don't have much to compare him to.

1472
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,900
Commentary channels.

1473
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:05,460
It's like the, it just feels like,

1474
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,660
what if you made a YouTube comment, but it was a video?

1475
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,540
And I'm like, ah, you know,

1476
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:14,300
I don't really want to listen to a YouTube comment.

1477
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,260
Like it, the commentary as a,

1478
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,900
like a community or like a genre of video,

1479
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,260
it feels like there's not a lot of meat.

1480
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,020
There's not a lot of things you can really do with that.

1481
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,300
It's entirely dependent on how interesting

1482
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,860
the thing you're reacting to is.

1483
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,380
And in that same vein, I often feel like

1484
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,500
they're, they're like equivalent to

1485
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,660
YouTube channels or like, like Facebook groups that like

1486
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,140
put a, but like, here's the viral clip of the week.

1487
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,580
Here's the viral video that's really funny.

1488
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,620
Here you go.

1489
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,940
And they're like barely doing anything.

1490
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,820
They're just pointing your attention towards a thing

1491
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,620
that is entertaining on its own.

1492
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,420
And you could just go and see that thing.

1493
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,060
A lot of, like a lot of like podcasts or even like, you know,

1494
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,780
it's less like, not calling you guys up by the way,

1495
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:09,980
but it's just like, like, it's just like, like, you know,

1496
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,380
or not even podcasts, just like every YouTube video.

1497
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,180
It's just thing of thing, like story time.

1498
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,020
Hey, here's my story of the week.

1499
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,100
It could be the most boring shit ever,

1500
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,780
but here's my story of the week, you know?

1501
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,260
No matter what medium you're in,

1502
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,540
I feel like you can, you can make it as entertaining

1503
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,020
as you put into it or like as engaging as you put into it.

1504
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:31,900
I'm not sure.

1505
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,420
I think a lot of YouTube is that in various ways.

1506
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,260
I mean, a lot of videos about things

1507
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,860
that aren't made by like smart people are just,

1508
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,660
here's a Wikipedia article turned into a video for you.

1509
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,900
Hey, that's me.

1510
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,500
It's like, that's a lot of those things.

1511
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,100
I'm like, hey, I guess it's interesting,

1512
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,980
but like nothing new is being created.

1513
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,100
It's all just redirecting your attention

1514
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,140
towards things that have already been done,

1515
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,980
already been seen, already been made.

1516
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,220
Yeah.

1517
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:06,220
I mean, the podcast thing is like, it's true.

1518
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,300
We just do talk about whatever.

1519
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:12,300
But I just think that like for every medium,

1520
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,860
it's just what you put into it.

1521
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,980
Cause you could just write like a,

1522
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,380
you could just like,

1523
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,460
if you want to do like a story time video,

1524
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,100
you could just like make a blog,

1525
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:26,860
but the medium of video makes it so much like more engaging

1526
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:30,780
and you know, just so much more like entertaining

1527
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,340
rather than having someone just read,

1528
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,180
you know, your blog or your book or whatever.

1529
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:39,020
And I feel like a lot of times people just miss out on that

1530
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:43,420
by creating very non-interesting like,

1531
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,620
you know, like, like video, you know?

1532
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,060
And I do agree, you know?

1533
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,220
Uh, uh, what, huh?

1534
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,340
Like a story time.

1535
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,900
I mean, a story is like, like art.

1536
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:00,860
Like, uh, like a video game or a movie or whatever.

1537
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,940
That's a story.

1538
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,940
Joel Haver makes short films.

1539
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,780
Yeah.

1540
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,620
I love those videos.

1541
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,980
They're just like a little story told.

1542
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,340
Well, usually very funny.

1543
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,300
And that's the sort of content I like.

1544
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,420
But when it's, when it's somebody just doing a vlog

1545
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,820
for like watch time or engagement,

1546
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,380
there's not a lot to it.

1547
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,940
I will say that, um, like if you put a lot of effort

1548
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,380
into telling a small little story,

1549
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:34,540
often stories are not like made for people like me

1550
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,860
because I'm old now.

1551
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,460
It's for young youngsters,

1552
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,220
like YouTube animators, story time people.

1553
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,060
Yeah.

1554
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,860
They make very engaging animated little stories about,

1555
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,900
oh, this is a thing that's relatable to you.

1556
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,460
And they're all like, oh, he is.

1557
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,020
Oh.

1558
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,580
I've been to school once.

1559
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,420
Literally me.

1560
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,260
Literally me.

1561
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,500
And it's like, okay, I don't care for it myself,

1562
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,700
but like, that's all right.

1563
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,540
Don't mind those.

1564
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,380
Why?

1565
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,340
They're making something.

1566
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,180
They're telling all,

1567
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,140
they're gathering people around the campfire.

1568
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,620
I guess, I guess that's what commentary.

1569
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,260
I hate this conversation we're having.

1570
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,500
God, I'm so fucking bored.

1571
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,340
Shut up.

1572
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,180
Oh my God.

1573
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,900
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

1574
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,380
Let's discuss the important stuff.

1575
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,460
The moral background of commentary.

1576
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,300
No.

1577
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,140
Let's go back.

1578
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:19,980
I'll kill you.

1579
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:20,980
I'll fucking kill you.

1580
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,020
Let's talk about, you know, Trixie.

1581
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:26,980
She moves.

1582
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,980
Riley, he produces.

1583
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,500
What?

1584
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,340
You know.

1585
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,680
What?

1586
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,060
What does Riley produce?

1587
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:35,900
Nothing.

1588
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,140
He just produces.

1589
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:38,980
I mean, true.

1590
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:42,700
Yeah, he just, he produces whatever that means.

1591
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,580
Whatever that needs to mean at the time.

1592
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,420
No, I don't want to talk about that.

1593
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,260
I don't care.

1594
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,380
Let's, the fucking,

1595
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,900
well, hey, do you guys see the news?

1596
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,860
Oh God.

1597
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:53,700
What?

1598
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,540
What?

1599
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,380
No, what?

1600
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,220
What?

1601
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,220
I was going to ask you how your game's going.

1602
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,540
Fuck you.

1603
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,540
It's like compared to like.

1604
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,940
My game, Phantom's Revenge, I'm back,

1605
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,140
I finished the Lord of Ghost comic.

1606
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:06,980
Yes.

1607
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,980
I'm back on the grind for the Phantom's Revenge game

1608
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,900
development numbers is good.

1609
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,140
What did I do?

1610
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,900
I fixed a bunch of visual, but yes, two days ago,

1611
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,220
I fixed a bunch of visual bugs.

1612
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,820
Yesterday, I was like completing a bunch of commands

1613
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:26,660
and making a bunch.

1614
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,180
I have successfully implemented the dab command.

1615
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,020
Oh my God.

1616
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,540
Phantom Warren can now dab in the game.

1617
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,780
Sick.

1618
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:36,700
So I, yeah, yeah.

1619
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,540
What else?

1620
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,380
What else?

1621
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:43,060
I fixed a glitch with the screen,

1622
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,340
the screen shake when you take damage.

1623
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,380
Yeah, I'm on it.

1624
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,260
I'm focused.

1625
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,940
It's going good actually.

1626
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,540
And I showed, I said I wasn't going to do this.

1627
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,100
I actually like kind of betrayed myself a little bit.

1628
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,100
I showed myself playing a bit of the game on the stream

1629
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,660
on the Shackles for Heckles we did yesterday.

1630
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:08,060
I showed more than I had meant to show actually publicly,

1631
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,580
but fuck it, it's fine.

1632
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:15,580
So if you want to go listen to that stream we did yesterday,

1633
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,700
you might, and you're interested,

1634
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,100
you might find some secret knowledge

1635
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,420
about my video game in there.

1636
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,420
No, I have two questions for you.

1637
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,660
Number one, are you going to sign an exclusivity deal

1638
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,060
with Epic Game Store and release all the way on there?

1639
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,380
Absolutely.

1640
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:37,940
Well, yeah, NFTs will be incorporated into the game.

1641
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,420
You will have to buy real life NFTs

1642
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,860
in order to progress.

1643
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,900
Jesus Christ.

1644
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:47,280
Only people with an NFT can get in and play the game.

1645
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,940
Otherwise she dies only.

1646
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,140
What's your game about?

1647
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,660
I wasn't here for that arc, what's your game about?

1648
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,860
What's it about?

1649
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,860
It is the, well, it's the conclusion

1650
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,980
of my comic Slime and Punishment

1651
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,300
and it is called Phantom's Revenge.

1652
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,300
And it features Phantom Horn, the unicorn, fighting enemies.

1653
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,820
And I think that's all I'm going to say here about it.

1654
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,660
That is.

1655
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,660
If you watch the sample I showed in the stream,

1656
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,420
actually gives away a bit more of the context

1657
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,300
that I had not publicly talked about it before.

1658
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,900
So the second question I was going to ask you is,

1659
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,500
I didn't actually know you were making a game.

1660
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,580
What genre is it?

1661
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,260
I don't talk about it that much.

1662
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,180
What is the, what is it?

1663
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,060
Oh, I asked what genre it was.

1664
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:41,180
Is it action, platformer?

1665
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:46,180
It's a, I would say it's a turn-based like JRPG.

1666
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,020
Oh, sick.

1667
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,300
But it's with sort of a,

1668
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,980
most strictly speaking, yeah,

1669
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:57,220
it's a turn-based menu-based JRPG,

1670
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,940
but it sort of has the vibe

1671
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:02,620
of like a side-scrolling beat-em-up where you go,

1672
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,580
where basically you just, you go like from left to right,

1673
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,540
from room to room and you, you know, you clear enemies out.

1674
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,020
Yeah, there's no like overworld, there's not RPG maker.

1675
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,460
It's a unique little thing.

1676
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,380
It's a linear, it's a linear,

1677
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,960
it's a beat-em-up that you do with menu commands, basically.

1678
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,780
Yeah, it's a strategy.

1679
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,180
I put the demo out on my Patreon a few months ago,

1680
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,540
and it was really hard.

1681
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,380
It was really hard.

1682
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:36,300
Very, very few people were able to beat it.

1683
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,620
So the final release will not be,

1684
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,140
I'm good, I'm making some changes

1685
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,500
to make it a little bit more forgiving.

1686
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you got,

1687
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,500
no, you don't understand.

1688
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,820
You should make like an insane mode.

1689
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,980
You gotta make it grind people's testicles

1690
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,940
or their titties, you know?

1691
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:53,180
Honestly, I could make an insane,

1692
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,940
if I made the insane mode.

1693
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:55,780
That'd be sick.

1694
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,980
Yeah, you get a funny achievement for it.

1695
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,740
Yeah, if I made an insane mode that took out the ability

1696
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,420
to like rest between rooms or whatever that would be,

1697
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,620
because the demo, if you beat one room,

1698
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,980
you had to immediately go to the next.

1699
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,500
In the final game, you're gonna be able

1700
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,140
to like prepare between rooms a little bit.

1701
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,580
Yeah, you should just insane mode,

1702
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,860
just what is called boss rush.

1703
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:23,700
Boss rush, there's not many bosses in it.

1704
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,660
So what is the process been like of making a game?

1705
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,900
Because I've never really-

1706
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,740
I don't know, you fucking open Game Maker

1707
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,340
and you go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

1708
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,740
and you put things in parentheses

1709
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,380
and you put in semicolons, and it just fucking works.

1710
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,580
All right, speaking of video games,

1711
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,940
I found something absolutely magical today.

1712
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:43,140
Well, found is the wrong word, but it was linked to me

1713
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,420
and I'm already in love looking at this.

1714
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,580
Sonic Robo Blast 2 Persona Edition.

1715
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,860
What?

1716
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,700
Where?

1717
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,540
What does that mean?

1718
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,380
What?

1719
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:00,380
It is a fan-made Persona game with Sonic characters

1720
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,260
and Sonic levels.

1721
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:05,740
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1722
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:08,380
I just, oh, I should put it in links, I'm my bad.

1723
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,340
Now I get it, now I understand.

1724
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,180
Yeah, it-

1725
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,660
Why does this actually kinda look good?

1726
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,660
That's what I'm saying, it looks actually very good.

1727
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:20,500
It does, this actually looks really cool.

1728
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,340
Yeah.

1729
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:23,860
Oh, man.

1730
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:24,700
Holy shit.

1731
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,780
It apparently supports four teams of four players

1732
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,980
so you could play with 15 other friends.

1733
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,460
I mean, who has 15 friends, but, you know.

1734
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,220
I don't know.

1735
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,580
I was knowing 15 Sonic characters.

1736
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:37,420
There are?

1737
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,220
I really like this a lot, actually.

1738
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,260
Yeah, okay.

1739
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,380
You guys like Sonic?

1740
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,220
Yeah.

1741
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:44,060
No.

1742
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:44,900
No?

1743
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,740
Why'd they like it?

1744
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,220
I've never played a Sonic game.

1745
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,060
Damn.

1746
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:48,900
I see how it is.

1747
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,740
Yeah, I see what you like.

1748
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,300
It's one of those series that has just been around

1749
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,140
but I've never really played.

1750
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,020
I think I had Shadow the Hedgehog

1751
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,660
was the only Sonic game I had as a kid.

1752
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,900
What games did you guys grow up on?

1753
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,020
I played a bunch, I played a,

1754
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,460
I mean, my favorite games as a kid were like,

1755
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:11,420
were SNES RPGs, like Mario RPG and Secret of Mana and.

1756
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,700
Yo, Mario RPG, that's a good game.

1757
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,540
I respect that.

1758
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,740
That's, yeah, that's probably my childhood fave

1759
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,820
was Mario RPG.

1760
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,940
What about you, Gib?

1761
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:25,940
I was in PS1 for a bit and then PS2 mostly

1762
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,060
is a wretched and clank, Jack and Dexter.

1763
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,500
Hell yeah.

1764
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,940
Tomb Raider 1, Rayman.

1765
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,420
Oh, did you play Crash?

1766
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,540
I did, yes.

1767
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,580
I didn't have Crash for some reason.

1768
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,100
I never beat, I never beat Crash.

1769
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,420
I never beat Crash.

1770
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,620
Dude, Crash is so good.

1771
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:45,060
I had a weird situation.

1772
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:48,340
So I had a Nintendo 64 growing up

1773
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,180
and then I got a PS2 a little later on.

1774
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,900
But well, the weird part is I never got a GameCube

1775
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,380
or a Wii for a very, very long time.

1776
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:59,460
So I played like Ocarina of Time and I grew up on that.

1777
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,380
But then I also grew up on Ratchet and Clank

1778
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,740
because those are my favorite action RPGs.

1779
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,060
The guns are just amazing.

1780
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,220
It's so fun.

1781
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,340
I wouldn't call Ratchet and Clank an action RPG.

1782
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:18,220
You can level up the guns in two and three, so I guess.

1783
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,460
Yeah, I would, I think that's a straight.

1784
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,740
I mean, you have some RPG element.

1785
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,700
It's an action, it's a 3D action.

1786
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,660
Adventure game with RPG element.

1787
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:30,100
It's a third person shooter platform.

1788
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,220
Yeah, or if you played Deadlock, it's a arena shooter

1789
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,540
slash RPG.

1790
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:39,980
Oh, Ratchet fucking bread, Dread.

1791
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:43,700
Ratchet Gladiator was called in the UK.

1792
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,540
I love that shit.

1793
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,380
Hell yeah, same.

1794
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,460
I remember getting that for Christmas

1795
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:51,740
and I played it like after I'd opened the presents.

1796
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:55,100
I had it and I just played the whole entire game.

1797
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,740
And then it was dark.

1798
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,220
I remember, so I didn't have an internet

1799
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,580
at my house at the time and there was always

1800
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:04,140
a big sticker on the box that says play online

1801
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,860
with PlayStation.

1802
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,220
And there was one time me and my family

1803
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,860
were staying at a hotel somewhere

1804
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:12,420
and I actually hooked it up to the PS2

1805
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,460
and got to play online for the first time

1806
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,660
and it was really fun.

1807
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:18,260
That is like a-

1808
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,820
You can never figure out, what do you need to do

1809
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:25,820
to get a PlayStation 2 to be online?

1810
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,060
I thought you needed a funny adapter thing.

1811
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,580
Yeah, you did need, I think, I remember

1812
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,500
we had to buy some kind of adapter

1813
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,060
to play Ratchet and Clank Arena online.

1814
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,860
God, that shit was so fun.

1815
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:38,700
It was.

1816
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,860
That was awesome.

1817
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:42,180
Wait, so were you guys Nintendo kids at all?

1818
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:47,180
I had no, I switched from the Super Nintendo

1819
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:52,780
to the PlayStation because I wanted to play Final Fantasy 7.

1820
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,820
So I started with Nintendo and then switched to Sony

1821
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,700
when PlayStation came out.

1822
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,420
I mean, I had the consoles was always Sony.

1823
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,620
And then I had a Game Boy Advance SP

1824
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,660
and then a DS Lite.

1825
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,820
No, I didn't have a DS Lite.

1826
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:15,260
I had, I started, I was borrowing my brother's DS lights

1827
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,900
and then I got like a DSi XL and then a 3DS.

1828
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,180
So I was like portable Nintendo,

1829
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,180
like Phoenix Wright and shit.

1830
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,460
Oh yeah, I still had, I still had GBA

1831
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,820
and I think I got the S.

1832
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:32,300
Was it the SD after the GBA?

1833
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,140
Yes.

1834
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:33,980
Yeah, yeah.

1835
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:34,820
No, wait.

1836
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,500
Yeah, so I continued to be a Nintendo portable kid.

1837
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,540
The same.

1838
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,380
Advance, I think?

1839
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,220
Yeah.

1840
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,620
I only got the-

1841
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,220
No, after Advance.

1842
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:47,500
I definitely had the Advance and was it the SP after the SP?

1843
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,940
Yeah, yeah, it was the SP.

1844
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:52,700
The one, the silver one with the flip up screen.

1845
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,620
Yes, yes, yes.

1846
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:58,980
I remember fucking, I only cared about the Game Boy and DS.

1847
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,620
Like I had to have them exclusively for Pokemon

1848
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,660
and no other reason.

1849
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,340
Were you guys play Pokemon?

1850
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:09,700
I know a bunch of people that didn't and it's like-

1851
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,540
That's funny.

1852
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,380
It's so weird.

1853
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,300
We have been criticized for talking too much

1854
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,820
about Pokemon on this channel.

1855
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,340
I mean, it's been a while.

1856
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,340
Let's talk about Pokemon.

1857
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:25,260
Yeah, I played red and then I played,

1858
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,940
no, I played blue and then I played silver

1859
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,860
and then I skipped gen three and then I played pearl

1860
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,620
and then I played, was it, was it,

1861
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,220
was black and white after pearl and diamonds?

1862
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,060
Yeah.

1863
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,980
Well, there was black one, but yeah.

1864
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,300
I played black.

1865
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,420
No, I bounced off black and then I didn't play

1866
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:43,700
another one for a while.

1867
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,100
Yeah, I played a bunch, played a bunch of Pokemon.

1868
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:52,500
I have played blue and then I had Sapphire

1869
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,500
and that's like my big nostalgia one.

1870
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,100
And then I didn't care much for other stuff

1871
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,660
because I think it was like, I was used to it being

1872
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,420
like pixelated little drawings

1873
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,220
and then they started experimenting

1874
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:12,100
with having three dimensional buildings and stuff.

1875
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,380
And I'm like, that's fucked.

1876
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,580
That's incorrect.

1877
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,740
You thought that was fucked?

1878
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,300
They're ruining my game.

1879
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,260
Wait until, just you wait, you didn't know,

1880
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,700
young Gabe didn't know just how fucked

1881
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,780
things were gonna get.

1882
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,100
I had a little gamer moment where I was like,

1883
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:29,100
no, things on the GBA, they look great.

1884
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,260
Fire Emblem, right?

1885
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:33,020
Fire Emblem seven and eight, perfect looking games,

1886
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,940
incredible, great little sprite animations

1887
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,780
on all the little people.

1888
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:41,660
Then GameCube, Fire Emblem comes out, looks like shit

1889
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:44,340
because it's like low poly 3D renders,

1890
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,140
no good animation at all.

1891
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,020
And I was seeing that as well with other games.

1892
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:52,820
It was like, 3D versions of once two dimensional properties.

1893
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:56,700
These fucking 3D Pokemon houses, this Pokemon center,

1894
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:57,900
looks like crap.

1895
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,740
I hate it.

1896
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,940
And then I didn't play Pokemon at all until Pokemon Moon.

1897
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,380
I thought the limited 3D stuff looked pretty good

1898
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,300
It does look good.

1899
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,700
I was just like an ancient for a reason.

1900
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:12,020
And then like, was it in, was it,

1901
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:17,900
yeah, like fourth and fifth gen had some 3D house and stuff.

1902
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,980
Some pseudo 3D stuff and then actual 3D.

1903
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,220
And they looked really good.

1904
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,340
Yeah, they looked good.

1905
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:23,500
And then they fucked it all up.

1906
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,060
And then they fucked it all up, believe me.

1907
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:25,980
I did enjoy playing Pokemon Moon.

1908
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,820
If a little 3D looks good,

1909
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,540
everything would look good in 3D.

1910
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,100
Now, Sun and Moon suck, Sun and Moon are shit, honestly.

1911
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,420
Yeah, Sun and X, Y, Sun and Moon.

1912
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,220
Sun and Moon have gotten worse over time.

1913
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,060
All right, yeah.

1914
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:36,980
Well, I like the music from them.

1915
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,300
I still listen to those.

1916
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,700
Yeah, every Pokemon game has good music.

1917
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,780
Yeah, I wouldn't play it again, God, no.

1918
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,980
But like it had the team skull, that was epic.

1919
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,300
Here's the hot take of this episode.

1920
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,220
And the characters were cool.

1921
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,180
Here's the hot take of this episode.

1922
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,580
The 3D stuff and starting with gen six,

1923
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,020
I don't think it was bad.

1924
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,620
I liked the new designs.

1925
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,220
I liked the quirky way the world looked.

1926
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,300
I just hated the fact that the DS

1927
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,300
couldn't handle double battles in 3D.

1928
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,220
So it lagged, like even the 3DS.

1929
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,940
Like if you play Sun and Moon,

1930
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,300
especially the re-release of them, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon,

1931
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,300
and you get into a double battle,

1932
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,980
oh my God, the frame rate drops

1933
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,620
to 10 frames a second sometimes.

1934
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:24,740
And the battles just go by so slow because they're lagging.

1935
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,740
I had the new 3DS too, which was the upgraded one.

1936
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,460
The one that's supposed to be more powerful

1937
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,700
and it was just lagging so bad.

1938
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,100
Like 3D was okay, but not for a console

1939
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,300
that couldn't handle it.

1940
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,460
I remember when he fucked me up sometimes.

1941
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:43,500
I think the move to 3D was just bad in every way.

1942
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,340
It looks worse and it plays worse.

1943
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:49,460
You know, like I did it for black and white.

1944
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,860
Like they should have done like what Sonic,

1945
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,140
like Sonic Persona did and have 2D sprites walking around

1946
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,140
in a big 3D world.

1947
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,380
That would have been badass.

1948
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,900
Honestly, maybe it would have worked, I don't know.

1949
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,740
It would have been a bold decision though,

1950
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:04,100
considering how like every other game company was doing.

1951
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,380
But it would definitely make them stand out.

1952
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,580
And Pokemon was already so big at the time,

1953
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,740
and then it didn't matter.

1954
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,020
It's like no matter what happened,

1955
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,860
people would have bought it, you know?

1956
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,300
Yeah, fuck the crew.

1957
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,860
It's still true today, haha.

1958
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,460
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

1959
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:27,580
It really fucked me up that sometimes like a game

1960
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:31,860
built for a console cannot run well on that console.

1961
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:32,700
Yeah.

1962
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,500
Like there was a moment in Professor Layton

1963
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,660
versus Phoenix Wright on DS, which is a 3DS,

1964
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,060
which is a game I really like,

1965
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,100
but there's like this one core section.

1966
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,740
I can't remember your review of it.

1967
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:49,780
Where there's like a bunch of characters on screen,

1968
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:52,180
cause it's like they interview like a group

1969
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,220
of some or of knights or something.

1970
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,580
And you know, they're all wacky and cool models,

1971
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,820
but because of there being so many fucking vertices

1972
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,620
and points on screen at once,

1973
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,820
the fucking DS 3DS can't handle it and it lags

1974
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,060
and it just ruins like the game.

1975
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,660
That's just the way the game is.

1976
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:12,060
You can't play, you can emulate it.

1977
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:12,900
Nice.

1978
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,900
But like it was built for that and it just doesn't run.

1979
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,300
How do they cool?

1980
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,820
How do they sleep at night knowing that they made a video game

1981
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,660
that wasn't quite up to standard?

1982
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,700
That's a great question.

1983
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,100
Nobody knows.

1984
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,020
That's why everybody gets mad at Pokemon

1985
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,700
because oh, you guys rake in millions of dollars,

1986
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,340
but you can't optimize your games properly.

1987
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,180
What the fuck?

1988
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,980
Yeah.

1989
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,260
No, I can think that I can.

1990
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,220
Sad, but true.

1991
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,060
Sad, but true.

1992
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:44,260
I feel like there's like an interesting

1993
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,220
like secretive documentary on like why Pokemon is just bad?

1994
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,860
Cause it's like it doesn't make any sense

1995
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:53,060
why they just don't do it right.

1996
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,060
You know, you go, you get a guy on the inside.

1997
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,380
They just don't give a fuck.

1998
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,700
They sneak around the office.

1999
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,540
They just don't give a fuck.

2000
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:04,460
They get private conversations of like the developers

2001
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,420
at Game Freak being like, ha, ha, ha,

2002
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,260
I don't care about what I'm doing.

2003
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:09,260
Ha, ha, ha.

2004
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,860
And then it was like, oh my God, what a scoop.

2005
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:13,180
Yeah.

2006
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,020
True though, true though.

2007
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:23,020
Um, okay.

2008
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:23,860
All right, I don't care.

2009
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,740
I don't care about Pokemon.

2010
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:27,060
I don't care about anything.

2011
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,860
This doesn't, this don't matter.

2012
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,660
You care about Yu-Gi-Oh. None of this matters.

2013
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:32,900
I don't.

2014
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,820
I don't like Yu-Gi-Oh.

2015
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:37,300
Did you guys see, all right.

2016
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,580
This week on YouTube.

2017
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,860
What?

2018
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,700
What, they're still making Yu-Gi-Oh?

2019
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,260
Yeah, I did.

2020
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,100
Stop.

2021
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,220
Like cards or the show?

2022
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,660
Both, all the above.

2023
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,660
Cards, video games, everything.

2024
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:54,900
I'm just kidding, I know,

2025
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,940
I know that they're still doing that.

2026
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:57,980
I wish they wouldn't.

2027
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,020
Actually, no, I don't.

2028
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,700
I stopped giving a shit after.

2029
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,460
I don't actually mind it, it's fine, it's fine.

2030
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,420
I stopped giving a shit after.

2031
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,660
I wanted to say, this week on YouTube,

2032
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:10,660
with two monumental videos dropped on YouTube this week.

2033
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:15,340
One of which I expected and was anticipated.

2034
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,220
The other, which was a total surprise.

2035
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,780
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

2036
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,620
Probably not.

2037
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,780
No clue.

2038
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:21,620
Okay.

2039
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,300
Well, the one I was expecting

2040
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,300
was the new Tim Rogers action button review

2041
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,340
of Cyberpunk 2077.

2042
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,820
After like, what's it been like 10 months

2043
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:33,480
since the Tokimeki Memorial review,

2044
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:37,540
the new action button dropped.

2045
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:41,380
And it is a sprawling epic

2046
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,820
that was so big that it had to be split into like,

2047
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,940
it had to be split into like seven videos.

2048
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,220
Holy shit.

2049
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:51,660
For some reason, it's, I don't know, it's good.

2050
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,500
How long are all the videos?

2051
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,900
Honestly, I don't even have that much to say about it.

2052
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,140
It's an action button, it's good, huh?

2053
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:59,300
How long are all the videos?

2054
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,140
They vary, some of them are,

2055
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:05,180
he started out making them maybe like two hours or so,

2056
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,860
but they like, they got longer longer.

2057
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:11,740
I think the Tokimeki Memorial one is like five hours long.

2058
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,820
And this one is probably like nine or 10 hours

2059
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,420
all total or something.

2060
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,300
I don't know, action button is weird

2061
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,980
because it's really not even about the game.

2062
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:24,300
It's basically just, I mean, he does talk about the game,

2063
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:27,620
but he also just like rambles about himself

2064
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,900
and random shit a lot.

2065
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:34,140
And probably some people would find that annoying,

2066
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,180
which is fine.

2067
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,240
That's valid.

2068
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,020
Yeah.

2069
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,900
Let's talk about something, you know,

2070
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,740
not too spicy here, politics.

2071
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,860
No, I wanted, fuck, no, my other video,

2072
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,420
I said there were two videos.

2073
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,260
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

2074
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,060
Another big video that I need to recommend,

2075
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:57,900
that I need to recommend.

2076
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,020
I want everyone to go and watch,

2077
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:02,860
yeah, the new, the new Yan Misali video.

2078
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,020
Did you see this?

2079
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,300
What was that?

2080
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:10,300
Yan Misali is a guy, he does, he's a conlanger.

2081
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,460
He like made video reviews,

2082
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,820
where he reviewed constructed languages,

2083
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,020
stuff like Esperanto, and he would review them

2084
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,140
and be like, how good is it as a language?

2085
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:22,540
How shit is it as a language?

2086
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:23,380
What's wrong with it?

2087
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:25,340
How could it be better?

2088
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,420
And then he was moderately successful doing that,

2089
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,780
and then he recently branched

2090
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,900
into doing more like YouTube-y stuff.

2091
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,900
He did a big iceberg video about the Rhythm Heaven series.

2092
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:40,100
He did a video exploring how many,

2093
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:42,700
how many Mario games are like,

2094
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,700
are considered part of the mainline Mario series,

2095
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:46,820
and which ones are they?

2096
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:48,020
That one's pretty interesting.

2097
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:52,660
And his new one, which is Who Made Caramel Dancin,

2098
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,540
is a masterpiece.

2099
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,380
Oh, I saw that.

2100
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:55,220
That was a great one.

2101
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,060
It's so good.

2102
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,100
It's so good.

2103
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,100
Wait, who's this guy?

2104
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:02,340
His name is Yan Misali, that's J-A-N,

2105
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:06,220
and then space M-I-S-A-L-I.

2106
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:11,220
And there's so much to the story of Caramel Dancin

2107
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,660
that I just didn't know.

2108
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,940
Who would have thought?

2109
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:18,780
But it's true.

2110
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:19,900
Yeah, it's weird.

2111
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:23,060
I found the Caramella Girls just randomly,

2112
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,020
and I was like, oh, I guess they made it.

2113
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:27,820
I guess this is what they're unable to do with YouTube channel,

2114
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:28,660
and I would have been fooled.

2115
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:29,580
You would think so.

2116
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:32,220
Yeah, it's a whole, yeah, a bit of a spoiler,

2117
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:35,220
but it's a whole, yeah, the band,

2118
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:40,300
that pretends to be responsible for Caramel Dancin

2119
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,380
is just like a later invention

2120
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:46,120
by the record label that owned the song,

2121
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:51,120
and just is out here sitting on a throne of lies.

2122
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,780
Amazing, it's amazing.

2123
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,900
Yeah, great, that was a great video,

2124
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:04,020
and I just wanted to fucking, oh, oh, oh, but yeah,

2125
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,300
but in that video, he explained,

2126
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,340
oh, this ties into the Trixie thing,

2127
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,020
the Who Are These podcast,

2128
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,580
because in The Who Are These podcast,

2129
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,540
they make fun of me.

2130
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,380
They rightfully make fun of me

2131
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,700
for not knowing the lyrics to,

2132
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:23,340
or the name, in fact, of a, fuck, what song was it?

2133
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:27,020
Blitzkrieg, boop, Blitzkrieg bop.

2134
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:28,940
I didn't know the lyrics to Blitzkrieg bop,

2135
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,940
and I interpreted them as let's get fucked,

2136
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:37,140
which is a phenomenon that I learned from that video,

2137
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:40,140
from that Yan Misli video, it's called Mondegreen,

2138
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,220
or in Japanese, Sora Mimi,

2139
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:46,300
the practice of interpreting another song

2140
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,220
in a different language in your own language,

2141
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,380
just based on mishearing the words.

2142
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:54,060
So yeah, I Mondegreened, Blitzkrieg, boop,

2143
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,940
so it wasn't, it's not an L, it's not an L.

2144
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,500
I was doing a Mondegreen, actually, it was W.

2145
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,780
Yeah, yeah, so.

2146
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:05,540
Wait, do you know what the actual lyric is?

2147
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,380
Or probably not.

2148
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,740
Yeah, it's Blitzkrieg, swedish.

2149
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,580
Oh, okay, now I know.

2150
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:11,100
Oh, you mean Blitzkrieg, boop, I don't know.

2151
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,460
Some sort of words.

2152
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,300
Cause, I-

2153
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,380
Blitzkrieg, boop.

2154
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,540
Blitzkrieg, boop.

2155
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,460
Wait, Blitzkrieg, boop, let's get fucked, okay.

2156
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:23,220
Sorry, sorry, it just sounds like that to me.

2157
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,380
And that's valid, and no one can take that away from me.

2158
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:31,420
I just, yeah, when he said the Mondegreen thing,

2159
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:33,900
I was like, oh, just like me and Blitzkrieg, boop.

2160
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,980
Relatable, this is literally me right now.

2161
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,820
Huh?

2162
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:41,660
There's like a Reddit thread dedicated to

2163
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:44,460
let's get fucked, bitch, Blitzkrieg, boop.

2164
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,300
Excuse me?

2165
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,140
Yeah.

2166
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:46,980
So I'm not the only one.

2167
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:47,820
No.

2168
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,660
So I'm not the only one.

2169
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:49,500
No, you're good.

2170
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,380
Excuse me, did you just bring up Reddit?

2171
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:53,220
Read.

2172
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,060
Oh, fuck.

2173
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,580
I mean, I'm in 4chan, I'm in 4chan,

2174
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,180
I'm in 4chan.

2175
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,020
Disavow, disavow, double disavow.

2176
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:00,540
No, link me, link me the thread about,

2177
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:01,380
link me the thread.

2178
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,900
It's not a thread about it, it's about what song

2179
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,380
you've been miss hearing, but there's like

2180
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,660
three people talking about Blitzkrieg, boop.

2181
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,540
That's, that's great.

2182
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,180
Speaking of, how long am I gonna con, blitz?

2183
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,620
Speaking of threads, yeah, I always,

2184
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,980
seven years ago, Jetsetter underscore says,

2185
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,140
I always thought that Blitzkrieg, boop was let's get fucked.

2186
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,900
Some friends pointed out my idiocy just a few weeks ago.

2187
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:28,220
Same, except for me, it was my mortal enemy

2188
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:31,700
that pointed it out, cool.

2189
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,540
This reminds me.

2190
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,540
Oh, I love that, I love that.

2191
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,380
Given Ben.

2192
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:35,500
Okay, amazing.

2193
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,980
Mon de Green, think about it.

2194
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,980
How big of a fan are you two of Kingdom Hearts?

2195
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:45,420
I played one and two, and chain of memories.

2196
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:47,420
So I used to be kind of a fan.

2197
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,460
I played one and two sort of recently

2198
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:54,880
for YouTube videos that I made on the first one.

2199
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,080
I never made the second one,

2200
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,320
but I enjoyed them a fair amount, they're pretty good.

2201
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,800
Okay, this is-

2202
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,320
I think I played the third game as well

2203
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,600
because that was hype, I just felt like it.

2204
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,720
Okay, okay, so you two will very much appreciate this.

2205
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,320
I'll post in the links.

2206
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,120
I was linked this thread as it was happening

2207
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:16,520
and this is the funniest thing I've ever seen

2208
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,000
come from 4chan.

2209
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,920
Yeah, click it and read it real quick.

2210
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,400
In the reply, where is it?

2211
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,680
I posted in the links.

2212
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:33,240
Oh, indeed, I request a large cheese pizza,

2213
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,480
plain of, cheese pie of pizza, plain of course.

2214
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,560
Us nothing's required, nothing on our meals.

2215
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,920
A side beverage of a Dr. Pepper.

2216
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,520
Wait, we gotta post the image.

2217
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,160
The image needs to go along with this.

2218
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,520
Here we go.

2219
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,360
So here's the image, and yeah.

2220
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,680
Indeed, I request a large cheese pie of pizza,

2221
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,800
plain of course, us nothing's require,

2222
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,000
nothing on our meals.

2223
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,840
A side beverage of a Dr. Pepper.

2224
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,200
The ideal drink between drinks.

2225
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,960
Oh, and how foolish of me.

2226
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,120
Do not forget the garlic knots.

2227
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,460
I will be waiting to pay in cash.

2228
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,080
Please alert your courier to knock three times

2229
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,000
at the door of Castle Oblivion,

2230
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,320
so we are aware of his presence.

2231
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,640
And it just keeps-

2232
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,280
I shifted into Xemnas mode.

2233
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,240
It just keeps going.

2234
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,280
Oh, and then they just RP in character

2235
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:29,320
for the whole thread.

2236
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:32,000
The Sora ones are the funny ones.

2237
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,520
Don't you remember Xemnas?

2238
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,920
The savory, tasty, greasy cheese.

2239
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,520
The sour feeling of tomato toppings.

2240
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,560
If that's my favorite one,

2241
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:44,360
there's a picture of salad in it and it's like too late.

2242
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,760
I'm already going half and half.

2243
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:52,600
Okay, all right, this is pretty good.

2244
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,120
It goes on for so long too.

2245
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:58,960
It just keeps-

2246
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,800
Oh my God.

2247
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,960
Yeah, it just keeps going.

2248
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,920
I see Woody from Toy Story.

2249
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,840
There he is.

2250
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,240
Wait, wait, wait, I got this one.

2251
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,080
I want to read this one.

2252
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,400
I want to read this one.

2253
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,920
I'm posting the image here.

2254
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,440
Pizzas quivering with cheese.

2255
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,040
Pizzas burning with pepperoni.

2256
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,680
Pizzas scarred by anchovies.

2257
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:25,800
That fool Ansem said the pizza's true nature

2258
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,920
was beyond his understanding,

2259
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,080
but it's not beyond mine.

2260
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,040
Pizzas are the source of all power.

2261
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:37,600
He's ascended.

2262
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,240
All right, all right, all right.

2263
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,520
Good thread, good thread.

2264
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:46,240
Behold, these dried toppings used to be full of flavor,

2265
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,320
united with the taste of their customers.

2266
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:52,520
And this barren kitchen key cards of crepitant debt

2267
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,240
of what were locked in combat

2268
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:57,160
has a great three-for-one special rage.

2269
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,520
Countless customers emptied their wallets

2270
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,760
in search of one ultimate taste.

2271
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,160
And soon it will belong to me, the X-Car.

2272
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:09,680
Do you-

2273
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,760
The idea of a key card instead of a key blade.

2274
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,040
Dude, how many, dude, can you churn,

2275
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,880
can you churn key blade cards?

2276
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,680
What's the cashback rate on that key blade, bro?

2277
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:26,760
Like what's the sign-up bonus like on that key chain?

2278
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,600
Big card blade.

2279
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,000
Dude, I'm churning chains, bro.

2280
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,320
I'm chaining memories, bro.

2281
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,240
And ironically, like a giant credit card

2282
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,800
would make more sense as a blade than a key.

2283
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,760
That would be sick, though.

2284
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,840
It's time for me, it's time for me

2285
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,400
to start workshopping my new manga series,

2286
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,920
which is a shonen action about people battling

2287
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,840
with giant credit cards and comparing,

2288
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,480
like, who can get the best bargains?

2289
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,320
Yo!

2290
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,000
Who can do the best combos to get the most cashback

2291
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,200
on their purchase, on their Christmas gift shopping?

2292
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,040
Oh my god.

2293
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,760
Yeah, money equates to power in that shonen universe.

2294
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,600
Yo, when is this gonna come out?

2295
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,400
Just like, just like, just like the conclusion,

2296
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,240
just like the conclusion to Road to Radcon.

2297
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:10,200
Literally, that's the final beat of Road to Radcon.

2298
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,400
Not spoiler, I won't go in any more detail.

2299
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,160
Literally, just like the dramatic conclusion

2300
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,320
of Road to Radcon.

2301
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,240
Check my pinned tweet on Twitter, it's also ugly.

2302
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,920
Buy a copy, please.

2303
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,480
I have 55 copies left in a box.

2304
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,800
Please buy them from me, please.

2305
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,920
We're gonna buy them, I'll get rid of them.

2306
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,520
We're gonna buy them.

2307
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,760
If you check my Twitter, like I said,

2308
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,960
my pinned tweet on Twitter, it's also ugly,

2309
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,480
has buying instructions.

2310
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,360
It basically just tells you how much money it is

2311
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,200
and where to pay pallet to me.

2312
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,760
And then you can just DM me on Twitter

2313
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,280
and I will say, okay, I will send it to you.

2314
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:53,760
I'm doing this very DIY, like out the fucking back

2315
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,920
of my car kind of thing.

2316
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,520
I'll buy one and everyone who's listening

2317
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,920
should buy one too.

2318
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:03,080
No matter how many are left, everyone should buy one.

2319
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,080
Everyone should just cop a quick one,

2320
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,800
even if you already have one, you know?

2321
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,760
Please, I have to move product.

2322
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:11,360
I paid for these books out of my own pocket.

2323
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,200
Help me.

2324
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,880
You know what I say, having two of everything

2325
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:15,000
doesn't hurt, you know?

2326
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,760
Buy two, I would highly recommend buying two copies.

2327
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,600
So you can do a wheel.

2328
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,440
Maybe buy three.

2329
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,760
You can put one, you can buy two

2330
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,560
and then you could put one, like leave it mint.

2331
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,320
So for future generations, you could sell it at a markup.

2332
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,800
It's like a physical NFT.

2333
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,720
I was horrified.

2334
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,800
I came in, it was raining so hard yesterday.

2335
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:38,640
It was pouring.

2336
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,720
I was walking home with my umbrella.

2337
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,720
My legs got soaked, but I was walking home

2338
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,760
and I walked in my house and I closed my umbrella,

2339
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:52,720
but I shook my umbrella out and it threw water droplets

2340
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:55,960
all over my room and I realized to my horror

2341
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,560
that several droplets of water had fallen into the open box

2342
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:02,680
where the copies of Road to Radcon lie fallow,

2343
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,360
waiting, just waiting to be given a good home.

2344
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,640
And I was like, no, water damage.

2345
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,160
And I pulled out the two top copies

2346
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,400
that were sitting on top and I brushed them off

2347
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,920
and I tried, I dried them and I was like, no, no.

2348
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,920
They're gonna pockmark the cover.

2349
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,440
They're gonna get little divots on them.

2350
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,880
And it looked like it was true.

2351
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
It looked like they had swelled up a little bit.

2352
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,920
I was like, no, now I can't sell these.

2353
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,280
Now I'll have to give these away as business gifts

2354
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,800
to idiots that I find.

2355
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,680
But then I left them, I have to give these to homeless people

2356
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,320
on the street to wipe their asses with this.

2357
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:38,600
But I just put them down and I let them dry off

2358
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,000
and I checked them about an hour later

2359
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,320
and they had dried off and they were no longer,

2360
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,240
they had unswelled, they were no longer

2361
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,720
noticeably damaged at all.

2362
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,440
So I was like, few, saved.

2363
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,720
Well, thank God, I don't want to get to homeless people now.

2364
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,760
Oh, God, that was almost bad.

2365
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,600
So back in the box.

2366
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,840
And they're yearning for it.

2367
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:59,040
They think, well, they better pay up then.

2368
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,360
They don't, you don't understand.

2369
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,200
These books ain't cheap, kid.

2370
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,920
You don't understand how much homeless people

2371
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,400
love the PCP podcast.

2372
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,840
It's like a cultural icon.

2373
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,040
They're our target demographic.

2374
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,080
Yeah, target demographic.

2375
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,480
We're aspirational to them.

2376
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,240
They love it, but they can't access it

2377
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,960
because their phone ran out of battery.

2378
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,480
Every time that they listen to it,

2379
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,160
they're just imagining what it would be like.

2380
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:23,640
It's homeless people with dead batteries

2381
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,800
who haven't checked the podcast in a year

2382
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,920
coming back in the comments.

2383
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,800
It's that one or two guys in the comments

2384
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,080
every time being like,

2385
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,920
just checking back to see if Nate's on the podcast again.

2386
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,200
Like it's because they've been living

2387
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,360
on the street this whole time

2388
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:39,080
and they haven't found a starbucks to plug their phone into.

2389
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,840
They have to go to a public library

2390
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,960
to check in on you guys over a few months, you know?

2391
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,440
That's right, that's right.

2392
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,600
You should do a book signing at homeless shelters.

2393
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,880
Would it be controversial to bring up Nate's new show?

2394
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:53,840
Gamer's Zone?

2395
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,920
No, we mentioned it.

2396
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,320
You mean the Gamer's Zone?

2397
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,000
Yeah.

2398
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,840
It's not that new.

2399
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,040
Okay, Worst PCP.

2400
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,680
I have actually listened to like a full one.

2401
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,840
I glanced at it, I skipped around.

2402
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,320
I was like, okay, yeah, they're talking about

2403
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,680
like hot button issues of, or maybe they aren't.

2404
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,960
Well, okay, goodbye.

2405
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,440
It wasn't that.

2406
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:17,880
It was kind of like a PCP.

2407
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,120
I assume they talk about video games.

2408
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,160
I assume it's, I mean, it's like the PCP

2409
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,760
and that it's a people talking

2410
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:26,280
and one of the members is the same.

2411
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,120
Yeah, exactly.

2412
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:27,960
Is it real?

2413
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,320
Yeah, I mean, I guess, what else?

2414
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:30,880
I mean, we invented that concept.

2415
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,880
Absolutely, we invented podcasts as a concept.

2416
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,320
Well, I mean, wasn't the concept behind the PCP,

2417
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,640
Nate's gonna get his friends together to run a show

2418
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,080
and now Nate's getting his friends together

2419
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,000
to run a new show?

2420
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,360
No.

2421
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,920
What are you talking about?

2422
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,760
The concept behind the PCP was Nate's gonna get his friends.

2423
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,160
Like what, where do you get that idea?

2424
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,000
I have seen that idea.

2425
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:56,680
That's a little genuinely offensive in the same way

2426
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:00,640
that like, oh, PCP podcast is Digi Bro's anime podcast,

2427
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:01,920
but actually worse.

2428
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,320
Listen, I've heard that take so many times

2429
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,200
in just the general PCP community.

2430
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,000
I mean, I didn't do research, I didn't fight it.

2431
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,960
I've just seen a lot of people say it.

2432
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,040
I have never heard that and I, and they,

2433
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:16,960
and I whoever thinks that better be glad

2434
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,120
I never heard them say that shit before.

2435
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,400
Let it deranged, literally deranged.

2436
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,360
What were we talking about?

2437
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,640
He's gonna track down the homeless people.

2438
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,480
Oh yeah.

2439
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,800
That's claimed though.

2440
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,120
Oh yeah, I have more pizza things to read.

2441
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,920
This is in the Mickey Mouse voice.

2442
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:41,240
Say, fellas, did somebody mention the door to Domino's?

2443
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,400
That's actually a pretty good Mickey voice.

2444
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:49,040
Say, fellas, did someone mention the two for one special?

2445
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,120
It sounds like a South Park version of Mickey.

2446
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,680
Actually, it's a pretty solid Mickey impression.

2447
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,120
It's better than I could do.

2448
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,120
Geez, it's been Mickey Mouse.

2449
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:02,560
Oh, wow.

2450
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,040
We gotta kill the darkness or whatever, Sora.

2451
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:13,040
I have another thing that happened this week.

2452
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,960
You guys know the Drawcast podcast?

2453
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:18,800
Yeah.

2454
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:23,040
Yeah, not ours, the new one.

2455
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,840
The one with the C-Tool in them, right?

2456
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,840
Oblivionful. Yeah.

2457
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,160
What did you say, Pyro?

2458
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:31,000
I said the one with C-Tool, Oblivion,

2459
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,040
and I think Teleparte is on a few.

2460
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

2461
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:40,360
Well, I'm on a one that is coming up soon.

2462
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:43,480
It's the draw, it's Telephone.

2463
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,000
The idea being like there's a prompt

2464
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,600
and then someone draws it

2465
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,400
and then they show their drawing

2466
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,200
to the next person for like a minute

2467
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,720
and that person has to try to like remember it

2468
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,880
and then like recreate it

2469
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,840
and then they show it to the next person for a minute

2470
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,840
and they have to remember it and try to re...

2471
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,800
Yeah, yeah, like the game, Telephone.

2472
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,600
Yeah, Drawcast Telephone.

2473
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,600
So I had mine, I had my turn this week

2474
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,960
and the next person after me in line was Teleparte.

2475
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,160
So I had to get in a call with him

2476
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:20,160
and show him the, you know, my thing for him to copy.

2477
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,720
And it was very annoying

2478
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:27,720
because my Discord stream like fucked up.

2479
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:32,760
Like I put two minutes on the, okay, well, first.

2480
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:36,000
First, he asked me like, hey, when can we do it?

2481
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,320
And I was like, we can do it this afternoon,

2482
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,320
I'll be around.

2483
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,840
And then a like emergency situation

2484
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,600
with my landlord came up

2485
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:47,360
and I suddenly had to like run to the bank to pay rent

2486
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,080
and then run to the post office to send rent.

2487
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:55,080
So that was, by the way, by the way, side note,

2488
01:47:55,120 --> 01:48:00,120
my landlord is attempting to ask me to pay a late fee

2489
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,120
on rent, which is illegal in Massachusetts.

2490
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:08,040
It is illegal to ask your tenant to pay a late fee

2491
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,880
on rent that is less than 30 days late.

2492
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,760
And I was not 30 days late.

2493
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,600
So she is simply breaking the law.

2494
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,440
And if she asks me again, we may have to go to court over it.

2495
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,560
And I will win because the law is unambiguous.

2496
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,880
But so that's fun.

2497
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,920
So my shitty landlord is fucking,

2498
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,120
is fucking trying to do crimes against me.

2499
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,400
So I'm out, so I had to run to the bank and all that.

2500
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:35,720
And then I see on my phone that like Teleparte an hour ago

2501
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:38,240
was like, hey, you're ready to do it?

2502
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,480
Hey, let me know when you're ready.

2503
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,920
Get back to me, whatever you see this.

2504
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,560
And I'm like, shit, fuck, I said I would be around.

2505
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,320
So I tell him like, oops, sorry, landlord emergency.

2506
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,240
And then I come back and I'm like, okay,

2507
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,960
it's like two hours later, but I'm like, okay, I'm ready.

2508
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,320
And then I get on the thing and I open up my stream

2509
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,840
and I show it to him and my stream is like fucking up.

2510
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,200
I'm like sharing the window that my drawing is in.

2511
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,280
And it's all like, it's like glitching and jerking

2512
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,960
and like flashing around.

2513
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,000
And I'm like, I don't know why it's doing that.

2514
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:11,280
So I have to like stop that, stop sharing that

2515
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,680
and then just start sharing my whole screen,

2516
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,920
which partly shows the image.

2517
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,400
And it's doing that thing where like,

2518
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,840
you move your cursor around

2519
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,880
and like it remembers where your cursor was been

2520
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,600
and like the cursor stays on the screen,

2521
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,680
like flashing and like a trail.

2522
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,400
Yeah, it's doing that.

2523
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:31,120
And I don't know why, I'm just telling it share my screen.

2524
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:33,560
So, and this is like, I have two minutes,

2525
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,640
he has two minutes to look at the thing

2526
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,400
and it's all like glitching out and flashing around

2527
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,480
and like the cursor is fucking up

2528
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,840
and like marring the image.

2529
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,080
I'm sure it was very distracting.

2530
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,200
So that was kind of a shit show, but whatever.

2531
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,520
I mean, two whole minutes,

2532
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,760
how long does it take to fucking look at a thing

2533
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,880
and know what it looks like?

2534
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,680
So I'm sure it was fine.

2535
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,360
Are shows like that difficult?

2536
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,960
Two whole minutes to try to remember.

2537
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,360
I would assume that'd be really difficult, right?

2538
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:05,520
You were allowed to like take notes.

2539
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,960
You're not allowed to like sketch it,

2540
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,720
but you were allowed to like take notes

2541
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,040
in that two minutes about what it looks like.

2542
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,440
For me, it was pretty, you weren't on that.

2543
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,400
Oh wait, nice.

2544
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,680
I was, I was earlier in the train.

2545
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,200
No, you were, you were, I saw your drawing.

2546
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:25,120
Well, the person that called me on the discord

2547
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,120
and said, hey, it's your turn to look at mine,

2548
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,720
that person told me explicitly, you are allowed to take notes.

2549
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:33,400
Okay, I guess at some point somebody decided,

2550
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,000
Oh, can I take notes?

2551
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,720
And someone was like, yeah, I guess so.

2552
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:39,760
Even the rules, even the rules of telephone

2553
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,240
are like changed like in between.

2554
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,640
They're getting telephoned.

2555
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,160
Yeah, they are getting telephoned.

2556
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,400
That's kind of funny.

2557
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,680
Lamal.

2558
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,520
So it's not, okay.

2559
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:52,960
Okay, that makes a lot more sense that you can take notes

2560
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,160
because I'm not an artist at all.

2561
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,760
But if I had to do that,

2562
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,800
I would probably be stressing out about the little like.

2563
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,960
I kind of think.

2564
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,360
I think it wasn't that bad.

2565
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,960
I think two minutes was too long.

2566
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,400
I think two minutes is too long.

2567
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:11,160
I had one minute and I think it was, it was like, yeah.

2568
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,560
Why did they change the rules?

2569
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,400
It did telephone.

2570
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:14,920
Don't worry about it.

2571
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:19,080
I had like one minute and I was looking at it.

2572
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:23,000
I'm like, okay, humanoid with this, that,

2573
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:23,840
what color is the hair?

2574
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,120
What color is the thing?

2575
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,120
What color is that?

2576
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:28,920
Oh wait, no, I didn't have color

2577
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,360
because the person who went before me

2578
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,480
did theirs in black and white.

2579
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,480
Yeah.

2580
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,200
So I had to come up with colors.

2581
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,640
They told me what the colors were,

2582
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,600
but they didn't tell me where they were.

2583
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,440
So my-

2584
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,280
I feel like that's cheating.

2585
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:43,000
I feel like that's cheating that they told you that.

2586
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:48,360
I mean, I move the colors into various places.

2587
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:52,720
Tell a perte, look, I mean, I'm not trying to judge,

2588
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,200
but like that's definitely cheating

2589
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,320
for you to ask for like additional information

2590
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,120
than what's in the drawing.

2591
01:51:59,120 --> 01:51:59,960
I mean, that's what oblivion is for.

2592
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,600
It's obviously, like it's definitely not

2593
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,080
in the spirit of the game to be like,

2594
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,760
hey, tell me more about the images.

2595
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,040
I didn't ask for information.

2596
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,080
They just said, oh, like, oh, whoops,

2597
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:12,120
I drew in black and white.

2598
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:12,960
What should I do?

2599
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,800
An oblivion fool said, oh, you can just tell them

2600
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,120
the general colors.

2601
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:17,960
Stupid.

2602
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Well, I looked, okay, the person that went before me,

2603
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,880
I looked at all the images in the chain,

2604
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,920
and the person that went before me

2605
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,680
took some weird liberties with it

2606
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,400
in a way that I found kind of annoying.

2607
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,400
Like, it seemed like they like sort of deliberately

2608
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,360
tried to differentiate themselves

2609
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,160
by just like adding a bunch of shit.

2610
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,600
Wait, Ben, did you look at all

2611
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,640
of the different ones previously?

2612
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,480
Well, no, after I finished mine,

2613
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,320
I went back and I looked at them.

2614
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,200
Oh, after, yeah, I guess that's fair.

2615
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:49,040
That's fine.

2616
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,920
Yeah, the person before me, I don't know,

2617
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,800
they like, you know, they drew the figure,

2618
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,400
they tried to recreate the figure,

2619
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,400
but like, they put it like floating in a void.

2620
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,000
They put it like underwater, which was like,

2621
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,720
Like what was the thing you were supposed to draw?

2622
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,360
It was a girl.

2623
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:11,280
It was a girl, well, it doesn't matter.

2624
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,880
It's a particular character.

2625
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,560
But the point is, so this person who went before me

2626
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:18,000
decided, you know, they looked at a picture

2627
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,440
of this person, you know, just kind of standing there,

2628
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:23,760
and decided that for their iteration of telephone,

2629
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,760
they were going to draw them like floating underwater,

2630
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:30,200
which is like, I don't know,

2631
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,680
that doesn't seem right to me.

2632
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:35,320
That seems like they are deliberately adding things

2633
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:36,160
and changing it.

2634
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:38,360
That isn't the spirit of the game

2635
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:41,160
that you were supposed to attempt to recreate

2636
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:42,640
the image that you were shown.

2637
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:46,680
And the changes are merely from like,

2638
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:50,040
your lack of remembering your,

2639
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,200
Yeah, you can't replicate it perfectly, so.

2640
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:56,200
Yes, yes, so I thought that was annoying.

2641
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,480
But yeah.

2642
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,520
I'm gonna be a wild card.

2643
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:02,280
Teleperte, yeah, it's a little bit like,

2644
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,160
ooh, I'm gonna be a little different though,

2645
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,040
like, ooh, mine's a little,

2646
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,680
I'm gonna fuck this up on purpose a little bit,

2647
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:10,480
like, mm, just so that I stand out.

2648
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:18,080
The, yeah, Teleperte was, he was like kind of mumbling.

2649
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:19,880
He said like, he was asking me like,

2650
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:20,840
oh, so what is this?

2651
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,280
Is this like a such and such?

2652
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,120
Is this a so and so?

2653
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:26,600
And I said like, mm, I don't think I should opine

2654
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,440
on what it is.

2655
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,120
I don't think I should say anything

2656
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,760
about what I was trying to draw.

2657
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,280
I just think I should just let the image speak for itself.

2658
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,400
He also, he said he liked it.

2659
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,040
He said he was very complimentary of me,

2660
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,840
so that was pretty cool.

2661
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:41,680
Yeah.

2662
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,440
That's it, that's my story.

2663
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,560
Wait, so.

2664
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,920
It was a great fun.

2665
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,160
What's this?

2666
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,400
Sorry, I'm so out of the loop with all this stuff,

2667
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:53,040
but what's, what is this?

2668
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,040
Like, what is this channel on?

2669
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,680
I'm gonna kick, I'm gonna kick your ass.

2670
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,800
I'm gonna fucking kick your ass, dude.

2671
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,400
What channel is it?

2672
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:04,040
Like what, the channel is just called DrawCast.

2673
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:04,880
Yeah.

2674
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,720
DrawCast is.

2675
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,760
They stole the name from us.

2676
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,320
They stole the name, because we were.

2677
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:10,240
And the format.

2678
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,960
We didn't protect our copyright.

2679
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:12,800
We didn't strike them down.

2680
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,000
You should, 100%.

2681
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,840
No.

2682
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:17,800
They're squatting on our I.C. wall.

2683
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,480
Give them a copyright strike.

2684
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,280
I should give them a fucking.

2685
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,120
DMCA here.

2686
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,560
He didn't get my stern talking to, I think we should.

2687
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:28,400
Yeah.

2688
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,480
I'm a very faintly bullet.

2689
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,640
Is that what you said?

2690
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,640
Bullet.

2691
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:33,680
Yeah, I should give them a bullet.

2692
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:34,520
Oh my God.

2693
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,360
That's what, that's a normal thing

2694
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,200
that people say, right?

2695
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:37,880
Oh yeah, I know, yeah.

2696
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:38,720
Yeah.

2697
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:39,560
Yeah.

2698
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:40,400
Good.

2699
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,120
Oh, yeah, speaking of the DrawCast,

2700
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:46,240
the Halloween one that I was on

2701
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:48,880
has just released as of recording.

2702
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,560
And that is where I invented

2703
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,600
the scraggity-agity, the scarecrow.

2704
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:58,520
It was like a, like, oh, draw a scarecrow character.

2705
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,680
Wait, no, that was completely different.

2706
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:03,760
That's completely different.

2707
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,400
I'm thinking of a different DrawCast

2708
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:09,480
on a different thing that is not related.

2709
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:12,680
Well, I was on that DrawCast that is on the DrawCast.

2710
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:14,720
The Halloween DrawCast right now

2711
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,400
is not where I invented scraggity-agity.

2712
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:19,560
That was the big booby-mummy-milker's

2713
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,480
Halloween DrawCast that was out.

2714
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,960
You've lost, you've lost your mind.

2715
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,520
You've lost touch with reality.

2716
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,440
It's confusing, because there's two different

2717
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:29,880
DrawCasts Halloween-themed,

2718
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,680
where I, one in which I invented a cool OC

2719
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:35,280
and the other one in which I drew punk

2720
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,600
and some other things.

2721
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,680
Hmm, I can see how that would be confusing.

2722
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:42,720
Are you talking about big, bitty scream?

2723
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:45,200
Huh?

2724
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:47,320
Like, in the thumbnail for the DrawCast,

2725
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:51,200
it's just like scream, but with big bitties.

2726
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,160
Oh, yeah, scream, but boob-boob-boobs, yeah.

2727
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:56,080
Oh, right, yeah, that's a Oblivion Falls drawing.

2728
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,800
I think.

2729
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:59,400
I think.

2730
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,240
Yes, that's the one I'm talking about.

2731
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:05,940
Go watch it, link in description.

2732
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,040
Ugh!

2733
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:13,320
Wait, I have one other thing on my list

2734
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,520
of things to talk about this week.

2735
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,280
Crypto gas.

2736
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:23,120
This week I discovered that crypto is, in fact, a scam.

2737
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,760
It's bullshit, it will never take off.

2738
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,600
Discover?

2739
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,840
No one will ever use it.

2740
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:28,200
Well, I already kinda knew,

2741
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,160
but I was reaffirmed to me, like, this is dog shit

2742
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:34,440
and it's simply nonsense and it doesn't make any fucking sense.

2743
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:38,640
I was, I had, okay, last year,

2744
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:42,360
I had been watching a financial advice channel

2745
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:47,120
called Clear Value Tax, just for financial advice.

2746
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:50,520
And the guy at one point, he mentioned an app called KuCoin

2747
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,080
and he said he uses KuCoin and he said it,

2748
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:54,920
do you know what this is?

2749
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,240
I don't know what KuCoin is, yeah.

2750
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:57,320
What, KuCoin is?

2751
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,160
Really?

2752
01:57:58,160 --> 01:57:59,520
C-O-U coin?

2753
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,280
No, K-U, K-U coin.

2754
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,480
Oh, okay, okay.

2755
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,640
So it's an app that you can buy crypto on it

2756
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:08,280
and then you can invest in crypto,

2757
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,720
but you can also do things like take your crypto

2758
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:15,720
and you can put your crypto into trading bots

2759
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,320
that will make trades for you

2760
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:22,280
and it's a low-risk way of quote-unquote investing.

2761
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:23,960
It's sort of like a different investing method.

2762
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,880
It's like investment firms but bots.

2763
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:30,960
Yeah, something like that.

2764
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,840
So I tried it just to see what,

2765
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:35,080
I put a couple hundred dollars in it

2766
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:37,200
just to see what would happen.

2767
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,360
I put it into a few different currency

2768
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,760
and I tried running some bots.

2769
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,440
It did actually make some returns

2770
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:45,400
but it was so effort intensive.

2771
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:48,960
I had to be doing work on it every day

2772
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,520
to be making these returns and I was like,

2773
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:55,880
this is kinda, I'm not sticking with it, I don't think.

2774
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,720
So I left it alone for a while

2775
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,120
and then recently I'm not using that shit anymore.

2776
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:01,600
I just wanna pull the money out.

2777
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,680
So it was a nightmare to pull it out

2778
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:07,680
because you can't just directly withdraw your money

2779
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,200
from KuCoin.

2780
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:12,800
You have to send it to a wallet.

2781
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,080
I still have, you have to send it to a wallet

2782
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,560
and then depending on the wallet,

2783
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,560
you can maybe withdraw through that.

2784
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,640
So what I should have done was just,

2785
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,280
so I had to create a wallet

2786
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,800
and then what I should have done

2787
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:31,800
was send it to my Coinbase wallet

2788
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:36,040
and then I could have maybe withdrawn it through Coinbase.

2789
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:38,200
But instead Coinbase told me,

2790
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:41,560
don't send it to Coinbase, use our app

2791
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,480
which is called Coinbase Wallet.

2792
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,960
Not the same as just a wallet on Coinbase.

2793
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,980
Coinbase Wallet is a separate wallet.

2794
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:51,480
So I sent it to Coinbase Wallet

2795
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,880
and I also cannot withdraw it from Coinbase Wallet

2796
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,120
and I'm like, okay, great.

2797
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:58,920
I had to pay a fee for all three kinds of,

2798
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:01,240
I had USD, UST and Bitcoin

2799
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:04,720
and I had to pay $30 for each transfer

2800
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:07,760
from each of those currencies to the wallet.

2801
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:08,840
I'm like, okay, great.

2802
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,040
And so now I have it in the wallet

2803
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,680
and now I'm like, I wanna withdraw and I can't.

2804
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:17,240
And I'm like, it's like, okay, no, no, no, to withdraw,

2805
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:20,480
you have to send it from Coinbase Wallet

2806
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,520
to the wallet on Coinbase.

2807
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:25,320
And I'm like, all right, fine.

2808
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,800
And so I tried to do that

2809
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,400
and the Bitcoin transfer is easy,

2810
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,360
but the USD and the UST both tell me

2811
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:37,360
that it will be $100 to transfer like $70 worth of it

2812
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:44,360
from Coinbase Wallet to Coinbase, the same website.

2813
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,800
And I'm like, are you joking me?

2814
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,440
And it turns out, and I complained about this on Twitter

2815
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:54,560
and a couple people told me like, no, no, that's normal.

2816
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,440
No, no, that's normal, that's gas.

2817
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:58,400
That's what we call the gas fee.

2818
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:02,960
It like pays for like the Ethereum blockchain mining

2819
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,900
or something.

2820
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:06,160
I'm like, oh, great.

2821
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,880
Yeah, this is gonna take,

2822
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:09,000
this is gonna take off for sure.

2823
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,720
Yeah, everybody's gonna be doing this.

2824
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:13,520
Everybody's gonna be paying for everything.

2825
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,320
Paying like a hundred fucking dollars

2826
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:20,320
to send less than a hundred dollars between wallets.

2827
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,560
Like, oh, I'm glad we fucking have a decentralized currency

2828
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,400
that everybody's gonna be using soon.

2829
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,680
Get on this shit while it's hot.

2830
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:31,400
So, I don't know, fucking...

2831
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:35,240
Apparently if I wait, like the price fluctuates

2832
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:36,720
and I might be able to find a day

2833
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:41,720
where it maybe only costs me like $30 to send my $70

2834
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:44,760
to my wallet that I can actually,

2835
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,680
so like, I made modest returns on the money

2836
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,320
that I put into KuCoin.

2837
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:52,440
It has, all of that has been destroyed.

2838
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:55,480
All of that has been taken and much more

2839
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,040
simply by the act of me trying to get my money back out.

2840
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,920
So, total dog shit, a complete scam,

2841
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:06,080
a big pyramid scheme, and a few people get rich

2842
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:09,480
and it is designed so that everybody else loses money

2843
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,880
and pays into the system

2844
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,920
and just doesn't get anything out of it.

2845
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,560
It's for idiots, it's for idiots.

2846
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,760
There's very few cryptocurrencies

2847
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:22,880
that are actually worth investing in

2848
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,880
and the ones that are are now like...

2849
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:27,840
The only ones that, including the gas fee

2850
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,720
that you can get actual profit on

2851
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:33,920
are so expensive that it's not even worth your time.

2852
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:35,960
It's...

2853
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,920
I mean, I would have...

2854
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:41,360
I mean, if I'd bought a bunch of Bitcoin a year ago,

2855
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,560
it sure would be more valuable now.

2856
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,080
The number sure did go up.

2857
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:49,840
Like, investing in small cryptocurrency now,

2858
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:52,480
especially when a lot of them don't have an audience.

2859
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,600
Yeah, fucking...

2860
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,520
Crypto idiots are always saying like,

2861
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:59,440
oh, I invested in some new shit coins,

2862
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,160
some new fucking coin.

2863
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,120
Oh, did you see this one new coin?

2864
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:06,160
Oh, it went from like a penny to like $100 overnight.

2865
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,720
Oh, I could have made a million dollars.

2866
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,640
Yeah, I...

2867
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:11,200
Like, and all this stupid crap

2868
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:12,400
is always happening all the time.

2869
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,080
Some stupid new thing is always every week.

2870
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,080
Some new shill is like, I have a new coin,

2871
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:18,480
invested in my new coin.

2872
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,360
They're all the same, they're all a scam.

2873
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,200
They're all just, they're all a pyramid scheme

2874
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:25,040
where the guy who makes it is gonna take the money and run.

2875
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:27,120
And that's it.

2876
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:28,960
That's all there is to it.

2877
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:32,280
NFTs are so much worse though, like honestly.

2878
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:35,640
NFTs are, I mean, they're all...

2879
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,240
I guess they probably are worse.

2880
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:38,080
They probably are worse.

2881
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,320
Just like the amount of like,

2882
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:41,480
hypebeasts and shills that there are.

2883
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:45,520
Like, every single influencer has like an NFT

2884
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,240
that they like support holds hardly

2885
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:51,000
and it's like their profile picture on Twitter

2886
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,600
and all that stuff and it's like, shut the fuck up.

2887
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,920
Yeah.

2888
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:56,680
All a scam, obviously.

2889
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:58,920
All like a pump and dump,

2890
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:01,120
like get people hype for this thing,

2891
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,200
convince them it's gonna be worth a bunch of money,

2892
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,800
get them to buy in and then cut and disappear.

2893
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,120
That's why I'm so surprised whenever people believe

2894
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:12,440
what influencers say on like, crypto.

2895
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:14,680
It seems like such like a not,

2896
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:16,680
you know, something you should never do.

2897
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:20,520
I was reading Dan Olson's thread.

2898
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,320
Dan Olson has a big thread on Twitter

2899
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:26,040
where he was like, he was accepting invites

2900
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:29,760
and do all kinds of like crypto discord servers

2901
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:31,640
and just documenting them.

2902
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:33,800
He has made a big spreadsheet documenting

2903
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,880
like how they all were behaving and like,

2904
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:40,320
it's all a bunch of like,

2905
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:44,000
his story is that like, every one of these communities

2906
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,320
is a bunch of people who sort of like,

2907
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,720
pretend that they're there for a community.

2908
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:51,720
But they're all actually just obviously there

2909
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,200
because they think they can flip and make a profit

2910
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,320
and they're all like delusional about it.

2911
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:59,600
Like even after like the people that make it like,

2912
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,360
cut and run and disappear from the server

2913
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,880
and are obviously never coming back,

2914
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:05,560
everybody kind of is just like, nah, we just gotta hold.

2915
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:07,320
You know, this is just a temporary setback.

2916
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:10,880
You know, this is all gonna be worth a lot of money one day,

2917
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:11,720
but that's always the same.

2918
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:14,080
Everyone's just massive characters in this entire thing.

2919
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:16,840
Like in this entire like cryptocurrency.

2920
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:20,880
Yeah, I actually, I feel a little cheated.

2921
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,720
There was a YouTuber that launched Cluecoin,

2922
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:25,160
COU coin, right?

2923
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,120
CLU?

2924
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:30,880
And I bought it, I bought it like the third hour was out.

2925
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,200
So like I was one of the first investors.

2926
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:36,720
I put $500 into it.

2927
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:41,200
That $500 is now worth 14.

2928
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:47,000
You know, yeah, like I know, obviously, obviously,

2929
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:51,560
some people, there are some stories of people

2930
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:56,560
who through some chance or maybe either through

2931
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:59,400
the fact that like it was their plan all along

2932
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,520
or through maybe through some random chance

2933
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,720
made a bunch of money investing in crypto.

2934
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:06,960
There are some sort of, but like, you know,

2935
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,880
like the vast majority of people, you know,

2936
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,360
for a few people to be getting rich off of this shit,

2937
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:13,480
everybody else has to be losing money.

2938
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:18,200
So most people are gonna end up exactly like that.

2939
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:22,040
Ooh, I hates it, I hates it.

2940
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:26,320
I mean, at least the good thing about NFTs is that when-

2941
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,000
Is that it supports art?

2942
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,800
No, it's that when somebody fucks up

2943
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,040
and loses all their money and they go bankrupt,

2944
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:35,640
they have a really funny image.

2945
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:38,600
That it's like, it's funny to,

2946
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,280
it's something to point and laugh at.

2947
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:44,280
Crypto bros, like a text tweet of them being like,

2948
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:47,200
oh no, I lost all my money is less funny

2949
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:50,440
than a funny, like weird, gross looking ape saying

2950
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,280
I lost all my money.

2951
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,480
Did that have you like the only like copy

2952
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:55,040
of Charlie bit my finger?

2953
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:02,200
Instead of the fucking crypto shit,

2954
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:05,440
NFT shit is a fucking nightmare, we can see live in hell.

2955
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:07,400
Genuinely, like I thought,

2956
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:09,040
man, I thought 2020 was bad.

2957
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,840
I thought fucking coronavirus was bad

2958
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,320
and was never going away,

2959
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:16,040
but now NFTs are here and everybody's doing them.

2960
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:17,520
And it seems like they're becoming,

2961
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,640
like fucking Ubisoft is putting NFTs in their games,

2962
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,400
they're gonna, they said they're gonna do.

2963
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:25,200
This Adobe Photoshop is allowing you to make NFTs

2964
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:26,520
from Photoshop.

2965
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:27,360
Really?

2966
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,200
Really?

2967
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,040
Have you seen that?

2968
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,720
The building functionality into Photoshop

2969
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,920
so that you can like save as NFT.

2970
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:35,600
Just fucking kill me already.

2971
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:36,640
Just fucking end it.

2972
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:41,480
I mean, that is kind of big brain on Adobe's part though.

2973
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:42,680
Like it makes sense.

2974
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:44,800
Well, I guess it makes sense.

2975
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:45,760
Getting money from it,

2976
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,240
I guess people will have to get Photoshop for it.

2977
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:50,080
Yeah, I just like easier access,

2978
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:53,240
but still that's like, it's just so brain dead.

2979
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:55,800
But it's so weird,

2980
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:59,200
because it was like from every conceivable angle,

2981
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:03,040
it's stupid and yet everybody's getting on it.

2982
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:04,400
I don't really understand.

2983
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:06,040
I guess people just aren't aware,

2984
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:09,160
but they aren't critical for some reason.

2985
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:12,240
They're just going around just assuming it's perfect.

2986
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:13,920
No, it's not that.

2987
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:15,960
It's literally just dwarfish gold madness.

2988
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,320
It's literally just people here

2989
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,520
that somebody made a lot of money

2990
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:21,400
and they're like, I also wanna make a lot of money.

2991
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:23,000
Oh, you did a thing called NFT?

2992
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:23,840
Well, whatever.

2993
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:26,040
I don't care what it is, I'll do it.

2994
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,240
Like that's what it is.

2995
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:32,520
Nobody actually believes that like NFTs are like good.

2996
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,840
They just think they can make a lot of money.

2997
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,800
It's the hot new thing.

2998
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,240
And they're just uncritically going along with it.

2999
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,800
Especially for a lot of celebrities as well.

3000
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,640
Especially for like how badly it fucks up the environment.

3001
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,640
Put that cringe.

3002
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,720
Yeah.

3003
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:49,320
I'm just surprised that people are still like,

3004
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,720
like it doesn't make as much money as people would think

3005
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:52,960
and it fucks up the environment.

3006
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:55,160
So I don't see like the...

3007
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:57,720
Well, see, okay.

3008
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:02,200
NFTs are weird because they don't have any actual use.

3009
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:06,320
They are literally the only reason anybody gives a shit.

3010
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:09,800
Any of the NFT bros, they always say the same thing

3011
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:11,680
because it's a way to make money.

3012
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,520
That's it.

3013
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:13,560
That's all they see.

3014
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,880
Yeah, that's all they see.

3015
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,120
They see a dollar sign.

3016
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,840
There is no functional use.

3017
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,200
There is no reason to give a shit about NFTs

3018
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:23,040
other than, ooh, what if I make money?

3019
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:24,800
Yeah.

3020
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:27,800
It's the equivalent of like participating in a fad.

3021
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:29,800
Like, oh, planking.

3022
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,480
I'll do a plank.

3023
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:32,400
No, it's not like that.

3024
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,400
If it makes me money.

3025
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,640
Yeah, it's like if planking was like...

3026
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:38,760
Well, the thing with planking is like, oh, it's funny

3027
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:41,760
and it's fun being part of whatever's going on.

3028
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:45,440
Replace that with, it's nice to get some cash

3029
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,440
and then that's why everyone's saying it.

3030
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:49,920
The reason why crypto bros are so cringy

3031
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,760
is because they are operating under,

3032
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:55,200
like they literally don't care about what they're saying.

3033
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,440
They're saying whatever they think they need to say

3034
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:00,880
in order to like, to hype their brand up

3035
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:05,800
and like, you know, maintain the brand

3036
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:09,400
and like help their fucking items like cost rise

3037
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,080
so they can flip it at a profit.

3038
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:12,920
They're not saying anything

3039
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:15,600
because they actually believe it or like think it's cool.

3040
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,240
They're saying what they think they need to do

3041
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,480
just like serve their financial needs.

3042
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:21,800
I got this like Black Mirror episode.

3043
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,840
It's a crypto bro dad gets his son an NFT for Christmas.

3044
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,120
That's not a Black Mirror.

3045
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:28,960
It's just like, it's just...

3046
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:31,920
That would be such a good episode actually.

3047
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,480
You know, I forget what the legal term is called

3048
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:37,680
but they have this issue in baseball for baseball cards

3049
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:40,840
and there's still a lot of places with this issue

3050
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:44,520
where somebody would open a store, right?

3051
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:47,480
They'd have a pretty rare baseball card.

3052
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:49,440
It's not worth anything.

3053
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:52,480
They put a sign out or they have somebody come in,

3054
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,440
you know, they give this person money to come in

3055
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:57,360
and buy the card at $100,000.

3056
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:00,920
So that way they could say this card sold for $100,000.

3057
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:01,760
It really did.

3058
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,200
This person just bought it.

3059
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:06,880
You know, right now I'll sell it to you half off $50,000.

3060
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:09,600
And you know, some poor person will walk in,

3061
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:12,360
not poor as in money wise, but just poor as in this is sad.

3062
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:14,360
They'll walk in and they'll see that and say,

3063
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:17,360
oh, I could flip it at 100K and then they buy it.

3064
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:20,280
And then this person will now defend the shop.

3065
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:23,240
They'll say, no, no, no, this shop is legit.

3066
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:24,680
I bought this for 50K.

3067
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,600
I got it half off.

3068
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:27,200
I can still sell it for 100K.

3069
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,040
I swear the shop, you know, they defend the practice

3070
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:33,800
because, you know, sunk cost fallacy, I honestly.

3071
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:38,080
It's the, it reminds me of like, you know,

3072
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:40,400
that in that HBomber guy had that video

3073
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:44,520
about the anti-vax stuff and it's those people who,

3074
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:48,320
it's like the most vociferous defenders

3075
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:52,080
of like the anti-vax guy, that one guy

3076
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:54,120
who like wrote the book and like is sort of

3077
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:55,320
the starter of the whole thing.

3078
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:56,880
It's like, those are like the people

3079
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,040
that like were victimized the most by him.

3080
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:03,160
Who like, like the people who have like lost the most

3081
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:06,320
to the whole thing are like the ones that are most invested

3082
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:09,480
in like convincing themselves that like it was not a scam

3083
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:10,560
and it was not all for nothing.

3084
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,840
Yeah, and I mean, I'm not saying all NFT trading websites

3085
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,880
are like this.

3086
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:19,160
I have a feeling most are, but I've definitely heard stories

3087
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:22,240
of, you know, somebody seeing a piece,

3088
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:25,480
cause you know, it's all anonymous with, you know,

3089
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,800
Ethereum, you know, you see it go to wallets,

3090
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,520
but you don't know who's who.

3091
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,680
So you'll see something listed starting at like 10 Ethereum,

3092
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:34,360
which is a lot of money.

3093
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:36,560
And then, you know, somebody buys it,

3094
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:39,120
but it could just be the same person, you know,

3095
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:41,440
making a new wallet to make it and just transferring

3096
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,960
their Ethereum from wallet to wallet, basically,

3097
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:47,000
and then selling it for eight and then it sells.

3098
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,320
Like there is a lot of that.

3099
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,800
People get scammed every day with NFTs.

3100
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:53,200
And I think that's the biggest issue of it.

3101
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:56,520
It's just, you know, it's easy to scam people.

3102
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,480
It's too easy.

3103
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:00,400
Have you guys seen that?

3104
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:01,400
Oh, look at it.

3105
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:02,240
What's up?

3106
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:03,520
Mm-hmm.

3107
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,800
I understand I'm looking at Bitcoin.

3108
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,360
Bitcoin is down slightly, but it's still just kind of

3109
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:09,200
hanging out.

3110
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,920
Ben, you can't keep paying attention to it now.

3111
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,200
And yet, and yet I just did and there's nothing

3112
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,200
you can do about it.

3113
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:20,200
Well, isn't that, surely exposing yourself to it

3114
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,280
continually will allow you to slip in and be like,

3115
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:27,320
but maybe I could make some big cash.

3116
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:28,160
Don't worry, I can fix them.

3117
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:29,000
Like go back in.

3118
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,080
I can change them.

3119
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,440
I don't think so.

3120
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:36,440
I really don't think I'm gonna buy at this point.

3121
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:39,720
I really think I've basically missed out

3122
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:40,880
on like the big gains.

3123
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,080
If there are any more gains to be made,

3124
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:46,360
I think I've missed out on the majority of them already.

3125
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:48,840
I'm not really thinking of buying at the moment.

3126
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:50,640
Right, clip that.

3127
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:51,480
Don't worry.

3128
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:53,400
Then repost it whenever it happens.

3129
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3130
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:57,800
Clip that and then use it against me later.

3131
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,560
Well, did I interrupt someone?

3132
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:03,720
Speaking of, when you said anti-vax,

3133
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:07,160
the first thing I remembered was the John-tron shit.

3134
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:12,400
Was that this week that John-tron went on that fucking rant?

3135
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:13,960
John-tron is such a fucking dude.

3136
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:17,720
I like his content, but when he gets into like political shit,

3137
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:18,840
that's where I like turn my brain off.

3138
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:19,680
I don't.

3139
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:21,280
His old videos were funny.

3140
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,680
He doesn't even make funny shit anymore.

3141
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:24,520
No, you know what?

3142
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,480
You know what's an app comparison?

3143
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:29,680
John-tron and his wife are like Trixie and Riley.

3144
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:30,520
They're both,

3145
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:33,360
because they were both giving out different information.

3146
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:34,200
How so?

3147
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:38,520
Okay, so John-tron's wife was being a reply guy

3148
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,080
and replying to a bunch of people.

3149
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:41,920
And she was saying stuff like,

3150
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:44,560
oh, he's not really anti-vax.

3151
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:46,840
He's just against the animal abuse saying one thing.

3152
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:48,520
And then John-tron's going like,

3153
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,520
yeah, we got to question the science here,

3154
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:51,520
like with the vaccine.

3155
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,680
Just like how Trixie was saying,

3156
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:57,720
oh, I said that just to her kid,

3157
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:00,120
but then Raleigh was saying, no, no, no.

3158
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:03,560
And then, oh, no, no, she was just clarifying.

3159
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:06,840
Yeah, I see what she's saying, I see what she's saying.

3160
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:08,840
Fucking weasels, fucking weasels,

3161
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,680
Weasley little liars, dude.

3162
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:12,200
Still lying, bro.

3163
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:15,000
I don't understand how John-tron could be

3164
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,080
very clearly saying something

3165
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:19,640
and his wife could be reply guying to everybody

3166
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:20,480
in the comments.

3167
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:22,400
No, no, no, he's not anti-vax.

3168
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:25,640
You see, he just hates the animal abuse, that's it.

3169
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:26,480
That's a coat.

3170
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:31,120
I've linked myself to this idiot.

3171
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:33,480
I don't know, I have no idea what she's like,

3172
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:36,200
but you defend someone like that.

3173
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:39,120
So obviously being like a stupid,

3174
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:44,120
like anti-science, like numpty, that's a cope.

3175
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,520
It's a cope when you're trying to defend that.

3176
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:50,000
Yeah, of course.

3177
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,200
I wonder if, fucking, I wonder if,

3178
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:55,920
speaking, just a funny note,

3179
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,920
I saw a funny tweet from Nino earlier today

3180
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,840
that Trixie retweeted and I thought it was

3181
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:07,080
particularly good, it was,

3182
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,280
Nino says, I've always hated numbers

3183
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:11,160
and people who think purely with them,

3184
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,920
those who are ruled by arithmetic

3185
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:16,400
are the actual root of suffering in this world.

3186
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:19,280
So Nino says, numbers, I don't believe in them

3187
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:24,040
and Trixie's like, hell yeah, dude, this rules.

3188
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:27,680
That's the sort of tweet you make

3189
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:29,680
when you're stuck on a mass problem

3190
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:31,440
in like middle school or something.

3191
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:34,520
It's like, I don't, I mean, I really think,

3192
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:37,440
it's just like, yeah, I don't believe data.

3193
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:39,400
I believe anecdotes.

3194
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,440
I believe anecdotal evidence.

3195
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:42,120
Oh yeah, that's probably what it's about.

3196
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:46,040
Yeah, I think that's the only takeaway I can take.

3197
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:48,160
I say all these things and people come at me

3198
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,720
with numbers proving me wrong and I'm like, man.

3199
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:53,040
And I'm like, bro, but like I experienced-

3200
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,440
But I inferred it, okay?

3201
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:56,600
I inferred it, I'm smart.

3202
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:00,160
I know a guy who said something happened one time, idiot.

3203
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,920
Yeah, literally that's what it is.

3204
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:05,600
Did you, did you two talk about-

3205
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,160
That's the mindset, that's the mindset.

3206
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,000
Facts don't matter.

3207
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,040
Did you two talk about the grade A under A?

3208
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:14,160
It literally feels over reels, literally feels over reels.

3209
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,760
Should I comment on that?

3210
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:19,760
Should I reply to Nino and be like, yeah, feels over reels?

3211
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:21,120
No, he wouldn't even get it.

3212
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,760
He wouldn't even understand if I try to criticize it.

3213
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:27,800
Did you two talk about the grade A under A corona video?

3214
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:31,800
No, it got deleted by YouTube.

3215
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:35,800
I think I heard about that, but I don't care about grade A.

3216
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,800
So I don't know why, what do you do?

3217
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:41,800
So he made a video using data from when the coronavirus

3218
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:44,800
first started becoming a thing in China.

3219
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:48,800
So about two-year-old data and he was basically saying-

3220
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,800
Was this a recent video?

3221
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:53,800
Yes, this was like within the past week and a half, I believe.

3222
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:57,800
It got taken down like within 24 hours

3223
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:59,800
and he got a channel strike.

3224
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,800
But he was basically-

3225
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,800
Oh, because it was so incorrect.

3226
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:04,800
Well, he was saying-

3227
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,800
Was he saying the virus?

3228
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:09,800
His argument was, listen, here's data from when

3229
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:12,800
the virus first escaped in China.

3230
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,800
As you could see, it only kills very old people

3231
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,800
and very unhealthy people.

3232
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,800
Therefore, 99% of the population are safe

3233
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:22,800
and you don't have to give a shit.

3234
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:26,800
That's so intelligent.

3235
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:29,800
Oh, wait, no, I think I did see a bit of this.

3236
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:33,800
It was like, oh, so 99%,

3237
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:36,800
well, that means only like 100,000 people died.

3238
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,800
So the virus isn't even that bad

3239
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:40,800
and it was like brushing over the fact

3240
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,800
that 100,000 people died.

3241
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,800
That's still a lot of people.

3242
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:45,800
That's not a good thing.

3243
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:46,800
We should try to avoid even that.

3244
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:49,800
Yeah, but it's 99%, yeah, but it's 99%.

3245
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:51,800
99% of people survived.

3246
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:55,800
If you go through a crowd of 100 people

3247
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:57,800
and you only shoot one of them,

3248
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:59,800
then you're 99% safe,

3249
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:01,800
which means you're safe.

3250
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:02,800
That's very safe.

3251
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:04,800
99% is like a big percent.

3252
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:07,800
Yeah, I mean, it's no surprise to anyone

3253
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,800
that grade A is a complete idiot

3254
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:11,800
when it comes to anything.

3255
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,800
Yeah, I was honestly surprised

3256
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:15,800
YouTube even let that video release

3257
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:17,800
because it was set to premiere

3258
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:20,800
for like two days before it came out.

3259
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:23,800
But they took it down pretty fast afterwards.

3260
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,800
Look at it.

3261
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:27,800
Did they take it down?

3262
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:30,800
Well,

3263
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:34,800
I just don't personally trust any influencer

3264
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:38,800
with anything that can be taken out of sensitive matter.

3265
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:42,800
I would say that's probably an excellent position.

3266
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:45,800
If I watch a YouTuber

3267
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,800
and he is like content

3268
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,800
because of him screaming and yelling,

3269
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:53,800
I don't want to hear his political opinions

3270
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:55,800
on why the left is bad

3271
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:59,800
and COVID is actually made by the bourgeoisie, you know?

3272
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:05,800
Yeah, bourgeoisie is possible for a lot of things,

3273
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:07,800
but probably not COVID.

3274
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:10,800
I think the word influencer is too nice.

3275
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,800
It should be like manipulator.

3276
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:13,800
That's what...

3277
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:15,800
Hey, I'm a manipulator online.

3278
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:16,800
I mean, it's fine.

3279
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,800
Yeah, it's kind of true.

3280
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,800
It's not...

3281
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:21,800
It ain't wrong.

3282
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:22,800
Do you guys want...

3283
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:23,800
We've been going for a while.

3284
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,800
Do you guys want to move into voicemails?

3285
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:26,800
Oh, um...

3286
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:28,800
Do you guys want to start listening to voicemail?

3287
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,800
Unless there's anything else you want to get out there

3288
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:31,800
before we start?

3289
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:34,800
I have one thing to do.

3290
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:37,800
You know, last time I was on your show,

3291
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:40,800
I feel really bad because I softball-gibbed

3292
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:43,800
with a very, very clean ABDL post.

3293
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:47,800
So, this time I've decided not to softball you.

3294
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:48,800
Oh.

3295
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,800
So, I have two ABDL posts.

3296
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:53,800
One for Gibb, one for Ben.

3297
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:55,800
All right.

3298
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,800
All right.

3299
02:20:57,800 --> 02:20:59,800
If I must.

3300
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:01,800
If I must, let's have them.

3301
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,800
All right, I will post Gibb's first.

3302
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,800
It's in links.

3303
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:06,800
Okay.

3304
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,800
And for those of you who don't know...

3305
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,800
This is a Reddit post.

3306
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,800
These are Reddit posts of the variety

3307
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,800
that one might find on Shreddit.

3308
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,800
We have a segment at the end of the episode,

3309
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,800
every episode, ABDL posts of the week,

3310
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:21,800
because it's not hard to go on the ABDL subreddit

3311
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:23,800
and find a post to just make fun of.

3312
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,800
That's funny.

3313
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:27,800
Oh, God, I'm reading this one.

3314
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:30,800
I'm gonna read it without reading it first.

3315
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,800
Okay.

3316
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,800
First time messing.

3317
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,800
Didn't know what to expect.

3318
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,800
Not safe for work.

3319
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,800
I'm home alone right now

3320
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:43,800
and figured that'd be the best time for some little antics.

3321
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:45,800
I have my p-patchy.

3322
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:46,800
What is that?

3323
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,800
Passy.

3324
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:48,800
Passifier.

3325
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:49,800
Oh, my.

3326
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:50,800
Okay.

3327
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:52,800
Why'd you need to...

3328
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,800
He said we're on a nickname basis.

3329
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:57,800
I have my passy, my bottle, and I'm padded.

3330
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:59,800
I felt the pressure in my bowels.

3331
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:02,800
And while I hadn't anticipated messing,

3332
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,800
it seemed like a good opportunity.

3333
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:07,800
So now, here I am,

3334
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:10,800
in a soggy, stinky, good night,

3335
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,800
trying hard not to let my diaper leak

3336
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:16,800
and laying on my side because I haven't tried sitting in it.

3337
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,800
Any ideas of what I should do now?

3338
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:19,800
Nine comments.

3339
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:20,800
He doesn't say do now.

3340
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:21,800
What I should now.

3341
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:23,800
Any ideas of what I should now.

3342
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,800
Not that that matters much.

3343
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:27,800
Um, soggy, stinky, good night

3344
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:31,800
is a fucking winner of a phrase.

3345
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,800
So, soggy, stinky, good night.

3346
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,800
So, what advice should you give them?

3347
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:41,800
What should they do now?

3348
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:42,800
What should they now?

3349
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:43,800
Nine comments.

3350
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,800
Well, I'll tell you what they shouldn't do.

3351
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:47,800
Ninety percent upvoted.

3352
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,800
Ninety percent upvoted is the funniest part.

3353
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:52,800
What they probably shouldn't do is remove the diaper,

3354
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:55,800
clean the feces off of their body,

3355
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:59,800
and get a job.

3356
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:01,800
Become a productive member of society.

3357
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:02,800
Just working McDonald's.

3358
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:05,800
Yeah, really, if you think about it, this...

3359
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:08,800
You shouldn't let a child sit in their diaper

3360
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,800
in their soggy stinky.

3361
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:11,800
It sounds so...

3362
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:12,800
It's child abuse.

3363
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,800
It sounds so painful.

3364
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,800
It sounds uncomfortable.

3365
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:20,800
I feel sorry for him, but he loves it, I guess.

3366
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,800
Oh, God.

3367
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,800
Okay, well, here's mine, I guess.

3368
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,800
That reaction.

3369
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:27,800
All right.

3370
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,800
Okay.

3371
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:33,800
Do you make your guy's penis get smaller in the scene?

3372
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:38,800
That's S-M-O-L, smaller in the scene, NSFW.

3373
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:43,800
So this cold weather and my peepee being effected in that way

3374
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:47,800
has me wondering, do you ever do things to make your 18-plus

3375
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:49,800
baby's penis to shrink?

3376
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:52,800
Like maybe having them do work in the cold or other methods,

3377
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:56,800
so when it's change time, you're able to comment about his penis.

3378
02:23:56,800 --> 02:23:58,800
Sorry if this is too much.

3379
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:02,800
There's so much to unpack here.

3380
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:07,800
Oh, so this is from a partner of a baby ABDL person.

3381
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,800
Yes.

3382
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,800
Yeah.

3383
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:10,800
Okay, you know...

3384
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:13,800
They make them go work in the cold, so they're pee-

3385
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,800
They make them do something cold to make their penis shrink.

3386
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:16,800
So wait, but...

3387
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:18,800
So that when they change their diaper, they have a little,

3388
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,800
a small penis, more reminiscent of a baby's penis.

3389
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:25,800
So their partner messes in a diaper and they change that

3390
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:31,800
and they want to focus on calling out a small penis.

3391
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:33,800
I mean...

3392
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:36,800
I mean, if that's...

3393
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,800
If that's what they're into.

3394
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:45,800
Let's make an NFT of these posts.

3395
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:48,800
And it'll be the worst thing of all time.

3396
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:49,800
Jesus.

3397
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:55,800
I've... I've just... I've just... I've just... I've just... I've just...

3398
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:58,800
I feel like I have nothing to say about that one.

3399
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,800
It just speaks for itself.

3400
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,800
All right.

3401
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:05,800
That one, for some reason, only 65% upvoted.

3402
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:09,800
Yeah, people didn't seem big fans of that one.

3403
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:10,800
I don't know.

3404
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:11,800
I'm not sure what it is.

3405
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:14,800
They like their baby penis big, I guess.

3406
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:15,800
Honestly.

3407
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:17,800
Honestly?

3408
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,800
Same, though.

3409
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,800
All right.

3410
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:21,800
Real quick.

3411
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:24,800
Where the fuck did you find these?

3412
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:26,800
Oh, reddit.com.

3413
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:27,800
These are on the...

3414
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:28,800
R slash ABDL.

3415
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:31,800
It's the adult baby diaper lover subreddit.

3416
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:36,800
I literally was on there for less than five seconds when I pulled these two posts.

3417
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,800
Like, I did not have to look.

3418
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:39,800
Yeah.

3419
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:42,800
This is about what I would expect.

3420
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:46,800
I mean, what do you expect when you go on R slash ABDL?

3421
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:49,800
Like, honestly, you're the problem here, all right?

3422
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:51,800
These people are just trying to live.

3423
02:25:51,800 --> 02:25:55,800
They're in their natural habitat and you're going in and you're trying to fuck with them.

3424
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:56,800
Hold on.

3425
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:58,800
I have one more to show you.

3426
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:00,800
Now, we did read this in an episode.

3427
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:01,800
Oh, God.

3428
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:04,800
But this is the pin post on there.

3429
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:05,800
Give me one.

3430
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:06,800
All right.

3431
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:07,800
Pinned, huh?

3432
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,800
Like, safety pinned?

3433
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:11,800
Like, my dipey.

3434
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:17,800
No, like, this is the head mod making an announcement to the subreddit.

3435
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:19,800
Yes, I know, I know.

3436
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:20,800
There you go.

3437
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:25,800
Reminder, don't be creeps on other subs.

3438
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:28,800
I'm appalled I have to post this once more.

3439
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:35,800
We've had reports that some of our members have been trying to engage in a creepy way with people from incontinence subs.

3440
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:36,800
Don't do that.

3441
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:40,800
It's creepy and you give all of us ABDL peeps a bad rep.

3442
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:46,800
We're working hard to make ABDL more accepted, but this kind of behavior will make many people think we're creeps.

3443
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:49,800
Several people got banned from our sub because of this behavior.

3444
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:53,800
It's perfectly fine to participate in those subs normally.

3445
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:58,800
The F, you're actually incontinent.

3446
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:01,800
We know there's overlap and we want both communities to get along.

3447
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:05,800
Thank you and stay padded, Bottle Emoji, whether you need it or not.

3448
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,800
So what happened?

3449
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:16,800
Dude, ending my ABDL YouTube channel with, hey guys, thanks for watching and remember, stay padded, whether you need it or not.

3450
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,800
Signing out.

3451
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:18,800
I'll get you the next time.

3452
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:21,800
Hey, everyone, it's Crinklebottom, seven flowers, seven ears.

3453
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:25,800
I'm going to end my daffodil video by saying that.

3454
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,800
Stay padded, bro.

3455
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:29,800
Make sure not to shit yourself too hard.

3456
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:30,800
Stay padded.

3457
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,800
So wait, what's an incontinence subreddit?

3458
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,800
Incontinence is where...

3459
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:36,800
What do you think it is?

3460
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:39,800
No, I know what it is, but why would you have a subreddit for it?

3461
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:41,800
Because you like it or because you just know?

3462
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:45,800
No, I think it's probably dealing with the medical issue.

3463
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:55,800
The deep lore of this post is that people from the ABDL subreddit were going onto the incontinence subreddit and seeing pictures of women and commenting,

3464
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:58,800
hey girl, do you shit with that ass?

3465
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:02,800
See, that doesn't sound like a very little thing to do.

3466
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:06,800
That sounds like something any creepy guy would do.

3467
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:10,800
Or anyone who's a fan of Tommy Carson.

3468
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:15,800
I assume they were doing weird little role play stuff.

3469
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:16,800
No.

3470
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:18,800
Or asking people about their diapers.

3471
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:19,800
No.

3472
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:24,800
It was these people hitting on others for medical disorder that they fetishized.

3473
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,800
Yes, okay.

3474
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:29,800
It's nice to be valued.

3475
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:30,800
It's nice to be valued.

3476
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:36,800
I guess I never really thought of going to a subreddit for a medical issue.

3477
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,800
Yeah, that's a new one.

3478
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:38,800
I've never heard of this.

3479
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:39,800
Sure.

3480
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:40,800
I guess it makes sense.

3481
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:41,800
It's like support groups.

3482
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:42,800
Makes sense.

3483
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:43,800
Yeah.

3484
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:44,800
Yeah, basically.

3485
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:45,800
Or asking advice on how to...

3486
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:51,800
Yeah, I know certain subreddits for...

3487
02:28:51,800 --> 02:29:00,800
If your kid gets diagnosed with something, how do you deal with that as a support type aspect?

3488
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,800
Yeah.

3489
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:02,800
Yes.

3490
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:03,800
That makes sense.

3491
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:05,800
But commenting that...

3492
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:06,800
And then ABDL...

3493
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:08,800
Hey, yo, you shit with that ass?

3494
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:10,800
Oh my fucking god.

3495
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:12,800
This actually reminds me.

3496
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:18,800
There is actually some overlap because there are some members of the ABDL subreddit that

3497
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:22,800
quote have achieved the next level of human evolution.

3498
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:23,800
End quote.

3499
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:27,800
And these people that say that basically just train their body to be incontinence.

3500
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:32,800
They took away their ability to control their own bladder and they'll go on the ABDL subreddit

3501
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,800
and brag about it.

3502
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,800
Like, ah, yes, I am now better than everyone.

3503
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:38,800
I have achieved the next stage of human evolution.

3504
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:43,800
I have removed my ability to control when I shit.

3505
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:44,800
Except they're being...

3506
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:46,800
They're not being ironic.

3507
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,800
They're being serious.

3508
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:49,800
So that's why there is some overlap.

3509
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:56,800
They happily train their body to just lose this ability and it's so weird.

3510
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:58,800
I want...

3511
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:00,800
I want to move on voicemails.

3512
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,800
Yeah.

3513
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:02,800
I don't want...

3514
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:03,800
I don't want...

3515
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:04,800
No more.

3516
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,800
No more.

3517
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:06,800
No more.

3518
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:07,800
I've had enough.

3519
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:08,800
I've had enough.

3520
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:09,800
All right.

3521
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,300
This is the first voicemail.

3522
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,800
Here we go.

3523
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:14,800
This one is called...

3524
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:15,800
Fuck Trixie.

3525
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:17,800
All right.

3526
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:20,800
On the count of three, let's listen.

3527
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,800
Three, two, one, go.

3528
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:29,800
Okay.

3529
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,800
What was that?

3530
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:31,800
This is not...

3531
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:32,800
I think...

3532
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:36,800
I believe he said, I hope Trixie chokes on a fucking dick and dies.

3533
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:39,800
I believe that is what was said there.

3534
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:40,800
I heard dick and pole.

3535
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,800
I couldn't hear it because it was coming out of my sp...

3536
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,800
I thought bowls.

3537
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:44,800
Okay.

3538
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:45,800
Well, whatever.

3539
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,800
Okay.

3540
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,800
I mean, whatever.

3541
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:48,800
Yeah.

3542
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,800
Okay.

3543
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:55,800
The next voicemail is called Beyond the Pale.

3544
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:57,800
Here we go.

3545
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,800
Three, two, one, go.

3546
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:06,800
I just want to say that after the Golden Witches coked out like shitfests on Twitter today,

3547
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:09,800
I'm upping my pledges to the various Patreons.

3548
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:12,800
She can go burn hell.

3549
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:21,800
She's a vile, wretched, like third rank intellect narcissist that's eating this fucking loser.

3550
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:22,800
Fuck off and die.

3551
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:23,800
I would agree with all that.

3552
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:24,800
I would agree with all that.

3553
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:28,800
I love you, Ben, Gib, Tom, fuck.

3554
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:31,800
Yes, definitely true.

3555
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:33,800
Third rate intellect is the one that doesn't...

3556
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:36,800
People talk a lot about what a shitty person she is.

3557
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:37,800
Nobody talks about that.

3558
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:38,800
She's kind of just fucking stupid.

3559
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:43,800
She's kind of just like low intelligence, like idiot, and always has been.

3560
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:47,800
We need more people talking about that one.

3561
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:53,800
Next voicemail is called Why Would Trixie Say That?

3562
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:56,800
Three, two, one, go.

3563
02:31:56,800 --> 02:32:03,800
I'm sure lots has already been said about Trixie and her weird little podcast segment,

3564
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:06,800
where she just makes a pool of herself.

3565
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:15,800
But one thing which I especially did not like was the criticizing of Gib for making funny

3566
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:24,800
little words and phrases, like you give him an inch, and they'll take your splinch.

3567
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:29,800
You're just messing with words, saying funny things that just sound funny, even if they

3568
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:33,800
don't make sense, saying that, oh, Gib's not funny.

3569
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:34,800
Why?

3570
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,800
Why would you say that?

3571
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:38,800
Gib is funny.

3572
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:39,800
That's funny.

3573
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:42,800
It's funny when she said splinch.

3574
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:47,300
I mean, that's the humor that Gib's videos have always had.

3575
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:48,800
That's the humor she's always had.

3576
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,800
And it's always been funny.

3577
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,800
Trixie used to think that was funny.

3578
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:57,800
Because it's funny.

3579
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:02,800
It was such a nothing little comment to then pick it up, like, oh, clip that out of the

3580
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:03,800
episode.

3581
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:05,800
Oh, I got to bring this to show my dick show friends.

3582
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:07,800
What a loser this person is.

3583
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,800
They're so not funny because they said this word.

3584
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:11,800
They made up a silly word randomly.

3585
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:15,800
I make silly words without really thinking.

3586
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:21,800
And instead of making fun of someone and laughing at their misfortune or whatever, passes for

3587
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:23,800
jokes on shows like that.

3588
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:24,800
Yeah.

3589
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:27,800
It's just, it's just, I don't know.

3590
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:30,800
That was such a nothing thing as well.

3591
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:35,800
It really, it really was like, why, why even bother talking about this?

3592
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:41,800
Next one is called Go Gib exclamation point three, two, one, go.

3593
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:46,800
Hey, after that whole crap with Trixie and what are these podcasts?

3594
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:48,800
I had one thing on my mind.

3595
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:51,800
And I hope I speak for others as well.

3596
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:55,800
If I just say, hey, Gib, we love you.

3597
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:58,800
You're a great and your best girl.

3598
02:33:58,800 --> 02:33:59,800
Peace.

3599
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:00,800
Peace.

3600
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:01,800
Thanks.

3601
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:02,800
Thank you.

3602
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:03,800
Thank you.

3603
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:10,800
I'm changing my voice to be more feminine.

3604
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:12,800
Thanks for the voicemail.

3605
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:20,800
Next one is called I'm so sweepy three, two, one, go.

3606
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,800
Wow.

3607
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:22,800
I'm pooped.

3608
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:23,800
Gosh.

3609
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:29,800
Has anyone else noticed that when you're tired, it's easier to go to sleep compared to

3610
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:33,800
when you're not tired?

3611
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:35,800
It's just found that interesting.

3612
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:39,800
Anyone else that noticed this?

3613
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:41,800
Please give me one.

3614
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,800
Okay.

3615
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:49,800
This is a reference to I think Trixie's last sub stack article, which is two pages of

3616
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:56,800
her opining about how concentrating is hard sometimes and how it's easier to go to sleep

3617
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:57,800
when you're tired.

3618
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:00,800
Wait, is that what she said?

3619
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:01,800
Yes.

3620
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:02,800
Yes.

3621
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:06,800
How on earth could I guess weed?

3622
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:16,800
I mean, it's sort of supposed to be like a metaphor for like, it's like, do things.

3623
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:24,800
It's like, hey, do things because if you do things, you'll be tired and you'll have an

3624
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,800
easier time sleeping.

3625
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,800
Oh my God.

3626
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:30,800
And you won't be forcing yourself to sleep when you're not tired.

3627
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:32,800
That is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

3628
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:34,800
It doesn't make any sense.

3629
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,800
That's so strange.

3630
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:37,800
I don't get it.

3631
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:38,800
It's stupid.

3632
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:39,800
Is she getting it?

3633
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:40,800
Okay.

3634
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:41,800
I don't know.

3635
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:43,800
Is she trying to say it?

3636
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:47,800
This was the one that she wrote that she had to furiously tell.

3637
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:50,800
It was after she posted the What Are These? podcast thing.

3638
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,800
She spent the rest of the night writing that article.

3639
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:58,800
She passed out writing that article about how it's easier to go to sleep when you're tired

3640
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,800
and then woke up the next day and finished it.

3641
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:03,800
And it has nothing to do with any of the stuff on Twitter.

3642
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:04,800
It's completely unrelated.

3643
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:08,800
It's just a totally pointless, like, concentrating is hard and sometimes I don't like when people

3644
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:09,800
talk to me.

3645
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:12,800
And also, sleeping is hard unless you're tired.

3646
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:13,800
Okay.

3647
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:14,800
Thanks for reading.

3648
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:15,800
Bye.

3649
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:20,800
Is she trying to imply that, oh, I know that you sleep better if you're constantly busy.

3650
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:22,800
I'm such a hard worker, Teehee.

3651
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:25,800
I think it's supposed to be something like that.

3652
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:26,800
Yeah.

3653
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:32,800
It's about working hard to get shit done.

3654
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,800
Get shit done is the point.

3655
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:38,800
The next one is called Staggering If True, and it's not a voicemail.

3656
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:40,800
It's a Reddit link.

3657
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:41,800
Oh, no.

3658
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:42,800
So I guess I will...

3659
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:43,800
How could you, Ben?

3660
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:44,800
I guess I will...

3661
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,800
Oh, here it is.

3662
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,800
Link doesn't work.

3663
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:51,800
Staggering If True, and here's the image.

3664
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:53,800
It's this one.

3665
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:56,800
I've seen that.

3666
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:58,800
I haven't played Celeste.

3667
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:01,800
I haven't beaten it, but I've played a bunch of it.

3668
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:02,800
That's pretty good.

3669
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:04,800
It's a good video game.

3670
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:07,800
It's a fun platformer.

3671
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:11,800
It's about how trans people can double jump, but nobody appreciates.

3672
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:12,800
Yes.

3673
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:15,800
Nobody gets to that.

3674
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:16,800
Okay.

3675
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:18,800
Good joke.

3676
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:25,800
Next voicemail is called Trixie Disavows Hatred.

3677
02:37:25,800 --> 02:37:27,800
Here we go.

3678
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:28,800
There it is.

3679
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,800
Three, two, one, go.

3680
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,800
If you're hateful, you're wrong.

3681
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,800
You are wrong.

3682
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,800
You are wrong.

3683
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:38,800
You are wrong.

3684
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:39,800
True.

3685
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:42,800
This is a smart person must have written that.

3686
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,800
That bar.

3687
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:50,800
Next voicemail is called...

3688
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:53,800
Next voicemail is called Riley the Golden Pimp.

3689
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:57,800
Three, two, one, go.

3690
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:00,800
Hey guys, it's Riley the Golden Pimp.

3691
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:01,800
Cowboys.

3692
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:03,800
Halloween.

3693
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:08,800
What?

3694
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:10,800
Insightful.

3695
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:11,800
I get the ball coin.

3696
02:38:11,800 --> 02:38:14,800
I make things happen.

3697
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,800
I make things happen.

3698
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:17,800
I produce.

3699
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:19,800
I'm a producer.

3700
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:21,800
I'm a visionary.

3701
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:23,800
Best thing.

3702
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:24,800
You know how it is.

3703
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:25,800
I do.

3704
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:28,800
Do you like receding hairlines?

3705
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:33,800
Do you say receding hairlines?

3706
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:34,800
Cool.

3707
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:39,800
I like the nondescript diddly-diddly noises for what producing sounds like.

3708
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:42,800
Just slurping.

3709
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:44,800
I'm producing.

3710
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:49,800
I'm producing.

3711
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:50,800
Okay.

3712
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:52,800
Next one is called Cats.

3713
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:57,800
Three, two, one, go.

3714
02:38:57,800 --> 02:38:59,800
It's a dead cat.

3715
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:02,800
Oh no, it's a dead, dead cat.

3716
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:05,800
What we gonna do about the dead cat?

3717
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:08,800
I'm so very sad because we've got a dead cat.

3718
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:13,800
One minute this cat was alive and now this cat is a dead cat.

3719
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:18,800
Oh no, I'm so sad about this dead cat.

3720
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:21,800
Oh yes I am.

3721
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:26,800
It was such a good nice little cat when it was alive.

3722
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:29,800
Now it's just a dead cat.

3723
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:31,800
Okay, thanks for the song.

3724
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:35,800
Next one is called Kodoma.

3725
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:37,800
Three, two, one, go.

3726
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:39,800
I'm still listening to the dead cat.

3727
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:41,800
No, three, two, one, go.

3728
02:39:41,800 --> 02:39:45,800
Okay, I'm sorry if this has literally nothing to do with the current episode,

3729
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:47,800
but I have a slight feeling that it probably is.

3730
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,800
I'm guessing we're probably talking about a lot of how Trixie and...

3731
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:52,800
A bit, yeah, a bit.

3732
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:54,800
Just absolute idiots.

3733
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,800
But I need to like put a bit of highlight on Riley

3734
02:39:56,800 --> 02:40:00,800
and how much of a fucking in-step moron Riley actually is.

3735
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:04,800
This motherfucker, and ironically thinks that just because Trixie is trans,

3736
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,800
she's exempt of being called out on transphobia.

3737
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:08,800
I've been arguing with this motherfucker for 20 minutes on Twitter.

3738
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:09,800
He explicitly thinks that.

3739
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:12,800
And he's not understanding any point anybody's trying to make.

3740
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:14,800
I think Shreddit tried arguing with him.

3741
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:15,800
Nothing.

3742
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:17,800
He's just some fucking weird stoner.

3743
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:18,800
He's a weird guy.

3744
02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:19,800
I don't like him.

3745
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:21,800
He might be the stupidest.

3746
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:23,800
He might actually be the stupidest.

3747
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:24,800
He is very stupid.

3748
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:26,800
I don't know what.

3749
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:27,800
I'm sorry.

3750
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:28,800
Okay, bye.

3751
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,800
Base Shreddit call-out.

3752
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:31,800
It's pretty dumb.

3753
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:33,800
Base Shreddit call-out.

3754
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:35,800
Yeah, he, um...

3755
02:40:35,800 --> 02:40:41,800
I described him recently on Twitter to someone who asked like who is Riley.

3756
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:45,800
I said he's just some stoner vagrant who's good at kissing ass.

3757
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:48,800
That's what he does is he finds like people who's like money he wants

3758
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:52,800
and he just kisses their ass until like they like say that they're his friend.

3759
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:56,800
And then he can say, oh, I'm Dick Masterson's producer.

3760
02:40:56,800 --> 02:40:58,800
Oh, I'm Yeeg Studio's producer.

3761
02:40:58,800 --> 02:40:59,800
I have all these credits.

3762
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:02,800
I'm a successful musician or whatever because I have,

3763
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:07,800
I'm on a music YouTube channel with 300,000 subscribers or whatever.

3764
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:08,800
Right?

3765
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:10,800
Fake it till you make it.

3766
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:12,800
I'm looking to the, to the, to the ultimate experience.

3767
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:15,800
I do have to say this and you'll probably appreciate this, Ben.

3768
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:20,800
Um, so my co-host Kai the Kitty Lewis, he is actually a fan of the Dick Show.

3769
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:22,800
He keeps up with it.

3770
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:25,800
Uh, and we were talking about the argument with Riley and he says,

3771
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:30,800
no, no, see the funniest part about all this is that anyone that is deep into

3772
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:34,800
the Dick Show lore knows that they just keep Riley around to laugh at them.

3773
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:35,800
Like Dick...

3774
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:36,800
Is that true?

3775
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:39,800
I don't understand Riley's relationship to the Dick Show at all.

3776
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:43,800
So apparently Dick hires people just for the meme.

3777
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:45,800
He doesn't expect them to actually do anything.

3778
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:47,800
That's why Riley doesn't actually do anything.

3779
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:50,800
Like he just keeps them around for a circus.

3780
02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:52,800
Does he pay them?

3781
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,800
Uh, I don't know.

3782
02:41:53,800 --> 02:41:56,800
Why would you just pay people for nothing?

3783
02:41:56,800 --> 02:42:01,800
Okay, I don't see what's so entertaining about Riley that I would want to keep him

3784
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:05,800
around for, for amusement, but like, I guess it makes, I mean, I know,

3785
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:09,800
but I know, like obviously he's not like, obviously he's not useful for anything.

3786
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:11,800
So I mean, this kind of makes sense.

3787
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:15,800
Like there's no other reason I could think of that you would want him around.

3788
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:21,800
Uh, so I, I, fair enough, fair enough.

3789
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:28,800
I could imagine Dick finding some amusement in the idea of, of Riley thinking that he's

3790
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:32,800
the producer of the Dick Show and actually not really doing anything.

3791
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:33,800
I guess.

3792
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:34,800
Yeah.

3793
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:36,800
That's kind of funny.

3794
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:37,800
Yeah.

3795
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:41,800
It would be, I would, I might find it funny if, if, if it weren't so, if I weren't like

3796
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:45,800
personally annoyed by him on like a, on like, on like an in-person basis.

3797
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:48,800
I mean by in-person, I mean on Twitter.

3798
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:57,800
Um, next voicemail is, uh, is called, it's called, uh, three, two, one, go.

3799
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:59,800
What's up, fuckers?

3800
02:42:59,800 --> 02:43:01,800
It's me, Riley.

3801
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:03,800
Oh my God, he's here.

3802
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:13,800
Hey, Ben and Gib, you are, respectively, a not cool dude and not cool lady.

3803
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:15,800
What the fuckers?

3804
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:17,800
How could you, how could you fucking say so?

3805
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:20,800
I can't believe you'd be so transphobic.

3806
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:26,800
I can't believe you would say something like that on national television.

3807
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:33,800
Ah, but you gotta respect, ah, but you gotta hand it to him though.

3808
02:43:33,800 --> 02:43:36,800
But you gotta hand it to him.

3809
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:38,800
What do I gotta hand to him?

3810
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:39,800
Uh, whatever you got.

3811
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:41,800
Whatever you got, empty your pockets right now.

3812
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:44,800
Give him, hand it over, fork it over.

3813
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:45,800
Oh, damn.

3814
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:48,800
Oh, the one ring, oh, the one ring was in my pocket.

3815
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:49,800
Ah, darn.

3816
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:51,800
Ah, Gollum guessed it right.

3817
02:43:51,800 --> 02:43:53,800
My, my estrogen podrance.

3818
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:58,800
Uh, next, next one is called Goll, question mark.

3819
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:01,800
Uh, three, two, one, go.

3820
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:03,800
Cat and phantom horn.

3821
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:06,800
Strange things been happening down here in Equestria.

3822
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:09,800
A mysterious pony named Nylon Tusk has come to Ponyville.

3823
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:10,800
Nylon Tusk.

3824
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:12,800
And he started selling something called Ponycone.

3825
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:15,800
And now everyone's gone apples buying and selling them to each other.

3826
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:18,800
I'm worried, Phant, what if Ponycone ain't worth a bit in a few years?

3827
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:21,800
Where Pinkie Pie's already lost 30 nasinotic?

3828
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:23,800
That was her and Aaron and Phant.

3829
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:25,800
I'm not buying into Tusk, Esteem.

3830
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:27,800
He's trying to run off with every pony's bitch.

3831
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:29,800
So you know what I did instead?

3832
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:32,800
I took my money down to the main Manhattan Stock Exchange.

3833
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:34,800
I got invested in the pony tick industry.

3834
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:36,800
You know what I bought shares of?

3835
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:37,800
Apple.

3836
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:47,800
It would be unironically based if like a kid show like My Little Pony had an episode about like kids don't buy crypto.

3837
02:44:47,800 --> 02:44:52,800
It's a scam.

3838
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:54,800
Thanks, Applejack.

3839
02:44:54,800 --> 02:44:56,800
Oh, Nylon Tusk, Elon Musk.

3840
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:57,800
I get it.

3841
02:44:57,800 --> 02:44:58,800
I get it.

3842
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:00,800
Very pretty good.

3843
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:01,800
Pretty good.

3844
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:02,800
You know what?

3845
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:05,800
Just an unironically good and cool voicemail that I liked.

3846
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:06,800
Hell yeah.

3847
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:08,800
Also wait, that was wrong.

3848
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:13,800
I hated it when Applejack buying stocks and Apple, but other than that it was good.

3849
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:15,800
I didn't see it coming.

3850
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:16,800
Maybe I'm just stupid.

3851
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:18,800
By the way, sorry, that was the wrong voicemail.

3852
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:21,800
That one was actually called Applejack.

3853
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:24,800
This is the one that is actually called Goal, question mark.

3854
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:27,800
Can we put Applejack in the voice grail?

3855
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:28,800
Yeah.

3856
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:30,800
I think Applejack the character from My Little Pony.

3857
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:31,800
I think she deserves it.

3858
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:33,800
I think Applejack deserves to go in the voice grail.

3859
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:36,800
I think she's earned her place.

3860
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:40,800
That's the first placement in there for a while.

3861
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:45,800
Okay, this one is called Goal, question mark three, two, one, go.

3862
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:55,800
And during your Patreon podcast, question everything, stretching your fast forward.

3863
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:56,800
Six inches now.

3864
02:45:56,800 --> 02:46:01,800
What's your question mark?

3865
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:06,800
Zena, fucking hierarchy.

3866
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:08,800
No, I'm happy with six inches.

3867
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:11,800
I've achieved everything I set out to do.

3868
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:14,800
I've broken through, I've broken down the impossible already.

3869
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:17,800
It's time for me to retire at the top.

3870
02:46:17,800 --> 02:46:20,800
Next voicemail is not a voicemail.

3871
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:21,800
It is an Imgirlink.

3872
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:23,800
Here's the image.

3873
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:27,800
What is this?

3874
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:31,800
Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned,

3875
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:36,800
but what they have read has not penetrated, has not stuck root in their minds.

3876
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:40,800
So they do not know how to use it, and their class feelings remain as of old.

3877
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:43,800
Others are very conceited and having learned some book phrases,

3878
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:46,800
think themselves terrific and are very cocky.

3879
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:50,800
But whenever a storm blows up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers

3880
02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:52,800
and the majority of the peasants.

3881
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:54,800
They waver while the latter stand firm.

3882
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:57,800
They equivocate while the latter are forthright.

3883
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:03,800
Mao Zedong, the little red book, quotations from Chairman Mao Zetong.

3884
02:47:04,800 --> 02:47:11,800
I mean, sounds true?

3885
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:15,800
I guess what this is saying is posers bad.

3886
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:16,800
Yeah.

3887
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:17,800
Posers is bad.

3888
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:19,800
Posers is bad.

3889
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:22,800
This is like fake allies and whatever.

3890
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:24,800
Fair weather allies.

3891
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:26,800
Is he talking about the Democrats?

3892
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:27,800
Maybe not.

3893
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:29,800
Maybe that's not even...

3894
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:35,800
I mean, Mao seems to have had some pretty based quotes in his life.

3895
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:40,800
I've seen a bunch of Mao quotes around and he definitely said some things I agree with.

3896
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:42,800
So that's cool.

3897
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,800
Yeah.

3898
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:45,800
Shame what he did.

3899
02:47:45,800 --> 02:47:47,800
I don't even know that much about what he did.

3900
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:50,800
I assume he killed people and did tyranny.

3901
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:53,800
It was sort of like a bad handling of China.

3902
02:47:53,800 --> 02:48:01,800
I'm pretty sure he's the one that said that he was going to reward farmers for each pigeon killed

3903
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:04,800
because he was tired of all the pigeons and then because...

3904
02:48:04,800 --> 02:48:06,800
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

3905
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:11,800
And then because the birds went extinct, the insects no longer had a predator

3906
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:14,800
and they had a massive famine that killed millions.

3907
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:16,800
That's very funny.

3908
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:17,800
That's very funny.

3909
02:48:17,800 --> 02:48:18,800
They tried to do...

3910
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:20,800
That's what they did with emus in Australia.

3911
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:27,800
Australia and China are the only two countries that have declared war on birds and lost.

3912
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:30,800
And they both lost.

3913
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:35,800
Well, I guess for China they won, but it was like a Pyrrhic victory that damaged them just as much.

3914
02:48:35,800 --> 02:48:40,800
And then like, yeah, I think Australia just lost the war against the emus.

3915
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:42,800
Birds, man.

3916
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:44,800
Wait, how do you even fight the emus?

3917
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:45,800
Prime Minister.

3918
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:47,800
You can't.

3919
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:48,800
They're too powerful.

3920
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:52,800
There's a great Sam O'Nella video about it.

3921
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:58,800
They literally took jeeps and mounted gatling guns on the backs of jeeps

3922
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:04,800
and tried to just ride into the fucking outback and just gun down flocks of emus.

3923
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:06,800
And it didn't work.

3924
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,800
Are they bulletproof?

3925
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:14,800
You can kill them with bullets, but they take a while to die and they don't go down immediately.

3926
02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:19,800
And when they're densely packed together, you can only shoot a few at a time.

3927
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:22,800
They have strengthened numbers.

3928
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:26,800
You can't just immediately mow down the entire herd.

3929
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:28,800
What the fuck are people riding the war on birds?

3930
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:29,800
You just gotta get a bazooka.

3931
02:49:29,800 --> 02:49:30,800
Just ride emus.

3932
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:31,800
Oh my god.

3933
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:34,800
Call America and get a drone.

3934
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:35,800
That reminds me.

3935
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:42,800
I saw in the news two days ago, I think it was Pablo Escobar's cocaine hippos

3936
02:49:42,800 --> 02:49:46,800
are now being legally recognized as people with human rights.

3937
02:49:47,800 --> 02:49:48,800
Cocaine hippos?

3938
02:49:48,800 --> 02:49:49,800
Is it white?

3939
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:50,800
Yeah.

3940
02:49:50,800 --> 02:49:54,800
Oh, I saw that and it made so little sense that I didn't even think about it.

3941
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:57,800
You're cocaine hippos.

3942
02:49:57,800 --> 02:49:59,800
What's a cocaine hippo?

3943
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:02,800
Is it a hippo that is infused with cocaine in a DNA?

3944
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:06,800
It's a hippo that will eat the plant that cocaine comes from,

3945
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:10,800
but also protect them from people trying to steal the plants

3946
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:12,800
or people trying to mess with his farms.

3947
02:50:12,800 --> 02:50:14,800
Because I don't know if you know about hippos,

3948
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:16,800
but hippos are very vicious animals.

3949
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:19,800
They can and will kill people very easily.

3950
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:22,800
I've heard that they can kill these people.

3951
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:23,800
Yeah.

3952
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:25,800
Yeah, hippos are scary, dude.

3953
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:28,800
I hate them.

3954
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:29,800
They terrify me.

3955
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:31,800
They've been rhinos.

3956
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:35,800
I mean, I would probably, if one was coming at me, I'd be scared as shit.

3957
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:36,800
Yeah, of course.

3958
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:41,800
Next voicemail is called, it's just called DeVoo.

3959
02:50:41,800 --> 02:50:44,800
Three, two, one, go.

3960
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:47,800
I love DeVoo!

3961
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:49,800
Well, good for you.

3962
02:50:49,800 --> 02:50:51,800
Yeah, yeah.

3963
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:53,800
Well done.

3964
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:55,800
Next voicemail is an Imgirlink.

3965
02:50:55,800 --> 02:50:57,800
Here's the image.

3966
02:50:57,800 --> 02:51:03,800
Nate the type of fella to say nice kitty after falling into the tiger enclosure

3967
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:06,800
at the zoo.

3968
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:08,800
At the zoo.

3969
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:11,800
True?

3970
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:12,800
I can see it.

3971
02:51:12,800 --> 02:51:14,800
I mean, that doesn't seem like...

3972
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:16,800
Nate has a little Harambe moment.

3973
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:18,800
Harambe moment.

3974
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:21,800
And he's like, oh, nice kitty.

3975
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:27,800
I'm gonna be a friend to you, so you don't kill me.

3976
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:28,800
I hate animals.

3977
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:30,800
I fucking hate strong animals.

3978
02:51:30,800 --> 02:51:32,800
Get that shit away from me.

3979
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:34,800
What do you define as a strong animal?

3980
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:36,800
Like a zoo animal?

3981
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:38,800
Anything that could kill me.

3982
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:40,800
Anything that could kill me is unacceptable.

3983
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:41,800
So like a dog?

3984
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:43,800
If...

3985
02:51:43,800 --> 02:51:44,800
No, I'll kill the dog first.

3986
02:51:44,800 --> 02:51:46,800
Okay, okay.

3987
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:48,800
No, I'll kill the dog.

3988
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:51,800
If you're gonna make an exposed video on them, do not cut this clip.

3989
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:52,800
It is out of context.

3990
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:53,800
I will.

3991
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:54,800
I will kill a dog.

3992
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:55,800
I will kill your dog.

3993
02:51:55,800 --> 02:51:58,800
If I fucking see your dog on this read, it's over.

3994
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:00,800
It's over.

3995
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:01,800
It's over.

3996
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:02,800
You're a pain to judge.

3997
02:52:02,800 --> 02:52:03,800
Oh, no.

3998
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:04,800
Not Scruffy.

3999
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:06,800
Insanely dogfoaming.

4000
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:08,800
Insanely dogfoaming.

4001
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,800
If it's a big dog?

4002
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:10,800
Yeah.

4003
02:52:10,800 --> 02:52:12,800
If it's a big dog.

4004
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:15,800
Next voicemail is called,

4005
02:52:15,800 --> 02:52:17,800
Get fucked bitch.

4006
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:19,800
Three, two, one, go.

4007
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:21,800
Vod, Vod.

4008
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:25,800
I have some cruel stuff to say about Trixie that I have no reason to hold back anymore.

4009
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:29,800
I believe she's copying her new videos about an animal.

4010
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:36,900
She's copying the style of this more successful, younger, hotter, trans girl, anime video aces

4011
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:42,460
called Hazel because she was a young e-girl.

4012
02:52:42,460 --> 02:52:51,340
As she mentions in one of her texts on her sub-stack, she mentions how she loves how the

4013
02:52:51,340 --> 02:52:58,060
e-girls on TikTok have their little decorated rooms, while you're too old, let go, nobody

4014
02:52:58,820 --> 02:53:02,820
you live in a Prius, get fucked, you old bitch.

4015
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:08,820
Yeah, I googled Hazel and I can't find anyone named that, I don't know how to spell it.

4016
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:11,920
Yeah, I don't know how to spell it.

4017
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:21,660
I know she likes the fucking e-girl makeup shit and wants to be an e-girl or whatever.

4018
02:53:21,660 --> 02:53:27,220
I think she's given up on physical aspects of transitioning.

4019
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:32,820
She seems to be putting less and less effort into it and in recent sub-stack articles she

4020
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:38,060
kind of implied like, yeah, people see me as a man, people see me and my fiance as gay

4021
02:53:38,060 --> 02:53:48,660
men but like, fuck it, I don't care, she probably does care but she is coping or something,

4022
02:53:48,660 --> 02:53:56,460
she seems to, she's saying, fuck it, it seems like, I don't know, that's just me trying

4023
02:53:56,700 --> 02:54:01,940
to, that's just me trying to connect dots, that's not any kind of like, I know that for

4024
02:54:01,940 --> 02:54:04,900
sure or anything.

4025
02:54:04,900 --> 02:54:11,820
Next voicemail is Red Five Rainbow, is that it, did I put the right one?

4026
02:54:11,820 --> 02:54:17,900
Yes, I did, okay, Red Five Rainbow, three, two, one, go.

4027
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:25,460
I was just listening to Ben's Patreon podcast and I just absolutely love listening to Ben

4028
02:54:25,580 --> 02:54:30,100
talking about churning, it obviously works so well with this brain, with all the numbers

4029
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:34,740
and this and this will happen, if I don't do that, then I'll miss out on this and yada,

4030
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:43,420
yada, yada, but Ben, Ben, Bitcoin is not the same, Bitcoin is a gamble, it is not a guarantee,

4031
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:48,420
you don't know how Bitcoin works, please stop talking about Bitcoin, you're not losing

4032
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:53,020
money when you don't put the money in and then it goes up because you didn't know it

4033
02:54:53,100 --> 02:54:55,100
was going to go up, it's a gamble.

4034
02:54:55,100 --> 02:55:04,100
Oh my God, no, I know it's a gamble, but you're wrong, if a different currency goes up, you

4035
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:11,340
have less value compared to like the sum total of all wealth in the world, I'm sorry, it's

4036
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:16,780
just true, it's just true, it is an opportunity cost that you have lost, you have lost value

4037
02:55:16,780 --> 02:55:21,500
by not investing if another asset goes up and yours does not, it's just true.

4038
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:25,900
How often do you talk about crypto, man?

4039
02:55:25,900 --> 02:55:29,660
Not that often, I mean, I've talked a little bit about it.

4040
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:31,260
For a while there, it was all the time.

4041
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:38,460
For a while there, I was talking about it a lot, I talked more, I went on a whole, yeah,

4042
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:46,300
on the last Patreon.com slash Ben St Q&A, I went into excruciating detail about my credit card

4043
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:51,740
churning strategies and stuff, I'm glad Red Fever appreciated that.

4044
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:56,460
I know I don't understand the technical aspect of Bitcoin, please understand it,

4045
02:55:56,460 --> 02:56:01,100
when I say that I lost money, I'm talking about a missed opportunity cost.

4046
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:05,980
Is it important, am I saying like, oh, I should always invest because what if I lose money?

4047
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:11,820
No, because it's equally true that if you are invested and it goes down, then you've also

4048
02:56:11,820 --> 02:56:15,980
lost money, I understand like there's risk involved no matter what, but it's just true to

4049
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:22,700
say that if something you are not invested in goes up, you have lost by not being invested in it.

4050
02:56:22,700 --> 02:56:27,900
This might be the most brain dead way of thinking about crypto, but I think of crypto and NFTs as

4051
02:56:27,900 --> 02:56:31,740
you know like CSGO gambling, where you like you get like nice and stuff like that and you gamble.

4052
02:56:31,740 --> 02:56:34,620
Yeah, I don't know about CSGO gambling.

4053
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:38,220
Oh, so like you can buy like these skins and they go up or down in profits,

4054
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:42,620
and they're like completely online to have no real world value, you know?

4055
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:44,780
That's how I think about it at least.

4056
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:47,100
I mean, I don't know if that's brilliant.

4057
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:49,180
Well, in game, you can have a skin, I guess.

4058
02:56:49,180 --> 02:56:51,980
Yeah, true, and in NFTs, you get a monkey, so.

4059
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:55,340
There's more than, yeah, but there's.

4060
02:56:55,340 --> 02:56:56,860
Well, you can just right click save the monkey.

4061
02:56:58,380 --> 02:56:58,860
True.

4062
02:56:58,860 --> 02:57:01,340
Yeah, you're right, you can't like right click save have the skin.

4063
02:57:01,340 --> 02:57:02,780
Oh, that'd be so sick if they did that.

4064
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:08,620
Next voicemail is called, uh, subject bonus pod,

4065
02:57:08,620 --> 02:57:14,140
Solaru0311 they them pronouns at gmail.com.

4066
02:57:14,780 --> 02:57:20,940
Okay, three, two, oh, this must, this must be about the, uh, the recent bonus where we react to the,

4067
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:22,780
the, who are these pods with Trixie.

4068
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:24,220
Three, two, one, go.

4069
02:57:26,780 --> 02:57:29,740
Hey all, just wanted to send a message in for once.

4070
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:33,020
The bonus pond on Thursday, which everyone here should be listening to by

4071
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:37,420
signing up at patreon.com slash the procrastinators was cathartic and much needed.

4072
02:57:38,060 --> 02:57:41,180
I try to stay out of the drama, but enough was enough.

4073
02:57:41,820 --> 02:57:47,260
I'm really thankful for the bonus episode because not only was a way to dump on some really shitty

4074
02:57:47,260 --> 02:57:52,300
people, but it was also a way to share with the cast and friends on what makes the PCP community

4075
02:57:52,300 --> 02:57:53,580
worth returning to every week.

4076
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:58,620
I don't really have much of a sign out, but I just want to tell everyone to take care of each other

4077
02:57:59,100 --> 02:58:00,140
and thank you so much.

4078
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:01,020
Thank you, Solaru0311.

4079
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:01,820
We appreciate you.

4080
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:07,900
Yeah, uh, some, yeah, some people said that they found the bonus episode very cathartic

4081
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:10,700
and it was, it was good.

4082
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:16,380
It was a good, uh, it was a good, uh, I, it was, it was fun.

4083
02:58:16,940 --> 02:58:22,540
I, I, I think I said on it that like, I didn't listen to the, the, the, who are these pods

4084
02:58:22,540 --> 02:58:26,300
because I knew it was just going to make me mad if I listened to it by myself.

4085
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:32,140
But listening to it with you and Simsie and like talking about it as we went, it, it was,

4086
02:58:32,140 --> 02:58:37,020
I mean, some parts of it made me a little mad, but most of it was like, uh, it was right,

4087
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:41,980
righteous fury that I was then able to like immediately dissipate in a, in a, in a, in a,

4088
02:58:41,980 --> 02:58:47,820
in a more helpful way, uh, as we went through it, uh, and it felt good, uh, and I liked it.

4089
02:58:48,380 --> 02:58:51,420
Uh, good, good, good times, good times.

4090
02:58:51,980 --> 02:59:01,340
Next voicemail is called, um, the, the, it's called fun fact three, two, one, go.

4091
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:06,700
Uh, Gib, you mentioned, you watched the little prince and the eight headed dragon,

4092
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:10,540
also known as one packu o oji no orochi taiji.

4093
02:59:10,540 --> 02:59:13,900
And you thought that the main character looked like a wind waker.

4094
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:19,660
That's because the art director of wind waker, yoichi kotabe,

4095
02:59:20,460 --> 02:59:23,900
actually did character animation on the movie.

4096
02:59:24,620 --> 02:59:25,100
They're connected.

4097
02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:27,100
No shit, no shit.

4098
02:59:27,100 --> 02:59:31,020
Actually one to one same, same guy.

4099
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:36,300
I, I was assuming that there was like, oh, some, some, you know, person worked on wind

4100
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:39,740
waker, saw that movie and was inspired by, but they worked on it.

4101
02:59:39,740 --> 02:59:40,060
Well, okay.

4102
02:59:40,060 --> 02:59:43,340
It sounds, he said, he says he did character animation.

4103
02:59:43,340 --> 02:59:48,140
So it sounds like it's not like it's the same guy came up with both designs.

4104
02:59:48,220 --> 02:59:53,740
It sounds like this guy, yeah, he worked under the movie, like a cleanup or whatever.

4105
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:55,180
Well, no, probably not cleanup.

4106
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:55,660
Animation.

4107
02:59:55,660 --> 02:59:56,860
Well, I don't actually, I don't know.

4108
02:59:56,860 --> 02:59:59,500
Maybe I assume, um, I assume he was drawing.

4109
02:59:59,500 --> 03:00:01,900
So it, yeah, like he, yeah.

4110
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:06,940
So he, um, I have, I have an interesting factoid for you guys.

4111
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:09,340
So this just reminded me of what's up.

4112
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:16,460
Um, so I was on a show about, uh, reading axed shown and jump manga and talking about them.

4113
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:19,180
And I read one called Boki-san.

4114
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:20,060
Have you heard of it?

4115
03:00:20,060 --> 03:00:20,700
Probably not.

4116
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:23,020
It ran for 18 chapters before getting axed.

4117
03:00:24,060 --> 03:00:31,580
Uh, but I looked up the artist and found out that, uh, he is, uh, completely stopped

4118
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:32,860
working with shown and jump.

4119
03:00:32,860 --> 03:00:36,300
And he is now a VTuber and draws Hentai.

4120
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:40,540
That's kind of funny, I guess.

4121
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:40,780
Yeah.

4122
03:00:40,780 --> 03:00:42,700
I mean, I've, I've manga artist.

4123
03:00:43,180 --> 03:00:46,060
You know what, then a manga artist starts VTubing.

4124
03:00:46,060 --> 03:00:49,660
You know, I mean, I guess it doesn't sound that crazy, but it's funny.

4125
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:55,260
Well, a lot of like, um, like manga artists or like, uh, anime artists start off from

4126
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:57,740
Hentai, or I know that's like a common thing, right?

4127
03:00:57,740 --> 03:01:03,980
Yeah, that's why it's funny that he went from actually working for shown and jump.

4128
03:01:03,980 --> 03:01:07,980
And his first anime and manga he made was actually really successful too.

4129
03:01:08,540 --> 03:01:11,180
I guess he wanted to go indie, I guess so.

4130
03:01:11,180 --> 03:01:13,340
But it's still like, whoa, what?

4131
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:14,860
It's funny.

4132
03:01:17,420 --> 03:01:18,860
I think it's kind of cool.

4133
03:01:18,860 --> 03:01:19,580
It's kind of cool.

4134
03:01:19,580 --> 03:01:22,460
I was like, fuck, fuck, I don't want to work for, I don't want to work for this company anymore.

4135
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:23,900
I just want to do my own thing.

4136
03:01:23,900 --> 03:01:25,100
I really think I respect it.

4137
03:01:25,900 --> 03:01:26,220
Yeah.

4138
03:01:27,420 --> 03:01:32,620
Um, next voicemail is called, uh, Rainforest Be Damned.

4139
03:01:32,620 --> 03:01:34,380
Three, two, one, go.

4140
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:36,060
Hey Gib.

4141
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:40,620
I was curious why you were talking about how you're concerned about the

4142
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:45,980
environmental damage that NFTs cause when you have bought and sold bitcoin

4143
03:01:45,980 --> 03:01:48,460
and Ben still does it and you guys talk about it all the time.

4144
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:50,860
Because that's the same thing.

4145
03:01:51,980 --> 03:01:52,220
Thoughts?

4146
03:01:52,220 --> 03:01:52,460
Yeah.

4147
03:01:53,420 --> 03:01:58,140
Um, well, I have since sold all of my crypto and I haven't bought anymore.

4148
03:01:58,140 --> 03:01:59,340
I also have done that.

4149
03:01:59,340 --> 03:02:00,620
I haven't bought any in a while.

4150
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:06,540
It's, uh, the, the, the hypocrisy is not lost on me.

4151
03:02:06,540 --> 03:02:07,180
Yeah.

4152
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:14,220
I, I, I know that it's, it's just one of those, um, well, yeah, I don't know.

4153
03:02:14,220 --> 03:02:15,740
I, I've, I've, I'm not doing it anymore.

4154
03:02:15,740 --> 03:02:16,140
Okay.

4155
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:17,500
So I guess my conscience is clean.

4156
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:17,900
Okay.

4157
03:02:17,900 --> 03:02:21,900
Now, I'm, now I, I'm on record as not really knowing that much about it.

4158
03:02:21,900 --> 03:02:28,620
I thought that the majority of the environmental damage came from the mining of bitcoin.

4159
03:02:29,260 --> 03:02:32,140
I know that it does take energy to do transactions as well.

4160
03:02:32,620 --> 03:02:33,020
It mostly.

4161
03:02:33,020 --> 03:02:37,100
I thought it was the, I thought it was the mining that like the, the creation of them.

4162
03:02:37,180 --> 03:02:38,540
That was the big problem.

4163
03:02:38,540 --> 03:02:40,780
Not as much the, the transfer.

4164
03:02:40,780 --> 03:02:45,980
As far as I'm aware, it comes mostly from, uh, creating.

4165
03:02:45,980 --> 03:02:52,460
So like, uh, Indy, like, like, uh, like mining, uh, you have to get so many more hard drives out.

4166
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:57,260
So, so the, you know, making that also fucks up the environment.

4167
03:02:57,260 --> 03:03:04,220
And then, um, also like the mining itself takes up so much power that they have to

4168
03:03:04,220 --> 03:03:04,860
That's what I'm saying.

4169
03:03:04,860 --> 03:03:05,180
Yeah.

4170
03:03:05,180 --> 03:03:06,220
Get more resources.

4171
03:03:06,780 --> 03:03:11,580
And then, uh, and then like, um, what is it, then the transfer.

4172
03:03:11,580 --> 03:03:12,220
Yeah.

4173
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:17,020
It's like, I'd actually argue it's, uh, significantly less bad.

4174
03:03:17,740 --> 03:03:22,940
Uh, for the sole reason that mining bitcoin is, you're basically solving very complex

4175
03:03:22,940 --> 03:03:24,620
math problems through brute force.

4176
03:03:25,340 --> 03:03:27,820
And what do you mean it's less bad?

4177
03:03:27,820 --> 03:03:28,940
What's less bad than one?

4178
03:03:28,940 --> 03:03:32,060
Well, it's less bad because of the fact that because it's.

4179
03:03:32,060 --> 03:03:33,420
No, what are you, what are you talking about?

4180
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:34,620
What is less bad than one?

4181
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:35,420
I'm making my point.

4182
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:38,220
No, you have to tell me what you're talking about.

4183
03:03:38,940 --> 03:03:41,420
I'm talking about bitcoin is less bad than other crypto.

4184
03:03:42,700 --> 03:03:43,020
Okay.

4185
03:03:43,020 --> 03:03:43,820
Environment wise.

4186
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:48,300
And that is because when you're mining bitcoin, it is because it's brute forcing,

4187
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:49,580
solving a math equation.

4188
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:54,700
There's always a chance you can get lucky and you could solve it, you know, in a millisecond.

4189
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:55,420
And then that's it.

4190
03:03:55,420 --> 03:03:56,380
You mind the bitcoin.

4191
03:03:57,420 --> 03:04:00,940
Now that is extremely, extremely, extremely rare.

4192
03:04:00,940 --> 03:04:03,500
But because that chance exists, I don't care.

4193
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:04,540
I don't care about this.

4194
03:04:04,540 --> 03:04:06,220
I don't care about what you're talking about right now.

4195
03:04:07,820 --> 03:04:12,940
The thing was like the comparison with NFTs to crypto currencies.

4196
03:04:12,940 --> 03:04:16,460
No, that's not what the, that's not what the question was about.

4197
03:04:16,460 --> 03:04:21,180
The question was, the question was, you criticize society and yet you live in it.

4198
03:04:21,180 --> 03:04:26,300
No, the question was, you say crypto has an environmental impact and yet you did some of it.

4199
03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:27,100
And yeah, I did.

4200
03:04:28,060 --> 03:04:32,780
And yeah, the transfer probably did have an energy cost that was not good for the environment.

4201
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:33,900
That's probably true.

4202
03:04:33,900 --> 03:04:37,420
My understanding is that it is the creation of them that is the worst part,

4203
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:38,220
more than the transfer.

4204
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:39,900
But the transfer is probably also bad.

4205
03:04:40,860 --> 03:04:43,100
And I don't know, fucking.

4206
03:04:43,660 --> 03:04:44,700
Well, yeah, okay.

4207
03:04:44,700 --> 03:04:45,900
The thing I was going to say.

4208
03:04:45,900 --> 03:04:47,180
I wish crypto didn't exist.

4209
03:04:47,180 --> 03:04:48,940
I wish we lived in a world where there was no crypto.

4210
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:51,740
But since we do, I don't know, you know, I don't know.

4211
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:55,340
If I thought tomorrow that crypto is going to take off, it's going to be the only currency.

4212
03:04:55,340 --> 03:04:59,420
And if you don't have any of it, you're going to die in a Mad Max, no water hellscape.

4213
03:04:59,420 --> 03:05:02,540
Yeah, I'm sorry to say I would buy all the crypto.

4214
03:05:02,620 --> 03:05:08,140
Because I would just, you know, I want to fucking self preserve myself and survive.

4215
03:05:08,140 --> 03:05:11,740
I would do it, even though it would hurt the environment out of self preservation.

4216
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:12,380
I'm sorry.

4217
03:05:14,380 --> 03:05:14,940
Okay.

4218
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:16,300
I mean, sure.

4219
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:21,820
The thing with the NFTs, the reason I harped on about that, but I didn't harp on so much about

4220
03:05:21,820 --> 03:05:27,260
crypto was I think at the time, NFTs were becoming like a thing and people were talking about them.

4221
03:05:27,260 --> 03:05:33,580
I got the sense that the transactions between like NFT ownership created

4222
03:05:34,300 --> 03:05:40,780
like such a disproportionate amount of energy that it was like not quite comparable to like

4223
03:05:40,780 --> 03:05:43,820
transferring Bitcoin around for some reason.

4224
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:46,060
Maybe that's wrong.

4225
03:05:46,060 --> 03:05:49,820
I didn't, I looked into it enough to realize that they were stupid.

4226
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:52,700
I can't really remember exactly all the details.

4227
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:53,420
I really don't know.

4228
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:56,940
But that's why I was like really bad on, really hard on NFTs.

4229
03:05:58,940 --> 03:06:00,460
And I still had Bitcoin at the time.

4230
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:04,700
But yeah, they might, they might be at this point, I'm not interested in either.

4231
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:06,940
They might be different in the way they work in that way.

4232
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:07,500
I don't know.

4233
03:06:09,100 --> 03:06:12,060
Next one, we only have two more, by the way, we're almost done.

4234
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:17,420
The next one is called NNN, three, two, one, go.

4235
03:06:18,780 --> 03:06:19,980
It's November.

4236
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:21,180
And you know what that means.

4237
03:06:21,820 --> 03:06:23,420
It's no Nate November.

4238
03:06:24,140 --> 03:06:25,100
That's right.

4239
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:29,660
Myself and tons of other PCP fans are taking up the challenge

4240
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:32,220
and abstaining from nating for the entire month.

4241
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:36,460
I'll be checking back in every week to update on my progress.

4242
03:06:36,460 --> 03:06:40,060
And Ben, there's one thing you can do to help us all out.

4243
03:06:40,060 --> 03:06:42,780
And that's to not have Nate on the podcast for the whole month.

4244
03:06:43,900 --> 03:06:48,860
And remember the saying of the no Nate movement, no Nate, yes, watch.

4245
03:06:52,060 --> 03:06:56,780
I don't think they explained what that what it actually means to no Nate November.

4246
03:06:57,420 --> 03:07:00,300
Well, I think because I remember on the stream on the stream,

4247
03:07:00,300 --> 03:07:02,540
it was like a little joke, like, ha, ha, no Nate.

4248
03:07:02,540 --> 03:07:03,500
Maybe this is different.

4249
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:05,340
Like Nate's not going to make content.

4250
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:08,780
Yeah, the joke on the stream was that would be no Nate November would be

4251
03:07:08,780 --> 03:07:11,020
if Nate didn't make any uploads.

4252
03:07:11,020 --> 03:07:13,660
But this seems to be don't watch any Nate content.

4253
03:07:15,340 --> 03:07:18,060
So I solemnly pledge, I solemnly pledge,

4254
03:07:19,020 --> 03:07:22,300
never put Nate on the podcast for no Nate November.

4255
03:07:22,300 --> 03:07:24,620
It would be it would be breaking no Nate November.

4256
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:26,140
If we let Nate be on the podcast.

4257
03:07:29,900 --> 03:07:31,980
Either way, I'm going to be doing not November.

4258
03:07:33,980 --> 03:07:36,060
Yeah, just just just not November.

4259
03:07:37,980 --> 03:07:41,580
No, just not that's also same thing.

4260
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:42,060
Same thing.

4261
03:07:43,020 --> 03:07:45,420
Uh, last voicemail is called.

4262
03:07:46,460 --> 03:07:48,380
This is the jumble of random letters.

4263
03:07:48,380 --> 03:07:50,620
Okay, three, two, one, go.

4264
03:07:52,860 --> 03:07:55,580
Welcome to the pro procrastinators voicemail,

4265
03:07:55,580 --> 03:07:58,620
where I say positive things about the procrastinators because gosh,

4266
03:07:58,620 --> 03:07:59,340
round you've earned it.

4267
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:04,780
Yay, Ben excited to see your game come out and excited to see what comes up after.

4268
03:08:04,780 --> 03:08:05,980
Thanks, kid.

4269
03:08:05,980 --> 03:08:09,660
We'll have all the work you've done in the past and excited to see you keep creating today.

4270
03:08:09,660 --> 03:08:12,940
Calm, you're minding me about myself the way you source music,

4271
03:08:12,940 --> 03:08:16,540
but I'm so happy to see that you have a project going on right now that's sustainable

4272
03:08:16,540 --> 03:08:19,100
and I hope all the shit in the world goes good for you.

4273
03:08:19,100 --> 03:08:19,820
Gamers having?

4274
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:22,780
You make puns.

4275
03:08:22,780 --> 03:08:23,900
I fucking love puns.

4276
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:25,020
So good.

4277
03:08:25,420 --> 03:08:27,980
I am so excited.

4278
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:30,940
I'm so excited to continue to work on Phantom's Revenge.

4279
03:08:30,940 --> 03:08:36,620
And I feel like I'm so close to being finished that I hate that I'm angry that it's Halloween today

4280
03:08:36,620 --> 03:08:38,780
because that means I have to go out and do stuff.

4281
03:08:39,660 --> 03:08:42,780
I would rather just stay home and fucking code.

4282
03:08:44,780 --> 03:08:50,220
You know, one thing about Halloween, this Halloween that I hadn't really considered until

4283
03:08:51,420 --> 03:08:57,100
my dad said it earlier today was that is that COVID, right?

4284
03:08:57,900 --> 03:08:59,260
People go into people's doors.

4285
03:08:59,260 --> 03:08:59,820
Yeah.

4286
03:08:59,820 --> 03:09:01,900
Who knows what those kids have?

4287
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:03,740
Oh, I mean.

4288
03:09:03,740 --> 03:09:05,900
They could deliver COVID right to us.

4289
03:09:05,900 --> 03:09:07,180
Oh, that's kind of true.

4290
03:09:07,180 --> 03:09:12,700
I mean, yeah, I guess it's true that it could be a vector for infection.

4291
03:09:12,700 --> 03:09:12,940
Yeah.

4292
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:18,700
Because it's like a weird thing like kids aren't getting vaccinated or they can't get the vaccine

4293
03:09:18,700 --> 03:09:19,180
or something.

4294
03:09:20,540 --> 03:09:24,860
I mean, you can still spread COVID even if you have the vaccine.

4295
03:09:24,860 --> 03:09:28,300
Even if you're vaccinated, you could potentially give it to some neighbor.

4296
03:09:28,300 --> 03:09:32,220
I just think I'm pretty sure a lot of people are just going to leave bowls out,

4297
03:09:32,220 --> 03:09:35,020
you know, on the door, like on the like porch or whatever.

4298
03:09:35,020 --> 03:09:35,740
Yeah, we might.

4299
03:09:35,820 --> 03:09:36,460
I'm not sure yet.

4300
03:09:36,460 --> 03:09:41,260
That's what I'm doing, just, you know, just to make it easier.

4301
03:09:41,260 --> 03:09:45,260
And also, if I was a parent, I would be like, yeah, you're not going up to the fucking doors.

4302
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:48,140
You're not talking to any of those people because of COVID.

4303
03:09:49,340 --> 03:09:49,740
Maybe.

4304
03:09:50,380 --> 03:09:51,740
Yeah, I think it's fair.

4305
03:09:51,740 --> 03:09:54,220
Or a lot of cousins are going to have masks in them.

4306
03:09:55,260 --> 03:09:55,500
Yeah.

4307
03:09:56,300 --> 03:09:59,180
I would go out and get shitfaced tonight.

4308
03:09:59,180 --> 03:10:02,540
However, I got shitfaced last night on Lumia's birthday stream.

4309
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:08,460
So that's very responsible of you keeping it to once, however long.

4310
03:10:09,020 --> 03:10:09,900
Once in a blue.

4311
03:10:10,780 --> 03:10:12,940
Not not not on consecutive nights.

4312
03:10:12,940 --> 03:10:14,460
That's that's disaster.

4313
03:10:14,460 --> 03:10:19,500
I trust me getting wasted multiple nights in a row is not a is not a good way to live.

4314
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:23,500
It's a good way to like delete the next day.

4315
03:10:23,500 --> 03:10:25,180
It's a good way to stop living.

4316
03:10:26,060 --> 03:10:26,620
It is.

4317
03:10:26,620 --> 03:10:27,340
It really is.

4318
03:10:28,780 --> 03:10:29,100
Yeah.

4319
03:10:29,900 --> 03:10:32,380
Um, well, that was the last voicemail.

4320
03:10:33,980 --> 03:10:35,260
Oh, we're over three hours.

4321
03:10:36,140 --> 03:10:38,140
Eleazar hates it when we go over three hours.

4322
03:10:39,740 --> 03:10:41,020
Love you, Eleazar.

4323
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:43,180
Fuck you, Eleazar.

4324
03:10:45,020 --> 03:10:48,940
Any any anything else to say before we wrap up?

4325
03:10:50,540 --> 03:10:55,180
Uh, go check out Clarissa Gunsmoke on my website, my comic.

4326
03:10:55,980 --> 03:10:57,980
If you haven't already, give and take that site.

4327
03:11:00,060 --> 03:11:06,940
And, uh, look out for a secret reveal at some point in the next few months.

4328
03:11:06,940 --> 03:11:08,140
That's what I'll say for now.

4329
03:11:08,140 --> 03:11:08,780
Oh, I think I know.

4330
03:11:09,580 --> 03:11:10,700
I think I know what it is.

4331
03:11:11,660 --> 03:11:12,700
But I also won't say.

4332
03:11:13,420 --> 03:11:14,700
Be sure or will I know?

4333
03:11:15,660 --> 03:11:18,060
Unless no, no, I must.

4334
03:11:19,340 --> 03:11:20,700
Be sure to check out Shreddit.

4335
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:23,020
You know, we're a fun little quirky show.

4336
03:11:23,020 --> 03:11:25,740
Be sure to check out Advil's video on Daft Pina.

4337
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:27,340
It will be out by the time you hear this.

4338
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:30,380
Hopefully in the description, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

4339
03:11:30,380 --> 03:11:31,020
Okay.

4340
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:31,420
Okay.

4341
03:11:31,420 --> 03:11:33,340
If it's out by then, hopefully it'll be out by then.

4342
03:11:33,340 --> 03:11:38,620
We'll put a link in the description to Shreddit and Advil's Daft Pina video.

4343
03:11:39,180 --> 03:11:39,660
Hell yeah.

4344
03:11:40,300 --> 03:11:41,260
Hell yeah.

4345
03:11:42,300 --> 03:11:43,020
Thank you guys.

4346
03:11:44,220 --> 03:11:45,100
Uh, no problem.

4347
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:50,060
And, uh, buy road to Radcon.

4348
03:11:50,060 --> 03:11:51,180
Check my pin tweet.

4349
03:11:51,180 --> 03:11:54,140
It's also ugly for how to order it.

4350
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:55,500
Please buy my copies.

4351
03:11:55,500 --> 03:12:00,700
I don't need 55 copies, but you need one copy, listener.

4352
03:12:01,340 --> 03:12:06,300
$5 off if you're a PCP patron, of which many of you are now, thanks to all the drama.

4353
03:12:07,420 --> 03:12:09,740
And, um, anything else?

4354
03:12:09,740 --> 03:12:12,620
Oh, um, yeah, listen to the bonus episode.

4355
03:12:12,620 --> 03:12:14,780
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

4356
03:12:14,780 --> 03:12:18,700
Bonus episode, where we fire back.

4357
03:12:18,700 --> 03:12:22,540
Where we retaliate against this foreign aggression

4358
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:25,180
of the, of Trixion, who are these podcasts?

4359
03:12:25,180 --> 03:12:28,540
And we, we keep it, we keep a W tally.

4360
03:12:28,540 --> 03:12:32,220
And, uh, we'll, I won't spoil the final result, the final score.

4361
03:12:33,500 --> 03:12:34,300
I think that's it.

4362
03:12:34,300 --> 03:12:35,020
I think we're done.

4363
03:12:35,020 --> 03:12:36,300
All right.

4364
03:12:36,300 --> 03:12:37,260
Hit in the star button.

4365
03:12:37,260 --> 03:12:38,860
God bless.

4366
03:12:38,860 --> 03:12:39,980
Wait, no, gotta say goodbye.

4367
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:41,900
Goodbye.

4368
03:12:41,900 --> 03:12:42,700
Bye.

4369
03:12:42,700 --> 03:12:43,340
Goodbye.

4370
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:46,140
Okay.

4371
03:12:47,260 --> 03:12:47,580
Okay.

4372
03:12:48,460 --> 03:12:49,580
Thank you for watching.

4373
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:51,420
I'll see you in the next video.

4374
03:12:51,420 --> 03:12:51,980
Bye.
