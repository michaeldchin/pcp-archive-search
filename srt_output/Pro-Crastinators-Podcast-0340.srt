1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We started? Is this the start of the episode?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, yeah.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay. I shouldn't have eaten all those overnight oats.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I usually don't eat first thing in the morning, but I went to get coffee.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And while I was there, I had my overnight oats and I was like, oh, ooh, I'll have some.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ooh, I'll have some of this food I made for myself. Decadent. Decadent.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oats. Do you have to eat them during the night?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, it just means you, I discovered it fairly recently.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It just means instead of like, make an oatmeal, right?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Instead of like putting oats in a bowl and adding like milk, water, whatever, and then microwaving it.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Instead, you just combine the milk and the oats in the bowl at night and then you leave it in the fridge for eight hours plus.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And, you know, it just kind of soaks the oats and becomes a mushy oatmeal.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's like cold brew. It's like cold brew coffee, but for oatmeal.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's good. Better consistency and saves you like three minutes of microwaving.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But it takes an entire night. I guess you wouldn't do anything.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, but I'm not sitting there watching it.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Put it in the fridge and you just put your watch.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Damn, it's a bad value proposition because you can either put it in the microwave and stand there and watch it for five minutes for it to get hot.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Or you can put it in the fridge and stand there and watch it for eight hours and wait for it to get cold.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And then you eat it at the end.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can watch a Mega Man lecture in that time.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can watch a Mega Man lecture. Yeah, you got it.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's like recipe. Okay, so you Google it, right?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You find one of those food blogs with a recipe for overnight oats.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You start it up and it's written by me.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And it's like, hmm, yeah, when I was traveling in Europe, for New Year's in 2018, I went to Estonia.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I went to Tartu Estonia, blah, blah, blah.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And I learned and I became a man that day and I learned that crime doesn't pay.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Anyway, let me tell you my recipe for overnight oats.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Your ingredients will be one cup of oats, one cup of almond milk,

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
some one squeeze of English toffee flavored better stevia, and a final ingredient.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, wait, I had a joke. I had a joke.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What was my point? I swear I was going somewhere with that.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In the Mega Man lecture.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, yes. And then the final ingredient is you got to sit and watch the Mega Man lecture.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So you combine the ingredients in the bowl, put them in the fridge,

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
watch the Mega Man lecture, come back and eat it, it'll be perfectly done.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That was a thank you. Thank you. You saved the bit. You saved the bit.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I fucking hate that when they have like, oh, recipes. Also, it's a blog and I'm going to talk about stuff.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I'm like, where are you actually, I usually, I mean, I know what to do now.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I scroll as far down as I can as fast as possible.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, I don't read their stupid life, their stupid story about how much their kids like this recipe.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know who reads this shit. Who is that for?

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Maybe no one.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Like, is it just an ad revenue? Does it somehow generate ad revenue to write your stupid blog posts?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Maybe some people, maybe some percentage of people actually do read it.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But it's like when you're looking for a recipe, you're looking because you want to make something.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, because you just have like this vague notion of like, the art of cooking.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'd like to read about that right now. I'd like to read about people's experiences with cooking things.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know that I'm going to do it. Like, why would you look up a recipe at that time?

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can't, I mean, yeah, I don't, I see people, I see people complain about this phenomenon.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know anyone that likes it. There must be some benefit to it.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And it can't be ad revenue because like, they've already got the click because you clicked on the website.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think maybe the idea is that, yeah, some small percent, it does generate some small percentage of people

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
subscribing to your newsletter.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, maybe that's it, parasocialize, maximize the parasocial relationship as soon as possible.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's like, ah, this person has a family. I recognize that I'm similar in that sense and I feel like I can relate to them.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will now follow their blog instead of not do that so I can see more.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want to hear more about their, about their son, Jaden, with the gluten allergy, you know.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How's he going to, how's he going to feel about, how's he going to feel about the wheatless banana nutbread recipe next week?

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why was I also thinking of banana muffin thing? What is with recipes and blogs and bananas?

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I was thinking of that because I have a, I have a walnut, a banana walnut bread candle that I burn in my room sometime for a smell.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's delightful.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Smells, I mean, sounds good.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Smells, I mean, so it's both. Yeah, it's both.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can't smell it.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know what? I'm, I'm lighting it. You know what? I'm lighting it right now.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, yes. Get lit.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Get, let's just get, all right, here on this week on the procrastinators podcast, we're getting lit.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're getting lit. I got my Baileys here.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I got my, and I got my banana walnut bread sent to candle.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We're, and together we're the procrastinators.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Listeners, listeners, light, light your candle. Take, take a shot of Baileys.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Wait, that wasn't in the episode. That was before we started the episode. Give is drinking straight shots of Baileys.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not multiple shots. It's just one after another, just one after another.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I just, just there's, is the Christmas tree has been put up today. We haven't like decorated it yet, but big old Christmas tree and logs on the fire.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I got given a little thing Baileys. I'm like, all right.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Jack, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, I didn't go outside.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've been sick for this past week, and I'm only just now like getting over it.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Did someone give you Baileys as an early Christmas present?

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, just to just like a more like a late morning.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We've done a bunch of stuff. Let's relax by the fire with the alcohol of some kind.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My dad had a sherry or a port. I had a Baileys.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's sweet.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's nice.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Me drinking with my parents generally consists of a, yeah, sitting around the living room, me and my dad drinking Miller lights.

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's our version. That's our version.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I mean, that's a very unusual thing. I haven't had Baileys in like 700 years.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Kind of forgot what it was like.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's like a milkshake. It's like a milkshake.

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It is. It's like a milkshake. That's all I got to say on that.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:59,000
For the viewers benefit, I will say that I was surprised because to my recollection, I thought the way you usually drink Baileys is like you put it in coffee, right?

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And I think that's called an Irish coffee. That was what I thought. That was my, it's funny.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think it's funny to drink straight Baileys, but I mean, I've done it.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's not to say I've never done it because I have. And that's how I know it tastes like a milkshake.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it like eggnog flavored?

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is it coffee flavored or is it just kind of like rum flavored, like rum flavored cream?

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, kind of rum flavored cream.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Have you never had eggnog?

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't think I've ever had an eggnog. I used to think that it's like some sort of a nog and you put eggs in it.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's like some sort of a nog that you put eggs in. Yeah, it is kind of like that.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why would you put eggs in a drink and drink it? What are you fucking rocky?

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait, now I'm not sure if you were joking. What is a nog?

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I mean, because of eggnog, I just assume it's like an omelet in a glass. I don't actually know anything.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, I think a nog is like some kind of old fashioned term for like a mixed drink or like a rum or an alcoholic beverage.

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't actually know what's in it. I mean, I think there are eggs in it traditionally.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So it's got nothing to do with having an omelet?

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No, no.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wow, I've been rung this whole time.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a drink, but it's like a creamy drink.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And traditionally, you mix it up in a bowl and then people sort of spoon it into glasses and everyone drinks like a glass of it.

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And there's rum in it traditionally.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay, I never called it nog, but I don't know if this is the same thing.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But when I was at uni, there was like a party game where a bunch of just random drinks were thrown into a bowl and you had to do like a card thing.

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I can't remember what the game was, but then you had to take a drink from the bowl of like mixed drinks.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Was it the goal to make the mixture like as gross as possible?

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't think that was the goal, but it was gross because it was just like various spirits and I don't know if wine was in there or not.

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't remember.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Was it like Kings? Like a drinking game like Kings?

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I could have been. I mean, I got very drunk, so I can't really remember.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That was fun.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, that sounds interesting. Sounds fun.

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But no, it's like a punch, but it's like sort of like a spicy, like creamy, eggy kind of creamy drink.

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Like you can pour it onto a frying pan and make a pancake out of it.

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Although more commonly, more commonly when I say eggnog, I'm talking about the store-bought kind, which is kind of just something you buy in a carton.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And I don't think there even is eggs in it, but it's like it's just kind of like it's sort of like a milkshake.

133
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's sort of like a creamy, slightly nutmeggy.

134
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, it's like a creamy nutmeg milkshake pretty much.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And it's great by Hood Brand.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Sounds delicious.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why was I talking about this?

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because I was drinking Baileys.

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Alright, this is a very cozy holiday season.

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I feel like, are you in the Christmas spirit? It sounds like you're in the Christmas spirit.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am. I saw like a couple tweets, so just saying like Christmas sucks.

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Christmas sucks.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yo, Christmas is just another cold day.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's the whole point, though. Like if we didn't have like gaiety and jollity and silly fun times.

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What would we be without gaiety?

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It would be like dark and cold.

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And that's it.

148
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's just like life in a way.

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just like the universe, right? It's dark and cold.

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Until Elon Musk spreads the light of consciousness throughout the cosmos, you know, will continue to be dark and cold.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Except for our little blue dot.

152
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Our little blue marble.

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You said spreads. Ah, no, never mind.

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What? What?

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Never mind.

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What were you laughing at? No, what were you laughing at? Was it COVID?

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Did you think I was going to say spread COVID?

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, it's much more gross than that.

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is it spread semen?

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Is it spreading my seed?

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No, but it's spreading his ass.

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And the light shines from it.

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Gross, gross, gross, gross.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, you know, it's Elon Musk. It makes sense.

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You know, it does. No, it does.

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm not...

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, I am in the Christmas spirit.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I haven't really gotten like heavy into it, but I just sort of...

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's like getting to the point where the sun goes down so early.

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want to see Christmas lights.

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I want the fire to be roasting.

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know...

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In the fireplace.

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now that I think about it,

175
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't think I've seen any Christmas lights or decorations up

176
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in my neighborhood.

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Shameful.

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I mean, maybe I haven't really...

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where's the twinklin'? You gotta have twinklin'.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No, I walked...

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think I walked around at night the other day.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't remember seeing any.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Huh.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's not that.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We're almost halfway through December. I feel like there might be...

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Maybe I haven't been outside at night in a while.

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe I should take another look around.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, I haven't seen any yet.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Hmm.

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, I've been to a few malls where they got stuff around.

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hmm.

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There's, you know, the street lamps.

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't know if in America you have this,

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
but like the councils near where I live or in London in general,

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
they just have like Christmas decorations they put on every lamp post.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And they sort of appear slowly through the November into December

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and then, oh, they turn them on.

198
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then there's reindeers everywhere.

199
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You know, the local council like is in charge of it.

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not like mandated or anything, but it's always there.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's great.

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Not really.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I mean, maybe in certain places, not where I live.

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hmm.

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Now, suddenly I'm realizing a sort of distinct lack of a Christmas decor.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And because I live on like a street where like, you know, the houses have little yards.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not like I live on like a city block where like there's no trees or anything.

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Bunch of Scrooges.

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You gotta spread the joy.

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Bunch of Scrooges.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, I gotta spread the joy.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I gotta take it upon myself.

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You gotta get the toilet paper.

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You gotta get the toilet paper and wrap it in gift wrapping for them, for your housemates.

215
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I thought you were gonna say you gotta get the holiday toilet paper

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and go around toilet, toilet, papering their yards and their trees and their houses with it.

217
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, the special like Christmas-like toilet paper.

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hmm.

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sparkles.

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Twinkling.

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Good.

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You know, if they, if they, they can't, oh, they can't afford.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh no, they must not be able to afford Christmas decorations.

225
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, I'll just go and toilet paper their house for them.

226
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And they'll be so grateful.

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
An egg nog their house.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Toilet paper and egg nog.

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm gonna egg nog their house, but nog is kind of expensive.

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So I'll just egg them.

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Just egg them, actually.

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, they probably have nog already.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They have, I'm sure they have.

234
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Should they have nog?

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Just scrape the egg off the side of the building.

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Put it in the tree.

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's, that's, that's charity, right?

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's my groceries.

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's my groceries that I'm giving to them.

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They can scrape, scrape it off the side of their house.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Uh, the, my, I learned, I learned this yesterday.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
One of my, one of my roommates, the girl has, um, has like food stamps saved up.

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
She's been, apparently this is this guy she knows told me this yesterday, this tidbit.

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Apparently she like was getting, you know, food stamps, EBT for years and just never used it.

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And so now she's got like thousands of dollars of like credit just on a, an EBT card.

246
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Wow.

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah.

248
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I hope she'll give me some.

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I hope she'll buy me some stuff.

250
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How does that work?

251
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you mean?

252
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
With, I mean, I don't know what food stamp procedures there are.

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I mean, you just apply.

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've been lucky enough.

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you're, if you're poor, you just apply to a freaking, you just fill out a paper and

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
you send it to somewhere and you know, depending on your circumstances or whatever, they'll

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
approve you a certain amount based on your income that you just get.

258
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah.

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You get credit on a card.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They give you a special card and you can use it at supermarkets and stuff and you can

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
just spend it like money on food.

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's great that it just, just can keep continually like growing.

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can get to a point where you have thousands of dollars.

265
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I imagine like a really horrible way to do it is like you get a food stamp like coupon

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that expires if you don't use it.

267
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah.

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's how you would do it if you were evil.

269
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You know, I, yeah, I don't, I think the car, I think if you like don't use it for a long

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
time, the card like expires like the card itself becomes inactive.

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know if like the credit ever disappears unless like, unless like maybe you were to,

275
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
maybe you were to like your income were to increase and you reported your increased income

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and then you said you no longer eligible and then like they cancel your card and then you

277
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
can't get the credits back maybe.

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But as long as you're still eligible, I think that like the credits never expire or they

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
don't for like a really long time.

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, it rolls over from one month to the next.

281
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Anyway, she should buy my groceries, I think.

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know.

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's just a little tidbit.

284
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I got like nothing done this week at all.

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I completely squandered my week, wasted it.

286
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I mean, that's not entirely true.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I took care of some like more practical stuff like I went to the bank and I got the check

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
just I got the I got my negotiated down check to send my landlord.

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I still haven't sent it yet.

290
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's sitting on me.

291
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But I, you know, I had to do that.

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I called a guy that my parents wanted me to call to discuss like banking options.

293
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I set up an appointment.

294
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I did a couple of things like that.

295
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But in terms of like getting the book done almost almost nothing this whole week.

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm just going to call a vacation.

297
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll call a vacation.

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's funny.

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I was talking about hibernating like a couple of weeks ago, but being sick this past week.

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
How'd you get set?

301
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How'd you get set?

302
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How'd you get sick?

303
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Did I talk about going to camp?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You mentioned it.

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I think a few people there may have had a cough and then I got it.

307
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know if it was COVID.

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
People had to check and it doesn't feel as bad as a COVID.

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So it's probably just a regular flu or cold.

310
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Did you have COVID before?

311
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I did.

312
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
In America, yeah.

313
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, that's right.

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's the only time I got it.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Of course, of course.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Those dang yanks with their powerful COVID that they keep making.

318
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah, we got those powerful strains.

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We got the good stuff.

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
China may have done it first, but we did it best.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We mixed it up.

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
A concoction.

323
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

324
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Anyway, yeah.

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, I got it from Christmas camp and then I was sort of bedridden, actually.

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It was really bad for the first few days.

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Couldn't really move.

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Cough and spluttering.

329
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You didn't take a COVID test?

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I can be fucking bothered.

331
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I felt like it would go away after a couple of days.

332
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It wasn't like, I felt like I was going to die.

333
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I mean, I think you're a little scared at one point.

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Just because I don't like running out of water in the middle of the night and I'm like,

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
oh, everyone's asleep and I need somebody to get me a drink,

336
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
but I have to be the one to do that.

337
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So I have to get out of my nice warm bed and die on the way there.

338
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
When you're sick, the chills, the chills feeling when you're out of your bed.

340
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Gotcha.

342
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's that sort of thing where if a light breeze gets me,

343
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I start coughing and spluttering uncontrollably for like 20 minutes.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So it's bad.

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It was bad and I'm better.

346
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But because of that, couldn't do any work.

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I stayed up in bed looking at my phone and it was like, wow, fuck.

348
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I want to draw.

349
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I want to make so many things.

350
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I had so many creative ideas.

351
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I wrote a bunch of things down.

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, that's good.

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
When I was able to, when I was like cognizant,

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
when my brain was allowing me to like look at my phone,

355
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
because sometimes it was just too hard.

356
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But yeah, it really is one of those like, if you can't work, you really want to.

357
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If you can't do creative stuff, suddenly everything comes to you.

358
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Suddenly, when you're forcing yourself away from that constant grind,

359
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
you're like, oh, I can come up with stuff and I couldn't do anything about it.

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, yeah.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But now that I'm on the mend, I'm going to immediately forget all that

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and play video games instead.

363
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Definitely, definitely.

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You know it's bad when I'm playing Noida.

365
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I played Noida like twice, three times this week.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Game sucks, man.

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That game sucks so bad.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I just, I've just, I've so thoroughly explored its mechanics that like playing it

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and winning is just like a totally rote exercise.

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There's no point in it anymore.

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But I did it, I don't know, I guess just to procrastinate and it worked.

372
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, sometimes that's all you need is just something to occupy your mind for a few hours.

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah.

374
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It might be the cold, it might be the cold weather, so demotivating.

375
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's why you need the Christmas spirit.

376
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You need like cool lighting.

377
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That is why I need Jesus, yes.

378
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, I mean you can have Jesus.

379
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You can have Jesus.

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He ain't going to, you put him on the shelf.

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He ain't going to hurt you.

382
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You heard a elf on a shelf?

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

384
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I haven't, I don't know what it is.

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But you should put Christmas lights everywhere.

386
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You should put nice colorful stuff.

387
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Not necessarily like Christmas-y stuff, but just like cool colors that you like.

388
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think my banana wall handles pretty Christmas-y.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like neon green baubles and like purple killer stuff.

390
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, that's cool.

391
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
For Sly Mernalia?

392
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yo Sly Mernalia.

394
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yo Sly Mernalia.

395
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Woo!

396
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Shit, I was going to mention something.

397
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, I've been lifting again.

398
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I started lifting again.

399
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's generally like the one good thing that I can be like,

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
that's good about it this week.

401
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And I've been lifting for like probably two weeks now.

402
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm sticking with it.

403
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That feels good.

404
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'd like to be strong.

405
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm weak right now.

406
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
My numbers are pathetic.

407
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But I'll get them, I'll get them back.

408
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hell yeah.

409
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'll get them back.

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I've been, I've been pretty sloppy with my dieting lately.

411
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I've been pretty sloppy with my calories, but

412
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and my excuse is, oh no, it's my, no, I'm bulking bro.

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm bulking.

414
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Because I'm lifting again, so I got to eat big together.

415
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm bulking, which means I'm from that, the bulking.

416
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm bulking-izing.

417
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm bulking-izing bro.

418
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm splitting up into lots of small units.

419
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Smaller and smaller, but more numerous bends.

420
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Balkanizing.

421
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Balkanizing over and over again.

422
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
What if you turned into three smaller version of yourself

423
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and they had like one third of your personality each?

424
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think if I did that-

425
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Who would win?

426
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
If they fought immediately, because they probably would.

427
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Who would win?

428
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think if I did it twice and I became nine little pieces,

429
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
they'd be nine little tiny baby Ben Saiyans.

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But for the medium-sized ones, who would win?

431
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I mean, they would-

432
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Divide your personality into three distinct Ben Saiyans.

433
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, there's-

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
There's Twitter Ben.

435
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

436
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
There's Twitter Ben.

437
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There's-

438
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Drunk Ben.

439
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh my god.

440
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And there's Normal Ben.

441
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Normal Ben is the smallest of the three.

442
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I think Drunk Ben would probably win.

443
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Because he takes action.

444
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Whereas Twitter Ben talks a big game, it doesn't do anything.

445
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He folds like a paper tiger.

446
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So, yeah.

447
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
If Drunk Ben and Twitter Ben fused, you'd be drunk on Twitter.

448
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And then imagine the possibilities.

449
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I have done that and it sucks.

450
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I've done that a couple times and every time I look at my tweets from the last night,

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm like, what am I talking about?

452
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Why did I post that?

453
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So, I don't even remember.

454
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't even remember what I posted drunk,

455
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but I don't even want to remember.

456
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't want to think about it.

457
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Surprisingly, it's not a very powerful combination.

458
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Surprisingly, it doesn't get a lot done.

459
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Drunk Gib tweets, I think are pretty good.

460
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
When I get on it, when I get on it like a stupid tweet,

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
like moment, it's mostly just like stupid jokes.

462
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah.

463
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Because I'm throwing so much stuff out there that some of them are going to be funny.

464
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And then the bad ones, people just scroll past.

465
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's just like, weren't we saying this about Red Man the other day that like,

466
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
yeah, it's not many, the jokes aren't good, but there's more of them.

467
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah.

468
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So, that's got to count for some...

469
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Just like doing a comedy stand-up, it's four hours long.

470
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
People get really restless.

471
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But like, there's so many jokes.

472
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What if I did like stand-up comedy?

473
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But instead, I wasn't funny and I was talking about Mega Man for eight hours.

474
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
What if I did that, huh?

475
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And then by the time I was done, my oats would be done.

476
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Hey, I brought it back.

477
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You should do another eight-hour video and then make that reference.

478
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Wait.

479
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Like have oats in the background.

480
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Have oats in the fridge just the beginning of the video.

481
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The next lecture is just about like oats.

482
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And it's just about like, hey, I've decided to just talk about this while my oats...

483
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Sorry, my oats have to sit in the fridge for a while.

484
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So, I just got to talk.

485
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm just going to talk to you.

486
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, that's a good theme.

487
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You know, I sort of came around on the idea of doing a follow-up about Battle Network.

488
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I was thinking about it and I was like, I should just do that.

489
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I should just do that.

490
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So, I went and I downloaded ROMs for all the Battle Network games and the Star Forest games.

491
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I was like, maybe I'll just play one and just see.

492
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Turns out they're so fucking long.

493
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They're so fucking long.

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I've heard that they're like RPGs or tactics things.

495
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, they are.

496
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, pretty much.

497
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I mean, the battles are sort of like...

498
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, they're sort of like tactical RPGs kind of.

499
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But the gameplay is mostly running around talking to people like an RPG.

500
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So, yeah, they're all like 15 to 30 plus hour-long RPGs the whole series.

501
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And there's like 10 of them.

502
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And it's like, oh god.

503
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
150 hour lecture.

504
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Regular Mega Man games only take a few hours to beat.

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is just...

506
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't want to do it.

507
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Now I lost my motivation.

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I don't want to do it.

509
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because I feel like I have to play them.

510
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I feel like I have to.

511
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I can't not play them.

512
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Can you imagine?

513
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
My wonder is like the Mega Man lore is interesting at a glance.

514
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
There's a lot of weird things about it.

515
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And you're like, I wonder how that all connects.

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Battle Network I know absolutely nothing about except that one meme screenshot of that old guy who says I'm 30 years old.

517
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh yeah.

518
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Like that's the only thing I know about it.

519
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So I don't even know whether playing every game would be even that interesting.

520
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah.

521
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Like lore-wise.

522
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Well, I mean, I know the plot of the first game.

523
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I know what happens in the first game.

524
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I know that lots of the characters...

525
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, I know that it's about humans and these network AIs that interact with each other.

526
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And all the network AI characters are named things from Mega Man.

527
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And they sort of bear some resemblance or they take some inspiration from Mega Man characters,

528
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
but they're not the same characters.

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So I assume it has its whole own completely separate...

530
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
This guy is this guy's dad and this guy is that other guy's former business partner or whatever.

531
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I mean, I assume I could make a flowchart of character relationships and stuff.

532
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I know, I'm not going to spoil it.

533
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I already know that just in the first game there are some twist reveal of what this guy is actually that guy is so-and-so.

534
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So...

535
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Wily is Light's son?

536
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Son?

537
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Daughter? Yeah, stuff like that.

538
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No, there definitely is a lore to be explained.

539
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's a little bit like...

540
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,000
With Mega Man, you're pretty much piecing together a story out of many games that basically don't have hardly any story.

541
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Whereas basically in Battle Network, the game is all story, because it's all dialogue.

542
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, it's just all dialogue.

543
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So you're going to make a lecture about the gameplay?

544
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah.

545
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Which I think is grid based.

546
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Anyway.

547
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It implies the existence of grid cringe.

548
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Grid cringe is...

549
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Well, grid based is when you have characters on a map like Final Fantasy Tactics.

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Maybe Mega Man Battle Network is grid cringe, because instead of a big world map that you walk around in a grid on, it's just a little 3x4 tile grid that you kind of bleep around on.

551
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Maybe grid cringes when you use a pentagram.

552
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Not a pentagram, pentagon grid.

553
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And then you have those tiny little things to fill in the gaps, because you can't tile with a pentagon.

554
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, and the little placeholders are the grid cringes?

555
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, you can technically move through them or on them.

556
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But it's like, ah, your foot's over the line.

557
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It cuts in no space.

558
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There's no space for this one.

560
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Alright.

561
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:11,000
An anime about being a floor tyler in the competitive floor tiling business, but your weird character quirk is that you only tile with pentagonal tiles and everyone laughs at you.

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Like this is so fucked.

563
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This is so fucked.

564
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What am I looking at?

565
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Why would you do, why would you make this so difficult for yourself?

566
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
There's no advantage to this whatsoever.

567
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And you said, my father died tiling a floor with squares.

568
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I said, I'll never use squares again.

569
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And then I said, why didn't you use hexagons then?

570
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And you say, shut up.

571
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Just shut up.

572
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Don't fucking talk to me.

573
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I can't count that high.

574
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Because I only go one step beyond, he said, wagging his finger.

575
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The hexagons are too powerful.

576
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But then he discovers that you can make a grid on a 3D, on a sphere and he invents the football.

577
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And everyone's like, what?

578
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You can play chess on a football?

579
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And he's like, hell yeah, you can.

580
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He uses again Jutsu.

581
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
He uses again Jutsu to draw you into his spherical pentagonal chess world and you have to beat him in a game of skill.

582
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Are you okay?

583
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh no, I killed him.

584
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh, hang on.

585
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'll be okay in a second.

586
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Take your time and get some more coffee.

587
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
A few moments later.

588
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What's up?

589
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, all right.

590
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You gonna make it?

591
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

592
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Still not perfectly well, but that's okay.

593
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The views on the Mega Man Lecture have calmed down.

594
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I think it's getting like 5K views a day or something now, which is, no.

595
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yeah, something like that.

596
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Which is okay, you know.

597
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's more views than my Mega Man Lecture has.

598
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
When I say it out loud, you know, it doesn't sound that bad, although it's kind of, you know, it was after seeing it get like 30K a day for a while there.

599
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It feels like, ugh, ugh, the hype is dead.

600
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, so, you know, it's, the line has like stopped peaking.

601
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's kind of down to like, I wonder what did it level out?

602
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
If it levels out, if it like levels out for like a long term at like, even like a thousand views a day, that would be incredible.

603
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That would make me, that would make me like, that would be making me like $7 a day forever.

604
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Wow.

605
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Forever and ever.

606
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I mean, it won't do that forever.

607
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What if it did though?

608
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What if it did?

609
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What if it did?

610
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What's your biggest video, the Sonic 101?

611
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Sonic 101?

612
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That one continues to, I mean, other than maybe this one, but like, that one continues to get the most views forever.

614
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's like a few hundred views a day, I think.

615
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
No, no, no, no.

616
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I mean, what do you want to know? I can look at my analytics.

617
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, yeah, views per day.

618
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What's the average?

619
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Well, let me, you mean like before I put this new video out when like, the channel was just kind of dormant?

620
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah, if it went down after that.

621
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Oh, I'm almost at 25k subscribers.

622
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, you know, let me look over the past year.

623
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Over the past year, before this new video came out, the Sonichu lecture was getting,

624
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Sonichu 101 was getting 2 to 500, somewhere in the 2 to 500, 300-ish views a day on average.

625
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's pretty good.

626
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Still, like for an older video, even though it's over a million views at this point.

627
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's over one and a half million now.

628
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Wacky.

629
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But then like, you know, when this new video was out that, well, it was getting like a thousand, it got like a thousand views a day just from like runoff clicks, I guess.

630
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Now it's down.

631
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yesterday got 500, 300.

632
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So it's kind of back to where it was now.

633
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
How many views did yesterday Mega Man lecture got?

634
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh no, a pitiful 3,000.

635
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's over.

636
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's over.

637
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's so over.

638
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's over.

639
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You know, while I was sick, I did manage to get my PS4 on.

640
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I played some Dark Cloud because I got the PS2 version on the thing.

641
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Like digital, digital store?

642
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Digital, digital version, yeah.

643
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm like playing that again.

644
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm like, ah, it's so good.

645
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's my favorite.

646
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I'm like, I wanted to make that Dark Cloud video.

647
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And this was like one of the prerequisites.

648
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But you did make a Dark Cloud video.

649
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
No, no, I mean, like earlier weeks ago, I was talking about like a possibility of talking about Dark Cloud lore and its connection to the sequel.

650
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh yeah, I vaguely remember that.

651
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah.

652
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And it would have required me to play the games again to reacquaint myself.

653
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because like Dark Cloud is not like obscure, but it is not a cult thing with like active members.

654
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Like if you look for information.

655
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There's no Dark Cloud fandom.

656
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
There is, but like they're not like active.

657
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like you can find wikis and stuff, but they're very basic, very bare bones.

658
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
A lot of the stuff that's in the game doesn't exist online for you to read.

659
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So you have to play the game to read like dialogue from characters.

660
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And sometimes the dialogue doesn't repeat.

661
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So like certain bits of information, you just have to play the game to find it because nobody's documented all that shit.

662
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So I'm like, I'm playing it and I'm enjoying it.

663
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And I'm like, yeah, more people need to be obsessive fans of Dark Cloud.

664
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I kind of should make a video.

665
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I kind of should.

666
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I kind of will.

667
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I probably will.

668
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'll watch it.

669
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh my God.

670
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
A video.

671
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
What the fuck?

672
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What the fuck?

673
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't know how to like structure it.

674
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We are so back.

675
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The PCP is so back.

676
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
We are so videoing right now.

677
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But like there's multiple ways I could go about it.

678
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I was thinking of like, I know this way it will get no views and no one will care.

679
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But I just wanted to like make a long rambling video where there's no point.

680
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm just talking about cool things in Dark Cloud.

681
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm just talking about it.

682
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And it's like, it would open with like a little musing on the fact that most videos these days, they're all about teaching you something.

683
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like there's someone teaching you like a moral or like a lesson or some interesting fact.

684
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah.

685
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm not a teacher.

686
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm a gamer and I'm going to fucking game.

687
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm just going to talk about my favorite game and I'm going to say, look at this, look at that.

688
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And it was going to be a terrible video.

689
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
No one would like it.

690
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So I really should try and think of something different.

691
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I kind of miss.

692
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
This is a side tangent topic.

693
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Like, do you remember when YouTube was not like a like entirely like educational?

694
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We're like, yeah, sure.

695
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah.

696
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It was just stupid shit.

697
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's just stupid shit.

698
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:27,000
People stupid people stupid home videos and people stupid and flash cartoons flash cartoons and like 360p resolution rips of new grounds flash cartoons.

699
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I believe.

700
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I forget who said it.

701
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But I think.

702
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There was like a like a shift where people's shit posts and like half second ideas that they would have made a small YouTube video or a vlog or something about back in the day have been like consumed by other social media websites like Twitter.

703
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Like if you make you have like a funny idea, you don't make a video about it anymore.

704
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You tweet it.

705
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You tweet it and then it's out and then you've done it.

706
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And you get responses and it's like instant making videos a longer process.

707
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So now making a video has to be has to mean something has to have like a big purpose.

708
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And if the purpose is usually is like, I know something and I'm going to teach you it.

709
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm going to be an authority figure and you're going to be wrapped with attention because of how smart I am and how correct I am or how well I can explain something.

710
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
That's me.

711
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That's me now.

712
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah.

713
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Literally me.

714
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
No, but I get you.

715
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And it's like, that's fine.

716
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I don't dislike that.

717
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But when it comes to my my enjoyment for making videos, the videos I enjoy the most are the shit posts.

718
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
All of the like little stupid videos I made on Gibb and take that like had nothing to do with anything.

719
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It was just like, I've had a cool idea.

720
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I made it.

721
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And then the most scripted stuff.

722
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I felt like a pressure to be smart.

723
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't feel smart.

724
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I feel like I'm stupid, actually.

725
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Okay.

726
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So it's like, it's got to lean into that, I guess.

727
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I guess.

728
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But like, I think I wouldn't be that there's not really a climate that accepts videos that are not like educational or like have some sense of authority.

729
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm not sure if I if that that can't be completely true.

730
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Maybe not.

731
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's just sort of my reservations about making a video is this the sense that it has to be really big, big splash.

732
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And it can't just be like a casual little experience because people are going to get bored or something.

733
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I feel like.

734
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Would it be a would it be a long video?

735
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I don't know.

736
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It might not be.

737
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It might be that there's nothing to talk about.

738
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And I just have the idea and I say it.

739
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And then I'm done.

740
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But it'd probably be kind of long.

741
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Remember when I did that?

742
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That let's read Lillia's book?

743
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah.

744
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The video, the video sucks.

745
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The video sucks.

746
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But it's you can't remember it.

747
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I don't know if I watched it.

748
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
There's not very.

749
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I mean, it's whatever.

750
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That's whatever.

751
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Honestly.

752
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That video is sloppy.

753
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I filmed it with a fucking shitty webcam.

754
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
My my quality sucks.

755
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, I don't even know.

756
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I don't know why I did that.

757
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Like if I was going to make that video.

758
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It wouldn't have been that hard to just like make it good.

759
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But I just didn't invest like.

760
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I did not invest into like the pretty small.

761
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't know why I was so afraid of spending like $100 to have like.

762
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Well, I guess I guess.

763
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I guess I had a worse phone at the time.

764
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So my camera quality was bad.

765
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So I opted to use that shitty web camera.

766
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And then I.

767
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And I was like, oh, well, I have a good enough microphone.

768
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So I'll use this microphone instead of buying a real one.

769
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And so my audio quality is bad, my video quality is bad.

770
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And then I mean.

771
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The video itself is just me like.

772
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah, there's no there's no point to it.

773
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's just me pointing out like things I find amusing as I read through the book.

774
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And like, I guess I guess that's fine.

775
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But it's just not there's not a lot to it.

776
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
There's no there's no real there's no real overarching point to what I'm doing in it.

777
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So whatever video sucks.

778
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Could have been better, but it wasn't.

779
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But it's fine.

780
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know what point I'm making.

781
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
The point is that you sometimes is okay to just make a video and it's bad.

782
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I've done it and it's good.

783
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, I guess that's my hang up.

784
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't want to make a video that's bad.

785
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You don't want to be like me.

786
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You don't want to end up like me.

787
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I feel that with a big old video that's everyone loves.

788
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I do have.

789
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah, but before I made that one, I had to make the crappy one that everyone hates.

790
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And then I had to wait like two years for no reason.

791
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It's a process of becoming.

792
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I guess.

793
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I guess it's the same with any art form.

794
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's sometimes going to suck.

795
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I just, um, I feel like.

796
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Honestly, I'm the Lillia video I made on a complete whim.

797
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I just had the idea and then like a week later, I did it.

798
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Whereas the Mega Man lecture I prepared for for like months.

799
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

800
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Obviously, the more work you put into it, the better it is.

801
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's just, um, I guess it's YouTube feels less approachable than it used to.

802
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
No, yeah.

803
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It feels like because the quality like medium or whatever phrase you would use, average quality of videos in general, really, really high, really high up there.

804
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There's so many amazing things you can watch.

805
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Why would anyone click on something that wasn't like great or like stick with it?

806
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm like, uh, I'd like it when people pay attention.

807
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
That's the reason I make a video is for people to watch it.

808
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So I better make it good.

809
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But now it's like, I don't even know if I can.

810
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So, uh, fuck it.

811
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I think, um, yeah, I feel you.

812
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So I think the, I think the, um, the thing there, the solution there is that.

813
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You just kind of have to market it or not market, but you kind of have to hope that it would be good on the back of like people want to hear about Dark Cloud.

814
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Like if you've got stuff, if you've got stuff to say about Dark Cloud, like do people, if people want to hear.

815
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
If people want to be, oh yeah, I remember that game.

816
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yeah. Oh, tell me, tell me some things I didn't know about Dark Cloud.

817
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
That then, I mean, you know, it's, that's not, that's not an overly saturated market right there.

818
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Not many people are talking about Dark Cloud.

819
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Uh, but there's probably, you know, people that remember the game for playing as kids might nevertheless be like, oh yeah, I'm interested in that content.

820
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And that's, and that's the market, that's the demographic you got to capture.

821
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And you know, if you can, if you can capture the interest of that demographic, you know, you don't got to do anything like mind blowing with it.

822
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I guess not.

823
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's just, uh, I'll try it.

824
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I'll play the game, I'll play the next game and then maybe I'll play them through again with take notes more like thoroughly.

825
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Cause there's a few things I've noticed, but I haven't been taking notes cause I've been like just playing for fun.

826
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But yeah, I think, I think I could do it. I think I could do something.

827
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Maybe it'd be a waste of time, but I feel like, I feel like it's worth putting the time in maybe.

828
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I just, I just will feel bad if nobody pays attention.

829
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
If I don't get my millions of views.

830
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Well, how am I going to face Ben Saint?

831
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You can't. You can't.

832
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Am I going to return to the podcast?

833
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
No.

834
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I used to be someone in the broding community.

835
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I was a higher roller because like the rolling was so low.

836
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Oh no. I've dropped from, I've dropped, oh that, that, that realization.

837
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Oh no, I used to be D-list horse famous, but now I'm, now I'm E-list.

838
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
No.

839
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Um, I've dropped a rung.

840
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah.

841
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Uh, you, you will be judged on your metrics, on your video, on the Saber metrics, your videos performance.

842
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The Saber spark?

843
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It's, it's better, yes.

844
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yes. Saber spark.

845
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's better to not make, it's better to not make it and, and so, so that there's no chance that like the view count won't be high, right?

846
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's like they say, you, you miss 100% of the shots you never take and it's better to just commit to missing every shot.

847
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's how you get, that's how you make the big boss.

848
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't even know if that makes sense.

849
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That's where you get the real reason. Just commit, just commit, just commit to missing every shot as a bit.

850
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Okay.

851
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And just sell it.

852
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Like this is, just sell it.

853
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's like, I don't know why I'm imagining archery, but like you're at the archery thing and it's like, oh wow, that guy over there, he hasn't even fired his bow.

854
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Whoa.

855
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Whoa, he must be like, he's like, that guy must like, really, he must be so good that he like isn't even wasting his time shooting this target.

856
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's like targets too close.

857
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

858
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Dan, that guy is such a good archer.

859
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
He's like embarrassed by like how, how, how easy the shot would be when he finally fires his bow though.

860
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah.

861
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We're all going to die.

862
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
He's going to kill all.

863
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I've realized I've been peeking the mic.

864
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
That's bad.

865
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Oh, I did, I did that also.

866
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah.

867
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'd rather peek the mic than have the mic peep at me.

868
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
If you know what I'm saying.

869
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No, I don't.

870
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Okay.

871
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It's not got eyes, but it has got ears.

872
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Doesn't make any sense.

873
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I shaved my mustache.

874
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Not my, my beard is starting to grow in a little bit and I shaved the mustache off because I was picking at it and it looks like shit.

875
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You have a reverse chaplain.

876
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yeah, I guess.

877
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I guess I was picking, I was picking at my mustache and I kind of picked like a hole in it and I was like, well, that looks like shit.

878
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So I shaved it off and I was like, well, at least it looks like I did this on purpose, but it still looks bad.

879
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But I don't know.

880
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
There's, that story is not going anywhere.

881
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
There's no, yeah, there's no, there's no, there's no less than that.

882
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Hey, just to update my facial hair situation.

883
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Oh, it's fucked.

884
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yep.

885
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's right.

886
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
That's right.

887
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You should have a corner.

888
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh, no, I didn't read one piece.

889
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh, you fucker.

890
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
We'll have to read it live again.

891
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Again?

892
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
No, hang on.

893
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
This is the bit.

894
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
This is the new bit.

895
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
No, it's a bad bit.

896
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It might be a bad bit.

897
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It might be a bad bit, but it's the one we got.

898
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's the only one we got.

899
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Shit, we don't have to talk about that now.

900
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
No, we'll do it later.

901
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We'll do it just before or after voicemails, probably before.

902
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah, before.

903
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Don't worry about it.

904
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Totally forgot, totally forgot that that's the thing we do.

905
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah, I didn't read this week's one yet.

906
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I was too busy not doing other things.

907
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I was too busy ruining my beard.

908
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I'm so stupid.

909
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm so stupid.

910
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Why is you so stupid?

911
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I want to grow my beard in, but I can't.

912
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I can't do it, Gib.

913
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I literally can't do it.

914
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You mean because you keep picking at it?

915
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yes, yes.

916
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I can't not do it anymore.

917
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I used to be able to not do it and I can't not do it.

918
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Get you a little fidgety thing, like a little autism clickety-clack machine.

919
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It doesn't work.

920
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It doesn't work.

921
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You can grab that instead.

922
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It doesn't work.

923
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Maybe you should buy a fake beard.

924
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's a good idea, but it doesn't work.

925
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You should buy a fake beard and wear it on top so that you can pick on that instead.

926
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I had...

927
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You know what?

928
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's my fault.

929
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I brought it up, but I don't want to change my mind about wanting to talk about it.

930
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So let's talk about something else.

931
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But that's it.

932
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I didn't take notes.

933
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I don't have any notes this week.

934
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Well, I have one more note.

935
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah, go for it.

936
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I thought of doing a high school like manga where it's like they go to school,

937
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
but with all of my OCs in there, and it'll be non-canon to other things.

938
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I was going to say, is it an AU?

939
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah.

940
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's the augmented universe.

941
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And there's going to be Clarissa, and there's going to be Gun Girl,

942
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and there's going to be Red Man and a lot of ghosts.

943
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And Hippo and Gibbon take the pony, and then me as a person.

944
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh, okay.

945
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And then fucking everyone.

946
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Even characters from comics I haven't made yet are going to show up.

947
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And their joke is going to be like, oh, what comic are you from?

948
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I don't know.

949
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I think it's going to be fun.

950
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I think it'll be a fun thing.

951
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But I have to make sure I don't try and make it too serious and too good.

952
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It has to be shit.

953
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It has to be really bad, because then I could actually make it if it's supposed to be really bad.

954
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
That's right.

955
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
That's how to combat AI, is to draw bad shit that sucks and nobody wants to steal.

956
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They won't put it in the machine then.

957
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You draw so many bad things that it poisons the machine, and it's like,

958
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
oh no, now the machine can only draw things that are bad.

959
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Or, yeah, better yet, make only good things.

960
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So the machine only draws good things, and then there's no market for good things,

961
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and then you don't have to draw anything good anymore.

962
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Then only humans can draw bad things.

963
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You get what I'm saying?

964
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Now, you as a human artist, you're like, well, nobody wants quality anymore.

965
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Just a shitpost, please.

966
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Just give me something nice and sloppy.

967
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah.

968
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Did you see what I was going to say?

969
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Did you ever watch Community?

970
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
No.

971
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I've heard it's good.

972
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I've been meaning to get around to that for years.

973
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You just said about, oh, what comic are you from?

974
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
No, I don't think this is even what you were talking about,

975
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but it just reminded me that there's one episode where they do this a lot.

976
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,000
They might do it a bunch, but there's one episode in particular where they have a clip show episode.

977
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You know what I mean?

978
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Yeah.

979
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yeah, only all the clip shows, all the episodes that they're supposedly referencing with the clip show are not real episodes.

980
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's new content that they made in a clip show format,

981
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and so all the characters are like, huh, remember that time when we all had to chip in for the big bake sale,

982
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and then Bryce got poisoned, but poisoned from the banana nut muffins,

983
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
and everyone's like, oh yeah, and then they flash back to an episode that never happened.

984
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That's great.

985
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yeah.

986
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't know.

987
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Do that.

988
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I guess.

989
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Can we use a good show?

990
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I also obviously need to do Clarissa because she's still there not being finished.

991
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
How's that going?

992
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Well, nothing much.

993
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I haven't worked over the past week, and so it's the same as where it was last time,

994
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
which is that I'm at the epilogue in terms of blocking,

995
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and then I need to start inking and sketching the finished drawings for the next chapter, chapter four.

996
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You're at the epilogue, so you finished blocking like the climax and all that.

997
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Oh, wow, okay.

999
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, I mean, still looking forward to it.

1000
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Still gonna hype for whenever I can finally read it.

1001
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Glad to hear it's still going.

1003
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Did you see that I got called unbecoming by a unique name of Sora on Twitter?

1004
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh, yeah, I saw.

1005
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
How untoward.

1006
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
How untoward.

1007
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
How uncouth.

1008
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
How unseemly.

1009
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
How unsightly.

1010
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You called a woman a bitch.

1011
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I literally called a woman a bitch, and I literally told someone that their art was bad.

1012
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I literally did those things.

1013
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm a literal bad person.

1014
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So uncouth, Benzene, so unsightly.

1015
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's so funny.

1016
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I don't know.

1017
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I mean, I guess I wouldn't expect him to know like me at all.

1018
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So like, I guess I can't be like, haha, he doesn't know what I'm like.

1019
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But it's just such a funny, it's just such a funny attempt at a gotcha to me like Benzene.

1020
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'm gonna get, you were rude.

1021
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You were rude to someone online.

1022
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Was it like you were shit talking him, and then they pulled up those as like Benzene.

1023
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You said some nasty stuff.

1024
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You said some nasty things, so fuck you.

1025
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah, I call them a dweeb because he was posting like, okay, I mean, I didn't watch that eight

1026
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
hour NFT rant, but you know the one.

1027
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Yeah.

1028
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You know how in that there's like some girl, there's some like artist who like quit Twitter,

1029
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and he's sort of is like, honestly, the whole, I mean, I didn't watch it, so I don't know.

1030
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
But from what the sounds of it, it sounds like the whole video is basically just an excuse

1031
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
to White Knight for this, for this damsel.

1032
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I get the feeling that this all might just be a big weird social thing that like he's like

1033
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
doing out of some sense of like defending this woman.

1034
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, possibly.

1035
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah.

1036
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I also haven't seen it.

1037
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I remember Cheesy talked about it on the show, but I forget.

1038
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Well, I think that lady, I think it was her, made him a piece of fan art for one of his

1039
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
characters in like a comic that he is trying to get produced or something.

1040
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And so he was like, you know, he retweeted the fan art.

1041
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
He was like, you know, thanks.

1042
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
He said some stuff and then he made a follow up post that was like, he was waxing all like,

1043
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
oh, I've made so many sacrifices this year.

1044
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I've been trying to do what I think was right.

1045
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm trying to do the right thing.

1046
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You know, it's so hard being a NFT guy, but I do it for the fans.

1047
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I do it for the, you know, I do it for the love of the game, you know, and I told him

1048
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
he was a dweeb.

1049
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I said he's being a dweeb.

1050
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And I think he didn't know who I was.

1051
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So he searched my handle and the word NFTs to find like, what is my NFT take?

1052
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I think in doing so he discovered that I am a generally anti NFT person.

1053
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And then he found a couple of tweets that he thought made me look bad.

1054
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And then he posted them at me and said, you know, you called this, you called the woman

1055
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
a bitch and you called this other artist.

1056
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
He said their art was bad.

1057
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And the woman that I called it supposedly called a bitch was Sakimi Chan.

1058
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And I didn't say like, oh, she's a bitch.

1059
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I just referred to her as like this bitch.

1060
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And he said this bitch makes like $300,000 a year on Patreon or something.

1061
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So it was, it was like hardly even an insult in the way I was using it.

1062
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I was just like referring to her as like, oh, this person is disgustingly wealthy.

1063
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And now they're doing NFTs on top of all that money that they make.

1064
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Yeah.

1065
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah.

1066
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So I think, I think that's how he put that together.

1067
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's just such a funny thing to even consider doing like, oh, I got a, this guy called me

1068
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
a dweeb.

1069
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I've got to do something about this.

1070
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah.

1071
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah.

1072
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Pretty funny.

1073
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I am, I really, I really, I really don't like that guy.

1074
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I really, and it's, I really, he's, he's pretty disgusting.

1075
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
He disgusts me.

1076
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I have a lot of contempt for him.

1077
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I think he's very pathetic.

1078
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I think that his, the weird, I was thinking about it.

1079
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's his, his thing, his NFT take, he's literally, it's worse and it's more off-putting and

1080
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
it's more like, it's more despicable to me than someone who is just scamming people.

1081
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like someone who like does like a drop and then a rug pull and scams people out of money.

1082
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Like at least I understand them.

1083
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
They're doing it for money.

1084
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
They're, they're, they're stealing money.

1085
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
This guy isn't even really doing it.

1086
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I mean, he, he is getting some money in support from people that like are like, yes, keep,

1087
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
keep preaching the good word of NFTs, my brother.

1088
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But he's not like, I don't, as far as I can tell, he doesn't sell NFTs.

1089
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He doesn't like directly make money off of NFTs.

1090
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
He just is like ideologically committed to the position that everything should be made

1091
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
into a monetary transaction.

1092
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
He just, he just thinks that is a moral good and he's doing it out of that.

1093
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Insane worldview.

1094
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
To me, that's worse than someone who is just a thief who wants money.

1095
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Like that's like a true, true brain worms.

1096
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It is, it is a bizarre place to draw your line in the sand.

1097
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah.

1098
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That's why I think it must be like a, like a, like a social thing.

1099
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

1100
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I think there's some element of like, he is doing this out of some misguided loyalty

1101
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,000
to someone and he feels he, the way he was posting is very much like,

1102
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I've made a huge fool out of myself, but I did it for love, you know?

1103
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Like it could have been saying that.

1104
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Fuck you, unique nemosaurus.

1105
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You're a little bitch.

1106
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You're a little bitch.

1107
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You're an even bigger bitch than Tsukimi-chan.

1108
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Wow.

1109
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah.

1110
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Fighting words.

1111
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Just despicable.

1112
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
A truly despicable little worm.

1113
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I don't know why I'm getting so, I don't know why I'm getting so annoyed.

1114
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Like who cares?

1115
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
He's irritating.

1116
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Just irritating.

1117
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
What else happened to me this week?

1118
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I already mentioned him lifting.

1119
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But are you putting it down?

1120
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That's the important part.

1121
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Oops.

1122
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh, that's what, a clunk.

1123
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Oh, that's better.

1124
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh, a few.

1125
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Maybe that's why I've gotten so little else done, because like the cold weather is so

1126
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
innervating.

1127
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And then like when I am, I have to go walk to the, to Munchie house to do my lifts and

1128
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
then I gotta walk back and that's just all I can fucking muster under these conditions.

1129
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That's all I can do.

1130
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Do they have like Christmassy stuff?

1131
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
No.

1132
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't think so.

1133
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Hmm.

1134
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I don't think so.

1135
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Hmm.

1136
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Pretty sus.

1137
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I'm getting in that spirit.

1138
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's a whole neighborhood, a whole neighborhood of Scrooge's over here.

1139
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Gotta have the colorful lights.

1140
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You gotta be like distracted by all of the blinking.

1141
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Gotta have athletic fits.

1142
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Now, when it gets dark, when it gets dark, I'm gonna like go and look outside just to

1143
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
make sure I haven't like just not been paying attention.

1144
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
But yeah, now that you mention it, I feel like I should have seen some lights by now.

1145
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And I can't recall seeing any lights.

1146
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That's, that's wild.

1147
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I can't wait to put lights all over my room because when the main light is off, it is

1148
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
kind of spooky.

1149
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I would like like a big blue something or other or some.

1150
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah, actually blue.

1151
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I want a blue light.

1152
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I want a cool blue or like a warm blue or some sort of a blue.

1153
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I'm feeling very blue, not in a sad way.

1154
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah.

1155
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
But I just.

1156
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But in like a Dabu-D, Dabu-Dag.

1157
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah.

1158
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yeah.

1159
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Cool.

1160
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah.

1161
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Maybe it's because the PS4 like loading screen, home screen is blue and I've been looking

1162
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
at that.

1163
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I was considering buying some like, not just for like decorative purposes.

1164
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Like I sort of had an idea that I might make a little bit of, well, it would be, it was

1165
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
going to be for a slime and punishment related video, like a promo video for that.

1166
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But I thought I might buy some like black light.

1167
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Like, you know, like, like, you know, like, like string lights, like roll, roll or, well,

1168
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
you know, like.

1169
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Black lights.

1170
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Yeah, but they come in a roll and you roll them like along like the corners of your room

1171
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
to like black light light up your room with.

1172
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You know what I mean?

1173
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Do you, you mean like Siemens stain black light or is that?

1174
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1175
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I mean, the purple ones that make things.

1176
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Oh, yeah.

1177
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

1178
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Isn't that, is that ultraviolet or is that something else?

1179
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

1180
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Well, it was, it wasn't a yes or no question.

1181
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Well, you said is that ultraviolet or is that something else?

1182
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And the answer is yes, it's.

1183
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Something else.

1184
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Okay.

1185
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
No, no, it is.

1186
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
No, it is ultraviolet.

1187
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Oh.

1188
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Well, in the low ultra, that's why it's called a black light is because it gives off only

1189
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
a little bit of visible light and mostly it gives off light in the low ultraviolet spectrum.

1190
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I see.

1191
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You can't see it unless it is, you know, reflecting off of some sort of fluorescent thing and making

1192
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
it glow.

1193
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah.

1194
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah.

1195
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Okay.

1196
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I didn't realize they were the same thing.

1197
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
But yeah, that's a cool thing.

1198
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah.

1199
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So you got that like behind your desk or something?

1200
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
No, I haven't bought it yet.

1201
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I just, I'm just, I might get some.

1202
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You, you talking about putting up Christmas lights or made me think, I haven't, I haven't,

1203
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I should get those.

1204
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Or should I get, I don't know, because I think it, I think a black light effect might be

1205
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
kind of cool looking in for the slime, a slime and punishment video trailer.

1206
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,500
So should I get like track lighting or not track lighting or, you know, like, like a role

1207
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:04,900
of lights to put around like my wall or I could get two little sort of like stand lights

1208
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:10,660
that like sort of provide a like directional black light effect and use them to light a

1209
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:15,500
shot almost like, you know, regular photography lights.

1210
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:20,500
I feel like they wouldn't be quite powerful enough to light an entire shot.

1211
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,500
I wouldn't light the shot with them alone.

1212
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,500
Definitely.

1213
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:31,500
I would just use them to get like a, honestly, honestly, might not even, if like, if the

1214
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,500
shot is lit, if the shot is well lit enough to film, it might be pointless to use a black

1215
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,900
light to achieve a fluorescent effect because just the ambient lighting of the shot will

1216
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,500
overwhelm the, the fluorescent black light.

1217
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:49,500
Well, maybe you should have, maybe you should lean into the darkness angle.

1218
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,500
You get like a black light, like a lamp or whatever, shine it right at your face and

1219
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,500
then like put some like weird shit on your teeth that make them glow green and then you

1220
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:05,500
can be like a floating like darkness head and you would say, hey, look at this slime

1221
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,500
and the slime is neon and it reflects.

1222
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:13,500
That's a little different than what I was imagining, but like that is an idea and that, that could

1223
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,500
be a shot.

1224
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,500
That could be a shot for sure.

1225
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,500
Yeah.

1226
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,500
I'm thinking of the mask you have.

1227
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,500
It's like, what if that goes to be real?

1228
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Look at your face, you had green glowy teeth for real.

1229
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
I was wearing that the other day.

1230
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,500
I was wearing it.

1231
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:34,500
Well, you wouldn't need to paint them because it reflects like it makes white stuff glow,

1232
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,500
right?

1233
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,500
A little bit.

1234
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:43,500
It, black light, it can make your teeth glow a little bit.

1235
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
But not that much.

1236
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,500
Even if they're really white and my teeth are not, my teeth are not that white enough

1237
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
and not that they look like shit.

1238
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,500
They look like, like, like they're bad.

1239
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,500
I'm ugly.

1240
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,500
My teeth are fucked up.

1241
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
I have to just, I have to kill myself.

1242
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
I have to end it all.

1243
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
It's over.

1244
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,500
It's over for me.

1245
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,500
Don't worry, Ben.

1246
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
You can come to the UK.

1247
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Nobody will know.

1248
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,500
Yes.

1249
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,500
Oh my God.

1250
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,500
I fit right in.

1251
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Oh my God.

1252
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,500
I fit right in.

1253
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,500
Oh my God.

1254
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:14,500
Social societal expectations for teeth are not so strict over here.

1255
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,500
It's great.

1256
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Yes.

1257
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Yay.

1258
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:25,500
Sometimes you can have healthy teeth and they look fucked and some people just can't stand

1259
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
looking at it.

1260
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,500
Yeah.

1261
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:36,500
It's kind of a meme because like the American like super straight, super white gleaming like

1262
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:41,500
block of cheese teeth is like, it's such an American icon.

1263
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Yeah.

1264
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,500
American advertisements have those teeth everywhere.

1265
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:55,500
I think, you know, yeah, I think, I think the difference is, I mean, I think it's just

1266
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,500
an ad thing.

1267
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Like I think the difference is not that like we actually look different.

1268
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,500
No, but that's the way.

1269
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,500
I think it's just that our advertisements like heavily featured.

1270
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Advertisements and celebrities.

1271
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,500
Yeah.

1272
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Yeah.

1273
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,500
Yeah.

1274
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Yeah.

1275
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,500
Which are basically human advertisements.

1276
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,500
Yeah.

1277
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,500
But that influences the way people feel about it so much.

1278
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,500
Yeah.

1279
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:23,000
It's there are sometimes you see, I don't know who it was, but I can I can distinctly remember

1280
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
not that long ago.

1281
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,500
I saw a video clip of like some celebrities in a zoom call and some miners.

1282
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,500
I think he might have been a guy who used to be in a in a band or something.

1283
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
He was like an older guy.

1284
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,500
He's like in his sixties, you know, looks like a 60 year old guy.

1285
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,500
He's got long gray grayish hair wears glasses, you know, looks like an ex rocker or whatever.

1286
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:49,500
But he had gleaming white teeth and they looked weird.

1287
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,500
They stood out and looked like bizarre.

1288
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,500
Like they look too good.

1289
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
They don't.

1290
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
They definitely don't have pearls.

1291
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,500
Beautiful pearls.

1292
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,500
Yeah.

1293
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,500
They're definitely not real teeth.

1294
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,500
They're no noticeably, noticeably like too good for you.

1295
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
They're too good for you, sir.

1296
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Give me those teeth.

1297
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,500
You deserve them.

1298
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,500
I think I think someone was on Twitter.

1299
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,500
So I recently saw someone complaining about like veneers.

1300
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:29,500
They said like they were saying like it's fucked up that people get veneers and like they have

1301
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,500
fake teeth basically.

1302
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:35,500
It's fucked up that some people do that to like get teeth that look good, but they don't

1303
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,500
look good.

1304
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
They they they're like it.

1305
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,500
Yeah.

1306
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,500
I know veneer from like like furnishing.

1307
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,500
Yeah.

1308
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Well, I think I don't really know the details.

1309
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,500
Weird like sticker.

1310
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:52,500
So I think they will basically like file your teeth down and put like fake fronts like fake

1311
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:58,500
fronts on your teeth to have like basically the visible part of your tooth is fake tooth.

1312
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,500
And I think people do this.

1313
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,500
And then someone replied someone replied saying like I have veneers.

1314
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
I got them for like a modeling gig.

1315
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,500
Like when I was younger, I was wanted to go into modeling and they told me, you know,

1316
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,500
you got to get these veneers for your teeth to have perfect teeth.

1317
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,500
And I regret doing it.

1318
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,500
It doesn't look good, but there's nothing I can do about it now.

1319
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,500
So don't change your teeth down.

1320
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Fuck.

1321
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,500
Yeah.

1322
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Yeah.

1323
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:30,500
I think that it's a thing that looks good in photographs, but it may be in real life.

1324
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:35,500
It's when you notice it, it's a bit of like, oh, it looks weird actually.

1325
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
You know,

1326
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
Can they just Photoshop the teeth?

1327
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,500
Why do you have to do that to them?

1328
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Yeah.

1329
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,500
I think it's one of those things that like when you when you notice it in real life,

1330
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,500
it's a little bit like, oh, it actually looks.

1331
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,500
I can't, I can't, I can't stop noticing it now.

1332
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,500
I can't, like those are noticeably false teeth.

1333
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,500
Yeah.

1334
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:06,500
We've got to bring back little dimples, little red cheeks.

1335
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,500
Why?

1336
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,500
Did they go somewhere?

1337
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,500
I don't know.

1338
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:16,500
I just think you know, like a perfect little oval shape, like face paint on your cheek.

1339
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,500
On your cheek.

1340
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,500
I have.

1341
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,500
Not like blush.

1342
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:25,500
Not like, like, like makeup, but like a little, little spludge, like a cartoon character,

1343
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,500
like a Pinocchio.

1344
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,500
But you're talking, but you're not talking about makeup.

1345
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
You're talking about people should just look like that.

1346
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,500
People should just look like that.

1347
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,500
They should just be that way.

1348
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
People just don't look like, yeah.

1349
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
People don't look like Pinocchio anymore.

1350
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,500
People don't look like garden gnomes.

1351
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,500
It's fucked up.

1352
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,500
People don't look like garden.

1353
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,500
Damn.

1354
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,500
We have to go back.

1355
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,500
We have to go back.

1356
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,500
On my day, people looked like fucked up garden gnomes.

1357
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Nobody, nobody is like hanging out in, under a mushroom, like hanging out, like sitting

1358
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,500
on a, on a frog's back, smoking a corn cob pipe anymore.

1359
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,500
Yeah.

1360
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:08,500
Where are those people gone?

1361
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,500
Genuinely, where did they go?

1362
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,500
They live in your garden.

1363
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,500
Oh yeah.

1364
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,500
There they are.

1365
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,500
You ever watched David the Gnome?

1366
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,500
No.

1367
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,500
Do you know what that is?

1368
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,500
I assume it's a gnome.

1369
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,500
I kind of thought it was maybe a British thing, but yeah.

1370
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,500
It was a cartoon.

1371
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,500
I think it was on PBS.

1372
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,500
It was a cartoon.

1373
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,500
I sometimes watched it as a kid.

1374
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,500
Yeah.

1375
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,500
It was about David the Gnome and he's a little like gnome.

1376
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:42,500
He's an old like, little gnome guy who just, he's a gnome.

1377
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:47,500
And he's has a little gnome wife and he lives in a little gnome community and these trolls

1378
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:52,500
are always out to get him, but the trolls will turn to stone.

1379
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:58,500
They can only come out at night and they turn to stone in the sunlight and that's the trolls

1380
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,500
deal.

1381
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,500
And I couldn't, I don't remember anything that I don't remember any episodes.

1382
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:09,500
I guess he, he gets, I assume he must get chased by trolls at some point and I don't know

1383
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,500
that's like all I remember.

1384
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,500
And him and his wife do the little nose-nuzzling Eskimo kisses.

1385
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,500
That's how they make out.

1386
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Whoa.

1387
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:23,500
David the Gnome, originally titled David El Gnomo.

1388
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,500
No.

1389
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,500
Is a Spanish animated television series.

1390
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
You're fucking shitting me.

1391
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
You're shitting me right now.

1392
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
It's Spanish animated.

1393
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
Really?

1394
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Wow.

1395
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Based on the children's book, The Secret Book of Gnomes by the Dutch author Wil Huygen.

1396
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
David El Gnomo.

1397
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,500
David El Gnomo.

1398
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,500
David El Gnomo.

1399
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,500
What the fuck?

1400
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,500
Okay.

1401
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
That's funny.

1402
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,500
I don't know that.

1403
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,500
Hell yeah.

1404
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,500
Yeah.

1405
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,500
I used to see it on PBS.

1406
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,500
Tiny Ancient Gnomes.

1407
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Wait, wait, wait.

1408
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,500
The plot synopsis on Google.

1409
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,500
What the fuck?

1410
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:04,500
The plot synopsis on Google is tiny ancient gnomes perform feats of strength.

1411
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,500
Whoa.

1412
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
It is.

1413
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,500
What the fuck?

1414
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,500
Why does it say that?

1415
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,500
I don't know.

1416
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:16,500
I don't remember them performing any mighty feats of strength, but maybe they did.

1417
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,500
I don't remember.

1418
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,500
David El Gnomo.

1419
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
Where did they draw that from?

1420
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
I remember him riding a fox.

1421
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,500
He rides a fox.

1422
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:34,500
See, I was thinking of this other thing, but it probably sucks.

1423
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Yeah.

1424
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
He doesn't have a mustache.

1425
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:43,500
It's a gnome cartoon, not 80s, much, probably 2000s.

1426
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,500
I think I've seen a couple episodes of, okay, this is a baby show, actually.

1427
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,500
Gordon the Garden gnome.

1428
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,500
Never heard of that.

1429
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Slightly different.

1430
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,500
I'm looking up episodes.

1431
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
There's one called The Little Sorcerer.

1432
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500
What's this one?

1433
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,500
Who would win in a fight?

1434
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
David.

1435
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
David would win in a fight.

1436
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,500
Look at that guy.

1437
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
He performs feats of strength.

1438
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,500
He's an ancient gnome who performs feats of strength.

1439
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:13,500
I mean, I think he is supposed to be hundreds of years old.

1440
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,500
Is he super strong?

1441
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,500
I don't remember him being super strong, but maybe he is really strong.

1442
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,500
I mean, I'm looking at a picture of him with his fists up.

1443
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,500
He's going to punch something.

1444
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
He's going to fist a cuffs.

1445
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,500
He's going to fist a cuffs those goblins, those trolls.

1446
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Yeah, I've seen this screenshot of him with the fists up.

1447
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,500
I've seen this used as a reaction image.

1448
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,500
Yeah, there should be more gnome shows.

1449
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,500
Yeah, bring back gnomes.

1450
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
Where did they go?

1451
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,500
When magic died, they all retreated underground to await.

1452
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Less beautiful pearly white teeth, more garden gnomes.

1453
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
David would never get veneers.

1454
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
You can't see him.

1455
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
He's got a mustache in the way.

1456
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
He's just let his teeth fall out.

1457
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
He doesn't need them.

1458
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:11,500
You don't need teeth to eat those overnight oats.

1459
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Not if you let him sit for the full eight hours while you watch the Mega Man lecture.

1460
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,500
I mean, he's so small he only has an overnight oat.

1461
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:28,500
I went to Trader Joe's to get some oats, but they didn't have quick oats.

1462
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:34,500
They only had rolled oats, which are quicker than steel cut oats, but they're not instant.

1463
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:40,500
They're not the instant quick oats, which are rolled oats just cut smaller and rolled even more.

1464
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,500
So, I mean, they're fine. They worked okay.

1465
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,500
But there's a little...

1466
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,500
They couldn't just roll them a little more for me?

1467
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,500
Rolled them a little more and chopped them a little bit more?

1468
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
Make them quick?

1469
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,500
You got to do the last little bit of rolling and chopping yourself.

1470
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
Please, Joe. Please.

1471
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,500
So, you can feel like a chef.

1472
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:06,500
Please, Joe, I'll trade you some more money to process my oats a little bit more.

1473
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
Just a little bit more.

1474
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
More like Trader Joe's.

1475
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,500
More like, thank you. Thank you.

1476
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,500
So, I'm afraid that I'm going to take my business elsewhere.

1477
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:21,500
I'm afraid I'm going to take my oat business to Aldi for Millville's quick oats.

1478
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
Okay?

1479
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
I'm a busy guy.

1480
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:30,500
I need my oats quick eight hours from now.

1481
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,500
So, that's the...

1482
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,500
I'm sorry.

1483
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,500
That's just the market.

1484
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
I'm just responding to market forces.

1485
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,500
You know who else is just responding to market forces?

1486
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,500
No.

1487
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,500
I was reading...

1488
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,500
I had a little Twitter interaction with Umami.

1489
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,500
You know Umami, the interface guy?

1490
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
No.

1491
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
You've ever seen that?

1492
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Well, he's an animator and I think he does music too.

1493
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
He does these very...

1494
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
What do you call them?

1495
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,500
What do you call them?

1496
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,500
Well, they're cartoons.

1497
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,500
You would recognize the character.

1498
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,500
I may not recognize the user name.

1499
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,500
Yeah.

1500
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:25,500
The most recognizable character is this weird monster clown.

1501
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,500
Now, Dr. Light, now there's a gnome.

1502
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,500
Oh, I thought that was you posting.

1503
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
No.

1504
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
Oh, it's Twitch.

1505
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,500
He's Dr. Light posting.

1506
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,500
He's Light posting.

1507
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Just a little Light posting.

1508
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Just a little Light posting.

1509
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
This guy.

1510
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Oh, yeah, I remember.

1511
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:52,500
I watched one of the early videos of this character on the left.

1512
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,500
Yeah.

1513
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,500
I don't really know.

1514
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:01,500
I'm not really sure what to think of Umami because he...

1515
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
I know he sold NFTs.

1516
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,500
I know he sold some NFTs.

1517
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,500
And he's pro AI art.

1518
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,500
But I don't know if he's like a blockchain guy.

1519
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:16,500
I don't know if he is like a Web3 is the future.

1520
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,500
Like everything should be on the blockchain guy.

1521
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,500
Or if he was just like...

1522
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,500
Did it to make some money?

1523
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,500
I don't know.

1524
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:31,500
I looked at his Twitter feed and all he posts about is some bill that is passing through Canadian Congress right now.

1525
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,500
And I don't know what that's about.

1526
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,500
So I ignored it.

1527
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Uh...

1528
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,500
I know Umami, he follows Elon Musk.

1529
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,500
But that doesn't necessarily mean that he likes Elon.

1530
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
So I don't want to jump to any conclusions.

1531
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
Yeah, I guess not.

1532
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
I don't know.

1533
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,500
I would generally default to like...

1534
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:02,500
Probably they know and enjoy crypto if they're like selling NFTs.

1535
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:06,500
But there's lots of people who have just been like, oh, is this the new thing?

1536
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,500
Okay, I'll do it.

1537
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,500
I don't know exactly.

1538
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,500
It really becomes a problem when they double down and start like...

1539
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,500
If somebody tells them, oh, you shouldn't do that.

1540
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
And then they say, um, fuck you.

1541
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,500
And then they burn bridges and start going crazy.

1542
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
Yeah, I don't know.

1543
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,500
I don't want to like...

1544
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,500
I think where I'm at with it is like...

1545
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:36,500
I don't think I believe in like blaming the consumer.

1546
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,500
And I feel like...

1547
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:47,500
You know, when Sakimi-chan makes NFTs, it's like Sakimi-chan already makes like hundreds of thousands of dollars on Patreon.

1548
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,500
Sakimi-chan is already like absurdly wealthy.

1549
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:55,500
And she's doing these NFTs and it's just making like an even more obscene amount of money.

1550
01:24:55,500 --> 01:25:01,500
And probably minting like, you know, huge sets of them, minting tons of them.

1551
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:08,500
And just churning through it, right?

1552
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,500
This guy, Umami is not...

1553
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,500
You know, he makes like a couple thousands a month on Patreon.

1554
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:23,500
He's like, you know, he's somewhat successful, but he's not like a huge celebrity.

1555
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,500
He's not super wealthy, I'm sure.

1556
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,500
I don't know.

1557
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:37,500
The evil of the blockchain and the evil of NFTs, to me, is on the people that like made it.

1558
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:43,500
And the grift of like, we must force artists to mint on our chain.

1559
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,500
They must pay us for access to the chain.

1560
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Yeah, it's a bunch of middlemen.

1561
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Well, I don't like it when people participate in that system.

1562
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:59,500
You know, in the past, I've said like, you know, the artists that make it, you know, they're getting scammed.

1563
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,500
The scam is on them because generally they will...

1564
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,500
Most artists that do that will not recoup the investment of minting the NFT.

1565
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:14,500
So I think I don't think I can be like, oh, this guy's bad because he made some NFTs.

1566
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Even if he sold them and he did make a profit on them because like, I don't know.

1567
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,500
I don't think that's where the fault lies.

1568
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,500
No.

1569
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,500
This guy seems pretty smart.

1570
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Umami seems pretty smart.

1571
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,500
I haven't seen him say like, everything should be on...

1572
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Everything should be Webpoint 3.

1573
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:33,500
Everything should be on the blockchain or anything like that.

1574
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,500
He seems weird.

1575
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,500
I don't know.

1576
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,500
He's got...

1577
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,500
He's involved in all these Canadian politics that I can't be bothered to understand.

1578
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:46,500
So I have to reserve my judgment.

1579
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,500
I don't know.

1580
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Somebody was complaining.

1581
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,500
Somebody was complaining.

1582
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,500
This guy Grums.

1583
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:56,500
This guy Grums posted some artists' art and basically implied that the artist had used

1584
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,500
AI to color it.

1585
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,500
I don't even...

1586
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,500
Grums is an asshole.

1587
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,500
I hate Grums.

1588
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,500
But he had posted some art and been like...

1589
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:10,500
He said something about AI in a way that implied that this person had not drawn it himself.

1590
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:16,500
And this person said like, yo, Grums like posted my art and like said this stuff about it.

1591
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,500
And it's not true.

1592
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:24,500
And Umami replied to that thread saying like, you know, if he's posting your art without

1593
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:32,500
your consent, you know, instead of reporting him on Twitter, you should file a DMCA.

1594
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,500
You should use copyright law.

1595
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,500
And people dog piled on Umami and people said like, fuck you, Umami.

1596
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,500
You're an NFT guy.

1597
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,500
You're a blockchain guy.

1598
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,500
You're a crypto shill.

1599
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,500
You love AI art.

1600
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,500
You hate artists.

1601
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,500
You just hate artists.

1602
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:53,500
You just hate artists, Umami, because you think that AI is okay.

1603
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,500
It's going to take our jobs, Umami.

1604
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,500
It's going to take our jobs and you hate us.

1605
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,500
And I just think that's stupid.

1606
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,500
Yeah.

1607
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,500
It doesn't seem like an appropriate response to that post.

1608
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,500
Yeah.

1609
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,500
I don't think so.

1610
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,500
Yeah.

1611
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,500
I didn't feel like it was appropriate.

1612
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:18,500
I think, I think, I don't know.

1613
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,500
I think AI is good, but capitalism is bad.

1614
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Yeah.

1615
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
I mean, that's, I remember we had a conversation.

1616
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:31,500
I guess eventually boiled down to that is like, as a tool, it's cool.

1617
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,500
But as a mule, it's drool.

1618
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,500
It could not have said it better myself.

1619
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,500
I saw, um, I saw Harry Partridge, you know, Harry Partridge.

1620
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Yeah.

1621
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,500
Yeah.

1622
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:50,500
He posted on someone, some other person said something about, you know, AI is bad.

1623
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,500
It's going to take our jobs or maybe it wasn't.

1624
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:55,500
It was something about AI bad.

1625
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
And then Harry Partridge posted under that.

1626
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:02,500
He said, well, you know, I'm, I'm an artist and I used, I used AI to generate like some

1627
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:09,500
backgrounds in my animation, you know, as a labor saving measure to, you know, to make

1628
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
my freaking cartoons.

1629
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,500
So, you know,

1630
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Yeah.

1631
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,500
That's a lot of work into those.

1632
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,500
He sure does.

1633
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,500
He sure does.

1634
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,500
He sure does.

1635
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,500
Yeah.

1636
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Billions.

1637
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,500
Yeah.

1638
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,500
I haven't, I haven't watched a cartoon of his in a while.

1639
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:28,500
I guess he's been working on star variants for a really long time, hasn't he?

1640
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,500
Yeah.

1641
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:34,500
I don't know if I'm subscribed or if he just hasn't uploaded a million years.

1642
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,500
But yeah, star variants is the last thing I remember.

1643
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:43,500
I think he's been doing like commission work on the side while he works on star variants

1644
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
like on his own, you know?

1645
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,500
Yeah.

1646
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,500
It like, oh, kind of like that.

1647
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:57,500
Did you see that video, that atrocity guide video about that Russian animator that was

1648
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
making that?

1649
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,260
Well, I say it's actually a husband and wife team, even though the husband is like a lot

1650
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:08,500
more famous, even though you shouldn't be, but they're, they're right.

1651
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,500
No, I haven't seen that video.

1652
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,500
Okay.

1653
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,500
Well, yeah, there's a video by atrocity guy and I don't remember what their name is

1654
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:18,460
because their name's in Russian and I don't know, but they make these, you know how Russian

1655
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:24,260
animation has like a sort of different, it's almost like a South Park sort of like paper

1656
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:26,500
cutouts moving around kind of.

1657
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,500
Yeah, it's popular.

1658
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,500
Yeah.

1659
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Well, they, they were making like pretty much like the most, the most like finely detailed

1660
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:44,500
and meticulous version of that, like anyone has ever seen atrocity guide Russian animator.

1661
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:49,500
I'm sure this will, I'm sure this will turn up.

1662
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,500
Okay.

1663
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:55,500
Well, the video is just called the animators who spent 40 years on a single film.

1664
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,500
And, and basically, I think they slow as fuck.

1665
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
They slow, they slow as fuck.

1666
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:06,500
And I think during this 40 years, like they've continued to work on this movie that they're

1667
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:11,500
making, but also they've done, they do like, they've done, they do like commercials and

1668
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:17,500
stuff like they do, they do other commissioned animation work on the side, you know, to fund

1669
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,500
this fucking thing they've spent 40 years making.

1670
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,500
The overcar.

1671
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,500
Bombs at the box surface.

1672
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,500
At this point, it seems like the point isn't even to release.

1673
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,500
Yeah.

1674
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,500
You know what I mean?

1675
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:36,500
At 40 years, it stops being about like, oh, what if, what if, what if it's going to be

1676
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,500
a big return on investment?

1677
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,500
It's going to be a huge, we're going to, yeah, the returns are going to be, this is going

1678
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,500
to fund our next project.

1679
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,500
We're not going to get like 40 years worth of pay for one film.

1680
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,500
No, no.

1681
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,500
Let's stop like 29% in.

1682
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:57,500
Yeah, the best time to stop making this movie was 40 years ago.

1683
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
The second best time is now.

1684
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,500
That's mean.

1685
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:05,500
I mean, obviously it's not, yeah, it's not about making tons of money at the box office

1686
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,500
at this point.

1687
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,500
No, that's, I would like to see it though.

1688
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:14,500
This is a good video and I generally like the Atrocity Guide channel.

1689
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,500
They don't, they don't release.

1690
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,500
I like that Atrocity Guide.

1691
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,500
The Atrocity, oh, the Atrocity Guide.

1692
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Oh yeah, I saw him.

1693
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Oh, I loved your work in the Nuremberg Trials, sir.

1694
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,500
How did, how did I get on this?

1695
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,500
Something about the cell shaded, the cell animation?

1696
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,500
No, I don't think so.

1697
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:42,500
Oh, was it something about Harry Partridge and how like meticulous his work is and how

1698
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,500
many, how many in-betweens?

1699
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,500
Yeah, I don't know.

1700
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,500
I don't like that.

1701
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,500
Like he's spent years working on this, these Starbarians cartoons.

1702
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:55,500
And meanwhile he, you know, does like some commission commercial work on the side to

1703
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,500
keep himself feeding.

1704
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,500
So do people, do people share on him for him saying?

1705
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,500
No, I didn't see, I didn't see any responses to that.

1706
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,500
That was like a, that was like a reply tweet.

1707
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
So it wasn't like a public like on his main timeline.

1708
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:11,500
So I don't know if anyone even really, I just happened to see that and I just responded

1709
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:12,500
to it.

1710
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,500
I just like gave it a like and was like, yeah, man.

1711
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,500
It's good to automate.

1712
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
Automation's good.

1713
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:21,500
And he didn't, he didn't like my, he didn't like my reply.

1714
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,500
He didn't see me.

1715
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,500
He didn't notice me.

1716
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:28,500
That feel when you stick your neck out and like someone's tweet and they don't even like

1717
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
it.

1718
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,500
They don't even, they don't even courtesy like my reply.

1719
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,500
It's not fair.

1720
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,500
Harry Partridge is a Chris Chan fan.

1721
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,500
He should have seen my lecture by now.

1722
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,500
He should know me.

1723
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,500
Maybe.

1724
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:45,500
He is cause he's put, he's put, he's years and years ago.

1725
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:50,500
He was putting like Chris Chan in like a secret like frames.

1726
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,500
He was like, where's Waldo and Chris Chan into certain like crowd shots?

1727
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,500
I guess he's not doing that anymore.

1728
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Probably, probably not.

1729
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,500
Probably not.

1730
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,500
Yeah.

1731
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,500
I don't think so.

1732
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,500
Now he's putting them in the foreground.

1733
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,500
Put them in.

1734
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,500
Yeah.

1735
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:12,500
True, true.

1736
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,500
How do I get on this?

1737
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,500
Yes.

1738
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,500
The point is artists are obsolete.

1739
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,500
AI is the future.

1740
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
We don't need human artists anymore.

1741
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,500
You know who, you know who I hope is rendered obsolete by artists?

1742
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,500
That bitch, that bitch, Sakimi Chan.

1743
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,500
You know what?

1744
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,500
Her work is, should be the first to go because her work is garbage.

1745
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:38,500
Her work is a completely rote exercise in technical expertise and nothing more.

1746
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:43,500
The exact sort of thing that a computer should be designed to render obsolete,

1747
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,500
to make a human unnecessary for.

1748
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,500
So, you know, bring it up.

1749
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,500
What do they draw?

1750
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,500
Do they draw like anime?

1751
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,500
Oh, you don't know.

1752
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,500
Sakimi Chan.

1753
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,500
We, oh, you don't know.

1754
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
You don't know who Sakimi Chan is.

1755
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,500
I may have seen some of their stuff before.

1756
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,500
Do they draw frozen characters?

1757
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,500
Yeah, yes.

1758
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,500
But like render them a lot?

1759
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,500
Yes, they do.

1760
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,500
Well, they do.

1761
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,500
In general, they do anime characters or just popular cartoon characters,

1762
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:14,500
but they draw them like very anime, very like realistically detailed like body,

1763
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:21,500
like abs, you know, very like glamour shot, like beauty shots with sort of like anime,

1764
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:26,500
like feathery backgrounds and like glowy like effects around them and stuff.

1765
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:32,500
They do very, very like extremely like hyper, hyper, what's the word?

1766
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:38,500
Hyper idealized, but also sort of like photo realistic detail, like beauty shots of anime

1767
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,500
characters.

1768
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,500
It's like Shadman.

1769
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,500
No?

1770
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,500
I just thought I was thinking of.

1771
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,500
No, not me.

1772
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,500
No, what the fuck are you talking about?

1773
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:53,500
I'm just thinking of the way Shadman just adds like a little realistic stuff.

1774
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,500
How did that?

1775
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,500
Realistic stuff.

1776
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,500
How the fuck did that description that I just evoked?

1777
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
How did that conjure Shadman?

1778
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,500
Shadman.

1779
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,500
They put a lot of realistic things into their art.

1780
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,500
You're a freak.

1781
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,500
You're a freak.

1782
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,500
Shadman stuff is like dirty.

1783
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:11,500
All Shadman's drawings feel like dirty and smelly.

1784
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,500
I didn't say they weren't.

1785
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,500
Okay.

1786
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,500
All right.

1787
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,500
That's just what I was imagining.

1788
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,500
Like frozen character, whatever.

1789
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,500
Okay.

1790
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,500
That's very funny, but no.

1791
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,500
I'll show you what I'll show you what I'm talking about.

1792
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:26,500
I mean, let's let's just do a quick Google search for, yeah.

1793
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,500
Okay.

1794
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Um, stuff like this.

1795
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,500
Yeah.

1796
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:35,500
Or stuff like, uh, or stuff like this.

1797
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,500
And anyway, anyway, they do these.

1798
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:43,500
I mean, genuinely, these look like they were drawn by an AI to me.

1799
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,500
Um, but yeah.

1800
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:52,500
Kimi Chan makes like, makes like $30,000 a month on Patreon because she not, she doesn't

1801
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,500
just draw these, but she uploads like, uh, uh, what do you call them?

1802
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,500
Um, like time lapse with like sort of tutorials, right?

1803
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:04,500
She does like, he's like, you can learn how to draw like me.

1804
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,500
Uh, I see.

1805
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,500
Yeah.

1806
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:12,500
And honestly, this stuff is so unappealing to my sensibilities that like, I've like,

1807
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,500
why would you want to learn to draw like this?

1808
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:17,500
But I guess to a lot, I'll say it, I'll say it.

1809
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:21,500
I guess to a lot of people that don't know shit about art and have no aesthetic sensibilities

1810
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:26,500
at all, they see this as like, I can, I can imagine someone who sees something like this

1811
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,500
as like the pinnacle of, of visual, of visual artistry.

1812
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:32,500
And they're like, yeah, if I could draw like that.

1813
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,500
Oh yeah.

1814
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
That's the stuff.

1815
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,500
Yeah.

1816
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:41,500
There's a, it's, it's, um, uh, what is it?

1817
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Like, like, uh, drawing, not tutorials, but time lapses.

1818
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,500
Yeah.

1819
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:51,500
Time lapses of, of somebody drawing an eye, realistic, super realism eye drawing.

1820
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,500
Yeah.

1821
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:57,500
This is the, this is the anime version of like, oh, you drew, you like, you perfectly did

1822
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:03,500
like a pencil, you basically were a human photocopier and you did a pencil sketch that exactly

1823
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,500
duplicated a photograph of a person.

1824
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,500
Wow.

1825
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,500
Yeah.

1826
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:14,500
It's like technically impressive because people know what, people generally know that when

1827
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,500
you put a pencil on a paper, it makes a line.

1828
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:20,500
But then when somebody can put lines in such a way that it looks like a photograph, their

1829
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:21,500
mind is blown.

1830
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:26,500
But that's like the very first, like the very like first thing you understand about art

1831
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:30,500
is that you can make things, uh, with, with drawing.

1832
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,500
And once you become good at art, you realize it's, it's not very interesting actually to

1833
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,500
see that over and over again.

1834
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:40,500
You perfectly copied this photograph with a pencil.

1835
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,500
Dude, you're going to make the camera obsolete, bro.

1836
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,500
Like we don't even need cameras anymore because we got you.

1837
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,500
Yo, let's go.

1838
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,500
Let's fucking go.

1839
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,500
Yeah.

1840
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,500
That's, oh man.

1841
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,500
It's, yeah.

1842
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:57,500
So Sakimi, Sakimi-chan is such a good artist.

1843
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,500
She's going to put the AI out of business.

1844
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:04,500
You know, just like John Henry was so good, he was such a good rail worker that he, he,

1845
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,500
he defeated the, he defeated the steam engine.

1846
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,500
He made the steam engine obsolete.

1847
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,500
You know what I'm fucking talking about?

1848
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,500
Yeah.

1849
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,500
Like Shadman, right?

1850
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:18,500
Yes.

1851
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
That's what I'm saying.

1852
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:26,500
It's just like Shadman.

1853
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,500
I can see why this gets lots of likes though.

1854
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,500
It's sexual in nature.

1855
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,500
It's, it's anime and it looks realistic.

1856
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,500
It's a very broad demographic.

1857
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,500
I get it.

1858
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,500
It's appealing too.

1859
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,500
I get it.

1860
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,500
In a, in a way that is.

1861
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,500
I get it.

1862
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,500
Spits.

1863
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,500
Yes.

1864
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:45,500
Yes.

1865
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,500
Yes.

1866
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,500
But I called, but I called her a bitch and I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have said that.

1867
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,500
I shouldn't, shouldn't have used the B word.

1868
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
I should never have used the B word.

1869
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
This, this, you know what?

1870
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,500
This person's just responding to market forces.

1871
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,500
You know what?

1872
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:03,500
It's our fault that people give her a million dollars a year to produce this dog shit.

1873
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,500
What were we even talking about?

1874
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,500
What are you, what's going on?

1875
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,500
What's going on?

1876
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,500
We're talking about.

1877
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,500
We're in an hour 40.

1878
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,500
Wow.

1879
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,500
The time, the time flies.

1880
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,500
We're talking about how I'm the best artist.

1881
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,500
Yeah.

1882
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:22,500
Because I don't do, draw anything good.

1883
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,500
I draw it bad.

1884
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,500
Yeah.

1885
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,500
And that's what I like.

1886
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,500
And not rendered.

1887
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,500
Rendering sucks.

1888
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,500
True.

1889
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,500
You spend hours upon hours.

1890
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,500
The less you render the better it is.

1891
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:39,500
And then it's like, it's like, what, what, what am I, what am I fighting for?

1892
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,500
You know?

1893
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:44,500
What am I fighting for?

1894
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,500
Right.

1895
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,500
That's it.

1896
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,500
That's all I got.

1897
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:59,500
I, you know what?

1898
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,500
It's good, good thing I stopped drawing.

1899
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,500
Good thing I don't draw anymore.

1900
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,500
Now I can get a computer to do it for me.

1901
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,500
Suckers.

1902
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,500
You know what I don't like?

1903
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,500
All these nerds still drawn.

1904
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,500
Yeah.

1905
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,500
What's that?

1906
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,500
About AI art is that it's not truly accessible yet.

1907
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:21,500
I can't go Googling and finding a thing that generates something I actually want to see.

1908
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,500
And so I'm like, fine, I'll fucking draw it.

1909
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,500
You stupid idiot.

1910
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
Don't understand my prompts.

1911
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,500
Yeah.

1912
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,500
I don't know.

1913
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,500
There's like, yeah, there's, there's a bunch of different, there's a bunch of different programs that do it.

1914
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:34,500
And they're all a little bit different.

1915
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,500
And some of them are like, you have to pay to access them.

1916
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,500
And.

1917
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,500
Yeah.

1918
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,500
Unless it's all very.

1919
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,500
As soon as you have to pay to access them, I'm like, well, I already have my tablet.

1920
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,500
I don't have to pay any more money for that.

1921
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
So I'll just make it.

1922
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,500
It's easier.

1923
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,500
Yeah.

1924
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,500
You know, I looked up the Wikipedia article for stable diffusion.

1925
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,500
Just because I was like kind of curious, like, what does that mean exactly?

1926
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:06,500
And, you know, surprise, surprise, it was too complicated and I didn't understand it.

1927
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,500
Yeah.

1928
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:17,500
I try to watch a video or two, like science, maths, YouTubers trying to explain the science behind AI generated imagery.

1929
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,500
Yeah.

1930
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,500
And they just, they just died.

1931
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,500
I can't do it.

1932
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,500
Yeah.

1933
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,500
I, I think it, I would like to know.

1934
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:36,500
I just, I saw some diagrams and I was like, Oh God, this, I'd have to like, I'd actually have to like really commit to like understand this stuff.

1935
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,500
Let me find the diagram I'm talking about.

1936
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,500
Yeah.

1937
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
Like this one.

1938
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,500
Oh, that's how it works.

1939
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
Oh, that's how they do.

1940
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,500
Okay.

1941
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,500
Diffusion process.

1942
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,500
I got you.

1943
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:57,500
The nosing unit eel.

1944
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,500
Q, uh, fucking what?

1945
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
Oh, condition arrows.

1946
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:12,500
Oh, the conditioning includes the semantic map and the text and the representations and the images I see.

1947
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:20,500
And they go all into the key, which goes into all of these KVs and then loops back around to that other fucking thing.

1948
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,500
Yeah, I get it.

1949
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,500
Yeah.

1950
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,500
Oh, oh, child's play, child's play.

1951
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,500
I am, damn it.

1952
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,500
What, what, what Greek symbol is that?

1953
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,500
It really does be that computers is smarter than us.

1954
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,500
It really does be that way.

1955
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,500
Yeah.

1956
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:44,500
I mean, they're, they're, I mean, they're, in terms of like doing a large number of calculations over and over again.

1957
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:49,500
Like, yeah, they'll, they'll, uh, they'll beat us every time for sure.

1958
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,500
Maybe they should have computers, uh, doing all the jobs.

1959
01:43:53,500 --> 01:44:04,500
But they can't come up, but they can't come up with, they can't come up with a good idea for what, for what calculations to perform to provide useful information.

1960
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,500
We have to do that.

1961
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,500
Uh, that's too hard.

1962
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,500
For now.

1963
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,500
Can they do that instead?

1964
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:18,500
Um, maybe we can AI, maybe they can, not yet, but maybe with machine learning, they can, they can learn to come up with good ideas for us.

1965
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,500
Yes.

1966
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,500
Then I won't have to move.

1967
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,500
Then I will have to just lay here.

1968
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,500
Mm-hmm.

1969
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,500
Mm-hmm.

1970
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,500
Mm-hmm.

1971
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,500
Oh yeah.

1972
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Uh, oh yeah.

1973
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
We're headed towards that wally future.

1974
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:35,500
I can, I can, I can give up, uh, doing anything and then I could just fuck.

1975
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
That'll be all I do.

1976
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,500
That's my human thing.

1977
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:39,500
Mm-hmm.

1978
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,500
No more thinking.

1979
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,500
The computer does it.

1980
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,500
Oh, it's just like that bad religion song.

1981
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,500
I love my computer.

1982
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,500
It's just like that.

1983
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,500
That's a nerd song if I ever heard one.

1984
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,500
It's a good song.

1985
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:57,500
It's a good song.

1986
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:07,500
Uh, I went to the bank the other day to get a check for my shitty landlord who I hope will be in jail very soon.

1987
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:19,500
Um, and I said, I said, I said to the teller, I said, it's just like that movie.

1988
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,500
You know the one.

1989
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,500
It's just like that movie.

1990
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,500
And she said, no.

1991
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,500
I don't know.

1992
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,500
In what context did you say this?

1993
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,500
Okay, okay, sorry.

1994
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,500
I skipped it.

1995
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:34,500
Like you go to the bank and you just say that's the first thing comes out of your mouth.

1996
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,500
No.

1997
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,500
It's just like that movie when they go to the bank.

1998
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:48,500
I was just, I was getting my cashier's check and she was talking to some other teller or someone else behind the desk and they were like, can we get, they were like, can we get, they were like, can we move 20,000 so and so.

1999
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,500
And I was like, just listening.

2000
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:54,500
And then I think they said, like, I think she apologized to me.

2001
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,500
She said, like, sorry, you know, it's the holidays.

2002
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:00,500
Everyone's, everyone's take, everyone's withdrawing their money.

2003
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,500
And I said, it's just like that movie.

2004
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,500
It's just like that movie.

2005
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,500
You know the one.

2006
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Ocean's Eleven.

2007
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:12,500
And she was, and she was like, no, I don't know.

2008
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,500
I couldn't, and then I couldn't think of it.

2009
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,500
I was like, wait, shit.

2010
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,500
I forget the name in the movie.

2011
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:21,500
The movie I was talking about was, it's a wonderful life.

2012
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,500
Oh.

2013
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:31,500
Because, because, because, I mean, you know, the plot of that movie is that, yeah, it's for the holidays, everybody comes to withdraw their money from the credit union or whatever.

2014
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,500
Yeah.

2015
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,500
And I said, you know, and I thought it's like, oh yeah, yeah.

2016
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:39,500
I said, it's just like, it's a wonderful life.

2017
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,500
It's Christmas time.

2018
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,500
There's a run on the bank.

2019
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:44,500
And then everyone learns the joys of communism.

2020
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,500
That's what I said.

2021
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:52,500
And then, and then we, and then she gave me my cashier's check and I left.

2022
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:55,500
I left the bank.

2023
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,500
It sure was just like that movie.

2024
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,500
It was.

2025
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,500
It was just like that movie.

2026
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,500
And she should have known.

2027
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,500
She works at a bank.

2028
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
She should be thinking about bank movies.

2029
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,500
She should have been like, what movies do I know that have a bank in them?

2030
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,500
I know.

2031
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
It's a wonderful life.

2032
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,500
You know what?

2033
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,500
She had an accent.

2034
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,500
She was probably from like some other country.

2035
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,500
So she probably where they don't have banks.

2036
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:17,500
They don't have movies or wonderful lives.

2037
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:22,500
They don't have wonderful lives in, in, in Argentina.

2038
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,500
So she was not familiar with the, with the source material.

2039
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,500
Apologies.

2040
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Apologies to the Argentinian in the audience.

2041
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:41,500
Well, Argentina is a cool name.

2042
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
You know what it means?

2043
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,500
Uh, it's, uh, no.

2044
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,500
White.

2045
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,500
Uh, what?

2046
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,500
But it's so far down.

2047
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:58,500
Um, Argent, it's like, it's like in heraldry, in heraldry.

2048
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,500
Oh.

2049
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:00,500
A field, a field Argent.

2050
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,500
A field Argent is white or silver.

2051
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,500
They had the Argentine crusade in World of Warcraft.

2052
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,500
Yes.

2053
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,500
Yes.

2054
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,500
Yes.

2055
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,500
And then so Argentina, I guess it means like.

2056
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,500
White Tina.

2057
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:17,500
Does it mean like, would you, would you translate it as like white place or like white land?

2058
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,500
I guess you would.

2059
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:19,500
I guess so.

2060
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,500
I guess you would.

2061
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,500
I guess that's what we're going with.

2062
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:27,500
Is fucking, is the capital Montevideo is that the other one?

2063
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,500
Oh, I don't remember.

2064
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:36,500
I remember learning about Montevideo, which is a city bordering Argentina or maybe in

2065
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,500
Argentina.

2066
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,500
That's a cool city.

2067
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,500
It's got a lot of history.

2068
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,500
What if it was Montenegro?

2069
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,500
That would be somewhere else.

2070
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:46,500
You idiot.

2071
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,500
I know.

2072
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:52,500
But what if Montenegro was in Argentina and then it was Black Mountain in white land?

2073
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,500
Hmm.

2074
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,500
That would be pretty cool.

2075
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,500
Hmm.

2076
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,500
What do we think?

2077
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:57,500
That would be crazy.

2078
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,500
Wouldn't that be crazy?

2079
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,500
Okay.

2080
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,500
Anyway.

2081
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:01,500
That's all I have to say.

2082
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,500
And then the gray line.

2083
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,500
The gray line is where.

2084
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:07,500
The thin gray line, the thin gray line separating.

2085
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,500
Yeah.

2086
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,500
Law from, law from chaos.

2087
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
That's where you get gravel.

2088
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,500
Yeah.

2089
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
Definitely.

2090
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,500
Maybe they have a lot of white rock in Argentina.

2091
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:24,500
Maybe that's why.

2092
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:28,500
I wonder, I wonder if it is meant to refer to the landscape.

2093
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:29,500
Like chalky something or other.

2094
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
I mean, they have, they have mountains.

2095
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:36,500
Maybe they means like, maybe it's like reference to like white snow capped mountains.

2096
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,500
Could be.

2097
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,500
There's mountains all over the place though.

2098
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:45,500
Argentina is like, there's that mountain range between Argentina and Chile, right?

2099
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:48,500
Like on the, on the west coasts of South America.

2100
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,500
West.

2101
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:50,500
Yeah.

2102
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,500
Yeah.

2103
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,500
Yeah.

2104
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,500
That's my best guess.

2105
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
It's either that or maybe there's like a desert.

2106
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,500
Maybe there's like a desert plain that's very pale.

2107
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,500
Argentina.

2108
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,500
Wikipedia.

2109
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,500
I'm going to go to the etymology.

2110
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,500
Yeah.

2111
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:07,500
In English, the name Argentina comes from Spanish language.

2112
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:14,500
The name itself is not Spanish, but Italian Argentina means made of silver or silver colored.

2113
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,500
Hmm.

2114
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:18,500
Divided from the Latin Argentum for silver.

2115
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:19,500
Okay.

2116
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,500
So maybe there's a lot of silver there.

2117
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:22,500
That's probably.

2118
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,500
Okay.

2119
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,500
Yeah.

2120
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,500
Well, I know in heraldry, it means silver or white.

2121
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,500
So yeah.

2122
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,500
Okay.

2123
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,500
That's fair.

2124
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:34,500
Isn't the chemical, isn't the chemical symbol on the periodic table for silver?

2125
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,500
Is it like AR or something like that?

2126
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,500
Gold is AU.

2127
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,500
It could be.

2128
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,500
Gold is silver.

2129
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,500
I think silver is something similar.

2130
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,500
Argentina was first associated with the Silver Mountains legend.

2131
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,500
AG.

2132
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,500
AG.

2133
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,500
AG.

2134
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:51,500
Silver Mountains legend widespread among first European explorers.

2135
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:54,500
But why did they name it Argentina?

2136
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,500
Was it because of the legend?

2137
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:57,500
Sorry.

2138
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,500
I missed it.

2139
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,500
There's a legend.

2140
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,500
What?

2141
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,500
White spread among first European explorers.

2142
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,500
Let's click on that page.

2143
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,500
Silver Mountains of Silver.

2144
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,500
This is just like the fun fact bonus episode.

2145
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:10,500
Yeah.

2146
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,500
This is something I enjoy doing.

2147
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:17,500
Sierra de la Plata, Mountain of Silver was a mythical source of silver in the interior

2148
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,500
of South America.

2149
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:24,500
The legend began in the early 16th century when castaways from Juan Diaz de Solis, a

2150
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:29,460
bad accent, expedition heard indigenous stories of a mountain of silver in an inland region

2151
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,460
ruled by the so-called White King.

2152
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:35,460
First European to lead expedition to search of it.

2153
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:41,460
In search of it was the castaway Alexio Garcia, who crossed nearly the entire continent to

2154
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:45,460
reach the Andean Altiplano.

2155
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,460
Altiplano.

2156
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:49,460
He died.

2157
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:50,460
A high plane.

2158
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,460
Yeah, something.

2159
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:55,460
On his way back to the coast, Garcia died in an ambush by indigenous people in Paraguay.

2160
01:51:55,460 --> 01:52:00,460
It was brought precious metals back to corroborate the story.

2161
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:03,460
Okay, so it's a silver rush instead of a gold rush.

2162
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:08,460
This is just like the Aztec city of gold, but like a little more humble.

2163
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:09,460
A little bit.

2164
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,460
It's not gold.

2165
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,460
It's just silver.

2166
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,460
And it's not like a city.

2167
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,460
It's just kind of like a mountain.

2168
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:16,460
There's just kind of like a big pile of it.

2169
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:18,460
But it's like, it's still pretty good.

2170
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:19,460
It's still pretty good.

2171
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:22,460
I want to read the rest of this, but it's going to take a while.

2172
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:28,460
I actually, I'm going to go get some more coffee, so I'll be back in a minute.

2173
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:30,460
Okay, I'm back.

2174
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,460
Okay, I read a little bit more.

2175
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,460
Tell me what you've learned.

2176
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:40,460
As coding to this Wikipedia article on the Sierra de la Plata, the river Rio de la Plata,

2177
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:45,460
literally silver river and the country of Argentina from the Latin Argentine.

2178
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,460
This theme is boring.

2179
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,460
You know what?

2180
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,460
This is bad world building.

2181
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:53,460
It appears way too closely to this silver theme like, oh, the silver city and the silver mountain.

2182
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:54,460
It's the silver river.

2183
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:56,460
They both take their names from the legends.

2184
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:03,460
So that is, as far as I know, proof or like at least enough proof for me to be like, that makes sense.

2185
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:07,460
Argentina is based on legends of silver and then our hills.

2186
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,460
All right.

2187
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,460
And that's it, which is pretty cool.

2188
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:11,460
Pretty cool.

2189
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,460
Pretty strong.

2190
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,460
I want to know more about this.

2191
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,460
Pretty strong theme.

2192
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:15,460
Pretty strong theming.

2193
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:20,460
I want to know more about the indigenous stories of the mountain of silver ruled by the so-called white king.

2194
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,460
There's no page for this.

2195
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:23,460
I want to know about that.

2196
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,460
That sounds pretty epic.

2197
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:27,460
Sounds pretty epic.

2198
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,460
Not going to lie.

2199
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:31,460
There's no page for the indigenous stories.

2200
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:33,460
Should have called them the Pale King.

2201
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,460
They should have called them the Pale King.

2202
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:36,460
Yes.

2203
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:39,460
Like that video game.

2204
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:46,460
Or that book, the unfinished last book of David Foster Wallace was called the Pale King.

2205
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:52,460
This episode is going to be called AI and Argentina.

2206
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:55,460
What's the capital of Argentina?

2207
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,460
I don't know.

2208
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,460
I'm trying to Google.

2209
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:00,460
I'm trying to like word search.

2210
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:02,460
It's a capital capital.

2211
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,460
I'll be impressed if you were right and it is Montevideo.

2212
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,460
It's Buenos Aires.

2213
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:08,460
It's Buenos Aires.

2214
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,460
I know that one.

2215
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,460
Okay.

2216
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,460
What is Montevideo then?

2217
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:14,460
Buenos Aires has an endless war.

2218
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:16,460
Oh, hell yeah.

2219
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:18,460
You Google it and the first thing you see is a big obelisk.

2220
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:20,460
So, I mean, that's pretty cool.

2221
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:22,460
Pretty, pretty sweet.

2222
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,460
Montevideo, Uruguay is capital.

2223
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:27,460
There's a major city alongside Montevideo Bay.

2224
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,460
Who even gives a shit about Uruguay?

2225
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,460
Me.

2226
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:32,460
False.

2227
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:34,460
It's my favorite place to be.

2228
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:35,460
No, you don't.

2229
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,460
No, you don't.

2230
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:38,460
Fuck it, you're lying.

2231
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:42,460
I learned about it one day when I was Wikipedia diving.

2232
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:44,460
Let me...

2233
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:46,460
Oh, yeah?

2234
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,460
Well, let me tell you something, buddy.

2235
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:49,460
What?

2236
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:54,460
I tried a new frozen pizza this week.

2237
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:56,460
Great.

2238
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,460
No, it was bad.

2239
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,460
It was bad.

2240
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:00,460
It was worse.

2241
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:01,460
I'm here.

2242
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,460
All right.

2243
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:04,460
Did I...

2244
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:06,460
Did I stop me if I told this one before?

2245
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:09,460
But that lady I follow on Twitter,

2246
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:12,460
Lauren from the Batten Around podcast.

2247
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:13,460
I don't listen to the podcast.

2248
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:15,460
I just follow her on Twitter.

2249
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:18,460
She got banned, something, something, Elon Musk.

2250
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,460
She got...

2251
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:22,460
Lauren, at not a big jerk, got banned on Twitter.

2252
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:25,460
Only a week or two after she had recommended

2253
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,460
the Kirkland Supreme cauliflower crust frozen pizza,

2254
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:30,460
which I tried and it was good.

2255
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:32,460
But then she got banned before, so I couldn't tell her.

2256
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:33,460
I couldn't tell her.

2257
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:36,460
I tried the Kirkland pizza.

2258
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:39,460
I saw you get mad about that on Twitter or sad about that.

2259
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:43,460
I was like, I just wanted to tell her thanks for the pizza recommendation.

2260
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:44,460
And then she came back.

2261
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:45,460
She has a new account.

2262
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:46,460
She didn't come back.

2263
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,460
She had a new account.

2264
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,460
I think her old one actually got reinstated,

2265
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:51,460
so that's also good.

2266
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,460
But I told her, hey, I tried that pizza.

2267
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:54,460
It was good.

2268
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,460
Not specifically related to that, though.

2269
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:58,460
I tried...

2270
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:00,460
I had the Wegmans bacon rise.

2271
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:03,460
The Wegmans bacon rise pizzas are pretty good.

2272
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,460
But I tried an alternative from Aldi.

2273
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:08,460
The Aldi alternative is the Mamakotzi.

2274
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:11,460
The Mamakotzi, I forget exactly what they're called,

2275
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,460
but whatever, it's the same like the thick crust,

2276
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:17,460
like rising dough, pepperoni pizza.

2277
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,460
And it's like the same but worse.

2278
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:22,460
And it's worse because it has this like,

2279
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,460
this very faint sort of ineffable,

2280
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:27,460
sort of like sweet, almost like cinnamony,

2281
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:29,460
like smell or quality to the dough.

2282
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:31,460
And I just find it very off-putting.

2283
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:34,460
I find it like, it's barely there,

2284
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:37,460
but it's just enough there that I'm like,

2285
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,460
if it weren't there, it would be fine.

2286
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:41,460
But it's like they made this dough

2287
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,460
out of like what they had left over at like

2288
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:47,460
the cinnamon roll factory or something.

2289
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:50,460
And it's just, it only detracts.

2290
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:53,460
The only sugar you should have in dough

2291
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:56,460
is just from the white flour.

2292
01:56:57,460 --> 01:57:02,460
The sugar shouldn't feel sweet,

2293
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:06,460
but it should have that nice white bread flour.

2294
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:08,460
And then it burns a bit.

2295
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,460
It's not sweet.

2296
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:12,460
It's not like really sweet.

2297
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,460
It's just like sort of like an aroma.

2298
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:17,460
It's just kind of like an aromatic sort of like sensation.

2299
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,460
It doesn't actually taste like cinnamon.

2300
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:20,460
It doesn't taste sweet.

2301
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:22,460
It's like a smell.

2302
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:25,460
It gives me enough of the sense

2303
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:28,460
that I'm like, I don't know, this is something a little off.

2304
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:30,460
The flavor is a little bit off.

2305
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:35,460
Most of taste is in the smell, I think.

2306
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:37,460
They're so closely connected.

2307
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:40,460
It's sort of weird when it smells like something

2308
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,460
and it doesn't taste like it.

2309
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:44,460
It's like the first time you drink coffee.

2310
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,460
Like what?

2311
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,460
I thought it would taste better than that.

2312
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,460
It smells so good.

2313
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:51,460
Yeah, you're right.

2314
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:54,460
It smells way better than it tastes.

2315
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:58,460
When I was a kid, I used to love to sniff the grounds.

2316
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,460
I used to love to take that coffee can.

2317
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,460
My parents would make coffee.

2318
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:06,460
I didn't like to drink it, but I would put my nose in the can

2319
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:09,460
and smell the unbrewed grounds because they're amazing.

2320
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,460
They smell incredible.

2321
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:14,460
And then as an adult, why do I drink it?

2322
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,460
Why do people drink it when it smells so good?

2323
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:18,460
Just huff it.

2324
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,460
Oh, just smell it.

2325
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:24,460
I think I've heard of people just like putting the grounds in their mouth.

2326
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:28,460
Like chewing the grounds or like putting it under their tongue or something.

2327
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:30,460
I don't know if it like, that might be like a joke, actually.

2328
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:32,460
I don't know if anyone actually does that.

2329
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:36,460
They just got really hot saliva and they cook it in their mouth.

2330
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:37,460
Gross, gross, gross.

2331
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:41,460
Then they spit it into someone else's mouth and then they drink it.

2332
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:47,460
Genuinely, I have switched to drinking coffee solely because it is cheaper.

2333
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:51,460
It's a cheaper source of caffeine to brew coffee and drink it

2334
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:58,460
than it is to drink energy drinks or to take caffeine pills.

2335
01:58:58,460 --> 01:58:59,460
Really?

2336
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:04,460
Like straight caffeine is in like pure caffeine is more expensive

2337
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:07,460
than the same amount of caffeine in a coffee.

2338
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:13,460
I think, well, you know, you know, actually, I wonder,

2339
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:17,460
I should do like, I should do some calculations and compare like,

2340
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:22,460
how many total milligrams of caffeine do I get in like an entire can

2341
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:27,460
of coffee grounds versus like a little bottle of like pills

2342
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,460
and then like compare the price tag.

2343
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:38,460
Like it might be more expensive overall, but it's probably nicer.

2344
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,460
What, the pills?

2345
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:42,460
No, the coffee.

2346
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:46,460
Because you're also having a nice drink, a nice warm drink.

2347
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:50,460
I mean, honestly, I'd rather drink it in energy drink form.

2348
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:53,460
I'd rather slam a summit gridlock.

2349
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:56,460
But I mean, price to, price to Grammage wise,

2350
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:58,460
I'm pretty sure that one is the loser.

2351
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:05,460
Even though, even, even at the low, low price of $1.05 per can,

2352
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:09,460
it's still, you know, you know.

2353
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:11,460
I don't know.

2354
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:15,460
I'm, I don't know about coffee or caffeine.

2355
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:20,460
I just drink it because I'm stupid and I got addicted.

2356
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:26,460
Well, I'm getting, I'm getting all my threats a little getting closed up

2357
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,460
because I've been speaking so much.

2358
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:32,460
Well, is it time for me to read one piece?

2359
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:34,460
Oh, fuck.

2360
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:35,460
Okay, yes.

2361
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:36,460
All right.

2362
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:40,460
Spoiler warning for the latest one piece chapter.

2363
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:43,460
Chapter 1069.

2364
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:48,460
The desire of all things are born to this world.

2365
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,460
Okay.

2366
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:52,460
An emotionless voyage.

2367
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:56,460
Dufeld's charitable work, the Research Institute of Peace,

2368
02:00:56,460 --> 02:01:01,460
Mads, presented by Lou Feld.

2369
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,460
I don't.

2370
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:04,460
Pesifist.

2371
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:05,460
I don't know what this is.

2372
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:08,460
I feel like is this last week.

2373
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:13,460
There was a cover page with Caesar Clown and Judge.

2374
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:14,460
Yeah.

2375
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:17,460
And then they were about to like reminisce about something.

2376
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:19,460
And I think this is what they're thinking about.

2377
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,460
Oh.

2378
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,460
So this is a new character and a new thing.

2379
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:27,460
And it's like, ah, remember the good old days with Mads?

2380
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:29,460
They used to be Pesifist, I guess.

2381
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:32,460
They used to be researching science for good.

2382
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:34,460
And then I guess they turned evil because of war.

2383
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:42,460
Is Mads related to, isn't SADs like something to do with those fake fruits?

2384
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:44,460
It's just SAD.

2385
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:45,460
SAD.

2386
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,460
Yeah.

2387
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:47,460
And the smile.

2388
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:55,460
I forget which one's which, but like there's the SAD SAD in Punk Hazard.

2389
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:59,460
And that gets turned into, yeah, it gets transported.

2390
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:05,460
The SAD gets transported to fucking Doflamingo's haunt.

2391
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:06,460
What was that called?

2392
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:07,460
That whole place?

2393
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,460
Dressrosa.

2394
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:09,460
Dressrosa.

2395
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:14,460
The factory, the smile factory in Dressrosa where they made the smile devil fruits.

2396
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:19,460
The Kaido would commission from Doflamingo.

2397
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:20,460
Yeah.

2398
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:21,460
So what is SAD?

2399
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:23,460
I forget.

2400
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:25,460
It's one of those like big science things.

2401
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:28,460
Is it something to do with those giant kids?

2402
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:33,460
I definitely, like Caesar was doing experiments on those kids for Big Mom.

2403
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:38,460
And I think he was also making the SAD for Kaido, for Doflamingo.

2404
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:42,460
But I don't know whether the SAD is related to the kids.

2405
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:43,460
There probably is.

2406
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:48,460
There's just one big factory that's probably like, when you tell the story where there's

2407
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:53,460
giant kids in a weird factory, it's probably going to be related.

2408
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:54,460
Yeah.

2409
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:55,460
All right.

2410
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:56,460
Okay.

2411
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:58,460
I don't know.

2412
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:00,460
Mads makes me think of SAD.

2413
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:01,460
I don't know.

2414
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,460
They might have actually nothing to do with each other.

2415
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:03,460
Who knows?

2416
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:06,460
They probably would because like if Caesar clown is reminiscing about it.

2417
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:07,460
Yeah.

2418
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:08,460
Yeah.

2419
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:12,460
And then he's like, he went on to do the SAD and the smile stuff.

2420
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:16,460
Probably not by himself, but certainly in evolving.

2421
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:19,460
Commenters, let me know in the comments what is, remind me what SAD is.

2422
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:21,460
I don't want, I don't feel like looking it up.

2423
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:24,460
Maybe this Mads thing is like the Rocks Pirates.

2424
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,460
That's what I was thinking.

2425
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:30,460
I was thinking, is this somehow, is this related to the Rocks Pirates somehow?

2426
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:31,460
That's what it makes me think of.

2427
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:32,460
These are like their own crews.

2428
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:34,460
So like Judge was a scientist.

2429
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:37,460
Caesar clown, vagabunk.

2430
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:39,460
Who else is a scientist?

2431
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:40,460
No one.

2432
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,460
That's the only ones.

2433
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:48,460
But they all came from this really, really tall ship that's obviously going to fall over.

2434
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:50,460
It's so obviously going to fall over.

2435
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,460
It's so silly.

2436
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:53,460
Oh.

2437
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:59,460
Did Rob Lucci kill the big vagabunk girl?

2438
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:02,460
Looks like her head, it almost looked like her head's like blown in half.

2439
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:04,460
It could just be smoke coming out.

2440
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,460
It's kind of hard to tell.

2441
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:08,460
I mean, she could probably be repaired because she's a robot.

2442
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,460
Oh yeah.

2443
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:10,460
That's true.

2444
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:11,460
Right, right.

2445
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:13,460
They're probably robots.

2446
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,460
Yeah.

2447
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:17,460
Tell me when you have a comment and we can talk about whatever is happening.

2448
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:18,460
Yeah.

2449
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:20,460
Probably about a quarter through it.

2450
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:27,460
Who the hell is this guy?

2451
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,460
He's got a bit of a neck.

2452
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:33,460
Big long neck and a beard?

2453
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:36,460
And like, is that like a flame tattoo on his neck?

2454
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:38,460
Yeah, I don't recognize him.

2455
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:41,460
He might have been a background like Vice Admiral or something.

2456
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:45,460
This guy talking to not Al Kiji.

2457
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:46,460
Who's that?

2458
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,460
Akainu.

2459
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:49,460
Akainu, yeah, yeah.

2460
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:50,460
Okay, I see.

2461
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:53,460
I saw this on Twitter actually this week.

2462
02:04:53,460 --> 02:05:00,460
I remember this, the awakened form of the leopard fruit.

2463
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:01,460
Yeah.

2464
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:06,460
This is interesting.

2465
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:12,460
I mean, I, he's got this like black cloud.

2466
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:15,460
I mean, it reminds me of Luffy's.

2467
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:17,460
Gear four.

2468
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:19,460
Is, is gear five, right?

2469
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:21,460
Is the, the, the white one?

2470
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:22,460
Gear five is the white one.

2471
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:28,460
But, but gear fourth is when he has those, those multiple different forms of gear fourth

2472
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:34,460
where he's really fast and he's got that sort of like black flame or something around him.

2473
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:37,460
It doesn't, wasn't it, I was thinking, I'm thinking of gear five.

2474
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:40,460
He has like sort of the white like sort of cloud wreath.

2475
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:46,460
He does, but I think also in gear fourth, let me just Google that.

2476
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:55,460
Oh yeah, in anime, it's like depicted a steam, but in the, yeah, it is a steam.

2477
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:57,460
So it's sort of like white clouds.

2478
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:58,460
Yeah.

2479
02:05:58,460 --> 02:05:59,460
Oh, it's his tattoos.

2480
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:03,460
He's got like a weird like hacky sort of flame pattern on his arms.

2481
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:04,460
You're talking about Rob?

2482
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:06,460
And gear fourth and Luffy.

2483
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:07,460
Okay.

2484
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:08,460
Okay.

2485
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:13,460
And he's got like steam coming off him in a cloudy sort of shape that sort of is reminiscent

2486
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:16,460
of some sort of Japanese thing.

2487
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:17,460
Can you post it?

2488
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:19,460
Can you post an image?

2489
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:21,460
Yeah, let me find a good one.

2490
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:23,460
Oh yeah.

2491
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,460
Oh yeah, he does have the, yeah, he's got the steam.

2492
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:28,460
Right.

2493
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:34,460
He's got the like the hockey arms and it's sort of like kind of extends onto his body.

2494
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:35,460
Yeah.

2495
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,460
Yeah.

2496
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:37,460
Yeah.

2497
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:44,460
And this 3D little figurine, you can tell that's the, do you know what that is?

2498
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:51,460
Like a, like a, some sort of Japanese spirit like thing.

2499
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:53,460
What the cloud?

2500
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:59,460
I feel like I've seen like some sort of a classic Japanese design of a spirit of some

2501
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:06,460
kind that has like the thing going around the arms like that and the back of the head.

2502
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:10,460
The figurative reminds me of Enel's like thing that comes off his back.

2503
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:12,460
You know what I'm talking about?

2504
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:14,460
A little bit.

2505
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:18,460
He has like the ring that sort of comes off of his shoulders and has like the like little,

2506
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:19,460
the little drums on it.

2507
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:20,460
You know what I mean?

2508
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:22,460
Oh yeah, a little.

2509
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:24,460
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

2510
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,460
Might, that's what reminds me of it.

2511
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:35,460
I don't know if that has any relation.

2512
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,460
Okay.

2513
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:37,460
I'm reading.

2514
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:38,460
I'm reading.

2515
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:45,460
There's no record of the gum gum, no me written in the old devil fruit encyclopedia at all.

2516
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:46,460
Even.

2517
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:47,460
Oh, okay.

2518
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:49,460
Cause it's not that.

2519
02:07:49,460 --> 02:07:50,460
It's not a rubber.

2520
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:54,460
The form looks exactly like the God mentioned in the ancient documents.

2521
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,460
Oh my God.

2522
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:58,460
It's a special fruit.

2523
02:07:58,460 --> 02:08:02,460
It's a fucking special.

2524
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:03,460
Okay.

2525
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:05,460
Vega punk is explaining.

2526
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:08,460
Hey guys, actually, it's not the gum gum fruit.

2527
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:10,460
Actually, it's a super secret God fruit.

2528
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:11,460
It's a special secret.

2529
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:13,460
Was that not explained already?

2530
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:19,460
I, um, maybe it was just like not explicit before.

2531
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:21,460
It was not explained to the crew.

2532
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:26,460
We sort of heard about it from like, wasn't it the, the, the Gora say we're talking about?

2533
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:27,460
Gora say we're talking about it.

2534
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:29,460
Like, yeah, that particular fruit.

2535
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:31,460
Oh, that's such an important one.

2536
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:34,460
You see, like they're just talking to themselves.

2537
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:37,460
It is so fucking based.

2538
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:38,460
Yeah.

2539
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:44,460
It's so fucking sick and it sucks that the straw hat guy has it.

2540
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:45,460
As long as people.

2541
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:46,460
Okay.

2542
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:47,460
Okay.

2543
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:50,460
So this is, Nika has something to do with the void century.

2544
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:52,460
It was a race from history.

2545
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:54,460
Okay.

2546
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:58,460
All desires, the desires of all things are born in this world.

2547
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:03,460
Take, for example, the devil fruits has the same concept.

2548
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:09,460
The devil fruits are the potential of human evolution that humanity wished for.

2549
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:11,460
What the fuck?

2550
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:12,460
Okay.

2551
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:16,460
Oh, wouldn't it be nice if I was like that?

2552
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:18,460
Wouldn't it be great if I was like this?

2553
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:22,460
They have the powers of the diverse future of humankind.

2554
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:24,460
Okay.

2555
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:29,460
Therefore, these abnormalities are hated by the sea, the mother of all nature.

2556
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:31,460
What is happening?

2557
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:33,460
Dark souls.

2558
02:09:33,460 --> 02:09:35,460
He's going into it.

2559
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:38,460
Their existence is burdened with this punishment.

2560
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:39,460
Okay.

2561
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,460
Yeah.

2562
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:45,460
These so-called devil fruit users are beings living in a completely different world that many people wished for and envisioned.

2563
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:46,460
This is my theory.

2564
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:49,460
There's no need to think about whether there is a God or not.

2565
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:52,460
Isn't this world so interesting?

2566
02:09:53,460 --> 02:10:00,460
So this is a secular explanation for what the devil fruits are, I guess.

2567
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:10,460
If people thought they were literal gods and devils before, but I never really thought about it.

2568
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:11,460
No.

2569
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,460
I mean-

2570
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:22,460
Very thematic rather than an actual explanation.

2571
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:23,460
Okay.

2572
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:25,460
So the fruits?

2573
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:26,460
All right.

2574
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:29,460
They're sort of embodying freedom.

2575
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:31,460
What if I could be like this and then you did it?

2576
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:38,460
And that's why they're called devil fruits because it's not good to have such freedom or something.

2577
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,460
Okay.

2578
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:40,460
They're hated.

2579
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:54,460
They're hated by the sea because the sea is the mother of nature and the fruits represent the yearning of humans to escape from nature and achieve infinite potential or something.

2580
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:55,460
Yeah.

2581
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:56,460
So instead of like-

2582
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:59,460
That doesn't really explain where they come from.

2583
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,460
Why are they fruits?

2584
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:02,460
But okay.

2585
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:03,460
All right.

2586
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:04,460
Sure.

2587
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:06,460
I mean surely fruits is also nature.

2588
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:07,460
Why doesn't the land-

2589
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:09,460
You would think so.

2590
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:10,460
Yeah.

2591
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:13,460
Well, land isn't the mother of nature.

2592
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:15,460
The sea is the mother of nature.

2593
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:17,460
Land is like the son of the sea.

2594
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:25,460
So it's like the sea is like birthed humanity and all mammals like evolution.

2595
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,460
I guess.

2596
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:29,460
And then it's like, oh, they're trying to ascend even further.

2597
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:30,460
That's not fair.

2598
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:32,460
Come back and be a fish.

2599
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:35,460
Come back inside.

2600
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:37,460
Maybe this is wine.

2601
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:40,460
But you've got to stay down here with me, mother nature.

2602
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:43,460
I'm coddling you, humanity.

2603
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:46,460
Well, there's no fish-fish fruit.

2604
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:47,460
Wait.

2605
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:48,460
Yes, there is.

2606
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:53,460
Isn't the dragon fruit of the fish-fish fruit model dragon?

2607
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:54,460
Yeah.

2608
02:11:54,460 --> 02:12:00,460
It's a carp fruit model dragon, some sort of a thing like that.

2609
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:01,460
Yes.

2610
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:02,460
Okay.

2611
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:03,460
So never mind.

2612
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:04,460
There is a fish-fish fruit.

2613
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:05,460
Okay.

2614
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:06,460
Sort of.

2615
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:09,460
It's a fish man who has a devil fruit, the mammoth fruit.

2616
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:10,460
Jack.

2617
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:14,460
So he sinks in water but can nonetheless breathe.

2618
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:16,460
So he doesn't die.

2619
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:18,460
Oh, wait.

2620
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:20,460
Who is Jack?

2621
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:25,460
One of the three big boys of Kaido's crew, the mammoth boy.

2622
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,460
He's a fish man?

2623
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:27,460
Yeah.

2624
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:29,460
It never comes up in a fight.

2625
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:32,460
I don't remember that at all.

2626
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:33,460
I think there was.

2627
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:36,460
Is he the one that rides something?

2628
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:45,460
No, he's got big tusks and he turns into a mammoth and he fell or was otherwise defeated

2629
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:49,460
and laid at the bottom of the ocean because he's a devil fruit using fish man.

2630
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:50,460
So he didn't die.

2631
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:58,460
But that's why it took him a while to appear after he wrecked the big elephant guy.

2632
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:02,460
Like he poisoned everyone on the elephant, all of the minks.

2633
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:04,460
Jack was the guy who did that.

2634
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:06,460
Wait, Jack is the poison guy?

2635
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:13,460
Jack is the guy who, with his Kaido crew mates, storms the big elephant and poisoned all the minks.

2636
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,460
It said, where's Rizzo?

2637
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:15,460
Where's the ninja?

2638
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:16,460
Tell us where he is.

2639
02:13:16,460 --> 02:13:20,460
And then the minks said, we don't know where he is.

2640
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,460
Right.

2641
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:22,460
And then he left.

2642
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:25,460
Zizow is the elephant, right?

2643
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:26,460
Zizow?

2644
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:27,460
Is it?

2645
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:31,460
I'm pretty sure the elephant has a name and I think his name is like.

2646
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:32,460
Zizow.

2647
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:33,460
But whatever.

2648
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:34,460
Okay.

2649
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:35,460
Yes.

2650
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,460
I remember him.

2651
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:37,460
Damn.

2652
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:40,460
I have my memories of the whole Wano arc or so.

2653
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:41,460
Yeah.

2654
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:43,460
I forget when he fell into the ocean.

2655
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:52,460
I think after he, because he didn't, he wasn't there to like stop people getting to Wano or

2656
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:53,460
something.

2657
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:54,460
I forget.

2658
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:58,460
Whatever happened with Jack, he appeared at some point and then he got bodied in every

2659
02:13:58,460 --> 02:13:59,460
fight he was in.

2660
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:00,460
Yeah.

2661
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:01,460
Yeah.

2662
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:02,460
Okay.

2663
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,460
Okay.

2664
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,460
Sentomaru.

2665
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:05,460
I'm continuing.

2666
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:12,460
It is a nice save that he said, that's my theory because then Oda, if he changes his

2667
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:13,460
mind.

2668
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:14,460
Yeah.

2669
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:16,460
I don't really want that to be the exact explanation.

2670
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:17,460
Yeah.

2671
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:22,460
It can just be like, um, Megapunk, you misunderstood something very obvious and he's like, oh,

2672
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:23,460
whoops.

2673
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:26,460
And then the whole fandom's like, what the fuck?

2674
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:27,460
Ah.

2675
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:28,460
Okay.

2676
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:33,460
So he's got three Seraphim and they are, I'm looking at them and they, are they, uh,

2677
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,460
Jinbei?

2678
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:39,460
Is that Jinbei, Nami and Zoro?

2679
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:40,460
No.

2680
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:46,460
It's, no, it's with Mihawk and, and, and I figured her name all of a sudden.

2681
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:47,460
Is it Bonnie?

2682
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:49,460
No, it's, it's Amazon.

2683
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:51,460
Oh, was I right?

2684
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:54,460
I thought, I was like, that's who I was thinking, but I was like, why would it be her?

2685
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:56,460
There's no, there's no reason it would be her.

2686
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:57,460
It is.

2687
02:14:57,460 --> 02:14:58,460
It's totally her.

2688
02:14:58,460 --> 02:14:59,460
Okay.

2689
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:00,460
But why?

2690
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:01,460
Well, keep reading.

2691
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:02,460
Yeah.

2692
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,460
I guess I, uh, okay.

2693
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:10,460
This little panel confirming that Espair is definitely the same Seraphim, dark skin.

2694
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,460
Yes.

2695
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:12,460
Yes.

2696
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:13,460
Okay.

2697
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:15,460
Even though in that one panel, they are not shaded in.

2698
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:17,460
It was not clear.

2699
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,460
Yeah.

2700
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:19,460
Some.

2701
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:20,460
Yeah.

2702
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,460
Okay.

2703
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,460
No.

2704
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:23,460
The half tone guy is getting sloppy.

2705
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,460
He's sloppy.

2706
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:25,460
Yeah.

2707
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:26,460
I'm gonna go with that blender.

2708
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,460
Hey, is Kakus nose like full of hockey?

2709
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:32,460
Oh my God.

2710
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:34,460
His, like his nose sticking out.

2711
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:35,460
I didn't notice that.

2712
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:36,460
But yeah.

2713
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:37,460
It keeps looking like that.

2714
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:38,460
It keeps looking like that.

2715
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:40,460
And it looks like his nose is full of hockey.

2716
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:43,460
And I don't know why it keeps looking like that.

2717
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:48,460
Well, maybe he's like full of, he's like arm, arming himself.

2718
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:51,460
And that also includes his nose.

2719
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:52,460
Maybe.

2720
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:56,460
And because his mask is not covering his nose, his nose just looks like that.

2721
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:58,460
It's getting hockey on it.

2722
02:15:58,460 --> 02:15:59,460
Yeah.

2723
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:02,460
I mean, I guess that would make sense.

2724
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,460
Okay.

2725
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:06,460
So there, there's a, there's a hierarchy.

2726
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:07,460
Okay.

2727
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:11,460
So the five elders, Trump, Vagapunk, Trump, Sentomaru, Trump.

2728
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:20,460
So Sentomaru can control the, the, the pacifistas, including the Seraphim, including the Seraphim.

2729
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:24,460
So the, the CP nine just lost their, their Seraph.

2730
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,460
So, okay.

2731
02:16:25,460 --> 02:16:28,460
It would be a loss of an asset for the government.

2732
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:30,460
We destroy a Seraphim.

2733
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:33,460
What's, what's the deal with Awakening Zones again?

2734
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:38,460
I know that, I know that it's, it makes them, it makes, they just turn it a giant like mindless

2735
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:39,460
monsters is right.

2736
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:44,460
I thought, didn't, weren't there a bunch of those at like, at Impel down?

2737
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:46,460
No, those were not people.

2738
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:49,460
Those were actually animal things.

2739
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,460
Those are weird.

2740
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:52,460
A giant like Zebra with an X or whatever.

2741
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:58,460
I thought, I thought those were like Awakened Zoan users that had become like giant mindless beasts.

2742
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,460
No, no.

2743
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:02,460
Awakening is not a mindless thing.

2744
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:05,460
You might be thinking of Chopper going giant and being a mindless beast.

2745
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:06,460
I swear, I swear.

2746
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:09,460
But that was due to his like, like little medicine balls.

2747
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:10,460
Hold on.

2748
02:17:10,460 --> 02:17:11,460
Hold on.

2749
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:12,460
Hold on.

2750
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,460
Hold on.

2751
02:17:13,460 --> 02:17:14,460
Hold on.

2752
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:15,460
No, no.

2753
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,460
They say it right in this chapter.

2754
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:17,460
Did they?

2755
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:18,460
Yeah.

2756
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:19,460
It's a rare sight.

2757
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:20,460
Look at their speed.

2758
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:24,460
There were many cases that the Awakening of the Zoan types robs their user of their own

2759
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:25,460
personality.

2760
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:30,460
Now, I guess it's not exactly the same as saying they become mindless.

2761
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:32,460
Let me.

2762
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:33,460
It's right, right.

2763
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:40,460
The page right before you see the full spread of Luchi as the Awakened Leopard.

2764
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:41,460
The Five Jailabee.

2765
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:45,460
I'm trying to seeing the Impel down.

2766
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:46,460
The Five Jailabee.

2767
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:49,460
So the most feared creatures of Impel down.

2768
02:17:49,460 --> 02:17:50,460
Yeah.

2769
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:51,460
Okay.

2770
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:52,460
I knew it.

2771
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:53,460
Their zone devil fruit forms.

2772
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:54,460
Oh, I knew it.

2773
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:55,460
I knew it.

2774
02:17:55,460 --> 02:17:57,460
The original full guards.

2775
02:17:57,460 --> 02:17:58,460
Wow.

2776
02:17:58,460 --> 02:18:01,460
So they are other people.

2777
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:02,460
That sucks.

2778
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:04,460
I thought they were big.

2779
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:09,460
I don't know if they're Awakened or not.

2780
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:14,460
I'm not 100% clear on exactly what Awakening entails because it's not just a Zoan thing.

2781
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:24,460
Paramecia's fruits can Awakened and it sort of makes them Zoan-ish, not Zoan-ish.

2782
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:25,460
Logia-ish.

2783
02:18:25,460 --> 02:18:26,460
Right?

2784
02:18:26,460 --> 02:18:27,460
Can't like...

2785
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,460
Right?

2786
02:18:28,460 --> 02:18:29,460
Can't like a...

2787
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:40,460
A Paramecia fruit can Awakened and it sort of means that they can sort of turn their

2788
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:41,460
surroundings into...

2789
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:42,460
Their element.

2790
02:18:42,460 --> 02:18:43,460
Yeah.

2791
02:18:43,460 --> 02:18:44,460
Their element.

2792
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,460
Yeah.

2793
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:52,340
So like Doflamingo is a string man and he can turn things into string rather than just

2794
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:54,780
drawing strings between like clouds or whatever.

2795
02:18:54,780 --> 02:19:00,380
I think he has like a weird cloud fruit, a cloud string fruit.

2796
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:07,060
So like he can make strings appear and like puppeteer people but also when he Awakened

2797
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:12,580
it he could turn himself into string I think or make like a clone of himself out of string.

2798
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:14,940
That was all sorts of fucking stuff.

2799
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:15,940
Yeah.

2800
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,940
This one was weird.

2801
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:17,940
His one was weird.

2802
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,940
Yeah.

2803
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:19,940
Okay.

2804
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:20,940
Okay.

2805
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:21,940
Okay.

2806
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:22,940
I get it.

2807
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:23,940
So they have Seraphim clones of the former Warlords.

2808
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:24,940
Okay.

2809
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:25,940
Yes.

2810
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:26,940
That makes perfect sense.

2811
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:27,940
No, this is...

2812
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:34,500
I feel like it's a mistake that the Impel downguards are not just big animals because there are

2813
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:38,340
huge animals in One Piece.

2814
02:19:38,340 --> 02:19:44,780
Like giant beasts and sea beasts and like giant monkeys and like you could have like

2815
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:52,420
a big like sort of weird Minotaur, you give him an axe and say fight?

2816
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:53,420
Yeah.

2817
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:55,420
Doesn't have to be his fruit.

2818
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:57,220
I guess.

2819
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,220
I guess you could.

2820
02:19:58,220 --> 02:19:59,220
I wouldn't.

2821
02:19:59,220 --> 02:20:00,220
Yeah.

2822
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:01,220
Okay.

2823
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,220
Hmm.

2824
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:03,740
Okay.

2825
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:08,940
Everyone is confused by Luffy's power.

2826
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:11,740
All right.

2827
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:14,260
Sentomaru is working for Vegaponk.

2828
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:17,940
So he's like, yeah, okay, you can escape with Vegaponk.

2829
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:18,940
Okay.

2830
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:21,780
We have to kill the control tower.

2831
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:22,780
Okay.

2832
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:24,340
So they've taken out Sentomaru.

2833
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:25,340
Okay.

2834
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:28,100
Because Sentomaru can control the Seraphim.

2835
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:32,740
So once he's out of the picture, they can control him because they have the authority

2836
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:33,740
chip.

2837
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:35,860
But I mean, Vegaponk could control them even better.

2838
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:39,860
And all of his little robot persons.

2839
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:40,860
Yeah.

2840
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:43,180
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2841
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:46,460
That's so this doesn't seem like it's actually gonna...

2842
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,460
Yeah.

2843
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:48,460
Do much.

2844
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:53,500
You know, the most interesting thing I find out from this chapter is the idea that at

2845
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:59,900
the beginning, they see each other, but they don't immediately fight because Luffy is now

2846
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:02,140
a warlord of the sea.

2847
02:21:02,140 --> 02:21:09,460
He's one of the big guys and so they can't fight without orders to do so.

2848
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:13,300
The only reason Luchi is doing it is because he can't help himself.

2849
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:16,780
He's not a warlord.

2850
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:18,380
There are no warlords anymore.

2851
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:19,380
He's an emperor.

2852
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:20,380
No.

2853
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:21,380
Emperor.

2854
02:21:21,460 --> 02:21:23,740
It's not like an official government thing.

2855
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:29,980
No, but well, I don't know how it works, but the fact that it was reported as such by

2856
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:32,540
Big Bird Morgan, Big News Morgan.

2857
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:34,620
Big News Morgan, my favorite.

2858
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:40,180
Means that now people believe it and so they have to treat him as such.

2859
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:47,340
But he's still an enemy of the government.

2860
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:48,820
He's not working for the government.

2861
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:49,820
Yeah.

2862
02:21:50,260 --> 02:21:55,980
It's not that they aren't allowed to stop crying, but it's like he's so powerful that

2863
02:21:55,980 --> 02:22:02,340
trying to intervene randomly without direct orders could fuck up certain things.

2864
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:07,820
That's why shanks appearing at the war in Marenforge stopped people from fighting because

2865
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:12,820
it's like, okay, we've got white beard, but shanks is also here.

2866
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:13,940
This isn't going to go well.

2867
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:19,580
We've got to stop because he's so powerful and so that's the same implication is that

2868
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:28,260
now Luffy is at a point where simply meeting a marine admiral or something in the wild

2869
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:32,780
doesn't instantly mean there's going to be a fight, even though in this case there is.

2870
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:34,380
It means that the...

2871
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:39,380
Because the implications of a fight between beings of this power are like...

2872
02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:40,380
Yeah.

2873
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:41,380
Catastrophic.

2874
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:48,660
Remember what happened when Aokiji fought Ace and they transformed that whole island's

2875
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:49,660
ecology.

2876
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:54,780
They made it into like a winter fire island just because like...

2877
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:55,780
Yeah.

2878
02:22:55,780 --> 02:22:56,780
Right?

2879
02:22:56,780 --> 02:23:01,500
You're thinking of Akayinu, that's after the war at Marenforge, that's punk hazard became

2880
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:02,500
like that.

2881
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:03,500
Am I?

2882
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:08,940
No, I thought Ace and Aokiji fought and it turned a place into like a hot and cold island.

2883
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:11,260
No, that's punk hazard.

2884
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:15,540
It's Akayinu and Aokiji because Aokiji left the admirals.

2885
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:17,620
He left the marines after that fight.

2886
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:24,820
No, I'm thinking of when Ace fought Blackbeard, which is a different thing.

2887
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:25,820
Okay.

2888
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:26,820
No, you're right.

2889
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:27,820
You're right.

2890
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:29,620
He did have a big fire though.

2891
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,620
Yeah.

2892
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,620
Yes.

2893
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:32,620
I remember.

2894
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:33,620
I'm remembering the big fire.

2895
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:34,620
Hmm.

2896
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,620
Okay.

2897
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:37,620
Well, I'm finished with the chapter.

2898
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:38,620
Yeah.

2899
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:40,980
That one aspect is cool because it's like...

2900
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:45,620
It's a different interaction that is now possible.

2901
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:47,620
He's so fucking cool.

2902
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:48,620
He's so strong.

2903
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:53,900
It kind of just have to be like, yeah, we can't just attack.

2904
02:23:53,900 --> 02:24:01,460
You can't just attack someone like Luffy because the implications, yeah.

2905
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:08,460
Especially since he just defeated Kaido, not single-handedly, but basically and the marines

2906
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:09,620
know that.

2907
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:10,620
Yeah.

2908
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:15,620
I mean, okay.

2909
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,620
Rob's freaking awakened leopard looks pretty wild.

2910
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:23,620
Yeah.

2911
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:24,620
He's lean.

2912
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:26,620
He's just big.

2913
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:31,620
He's just bigger and lankier and he's got a flame cloud.

2914
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:32,620
I don't know.

2915
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:35,620
I guess he must be pretty strong.

2916
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:42,620
I think he's supposed to be strong, but I don't expect him to be able to beat Luffy or

2917
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:46,620
even hold his own at this point.

2918
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:53,620
I feel like just because of him being an older enemy, it's fun to see them grow and face off

2919
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:54,620
again.

2920
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:55,620
Yeah.

2921
02:24:55,620 --> 02:25:03,620
Like Kobe and Helm Epo and what's the other guy?

2922
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:05,620
The Spring-like guy?

2923
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:07,620
What's his name?

2924
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:10,620
Oh, the Spring-like guy.

2925
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:14,620
Like he got completely bodied by Luffy at...

2926
02:25:14,620 --> 02:25:16,620
Are you talking about hard body?

2927
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:18,620
No, no.

2928
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:20,620
The guy before Skypea.

2929
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:21,620
Oh.

2930
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:22,620
Jaya.

2931
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:24,620
The Jaya guy.

2932
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:25,620
Bellamy?

2933
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:26,620
Bellamy, yeah.

2934
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:32,620
Like he shows up later stronger under the orders of Duff Lamingo and they sort of fight

2935
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:35,620
there and it's like, oh, he's gotten stronger.

2936
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:37,620
Luchi was a very dangerous guy.

2937
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:38,620
Yeah.

2938
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:43,620
I think at this point though, Luffy could beat him with his awakened zone.

2939
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:44,620
Yeah.

2940
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:48,620
I feel like storytelling 101-wise.

2941
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:49,620
Yeah.

2942
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:53,620
Once you've bested a guy, you don't bring him back to be like, ooh, but is he going to

2943
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:54,620
be a threat this time?

2944
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:58,620
No, probably not.

2945
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,620
This seems like...

2946
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:06,620
It's a chance to show growth on the part of the protagonist that they can easily fight

2947
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:07,620
Luchi.

2948
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:08,620
Yeah.

2949
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:10,620
Luchi's even stronger than he used to be.

2950
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:20,620
And yet, it's the background to a chapter that's actually about lore dumps.

2951
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:25,620
There's this thing about the sea being the mother of nature.

2952
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:30,620
Yeah, I want to know where Vegapunk got all of this theory from.

2953
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:36,620
So I guess he knows about all the devil fruits because he's read whatever this old encyclopedia

2954
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:37,620
is.

2955
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:41,620
This compendium, one of the Blackbeard Reds to find the one he wanted.

2956
02:26:41,620 --> 02:26:42,620
Oh, that's right.

2957
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:43,620
That's right.

2958
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:46,620
Can I read that, please?

2959
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:47,620
Yeah.

2960
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:48,620
I wonder if they sell it.

2961
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:53,620
They might sell like a little like, ah, for the nerds, for the collectors.

2962
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:59,380
Are you talking about like, oh, they probably made like a Harry Potter, like Fantastic Beasts

2963
02:26:59,380 --> 02:27:00,380
and where to find them?

2964
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:03,620
Like they made like the book and you can buy it if you want?

2965
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:04,620
I wouldn't be surprised.

2966
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:06,620
That would be a cool thing to have.

2967
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:07,620
I doubt it.

2968
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:12,620
I actually kind of think not because I'm pretty sure like we haven't seen it for a reason.

2969
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:17,700
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't make that because then there would be like, oh, well now we

2970
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:19,700
know what all the devil fruits are.

2971
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:20,700
They'd be spoilers.

2972
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:21,700
Yeah.

2973
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:25,700
But it would be like, it would go out of date when Oda comes up with something new.

2974
02:27:25,700 --> 02:27:27,700
Maybe they'd make one after everything's finished.

2975
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:33,060
Well, that would be volume one, be volume one, everything we see up to a certain point

2976
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,060
and they can sell volume two later.

2977
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:35,060
Yeah.

2978
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:36,060
Because it's an encyclopedia.

2979
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:39,420
So it's like a multi volume like encyclopedia Britannica, like it takes up a whole shelf.

2980
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:40,420
Yeah.

2981
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:41,420
Of course.

2982
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:42,420
Of course.

2983
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:43,420
I'd buy it.

2984
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:46,700
I mean, if it was, if it was epic, of course.

2985
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:49,220
Yeah, actually, that would be really cool.

2986
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:53,900
Like little, little, little, like watercolor, like a Mega Man X, the Maverick Hunters guy,

2987
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:57,700
the Mega Man X, Maverick Hunters guy that explains what all the Mavericks are like.

2988
02:27:57,700 --> 02:27:58,700
Yeah.

2989
02:27:58,700 --> 02:28:04,300
It could be like presented in a sort of like written with a quill sort of way and they'd

2990
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:07,700
have like sketches of what the fruit looks like.

2991
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:09,700
Oh, that'd be so fucking cool.

2992
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:10,700
That'd be so awesome.

2993
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:11,700
Yeah.

2994
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:16,860
I have like random like an inconsequential lore of like who discovered this fruit.

2995
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:17,860
But it would be so important.

2996
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:19,500
No one people who have had this fruit.

2997
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:20,500
Yes.

2998
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:25,900
Oh, like a history of, oh, people going like going back to the void century of like known

2999
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:26,900
fruit users.

3000
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:27,900
Okay.

3001
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:28,900
Yes.

3002
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,900
That would be so awesome.

3003
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:33,020
But it would be so important to me that it would like look like an encyclopedia, that

3004
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:38,300
it was like a leather bound volume and not that it was like some fucking like stupid

3005
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:40,260
like anime art on the cover.

3006
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:41,420
Lol.

3007
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:43,500
How to draw a manga.

3008
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:44,500
Stupid anime.

3009
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,500
How to draw a devil for it.

3010
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:50,980
Don't want only stupid manga and stupid Japanese cartoons on the cover of my important, my

3011
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:52,820
important lore book.

3012
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:53,820
Thanks.

3013
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:54,820
Yeah.

3014
02:28:54,820 --> 02:29:02,860
So the fact that the Seraphima cloned from seemingly without their knowledge, the warlords

3015
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:05,820
means that they might be a buggy one, which would be really funny.

3016
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:06,820
Oh.

3017
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:09,420
Because he was briefly part of that before that got dissolved.

3018
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:10,420
He was.

3019
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:11,420
Oh my God.

3020
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:12,420
I forgot.

3021
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:13,420
But who else was there?

3022
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:14,420
There was.

3023
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:15,420
It was Shanks.

3024
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:16,420
Crocodile.

3025
02:29:16,420 --> 02:29:18,420
Shanks was never a warlord.

3026
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:19,420
Shibukae.

3027
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:20,420
Yeah.

3028
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:21,420
Yeah.

3029
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:22,420
Crocodile.

3030
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:23,420
Crocodile.

3031
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:24,420
Moria.

3032
02:29:24,420 --> 02:29:25,420
Gecko Moria.

3033
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:26,420
Yeah.

3034
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:27,420
Doflamingo.

3035
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:29,420
Oh my God.

3036
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:31,420
Obviously Kuma.

3037
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:32,420
Jim Bae.

3038
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:34,420
Boa Hancock and Mihawk.

3039
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:35,420
Wait.

3040
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:37,420
Was Kuma a warlord?

3041
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:38,420
Yeah.

3042
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:40,420
Oh.

3043
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:41,420
Forgot him.

3044
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:42,420
Oh yeah.

3045
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:43,420
Okay.

3046
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:46,420
I mean, I guess that's why he's a Pasifisa or why he's a Seraphim.

3047
02:29:46,420 --> 02:29:47,420
Oh, fuck.

3048
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:49,420
Do you think they have Blackbeard was on that?

3049
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:52,420
I felt like very briefly before he went to Impel Down.

3050
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:53,420
No way.

3051
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:54,420
They have Blackbeard.

3052
02:29:54,420 --> 02:29:55,420
No fucking way.

3053
02:29:55,420 --> 02:29:57,420
They have a Blackbeard Seraphim.

3054
02:29:57,420 --> 02:29:59,420
That would be so fucked.

3055
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:01,420
That would be so fucked.

3056
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:03,420
Actually, this is already pretty fucked.

3057
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:05,420
That would be, I don't know.

3058
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:06,420
That's too much.

3059
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:07,420
I can't.

3060
02:30:07,420 --> 02:30:09,420
I won't allow it.

3061
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:12,420
Do you fucking remember Edward Weevil?

3062
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,420
Wait a minute.

3063
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:15,420
Is he a Blackbeard guy?

3064
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:16,420
No.

3065
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:17,420
Is he the mime?

3066
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:18,420
No.

3067
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:24,420
He's a weird wobbly guy that you see in a chapter like a really long time ago.

3068
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:33,420
He was introduced and he has this mother who's got really short and has glasses.

3069
02:30:33,420 --> 02:30:39,420
She's sort of like a helicopter parent and they're saying that that's Whitebeard's son.

3070
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:41,420
And it's like, ah, Whitebeard's my dad.

3071
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:43,420
I'm going to kill everything.

3072
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:44,420
What?

3073
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:45,420
No.

3074
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:49,420
No, I don't remember this at all.

3075
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:50,420
I wanted it.

3076
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:55,420
I mean, it's obviously going to come up again, but like he seemed that he was shown to be kind of devastating.

3077
02:30:55,420 --> 02:31:01,420
I really wonder what they're going to do with that because I can't remember if he was part of the warlords or not.

3078
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:02,420
I think he wasn't.

3079
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:06,420
He's like a big, oh wait, this big guy.

3080
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:08,420
Edward Weevil.

3081
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:11,420
Oh yeah.

3082
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:17,420
This guy is like claiming to be son of Pirate Whitebeard.

3083
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:18,420
Oh yeah.

3084
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:21,420
I think I kind of thought he was lying.

3085
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,420
I thought he was lying as well.

3086
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:31,420
I mean, he could have been like a bastard child, but like there's something about the mother that's sort of like, I don't know.

3087
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:36,420
Maybe she's trying to push it for some reason, like she's manipulating him to be a pirate.

3088
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:37,420
It could be true.

3089
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:39,420
It could be true, I guess.

3090
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:40,420
Yeah.

3091
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:41,420
I don't know.

3092
02:31:41,420 --> 02:31:42,420
Totally.

3093
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:44,420
Was this guy at Marenford?

3094
02:31:44,420 --> 02:31:45,420
He was post.

3095
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:48,420
He was introduced after that.

3096
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:49,420
Yeah.

3097
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:52,420
No, I vaguely remember.

3098
02:31:52,420 --> 02:31:53,420
Lol.

3099
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:54,420
Amazing.

3100
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:55,420
Elias.

3101
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:58,420
Oh yeah, Elias Whitebeard Jr.

3102
02:31:58,420 --> 02:32:02,420
Shiro Hige Jr.

3103
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:03,420
Lol.

3104
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:12,420
I'm trying to look and see if he was part of the warlords because then they'd have him as well.

3105
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:17,420
He served as one of the seven warlords of the sea whom he joined sometime during the...

3106
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:20,420
How the fuck did this idiot become a warlord?

3107
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:22,420
Because he's so dangerous, I guess.

3108
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:23,420
What the fuck?

3109
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:24,420
Yeah, okay.

3110
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:27,420
Okay, so I guess maybe they have...

3111
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:29,420
What the fuck?

3112
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:36,420
That'd be fun seeing him show up as a seraphim and it was like, who the fuck are you?

3113
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:41,420
I mean, damn, they'll just fucking, they'll take anyone.

3114
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:46,420
They'll take any old person as a warlord.

3115
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:52,420
If anyone who was a warlord for even a brief period of time, it could be a seraphim.

3116
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:58,420
They could have had a little injection, like, oh, this is for nefarious purposes.

3117
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:00,420
Don't worry about it.

3118
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:02,420
They're like, oh, okay.

3119
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:06,420
Yeah, well, that's what I was expecting as a warlord.

3120
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:10,420
I was expecting to do nefarious things, so yeah, I have no problem with that.

3121
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,420
Go for it.

3122
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:23,420
So when it comes to the fight coming up, Luchi, obviously very strong because he killed Sentomaru with one punch.

3123
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:25,420
I don't know if he's dead, probably.

3124
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:27,420
Have we seen Sentomaru fight?

3125
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:30,420
I mean, I assume he's strong.

3126
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:41,420
He's strong when they were at Shabodi Archipelago at the beginning, the first time they went there, before the time skip.

3127
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:49,420
He was strong enough to fight off some of them, and then the Pasifistas were shooting lasers, so they had to run.

3128
02:33:49,420 --> 02:33:51,420
So he's tough.

3129
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:57,420
He doesn't seem fazed by a lot of stuff, but this was instant KO.

3130
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:59,420
Yeah.

3131
02:33:59,420 --> 02:34:02,420
Well, I wouldn't expect him to...

3132
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:06,420
I mean, Luchi is a top tier character.

3133
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:14,420
I would expect almost anyone to go down to Luchi instantly, pretty much, yeah.

3134
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:23,420
So, I mean, I don't think there's going to be that much focus on Luchi versus Luffy because we already did that.

3135
02:34:23,420 --> 02:34:33,420
Yeah, I'm pretty sure what's going to happen is if they have control of the Seraphim and for some reason they can't get control back,

3136
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:41,420
they're just going to have to run, and then they just run with Vegapunk and get on the ship, and then they could have burst out of there.

3137
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:43,420
Yeah.

3138
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:53,420
I mean, I don't see why Vegapunk wouldn't be able to regain control of the Seraphim.

3139
02:34:53,420 --> 02:35:03,420
Yeah, like if they could listen to, if it's voice activated and they hear it through a loudspeaker, would that work?

3140
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:05,420
Well, it says...

3141
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:07,420
Wait a second, wait a second.

3142
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:13,420
It says that they can't take commands through transponder snails.

3143
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:18,420
Well, it says the rank of authority they follow is different than those of the Pasifistas.

3144
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:20,420
Wait, sorry.

3145
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:22,420
Wait.

3146
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:24,420
Hold on.

3147
02:35:24,420 --> 02:35:30,420
The rank of authority the Seraphim follow is different from those of the Pasifistas.

3148
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:36,420
Even if the five elders order them through the transponder snails, it will be invalid.

3149
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:46,420
Okay, so the Pasifistas respond to the Gorose above all else, but I guess that's not true of the Seraphim.

3150
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:50,420
We don't know what the Seraphim's command of authority is.

3151
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:51,420
That's confusing.

3152
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:52,420
Why did they put that graphic there?

3153
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:57,420
It tells us the Pasifistas rank of authority, but that's not necessarily true.

3154
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:58,420
Oh, you know what it is?

3155
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:03,420
I mean, if they told us, this is a setup for like, this is how it's supposed to go.

3156
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:07,420
The five elders are supposed to outrank Vegapunk, are supposed to outrank Centumarra,

3157
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:11,420
are supposed to outrank the holder of any authority chip, in the case of a normal Pasifista.

3158
02:36:11,420 --> 02:36:14,420
But these are Seraphim, so it's not going to be like that.

3159
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:18,420
So, yeah, they're going to...

3160
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:21,420
I think you're probably right.

3161
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:29,420
Vegapunk is probably not going to be able to regain control of them because they don't work like this.

3162
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:35,420
But why would the Seraphim not have Vegapunk at the top?

3163
02:36:35,420 --> 02:36:37,420
That's what I want to know.

3164
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:44,420
Why would he make it so that he has even less authority over the even more powerful version?

3165
02:36:44,420 --> 02:36:48,420
Even if the five elders order them through the transponder snails, it will be invalid.

3166
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:51,420
Does that mean that they don't take orders from the five elders,

3167
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:55,420
or that they don't take orders via transponder snails?

3168
02:36:55,420 --> 02:37:00,420
I think it just means that the five elders don't command them.

3169
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:17,420
I think somewhere I saw a different translation, not being... I can't see it looking for it.

3170
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:29,420
All right, well, we're clearly being given incomplete information here.

3171
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:34,420
Yes, the rank of authority they follow is different from those of Pasifistas.

3172
02:37:34,420 --> 02:37:38,420
What was I saying before that?

3173
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:45,420
Oh crap, that's right, our authority chip is no match to the one he has.

3174
02:37:46,420 --> 02:37:52,420
Are Seraphim considered Pasifistas? That's the question, because if they are then...

3175
02:37:52,420 --> 02:38:02,420
Well, I think they are a kind of Pasifista, but what she's saying here is that the rules of who they obey are different.

3176
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:06,420
Okay, I guess it's just more confusing for some reason.

3177
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:16,420
Yeah. Although, I mean, unless this is a bad translation and this is actually laying out how the Seraphim work...

3178
02:38:26,420 --> 02:38:28,420
I'm seeing the same translation everywhere.

3179
02:38:28,420 --> 02:38:29,420
Okay.

3180
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:31,420
Forget about it.

3181
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:36,420
I think, yeah, no.

3182
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:46,420
So normally, Sentomaru does outrank the holder of an authority chip, and for the Seraphim, that is also the case,

3183
02:38:46,420 --> 02:38:49,420
but not the case the five elders outrank them.

3184
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:53,420
That would be the case in the case of the Pasifistas, but not the Seraphim.

3185
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:57,420
So, does Vegapunk outrank Sentomaru in the case of the Pasifistas?

3186
02:38:57,420 --> 02:39:01,420
I'm going to guess yes for the Pasifistas and probably no for the Seraphim.

3187
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:03,420
It's probably only Sentomaru.

3188
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:05,420
It's just sort of confusing.

3189
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:10,420
She would mention the rank of authority they follow is different.

3190
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:15,420
In the situation where Sentomaru is gaining control, that's already the case.

3191
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:17,420
It seems like it's normal.

3192
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:18,420
Yeah.

3193
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:21,420
For Sentomaru, it seems like it works the same way.

3194
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:25,420
I think she's just setting this up so that next chapter, they can be like,

3195
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:29,420
oh yeah, normally it works like that, but not this time.

3196
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:33,420
Here's why it doesn't work like that this way.

3197
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:34,420
Lol.

3198
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:35,420
Lol.

3199
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:45,420
If you tell, it's like they say, you know,

3200
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:52,420
when you explain in a work of fiction, when you explain a plan or how something is going to go,

3201
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:58,420
the only, like, pretty much the only time you do that is when it's not going to go that way,

3202
02:39:58,420 --> 02:40:04,420
because if a plan is going to go according to plan, you don't say the plan.

3203
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:09,420
You let the audience see the plan play out and then they go, ah, now that was a good plan.

3204
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:12,420
But if you lay it out and you're like, okay, here's what's going to happen.

3205
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:17,420
You wouldn't lay out what's going to happen and then have it just play out as explained.

3206
02:40:17,420 --> 02:40:22,420
You would only lay it out ahead of time if you were going to subvert it or have it fail

3207
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:24,420
or there be unexpected complications.

3208
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:25,420
Yeah.

3209
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:26,420
So there you go.

3210
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:30,420
That's why the ending of Homestuck is annoying, because rest of it lays out the plan and it just works.

3211
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:32,420
And then it's such garbage.

3212
02:40:32,420 --> 02:40:33,420
It's such trash.

3213
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:34,420
Yes, that's exactly why.

3214
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:35,420
It's exactly what's wrong with it.

3215
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:37,420
It's literally the entirety of Act 6.

3216
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:40,420
It's just like, hey, what if we fought Lord English?

3217
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:44,420
Let's get an army together and then fight Lord English and then they get an army together

3218
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:47,420
and then they fight Lord English and then they just win.

3219
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:50,420
And it's the worst fucking story ever told.

3220
02:40:52,420 --> 02:40:54,420
What were we talking about?

3221
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:55,420
One piece.

3222
02:40:55,420 --> 02:40:56,420
One piece.

3223
02:40:56,420 --> 02:40:57,420
I guess we're done with the chapter.

3224
02:40:57,420 --> 02:40:58,420
I think we're done.

3225
02:40:58,420 --> 02:40:59,420
I don't have anything else to say.

3226
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:00,420
Oh.

3227
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:01,420
Yeah.

3228
02:41:01,420 --> 02:41:02,420
I just pulled my headphones out.

3229
02:41:02,420 --> 02:41:03,420
Hang on.

3230
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:05,420
I'm kind of looking forward to more lore.

3231
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:07,420
Nice to see Luchi again.

3232
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:09,420
Cool fruit, bro.

3233
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:11,420
But we've got more important things.

3234
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:13,420
We've got more important things to worry about right now.

3235
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:16,420
Let's go to Elba.

3236
02:41:16,420 --> 02:41:18,420
Let's go see the Giants, please.

3237
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:19,420
Let's go to Elba.

3238
02:41:19,420 --> 02:41:21,420
Well, we haven't seen Kuma.

3239
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:24,420
Kuma's about to appear.

3240
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,420
Oh, right.

3241
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:26,420
The real Kuma.

3242
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:27,420
Yeah.

3243
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:28,420
Yeah.

3244
02:41:28,420 --> 02:41:29,420
He's going to have something to say.

3245
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:34,420
He's going to get up on his little soapbox and he's going to say, enough.

3246
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:35,420
Hey.

3247
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:36,420
Oh.

3248
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:37,420
Hey.

3249
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:38,420
I don't know.

3250
02:41:38,420 --> 02:41:44,420
This is probably not like super a crazy revelation, but I noticed that this panel right here.

3251
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:46,420
Check this out.

3252
02:41:46,420 --> 02:41:52,420
You can see a pacifista or you can see Seraphim Kuma's little back flame.

3253
02:41:52,420 --> 02:41:53,420
Oh, yeah.

3254
02:41:53,420 --> 02:41:54,420
Got flame on it.

3255
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:56,420
We have a little fire on his back.

3256
02:41:56,420 --> 02:41:57,420
That's neat.

3257
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:01,420
Oh, and you can see actually you can see it.

3258
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:03,420
You can see it in these panels too.

3259
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:05,420
The other three also have it.

3260
02:42:05,420 --> 02:42:07,420
You can see it over their shoulder.

3261
02:42:07,420 --> 02:42:11,420
It is kind of like flying under the radar.

3262
02:42:11,420 --> 02:42:18,420
The fact that the world government or at least Vegapunk has been in the process of getting

3263
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:28,420
DNA and making like, not robots, but like almost like cyborgs using DNA of strong people

3264
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:36,420
and strong races to make amalgams that are like powerful weapons of mass destruction.

3265
02:42:36,420 --> 02:42:39,420
That's sort of flying under the radar amongst all of this.

3266
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:41,420
I mean, it's obviously there.

3267
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:43,420
No, I'm picking up on it.

3268
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:45,420
No, I'm picking it up.

3269
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:50,420
Because there's that bit where like, I can, you know, it's like, oh, Vegapunk out of

3270
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:55,420
himself with straw hat, it will leave a crack on an enormous military strength.

3271
02:42:55,420 --> 02:42:56,420
Yeah.

3272
02:42:56,420 --> 02:42:57,420
They have pacifistas.

3273
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:59,420
They've been making them for a while.

3274
02:42:59,420 --> 02:43:02,420
I mean, do they have seraphim yet?

3275
02:43:02,420 --> 02:43:04,420
Do they have like a big army?

3276
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:05,420
Maybe.

3277
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:12,420
Maybe what she means, maybe what she means by what she says, she says the Gora say can't

3278
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:18,420
order, she says the Gora say can't order the seraphim via transponder snail.

3279
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:23,420
So maybe it means that they all, they ultimately answer to Vegapunk as opposed to the Gora say,

3280
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:25,420
maybe that's all she's saying.

3281
02:43:25,420 --> 02:43:26,420
Yeah.

3282
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:34,420
Which is silly if like, Luchi thinks that killing Sentomaru will solve the problem if Vegapunk

3283
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:38,420
can just tell them to continually not fight him.

3284
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:39,420
Yeah.

3285
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:41,420
And like be on his side.

3286
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:42,420
Yeah.

3287
02:43:42,420 --> 02:43:49,420
And I think, I mean, that's, I would expect that he would be able to do that.

3288
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:51,420
Maybe Luchi has been a bit of a himbo right now.

3289
02:43:51,420 --> 02:43:56,420
I think he is because like Kaku is telling him like, stop fucking up.

3290
02:43:56,420 --> 02:43:57,420
Stop fighting.

3291
02:43:57,420 --> 02:43:59,420
You're not allowed to fight.

3292
02:43:59,420 --> 02:44:03,420
We're not supposed to be destroying government property and Luchi's like, but I want to.

3293
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:04,420
Yeah.

3294
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:05,420
I'm gonna.

3295
02:44:05,420 --> 02:44:06,420
Yeah.

3296
02:44:06,420 --> 02:44:09,420
No, I think that's right.

3297
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:11,420
I think a-

3298
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:12,420
Perfect rival.

3299
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:17,420
Vegapunk is like the strongest man because he's got all these minions.

3300
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:19,420
He's got the strongest minions in the universe.

3301
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:20,420
He's got all these goons.

3302
02:44:20,420 --> 02:44:22,420
He does have all these goons.

3303
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:24,420
He's just like Tron Bon.

3304
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:29,420
He's making all these little robot goons.

3305
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:30,420
Hell yeah.

3306
02:44:30,420 --> 02:44:32,420
Hell yeah.

3307
02:44:32,420 --> 02:44:33,420
Do you think-

3308
02:44:33,420 --> 02:44:34,420
Let's get to questions.

3309
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:39,420
Do you think that the last observation, I mean, do you think that's where this goes is just like

3310
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:44,420
Vegapunk allies with the Straw Hat crew and now they have all these like, little like

3311
02:44:44,420 --> 02:44:47,420
Lumarian clones on their side?

3312
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:56,420
That would be the best thing because then they would have presumably a seraphim buggy the clown

3313
02:44:56,420 --> 02:45:00,420
that they can use to fight buggy the real guy.

3314
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:03,420
Their most dangerous opponent.

3315
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:12,420
And I just want to see the reaction when buggy realizes there's a clone of him on the Straw Hat's like team.

3316
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:14,420
He's like, what the fuck?

3317
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:23,420
We need- one piece should end with another fight between Luffy and buggy.

3318
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:27,420
That should be like the final boss.

3319
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:28,420
Just like all times.

3320
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:30,420
It ends just how it begins.

3321
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:32,420
Yeah, I think so.

3322
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:34,420
It'd be like, what was happening?

3323
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:41,420
Like Luffy was in that cage and Zoro like carried it down because his swords were like gone.

3324
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:45,420
He couldn't cut the cage apart or something.

3325
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:47,420
Oh, yeah.

3326
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:50,420
Like he was going to get blown up with a buggy bomb.

3327
02:45:50,420 --> 02:45:52,420
Buggy had like taken over a town, right?

3328
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:59,420
He'd like taken over some town and then he captured Luffy because Luffy was doing something.

3329
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:07,420
Was trying to stop him from like, what was he like collecting taxes from all these like townspeople or something?

3330
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:10,420
I think he's just being a big old pirate.

3331
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:12,420
Yeah.

3332
02:46:12,420 --> 02:46:14,420
I forget how he got in the cage.

3333
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:16,420
Maybe it was just like a funny trap and it was easy.

3334
02:46:16,420 --> 02:46:22,420
I think the crew just beat him up and put him in it or something like that.

3335
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:24,420
Time to reread One Piece.

3336
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:26,420
Yeah, let's do it.

3337
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:29,420
One Piece reread podcast.

3338
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:31,420
Oh my god.

3339
02:46:31,420 --> 02:46:33,420
One chapter per episode.

3340
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:35,420
No.

3341
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:37,420
Okay, let's do that.

3342
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:42,420
Literally, like if it's an episode a week, that's for the rest of our lives.

3343
02:46:42,420 --> 02:46:45,420
Yeah, well, yeah, because One Piece will keep coming out.

3344
02:46:45,420 --> 02:46:48,420
There will keep being a new episode.

3345
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:49,420
Yeah.

3346
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:50,420
That we'd have to do.

3347
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:54,420
A new potential episode generated every week that we make a new episode.

3348
02:46:54,420 --> 02:46:58,420
So yeah, we'll be in podcasts for years.

3349
02:46:58,420 --> 02:47:01,420
Oh, no.

3350
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:04,420
I'm never going to stop.

3351
02:47:04,420 --> 02:47:05,420
All right.

3352
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:08,420
They're never going to make it the last chapter.

3353
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:09,420
They're NGMI.

3354
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:11,420
They're not going to make it.

3355
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:14,420
And by it, I mean the last chapter of One Piece.

3356
02:47:14,420 --> 02:47:17,420
There must always be a new chapter.

3357
02:47:17,420 --> 02:47:21,420
I mean, yeah, pretty much.

3358
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:24,420
Der.

3359
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:27,420
Voice mails.

3360
02:47:27,420 --> 02:47:30,420
How many of voice mails?

3361
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:34,420
Okay, so Ben's Weekly Reminder, play Delta in chapter two.

3362
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:35,420
Okay.

3363
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:37,420
Ben's Weekly Reminder, stay up to date with One Piece.

3364
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:39,420
I did.

3365
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:40,420
Next one.

3366
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:41,420
Okay.

3367
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:42,420
Here's a real voice mail.

3368
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:44,420
The AI apocalypse is fake news.

3369
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:45,420
All right.

3370
02:47:45,420 --> 02:47:47,420
Three, two, one, go.

3371
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:51,420
You know, people are all up in arms about AI art potentially replacing the jobs of artists,

3372
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:54,420
but what context do they actually see that as like potentially happening in?

3373
02:47:54,420 --> 02:47:59,420
Like other than mass producing jigsaw puzzles or other shit like that.

3374
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:04,420
The vast majority of artistic work is in advertisement and like entertainment.

3375
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:06,420
And with advertisement, you know, there's brand guidelines.

3376
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:09,420
There's a lot of attention to detail about how things are represented.

3377
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:12,420
You're going to have to do a lot of composing yourself.

3378
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:14,420
You're going to have to like do editing.

3379
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:17,420
You know, if you have a logo, you need to make different versions for like different contexts.

3380
02:48:17,420 --> 02:48:20,420
You know, all of that stuff, you need a human involved still.

3381
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:22,420
And that person's going to be an artist.

3382
02:48:22,420 --> 02:48:27,420
So like, you know, and when it comes to entertainment, you have a lot of similar issues.

3383
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:32,420
You know, you have like, you need something for specific use and you are going to have

3384
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:34,420
trouble getting the AI to generate that.

3385
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:37,420
You're going to have to have someone like intentionally go through it.

3386
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:41,420
It honestly would probably be easier to have a person make art in most cases than to like

3387
02:48:41,420 --> 02:48:47,420
try to make, you know, your game sprites with AI and like, you know, what for like Pokemon

3388
02:48:47,420 --> 02:48:48,420
design?

3389
02:48:48,420 --> 02:48:52,420
I don't see a future where like Nintendo would use AI to make Pokemon designs or, you know,

3390
02:48:52,420 --> 02:48:55,420
other companies doing similar stuff to that.

3391
02:48:55,420 --> 02:48:59,420
It seems very unrealistic and alarmist to me.

3392
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:00,420
Yeah, I don't know.

3393
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:02,420
I generally agree.

3394
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:10,420
I think though that the problem is not on like larger scale, like big boy money.

3395
02:49:10,420 --> 02:49:11,420
Yeah, it's not.

3396
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:14,420
I'm not worried about what the Pokemon companies is doing.

3397
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:22,420
Like what's likely to happen is that people who want art, just random people would much

3398
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:27,420
rather generate something for free or for cheap than they would commission an artist.

3399
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:35,420
And it's the smaller artists who are likely to lose customers just because when something

3400
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:40,420
costs less or doesn't take as long, people are just going to gravitate towards that.

3401
02:49:40,420 --> 02:49:46,420
And if AI art gets very good, it might be like bad for those sorts of artists who rely

3402
02:49:46,420 --> 02:49:47,420
on commission work.

3403
02:49:47,420 --> 02:49:51,420
And if there's less people willing to pay because they can just get whatever they want

3404
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:56,420
by typing in a prompt, that would be bad for them.

3405
02:49:56,420 --> 02:49:57,420
It's the small stuff.

3406
02:49:57,420 --> 02:50:00,420
I think that's the same with other AI generated.

3407
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:10,420
Like I saw somebody talk about the AI translation using AI for translating like text has put

3408
02:50:10,420 --> 02:50:17,420
a lot of translating like work out of business because so many people don't really care about

3409
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:20,420
it being like perfect syntax and perfectly translated.

3410
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:21,420
They just want to do it.

3411
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:23,420
They just want to make it so they can read it.

3412
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:31,420
So they'll like opt to use the free bot rather than hire somebody to translate it properly.

3413
02:50:31,420 --> 02:50:43,420
I mean, machine translation is good for like on the fly translating like in a casual context.

3414
02:50:43,420 --> 02:50:47,420
It's not good enough for like commercial work.

3415
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:48,420
Yeah.

3416
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:51,420
There would be those small potato stuff still.

3417
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:58,420
But like the larger stuff, big companies, government agencies, anybody who needs to do translation

3418
02:50:58,420 --> 02:51:03,420
to make sure it's good publishing companies, they will hire translators.

3419
02:51:03,420 --> 02:51:10,420
But like there's not a lot of work for smaller translation jobs from individuals who want

3420
02:51:10,420 --> 02:51:14,420
to translate it or like hobbyists or stuff like that.

3421
02:51:14,420 --> 02:51:16,420
That's just gone apparently.

3422
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:20,420
I don't potentially potentially damaging for smaller artists.

3423
02:51:20,420 --> 02:51:21,420
I don't know if that's true.

3424
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:26,420
I mean, they're not they're not machine translating like mangas now.

3425
02:51:26,420 --> 02:51:29,420
I mean, if they are, I'm sure it's dog shit.

3426
02:51:29,420 --> 02:51:30,420
Yeah.

3427
02:51:31,420 --> 02:51:40,420
I think there must be like some like to like if you really want to translate something

3428
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:44,420
and you can't like hire somebody to translate it for you.

3429
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:45,420
Okay.

3430
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:48,420
And you have this this bot, you could like put it through that.

3431
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:52,420
And then if it doesn't make grammatical sense, you could just shift it around.

3432
02:51:52,420 --> 02:51:53,420
Okay.

3433
02:51:53,420 --> 02:51:56,420
And you don't know you can make it readable, but you don't know whether it's correct to

3434
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:59,420
the original source material because you didn't translate it yourself.

3435
02:51:59,420 --> 02:52:07,420
I suppose in like in like the market sense, what AI does is like it might not be a good

3436
02:52:07,420 --> 02:52:09,420
option, but it does.

3437
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:12,420
There is now a zero cost.

3438
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:18,420
There is a zero cost option, even if it's awful, which I which I guess does sort of like

3439
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:25,420
lower it lowers the price floor out from under maybe like extremely low level people who might

3440
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:29,420
otherwise do low level translating jobs.

3441
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:31,420
That's yeah.

3442
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:36,420
I mean, it is it is yeah, it is a competitor.

3443
02:52:36,420 --> 02:52:45,420
It does present a competition to that space, I guess.

3444
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:52,420
And when it comes to translation, you're either correctly translating it or you're not.

3445
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:58,420
And it's not as like creatively like varied as like art.

3446
02:52:58,420 --> 02:53:05,420
So like, a robot is more likely able to do something correct than you are to like type

3447
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:07,420
in the prompt and get exactly the piece of artwork.

3448
02:53:07,420 --> 02:53:20,420
I think I think that probably most in most cases, someone who wants artwork.

3449
02:53:20,420 --> 02:53:27,420
I think it might be kind of similar to like piracy and that like the people pirating art

3450
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:32,420
or people pirating like commercial products, probably we're not going to pay for it in

3451
02:53:32,420 --> 02:53:33,420
the first place.

3452
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:34,420
Probably.

3453
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:38,420
So I think I think probably most people that are maybe using AI art to generate images.

3454
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:43,420
I think most people that would have paid an artist to make something they really wanted

3455
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:48,420
to see would probably still do it because an AI can't really make something you can't

3456
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:53,420
tell it like you can only really tell it exactly what you want if you give it like

3457
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:56,420
something to learn from and just be like copy this.

3458
02:53:56,420 --> 02:54:04,420
Yeah, the the the the I think probably most people that are content with using AI art

3459
02:54:04,420 --> 02:54:06,420
to generate images for free.

3460
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:11,420
We're not are not dedicated enough to like a particular vision that they want to see

3461
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:15,420
realize that they would have had like any budget for an artist anyway.

3462
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:18,420
That's probably not universally true.

3463
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:24,420
Yeah, it does present some competition in terms of like image generation to artists.

3464
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:26,420
I'm not saying it doesn't do that at all.

3465
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:31,420
I'm just saying I kind of agree that it's not going to replace it's not going to replace

3466
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:32,420
artists.

3467
02:54:32,420 --> 02:54:39,420
It's it is getting a bit like like over what did they what's the term they used?

3468
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:41,420
Was it overhyped overblown?

3469
02:54:41,420 --> 02:54:44,420
Like like out of proportion something like that.

3470
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:48,420
Yeah, I think people are freaking out maybe a bit more than they need to.

3471
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:51,420
But I don't think that there is no damage.

3472
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:56,420
Yeah, in the same way in the same way that piracy like you could there's an argument

3473
02:54:56,420 --> 02:54:59,420
to be made that people who pirate probably wouldn't buy stuff.

3474
02:54:59,420 --> 02:55:01,420
But I don't think that's a guarantee.

3475
02:55:01,420 --> 02:55:02,420
It's not.

3476
02:55:02,420 --> 02:55:07,420
I don't think piracy has no negative impact on the sales of any given thing.

3477
02:55:07,420 --> 02:55:08,420
No, you're right.

3478
02:55:08,420 --> 02:55:09,420
You're right.

3479
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:14,420
So it's like it's it's like it's not a it's not a non issue, but it's not the worst thing,

3480
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:15,420
I guess.

3481
02:55:15,420 --> 02:55:16,420
Yeah.

3482
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:26,420
I think that I think that I mean in OK, Harry Harry Partridge, just to take that example

3483
02:55:26,420 --> 02:55:31,420
that I used before, he used AI to generate some backgrounds or something.

3484
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:33,420
He said he didn't specify, but he said subtle AI.

3485
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:35,420
I assume he means backgrounds.

3486
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:44,420
And I mean, I guess under different circumstances, maybe he would have had to pay someone to

3487
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:49,420
he either would have had to put like paint a background image himself, or he would have

3488
02:55:49,420 --> 02:55:51,420
had to pay someone to make that background image.

3489
02:55:51,420 --> 02:56:01,420
And so I guess there does represent a sort of like a would you call it a loss to the

3490
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:02,420
economy?

3491
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:06,420
You know, somebody might have gotten paid for that job and now they're not getting paid

3492
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:08,420
because of AI.

3493
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:12,420
And I guess you could choose to see that as a negative.

3494
02:56:12,420 --> 02:56:14,420
And in some cases, maybe it is.

3495
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:23,420
I think that it's I think it's good when labor is saved.

3496
02:56:23,420 --> 02:56:26,420
I kind of I feel like I feel like if a machine.

3497
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:32,420
Taking like taking like jobs, taking like the jobs question out of it for a second,

3498
02:56:32,420 --> 02:56:37,420
I think it's good when a thing can be done without work versus when it requires work

3499
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:38,420
to be done.

3500
02:56:38,420 --> 02:56:45,420
So I'm I really want to be like, it should be it should be a good thing that nobody had

3501
02:56:45,420 --> 02:56:50,420
to draw this image, because, you know, the image didn't need to be so specific.

3502
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:54,420
If you could have just used any old freakin background, if you could have just, you know,

3503
02:56:55,420 --> 02:57:00,420
it didn't require specificity to the point that you needed to hire a human intelligence

3504
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:02,420
to create it.

3505
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:05,420
It was very you didn't need a machine.

3506
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:07,420
A machine image would do.

3507
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:09,420
And so it's okay to be like, well, she's a machine.

3508
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:10,420
Fuck it.

3509
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:11,420
It's free.

3510
02:57:11,420 --> 02:57:12,420
No labor.

3511
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:13,420
No labor required.

3512
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:19,420
And I feel like if work, if work can be automated, if work can be.

3513
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:23,420
If it can be done by a machine, it might as well be.

3514
02:57:23,420 --> 02:57:29,420
I kind of think it's OK if that work disappears, because it's no longer necessary.

3515
02:57:29,420 --> 02:57:30,420
Yeah.

3516
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:33,420
I hate artists is what I'm saying.

3517
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:35,420
I do want them to die.

3518
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:44,420
When it comes to like stuff like backgrounds, like I personally like to put like, like background,

3519
02:57:44,420 --> 02:57:48,420
like design a background as specifically as I can.

3520
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:52,420
Well, so like a generated background for me might not really fill.

3521
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:57,420
It might not do the job that I want it to.

3522
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:58,420
OK, hang on.

3523
02:57:58,420 --> 02:58:02,420
But do you always like to do that?

3524
02:58:02,420 --> 02:58:05,420
Well, I don't like to draw unless there's a point.

3525
02:58:05,420 --> 02:58:06,420
Right.

3526
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:11,420
But I also don't like to put backgrounds if there is no reason to have a background,

3527
02:58:11,420 --> 02:58:15,420
which leads to like a panel that has nothing behind the character.

3528
02:58:15,420 --> 02:58:17,420
Which is to depict anything.

3529
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:18,420
Which is fine.

3530
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:19,420
Yeah.

3531
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:21,420
Which is like totally fine most of the time.

3532
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:22,420
Yeah.

3533
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:24,420
It's not an argument against AI.

3534
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:26,420
It's just that I probably wouldn't use it personally.

3535
02:58:26,420 --> 02:58:31,420
I mean, if it's just going to be whatever.

3536
02:58:31,420 --> 02:58:32,420
Yeah.

3537
02:58:32,420 --> 02:58:34,420
I'd rather be nothing, actually.

3538
02:58:34,420 --> 02:58:36,420
I think it's cleaner and easier to read.

3539
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:37,420
OK.

3540
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:42,420
I'm going to say yes, but I feel like that works better in like a comic or a manga than

3541
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:43,420
it does in like an animation.

3542
02:58:43,420 --> 02:58:48,420
I can't imagine like someone like Harry Partridge just having like blank background.

3543
02:58:48,420 --> 02:58:55,420
When it comes to space, you can have like all sorts of weird bloops and stuff in a space background.

3544
02:58:55,420 --> 02:58:56,420
Yeah.

3545
02:58:56,420 --> 02:59:03,420
If you're on like a non-descript green rock planet and you just need like a bunch of green

3546
02:59:03,420 --> 02:59:06,420
rocks stretching out for a little while, then fine.
