1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Get out of me swamp. Welcome everybody. Get out of my swamp. It's the PCP. I'm the best

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,440
guy ever. We've got Ben Saint in his swamp. I'm here. I'm showering in mud and farting

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:27,520
to kill fish. That's the thing. And Tom Oliver. I'm still sick post-radcon with not coronavirus

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,280
and it's pretty annoying. It's pretty fucking annoying. I don't feel like sick. Like I have

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,120
a disease but I feel like really tired all the time. Yeah. I'm back to 100% feeling and

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,440
my only issue now is I need to start exercising because I know I'll feel better. I will probably

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,800
feel better if I started exercising again. I just feel like I wake up early. I've been

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,280
waking up early lately and then like three hours later I'm like, man, can I go back to

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,120
bed again? And then I just feel like that for the rest of the day. It's based. Exercise

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,440
would probably help. Probably. Real recommendation anyway. I called my doctor and they were like,

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,640
it sounds like you have a sinus infection. Go get a sinus infection medication. I'm just

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,080
like, I don't want to go to a pharmacy. That seems like the worst place to go during a

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,760
pandemic where all the sick people go. Just wear a mask. Put your scarf over your face.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,920
No, I'm a scared populist person who watches too many scary things. I mean, I don't want

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,920
to go outside either, but like I have to go out for like groceries and stuff. I'm a go

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,320
to the grocery store probably. Wait, have you been using Instacart? Yes. How? I've tried

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,520
to use Instacart a bunch of times and they're all like, oh yeah, there's no deliverers available

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
not for like four days. Probably because you're in Boston and I'm in the middle of nowhere.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,840
Wouldn't that, I feel like that would make me more likely to be able to. No, because

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,840
there's more demand. There's more supply, but there's way more demand because you're

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,920
in a city. I guess that makes sense. They're legitimately not available because they're

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,880
busy. I mean, maybe it's just that they're too busy and not that nobody wants to do

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,520
it. Right, right. Yeah, it could be. Like when I order Instacart, it's like, hey, your

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,480
order will be here by 2pm, like okay, and then like it'll be delayed like four times

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,080
and then it'll get there like seven at night. Right, right. You know, I should do that.

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,400
I want to, I'm working from home. I'm working on all these Radcon videos and stuff. I should

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,520
just fucking Instacart. What do I do? Well, apparently Instacart workers are organizing

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,960
a strike soon. So maybe I shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't strike break. My friend works

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,280
does Instacart and he showed me like the payouts and they're pathetic and terrible and bad.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,800
And I was like, why are you doing this? Yeah, why would you do it? I'm sure they're bad.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,640
Fringe to the max. I've just been going to, I've just been going to Whole Foods, you know,

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,920
looking like a fucking wasteland warrior, wearing my like scarf over my mouth with my

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,480
fucking dyed hair and shit and like a, my coat. I'm the only one who does it too. There's

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,480
like old people who are wearing medical masks and then everyone else just looks normal and

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm like, I'm like all mouth covered and stuff, feeling like a freak, but I'm convinced that

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm right and everyone else is wrong. When I was coming back from Radcon at the airport,

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,880
I saw a bunch of people in gloves and a couple of people in masks. That was like pretty much

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,560
the highest. Yeah, I wear gloves when I go into Whole Foods. I put gloves on. I don't

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,240
touch anything. I would never, ever, I'm never going to touch that keypad. Sure. Wear gloves

40
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,640
the whole time. It's based. Makes sense. Makes sense. Yeah, I'll probably do that if I end

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,440
up going up. Hey, speaking of going to stores. Hey, big news guys, I know you've been waiting

42
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,360
to hear this, but it's, I'm sorry to say it's true. GameStop sales have dropped by 26% in

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,000
the fourth quarter. Oh, wait, so sorry, everyone. Sorry to let you know. What's dropped in the

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
fourth quarter? GameStop sales. Are you not aware of the saga of GameStop and what they've

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,880
been doing in the wake of this crisis? I mean, I know that they're bad. What have they been

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,080
doing, Tom? I don't actually know. Oh, so GameStop in response to like everything closing

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,560
down, they tried to make the case that they were an essential service and should stay

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,640
open. Oh, yeah. My gamer score, Tom, my gamer score. And then like they didn't provide anything

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,960
for their employees and they actually like sent out an internal email to like the managers

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,800
and they were like, if the cops come, give them this number to call because you can't

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,320
close even if the police come to close you down. Bro, when the bombs drop and it's us

52
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,560
against us, the only currency that's going to matter is gamer score. It's important.

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,160
That's an essential function, you know, society. You're right. I guess GameStop Corporation

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,440
knew the correct shares thing all the time. Yeah, you know, I just happened to see a thing

55
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,400
before this that said that like, oh, they're closing 300 storefronts this year. Okay, which

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,560
obviously isn't bad. But do you know how many GameStop stores there are too many nationwide?

57
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:06,280
As of googling just now, 5,500 stores. So that represents what like a 5% maybe maybe more

58
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,320
than that 10%. Yeah, a little over 5%. It's like six, six and a half, 7% something like

59
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:18,240
that. So obviously the trend is down. And I mean, I you know, I have some sympathy for

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,000
like or some some attunement to the argument that like, you want to own your physical media

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
because I fucking hate patches and shit in in a sense that games are being wiped off the

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,280
earth because you can't get creators make little George Lucas esque tweaks and the fuck

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,680
things around. I just want the classic original. Her name is Eris. You can't tell me her name

64
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,240
is Eris. I will never submit and I will never surrender. But but why the fuck would you go

65
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,280
to GameStop? Would you just download the game? I mean, that's, you know, I don't get it. I

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,680
like never buy games in physical media. I mean, I just I just order them from Amazon.

67
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,320
They're usually cheaper or just get them used from eBay. But they have to wait like days,

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,720
several days for it. But I don't have to get out of my chair. And that is definitely worth

69
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,560
waiting two days. But I don't have to get out of my chair if I go on the switch store and download

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,880
the game directly on there or steal a game from the internet. But then the bad people win because

71
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,200
then you don't own your media anymore. And when your switch console breaks and you can't port

72
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,000
any of your shit over to the new replacement system you buy, because Nintendo is living in

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,200
the Stone Age when it comes to internet, you're fucked. Okay, I'm happily in the valley of it

74
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,160
feels like this is the way things are going. I would love to for things to not necessarily go

75
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,840
this way. But I can't do it alone. So I give up. And I'll just do what's convenient. We could have

76
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,160
been brothers in arms, but you've abandoned me. In some ways I am. But the convenience argument

77
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,360
is too strong. It's far too sounds like you're part of the problem, Nate. The most No, I think

78
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,280
I'm part of the solution. Convenience is everything. It's all I want. It's all I have just like a

79
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,720
capitalist bootlicker going for the convenience over fucking anything else. How sad. That's true.

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I mean, why would you ever buy a video game? Which of Maslow's hierarchy of needs does it

81
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,520
serve? Why would you even buy video games in the first place? Truly the worst thing to do.

82
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,840
Can you eat a video game? Can it shelter you from the elements? Depends on how many you have, I

83
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,320
guess. You can't build a shelter out of downloads, but if you have enough jewel cases, you can.

84
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,760
So clearly I'm in the right here. Yes, Ben. I want to see you collect that vapor,

85
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,000
you spew from your fiery gullet and try to make a shelter or live off of that. You degenerate.

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,360
I believe in the miasma theory of disease. I don't believe in bacteria. So by filling my room

87
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,280
with vapors that smell like cotton candy or blueberry or blueberry cake or mango sorbet,

88
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,280
I believe I will be protected from infection, yes. Okay, well said. Well argued.

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,240
It's like, wait, no, it's the opposite of what Digi said with Destiny that even if you make a

90
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,000
bad, if you make a good case for a bad argument, Digi said, no, you lose. No, he said you win,

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
whatever. Oh god, I can't remember. It was too confusing. I'm sorry to bring it up. What a nightmare.

92
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:33,400
Well, that's it guys. Game stop. That's all that's on my mind. You guys all, you guys quarantined?

93
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,760
Still quarantined. You know, it's this, you know, the joke, the joke going around on the

94
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,920
internet is everyone's like, haha, I never leave my house anyway. And that's true. I am not, life

95
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:54,200
is not very much different for me personally under quarantine than it was at any other time.

96
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,840
And yet, and yet, it feels worse. It feels because now you have to, you're not doing it

97
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,400
voluntarily. I don't like that. I don't like that. I guess so. I guess that has to be it.

98
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,360
But here's a silver lining, Ben. Here's a silver lining. It just feels more stressful because

99
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm seeing people like talking about it on Twitter and like people on Twitter and stuff are like,

100
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,760
oh boy, I'm cooped up in the house. This is so bad. And I'm like, and it makes me self-conscious,

101
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,400
like, oh no, me too. And now I, but now I feel bad about it. Well, no, here's the thing. The thing

102
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,520
is that like you realize, oh, I should feel bad about it. My entire life for the last like 10

103
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,120
years, I've been living like I was in a pandemic without realizing it. Yeah, kind of. That's pretty

104
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,040
fucked a little bit. Yeah. But but but the silver lining guys, the payout, the payout was approved.

105
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,520
We're getting $1,200. Oh my god. That's true. Yeah. You know, hey, that'll pay rent for one month.

106
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,760
That's not bad. But here's the thing. For us specifically, they're saying unemployment works

107
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,840
for a gig economy and like people working like like independently. So we might actually be

108
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,360
able to get a couple months of unemployment as well. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

109
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,720
Yeah. What? What? Yeah, dude. What? Yeah, I don't, how? How? That doesn't make any sense.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,720
I want to believe it's true. I mean, let me pull up the article again. Someone sent it to me. It was

111
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,160
like, Hey, does this apply to you? For self-employed 1099 creatives who have lost employment due to

112
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,480
COVID-19, everyone is fixated on the one time $1,200 check. But for the first time ever,

113
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,320
freelancers are eligible for unemployment pay plus $600 per week through the end of July.

114
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,280
Per week, baby. Let me, let me for no particular reason point out that those

115
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,280
uninsurance protections were included in the bill specifically because Bernie Sanders pushed for

116
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,880
them to be there. So if we all get $600 a week, we have Bernie to thank for it.

117
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,160
That's all I have to say about that. Based. But I heard that like, we don't get paid out until like,

118
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,760
I heard that those checks won't be going out until like May, which seems like a little.

119
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,960
I don't figure that as well. I mean, I'm not sure if that's true, but that's what I heard.

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,360
To cover. To do those.

121
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,040
Okay. So that's not good for people who are literally living, you know, paycheck to paycheck.

122
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,960
But I guess I like to think that most people have enough money to, you know,

123
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,080
dig into their savings until that comes to account. Most people have no savings.

124
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,200
A lot don't. A lot. What is it? What was it?

125
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Yang would always throw out the statistic and so would Bernie that like 40% of Americans

126
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,880
can't afford like a $500 emergency or something like that. Right. Right.

127
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,120
So that's pretty bad. Pretty bad. Rent strike. I mean, that's rough. That's rough.

128
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Rent strike. Damn you Nancy Pelosi holding up the bill. Curse you. Curse you woman.

129
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:44,680
The, you know, for one day, I heard that I heard that Canada, Canada is getting $2,000 per person

130
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,880
for four months, as opposed to our one time $1,200. Well, pretty cool.

131
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,760
We just, we just used, you know, 75% of that money to bail out everybody but the common

132
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,560
person because that's much more important. That's, oh, that's after. So we gave them 1.5 trillion

133
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,560
out of the $2 trillion and then we also gave them $1.5 trillion a couple like last month

134
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,120
to jumpstart the stock market for 20 minutes before it crashed again.

135
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Yeah. So, you know, you know, about that first bailout, I did learn that it's not,

136
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,680
it's not as simple as we just took $1.5 trillion from the budget and just gave it to companies.

137
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,680
It's more like, it's weirder than that. It's like, they basically just went into the government,

138
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,480
the government computer like fund and just like edited the number to say,

139
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,680
we have $1.5 trillion more than we have. And then gave that as like sort of a short-term loan

140
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,640
to those companies to like liquidate assets. And then they were given back the money,

141
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,880
the quote unquote money, the phantom money, and then it was like deleted again.

142
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,160
So it's not like, it's not as simple as they just gave them $1.5 trillion,

143
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,880
they just invented $1.5 trillion that did not exist out of whole cloth,

144
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,280
pretended to give it to some people to fix the, to try and fix the economy,

145
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,720
and then unpretended it. So I don't know. I don't understand that at all. Money is,

146
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,760
money is literally fake. Money is a spook. It's made up. The government, the government has as

147
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,040
much money as they say they have. You know, it occurs to me that all our current,

148
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,720
I forget the word for it, but this whole system, capitalism, we have an entire country that has

149
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,400
expanded itself to a very wide degree on the back of, I mean, this is just basic economic theory

150
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,440
of capitalism or whatever, on the back of like, there's all this money in play that can be promised

151
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,360
here. It's like your basic loan thing. Your bank has money and it loans it out. That money

152
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,520
doesn't actually exist all the time, but there are expectations of earnings and whatnot,

153
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,920
so that when the machine grinds to a halt, like there is nothing there to support it,

154
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,040
and then it collapse. I mean, this is just your basic fucking bubble theory or whatever.

155
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,720
I don't think I would have done that if it was me in charge. That seems pretty irresponsible,

156
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,400
but maybe it's not. I don't know. I've been against fractional reserve banking ever since

157
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,960
guys two fucking red-pilled me on that shit like 15 years ago.

158
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,120
You lost me there. What are you saying you wouldn't have done?

159
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
I don't know. I can't express it any better than I did.

160
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,560
For fractional reserve banking, for every dollar that comes into a bank, a bank is allowed to loan

161
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,320
to $10 out because of the way the system works. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, gotcha.

162
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,000
So when something happens and they call the debt or whatever, the problem we're having is not

163
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,440
specifically a run on the bank, though. No, no, it's a separate issue. I mean,

164
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,440
it just occurs to me that I mean, all this stuff is intertwined in the underpinnings of our broken

165
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,560
fucked up society. So when one thing fails, it all fails. Sure. And now the big thing this week

166
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,920
was like Republicans calling for this cure is worse than the disease. We got to get everyone

167
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,720
back to work because like, sure, people will die, but like, we can't let the we can't let the economy

168
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,600
crash. You're right, because the economy, unlike everything we just explained about why it actually

169
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,160
is important for our overextended world, we can just let that collapse. And it'll be totally fine.

170
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,560
Don't worry about it. No one's going to get hurt as a result of that. I mean, I mean, the economy,

171
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,480
I mean, as as a elaborated upon in the example of the just made up a bunch of imaginary money,

172
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,840
the money in the economy is all fake. It's all it's all a dream, a whisper in the wind.

173
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,240
But but but but further than that, further than that, the problem with that line of thinking,

174
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,120
okay, maybe maybe you do believe that there will be like a like a measurable like cost of like human

175
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,400
life, specifically from a from an economy crash, right? Well, like maybe maybe if you if you believe

176
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,480
that, you could try and weigh it against, okay, what is the what is the cost of allowing COVID-19

177
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,800
to spread versus crashing the economy? And that's a reasonable line of inquiry. But like,

178
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,640
yeah, if you're saying like, oh, we got to get people back to work, we can't we can't let this

179
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,960
virus stall the economy. That's bad. Well, like, okay. But if you people go back to work and they

180
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,280
stop self quarantining, then the infection will continue to spread. And like, that just

181
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,680
unsolves the problem. And we're going to have an economic crash anyway, from like,

182
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,240
millions of people dying. Like, that's like, that's going to be way, like, not only is that I think

183
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,480
a bad way to go about it, it doesn't even like on it doesn't even solve the problem it purports to

184
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,560
solve of preventing the economy from crashing. Well, you're totally right. If that happens,

185
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,280
I mean, yes, it would be it would be not only would it be bad, then it would kind of be have

186
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,120
pointless to have even done anything that made the economy go bad in the first place,

187
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,080
which is obviously foolish that likes the worst of both. It would all it would also undo the

188
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,400
utility of everything that has been done. Yeah. Yeah. So what's the right answer? Oh, God, I'm

189
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:18,600
too stupid. Professional epidemiologists who seem to agree that mass quarantining for a period

190
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,040
is the right way to go. I believe that works for South Korea.

191
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,240
Is that what they did? They they they did mass testing really quickly isolated everybody who

192
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,280
had the disease quarantine them and now they're kind of doing better. Yeah, I saw that like their

193
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:42,120
curve was like, flat AF. Yeah. Damn. I mean, you know, yeah, sure, this would spread the disease.

194
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,920
But like, why not have like, the young people are mostly fine. Maybe there could just be like,

195
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,000
the people who are the higher risk are self there's a bunch of young people now.

196
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,200
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, first of all, the proportions of people infected. I mean, you know,

197
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,800
listen, young people can die of it. But sure, furthermore, it's the point of quarantining everyone

198
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,320
is that the infection stops spreading and the virus is killed. Like, yeah, young people mostly

199
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,240
don't die of it, but they can still spread it. Well, sure. Listener, fair listener. None of us

200
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,760
know what we're talking about. I just finished watching this awesome video by cold fusion,

201
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,480
one of my favorite YouTubers about the virus and like the cures that are being worked on right now.

202
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,520
It's fucking great. It's a LinkedIn in the show notes. Watch it, subscribe to cold fusion,

203
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,520
one of the best YouTubers on the platform. Really good shit. I'm looking at, you know,

204
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,640
I'll be honest, the biggest thing about this is it's fucking boring is what it is. It's

205
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,840
fucking boring and I don't care and I'm really bored and I just want to do other shit and I'm

206
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,480
sick of everybody talking about it. Fine, be quarantined. What would you be doing? Yeah,

207
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,800
I'm going to say, are you not in the boat of like, I would just be home anyway? I mean,

208
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,240
I definitely am. But I'm sick of it dominating everyone's thoughts. That's what annoys me.

209
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,160
And look, I get it. It's a big deal, but I could also be bored of that. Here's the thing,

210
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,640
though, the fact that we're all saying like, Oh God, the fact that like everyone's talking

211
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,800
about COVID-19, it's so boring. That just shows that we're too glued to social media. We have all

212
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,080
this free time to just go do actual productive things or just watch anime. Like I started

213
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,280
watching Olive Shirabako. That was much better than just being on Twitter reading about COVID-19.

214
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,800
Go use your time wisely, people. Go do something fucking cool.

215
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm no goddamn Twitter animal who's on Twitter all day reading about this stuff. I'm just saying

216
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:39,240
that in the feeds that I already follow, there has been certainly a shift toward this subject

217
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,480
matter. Just block coronavirus and COVID-19.

218
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
You're not going to get any like vital information about the outbreak through Twitter anyways.

219
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,760
I mean, I use Twitter for cute anime girls. That's what I use Twitter for. So that's not the

220
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,800
issue, Twitter. It's mostly like YouTube videos. Thank God, 2D waifus can't get the coronavirus.

221
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,960
They're safe. I'm looking at this flow chart.

222
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:13,480
Uh, or I'm, man, can I do this? Can I file for unemployment insurance?

223
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,480
I mean, I haven't been fired or anything, but I don't know. What are the conditions?

224
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,000
Is it just if I don't make enough money, then I qualify for unemployment insurance?

225
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,880
If that's the case, then maybe I would just get unemployment insurance.

226
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,200
That would be pretty sick. I don't know.

227
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,680
I want to roll the dice. I want to try. Why not?

228
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,520
Well, nothing wrong with trying if you want to.

229
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,680
I guess I should look into it.

230
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:45,560
Like I'm so fucking poor that getting even just $600 a month, not even a week, would double my

231
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,640
income. Oh, dude. Oh, dude. Hell yeah. Please God, let this work.

232
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,880
What is this about a SBA paycheck protection loan? It says to apply for. I don't know what that is.

233
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,640
Thank you for this infographic, Tom. I will be looking into it shortly.

234
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,320
If you figure out anything, let me know. I'm going to start looking to it as well,

235
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,000
because I want to get to the bottom of this shit.

236
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,760
Let's do a left turn here. I've got something else to discuss.

237
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,400
And it's that. Okay.

238
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:20,200
So there are three PCPU lectures coming out, or already out, sorry. There's Ben's,

239
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,520
Tom's, and Gibbs. They have been very well received. And mine, by the time you get this.

240
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,400
Tom's is literally, it's accelerating in views. It is not flattening. It is gaining views at an

241
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,400
increasing rate. Did you guys see what you guys think about your experience of getting them out

242
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,280
so far since we talk about them so much? And I'm really happy with the response. It was funny,

243
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,280
because I was in this morning in the Radcon for Discord, and someone was like, hey, a few days

244
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,280
ago, some guy uploaded an Animorphs video and was like, oh, yeah, it's beginning. Was it just

245
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,160
intolerant or something? Yeah, the video was pretty shit. I didn't like it, and I don't like the guy's

246
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,000
channel. I have seen that guy's channel. It's, by the way, it's James Tullo. James Tullo. I saw

247
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
that today, and I posted a comment in the comments saying, because in the video, he says, like, oh,

248
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,080
I could, if you wanted a full explanation on this, on the lore of this series, that would take me

249
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,440
forever. And so I commented like, oh, if anyone wants that explanation, there's a link to exactly

250
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,440
such a video. Got four hours free. It's funny, I almost did that as well. But I ended up forgetting,

251
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,280
because I'm dumb. And I was too busy watching COVID-19 treatment by Cold Fusion.

252
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,360
So I mean, yeah, what do you think? What are the odds? This guy published two days ago.

253
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,440
He says in the video that he had been meaning to put out an Animorphs video for a while.

254
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,640
Okay, I believe it. Yeah, he's a book guy. He just talks about books.

255
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,920
His whole channel is him just talking about like fantasy books, mostly.

256
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,120
I wonder if he feels cucked that you got yours out right before he got his.

257
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,840
I mean, he has 50k subs. So his is already like catching up to my video, despite being

258
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,920
out for like a third of the time. So I'm pretty sure he'll do just fine.

259
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,280
But his video, his video was not good. The production values were basically non-existent.

260
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,080
And he was just like, Animorphs was so weird. Lots of stupid shit happened. Man, the 90s were

261
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,920
dumb. I heard he had a very negative take overall on the series. It was pretty bad.

262
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Fair enough, I guess. He basically just lists off the five weirdest things.

263
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,000
They're not even the weirdest things.

264
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,120
Anything that you didn't touch on in your video.

265
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah, there was some of the filler books that I've left out because I just want to

266
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,320
write a general plot. There's one where Rachel morphs into a starfish, but gets cut in half.

267
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:44,280
Oh, yeah, that's right. My favorite one is how canonically El Fangor founded Microsoft.

268
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,680
Is that true? Yeah.

269
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
Why and how did that happen?

270
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, he didn't found Microsoft. What he did is like, well, he was a human nofflet.

271
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,920
He's like, he goes through a general human education, but he's an andalite. So he's super

272
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,600
fucking smart. And like he can easily get his PhD and whatever because it's like baby shit to him.

273
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,760
But there's one offline where he's like, yeah, I helped my friends, Steve and Bill

274
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,240
start their companies and it's Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. And it's just like cheeky.

275
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,360
What the fuck? That's really funny. That's really funny.

276
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,200
Hey, by the way, speaking of Microsoft just reminds me, are you guys aware that not only is

277
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,920
Bill Gates like in a hard quarantine, like in a boat offshore because the world may or may not

278
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,920
be ending, but also like he did a TED talk just like exactly predicting exactly what COVID is

279
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,600
right now. Have you seen that? No.

280
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,040
Yeah, I watched it just the other day. Or most of it anyway. I mean, he's just talking about

281
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,520
exactly what we're going through. And this is like two years ago. It was like two or three years ago.

282
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,640
And are you telling me the Bilderberg group engineered COVID-19 and is this all a big

283
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,400
experiment done by the deep state? Because I believe it. Maybe, maybe. But he's mostly like,

284
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,120
guys, please, let's make sure we're prepared. Please God, there are things we can do. No,

285
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:11,080
but then we didn't. Oops. Sorry, Bill. I popped into, I popped into a Pantsu party live stream

286
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,280
the other day. Those things are popping off these days. Where I don't, is that sarcastic?

287
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,120
I don't know. No, no. Maybe it's getting some good people on there. Didn't she

288
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,680
get like channel, get like shadow band or something? Yeah, I think it did. Somebody said

289
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:32,280
that it did. And like her side channel too, I think. They were discussing how COVID-19 is a

290
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,440
Chinese bio weapon designed to thin the population. I mean, some aspects of that,

291
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,760
some aspects could be true because they, it may have come from a lab. And then I mean, you know,

292
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:50,120
I mean, I went and I googled it and I did not see any credible information. I found a bunch of

293
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,560
articles being like, here's how we know that it did not come from a lab. No, it is not a bio weapon.

294
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,800
I mean, I'm not gonna, I've been in the air a little, I'm not going to claim that like that's

295
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,960
hard evidence of anything, but I haven't seen any evidence that it is a bio weapon. So,

296
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,160
if anyone's got any, I guess I'd be marginally interested in seeing it. Kind of sounds like

297
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,200
some crackpot shit to me. Certainly could be. I mean, this is, I mean, the coronavirus is,

298
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,760
it's just like a new version of like the same thing that caused SARS. This isn't like a new

299
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,320
invention. Yeah, I mean, for me, I'm much more concerned with the cover up China did after

300
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,320
it was already loose and that's not so good. Yeah, sure. That's just China being China. I'd be more

301
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,600
surprised if they didn't cover it up. If it turned out it was a bio weapon, I would be concerned,

302
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,840
but I don't know that, you know, whatever. I don't know. I'll just, I just need to see evidence

303
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,480
of such a thing. Of course, I agree. I agree. I think a lot of people just don't trust the Chinese

304
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,080
government too much. And so maybe they're a little tempted to lean on, they're bad boys,

305
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,760
which they are. They're doing some genocide over there. Let me complain about, let me complain

306
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,160
about something. Everyone, there was a, okay, first people got mad at Trump for calling it

307
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,000
the Chinese virus. And then there was a reaction of people like, why is it racist to call it the

308
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,320
Chinese? It's not racist to call it the Chinese virus. We name things, it's just where it came

309
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,240
from. We name things after where they came from. Ever heard of the Spanish flu? Did you see them

310
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,120
update the Wikipedia article on the Spanish flu to remove that it's called the Spanish flu?

311
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,520
That was pretty funny. I did not. I mean, I mean, I heard some people talking about that. I don't

312
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,840
have the facts, but let me, let me, let me, let me see if that's true. Spanish flu, Wikipedia.

313
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,520
I believe it, it's called something else now, but I think the Spanish flu also known as the 1918

314
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,320
flu pandemic wasn't unusually deadly, blah, blah, blah, blah. Thing about the Spanish flu is it

315
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,000
did not come from Spain. It came from America. All right. Why is it called the Spanish flu?

316
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,320
Maybe just it got there and that's what's best known for being. Honestly, like, okay,

317
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm not an expert on this, but I have heard it said that like people called it the Spanish flu,

318
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,680
like specifically to like, oh, okay. I guess it was first reported in Spain,

319
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,360
but it didn't come from, but it didn't come from Spain. All right.

320
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,840
I think it's more just like the zeitgeist of culture, you know, like, like the coronavirus is

321
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,080
obviously associated with China because that's where it fucking got its start and shit.

322
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,640
People are like, oh, it's not, but it's not racist just to call it the Chinese virus.

323
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,000
And like, I agree. It's not in and of itself racist to call it that. But like,

324
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,480
the point is it's weird. It's weird. Don't you think that like it was called the coronavirus?

325
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,680
They've been calling it that for months and then all of a sudden Trump and other people,

326
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,720
they just, they pivot. They start calling it the Chinese virus. Did you see that picture?

327
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,000
There's a picture. You can see Trump's speech and he literally used a sharpie to cross out

328
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,920
coronavirus on and wrote Chinese virus. I saw that. I assumed it was fake. It's not fake.

329
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,960
He really did that. Can I get a source? It just seems, it seems so, like, if anybody would do

330
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,800
something like that, it would be Trump, but it just seems so ridiculous to me that you would,

331
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,040
why would you need to scribble it out? Couldn't you just remember? I mean, maybe I don't know.

332
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,080
I don't know. The thing is, the thing is, the people are mad, people are mad at the,

333
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,560
let me fucking finish, the people are mad at the libs for being like, okay, oh, it's not racist.

334
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,520
It's just calling it what it is. Okay, whatever. The point is not whether that phrase is racist.

335
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,800
The point is that calling it that is, like, clearly a manipulation of the thing. It already

336
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,920
had a name, but they've decided we need to give it a new name to transpose blame for the situation

337
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,680
onto China. That's clearly why they're doing it. And I don't appreciate it.

338
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,480
I agree. I agree. I think, I think in the case of Trump, if he did that, then yeah,

339
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,600
I think someone on Twitter just calling it the Chinese virus.

340
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,400
No, it was, I mean, it became a thing because Trump said it in the speech and then Trump said

341
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,160
in one of his speeches when like some lady asked him, like, if it's racist, he said, like, no,

342
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,400
I mean, clearly one of his motivations here was that he said that the Chinese government

343
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,920
attempted to spin this as actually an American virus that was like leaked by the American

344
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,480
government. And clearly he was very annoyed by that. And he's like, no, no, no, this is

345
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,320
a Chinese virus. Is that true though? I mean, that's what he said. I mean, why would you believe

346
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,520
anything is he says it? I mean, that doesn't prove it's true. But I mean, I've never heard that

347
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,480
fact disputed. I've just heard the fact. I will not believe I will not believe anything just

348
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,000
because Trump says it. It's just that I've heard no pushback on that point. I don't care other

349
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,040
points. I mean, that's not him saying it is not evidence of it being true. I'm not I'm not

350
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,440
asserting that it is definitely true. I'm saying that I'm saying that there's no reason to believe

351
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,520
it even could be true simply because he mentioned it. Also, a lot of people seem hung up on like

352
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,880
this is giving a bad name to the glorious Chinese people. I mean, I can sort of see that. But

353
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,320
isn't really the intent here to smear the government who is responsible for managing the

354
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,920
situation? I mean, I mean, I read it. I don't I don't think the attempt is to deliberately like

355
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:19,480
demean the ethnically Chinese. It's definitely like a political thing. Right. I mean, I mean,

356
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,320
to be fair, the Chinese are trying to pin this on the US by saying that the coronavirus started

357
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,680
in America and we're saying it was US military. I've never heard that. Is that this is the first

358
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,160
time hearing of that? If it's true, then so be it. A couple weeks ago, that was the Chinese

359
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,640
government's position was trying to shift blame to the US and saying it was like a military operation

360
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,240
that brought it in or something to that effect. So this is the government's doing the governments

361
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,960
pretending to be brainless when they're all working in a big interlocking system where

362
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,000
they're all at fault and they all need to be called. Just to give you a fact here, a data point,

363
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,560
I'm reading an article in The New York Times that says, this is just the title, China spins

364
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,440
tale that the US army started the coronavirus epidemic. So I don't know any more than that.

365
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,520
It's The New York Times seems reasonably credible. Well, then well, then maybe. Okay, whatever. Yeah.

366
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,960
The point is, I'm going to keep calling it the coronavirus because that's I mean, that was its

367
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,440
name. It's perfectly fair to me. Okay, Trump definitely calls it the virus just to annoy China

368
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,360
and I don't feel a particular need to do so. So I don't care. The actually people saying it annoys me

369
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,440
because people say like, oh, we name things after what they're they come from. Well, actually,

370
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,320
the World Health Organization says no, we don't do that anymore. Because sometimes we're bringing

371
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:46,760
it back, baby. Our official naming convention specifically preclude doing that.

372
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,960
So no, wrong. I'm sorry, we are bringing your fancy laws to the streets where we call in the

373
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,720
virus, you know, what it what it really is. I'm just, you know, I'm just I'm too by the book.

374
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,400
Ben, let's call it what it is. It's the kung flu. It's the kung flu. I know. Look,

375
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,320
in my heart of hearts, I know it's the kung flu.

376
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,600
Hey, hey, okay, but but I was also curious, we talked about the dang lectures. I wanted to

377
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,800
hear what you your debacle about your lecture about my trauma you sucked. Yeah, it was because I

378
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,560
I guess my headphones are bad because we had two. There were two audio tracks. One was from

379
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:37,800
the two floor mics. And the other was from the the lapel mic. Yeah. And I listened to both of them.

380
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,800
And like quality wise, I didn't hear that much of a difference. But this baffles me.

381
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:51,320
But for some reason, the that you guys talking was actually quieter relative to me speaking in

382
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,080
the floor mics in the lapel mics, you guys are actually like relatively louder. I don't know

383
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,120
how that could possibly be the case. Yeah. And yet it is. So I was like, well, since I don't hear

384
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,200
much of a quality problem, I'll just go with the floor mics, because like whatever, it doesn't

385
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,520
matter. So I released it. And, you know, in hindsight, actually, the quality of the lapel

386
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,360
mic is actually a little better. It's a little less tinny. But even, but it's not like a deal

387
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:23,880
breaker. However, I guess for some reason, the two floor mics were like out of sync with each

388
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:30,200
other. Like, yeah, waveforms were like, yeah, they were just like one frame off or whatever.

389
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,560
And so listen to in stereo, it didn't it sounded okay. But if you listen to it on mono,

390
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,640
the two signals because they were out of sync, they would like negatively cancel or I forget

391
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,560
what the phrase is, you know, the two waves would like cancel each other out. And so people said

392
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,480
it sounded like they were hearing me like as though I was speaking underwater or through a wall or

393
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,480
something. So, you know, most people didn't have it. And a lot of people were like, why are you

394
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,960
reuploading it? It's fine. It's fine. But like some people were like, this sounds like terrible,

395
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,480
like this is like unlistenable. Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't use the the mics for the audience,

396
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,800
because for some reason, as the lecture went on, the those ones desynced from

397
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,400
in my case, the video was very weird. In my case, and this is very frustrating,

398
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,360
in my case, actually, the lapel mic desync, it's not very much. But if you watch at the end of the

399
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,480
Kokoro wish lecture, you can see that like the audio is desync from the video by like,

400
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,480
a quarter of a second, like it's very minor. But if you pay attention, you can kind of see it.

401
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,320
Yeah, I mean, yeah, the whole last third part of my lecture, the audio drops in quality even

402
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,960
further, because I guess the lapel mic for the third recording just didn't work. So it was just

403
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,280
the camera audio. So it's just like, okay, it's just bad. It's not going to be good. It's gonna

404
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,720
we're gonna have to ride on the performance and the information because clearly the production

405
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,080
value is not you got him in for the first two hours. I mean, most people will coast. I ended up

406
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:07,240
I ended up I contacted our old friend oblivion fall to do I was like, first I wanted him to like,

407
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,920
hey, could you fix this like, this like phase issue that is like causing this cancellation?

408
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,840
And then he kind of did but then he was like, you know, the lapel mic sounds better. And I was

409
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,360
like, well, okay, can you just apply the lapel mic? And he was like, well, I want to do some

410
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,720
cleanup on it. I was like, okay, and then it took a while but then he did it. And then I got it up

411
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,400
and that was how that happened. But very frustrating, because the second release

412
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,920
did not get as many views as the first one. It did not it did not spike. I think it killed

413
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,040
some of its momentum to re upload it. It lost like, you know, like six 6.8 thousand views

414
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:49,320
that it had on the first one. Kind of a bummer, kind of a bummer. But whatever, what are you

415
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:58,840
going to do? I think we should do this. Shut the fuck up. I'm fucking talking. Oh my god.

416
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Holy shit. It's fine. No, I love you. I love you.

417
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,280
On the first release, on the first release, I did I went and I posted it on like every

418
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,680
fucking subreddit that it was even marginally related. I posted it in my discord, I posted

419
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,680
an rfck discord, I posted the link to the first one everywhere. And I don't know if it made that

420
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,200
much of a difference, but it clearly maybe made some because the first one got got a percent

421
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,280
more views by a bit. But I don't know if I have the energy to do that again. I don't know if I feel

422
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,120
I just I feel like embarrassed. I would feel embarrassed to do it a second time. I know what

423
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,360
you mean. I don't know how to pin it on the audience because people were complaining. I went back and

424
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,120
did this. He's fucking entitled viewers. Where where would I plug such a thing? I was thinking

425
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:54,120
like what what subreddits would I even post this on? The PCP subreddit. Yeah, it was already there.

426
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:00,280
It's already there. But like I went and the webcomic subreddit, the cringe subreddit. I did that.

427
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:07,800
I did that too. I posted on like 15. The based subreddit. Yeah. Is there a based subreddit?

428
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,680
There should be. Okay. I don't. Where do you plug a thing like this? I put it on 4chan.

429
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,720
I don't know. I just posted. I've made a thread on 4chan about it.

430
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,520
Go to our college and just be like, here's a university lecture for you guys.

431
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,360
There is. There is actually a subreddit for video lectures. It's not that big.

432
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:37,240
Wait, regardless, our slash lectures. I don't think about any of this because I'm a fucking

433
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:44,280
idiot. I mean, to be fair, it didn't make much of a difference for me, but like

434
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:51,560
this is the kind of thing that I worry about. I like to watch numbers go up. Indeed. Same.

435
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,440
You want to know something disgraceful? Yes. You want to know something disgraceful about

436
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:06,120
our friend Gibb and take? Oh no. Yeah. Ream him, Ben. Do you know what he's doing right now?

437
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,920
Jerk in his little dick. Worse. He is streaming ratchet and clank.

438
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,000
He's streaming right now. He is streaming right now. He must have forgotten. That piece of shit.

439
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,600
You know what it is? He keeps thinking, okay, yesterday he like pinged everybody two hours

440
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,400
before the meeting and like, hey guys, it's time for the meeting. I think his like clock or alarms

441
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,760
are just wrong. How fucking hard is it to fix that? I don't know. Well, I think he probably just

442
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,160
something got screwed when he like changed time zones when he came here or something. I have no

443
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,320
idea, but the boy needs help. It's gotten to his brain. It just seems like a very solvable problem

444
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:55,160
to me. We could. We could add him right now, but it's too late. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. It's possible.

445
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm not gonna. You know what? You know what he should do? We didn't add everybody. We should.

446
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:06,440
Oh god. Oh, we didn't add everybody. Whoops. We should get him on the podcast right now, but he

447
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,280
should have us, our audio be audible on his stream. We should have this episode live on Gibbon

448
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:21,640
Gaming. Um, potentially doable, I suppose. Guys, here, I'll just add everyone. I got,

449
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,680
I got the best fucking comment right now on the Kokoro wish lecture. It is from Mike Smith.

450
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,520
Do you want to know what it said? Yeah, indeed. It said, Christ, you people are ugly.

451
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,480
He's not. Oh Christ. That's death.

452
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,280
My favorite comment on the Animarse lecture so far was just someone like yesterday say,

453
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,440
I know what you're going to say. This is the most unfunny thing I've seen in a long time or

454
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,840
something. Oh, I thought you were going to say the one about the circus, the four skins. Oh,

455
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,800
that one was great too. That was a nightmare fuel. Tell us that one time. Yeah. So somebody

456
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,400
commented yesterday on the Animarse lecture saying like, Oh, so you're saying when, when

457
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,360
everybody morphs back, all of their non-genetic injuries are healed from their base form. So

458
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,760
that means that all the man and male animorphs got their foreskin back, right? And I'm just like,

459
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:25,720
and all the women got their FGM reverse. I guess so. I guess so. I can't say you're wrong.

460
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:34,120
Female genital mutilation. Oh, right. My favorite. Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool. My favorite thing to

461
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,920
watch. Let's play is up. I can't cure this damn autism or this damn one-itis, the deadliest

462
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:48,520
mildest motor man. Shit. If only. Listen to purple glasses over here, making more misogynistic

463
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,200
comments. I'd never say the word because I hate women so much. Well, I mean, true.

464
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,240
Well, hey, so I'm, I don't wonder if you guys have done the same because I've been going through

465
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,360
my big ass long lecture and I have been, I'm going to go through it. I'm like, I'm, I'm getting pretty

466
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,920
close to being done. I should be done editing it two day. So it should be out by the time people

467
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,680
hear this. We know how my predictions go, but feeling pretty confident about this one.

468
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,960
And end of the month, people, end of the month. I've been doing that. Well, that's only two days

469
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,600
from now. End of the month, every month. Well, uh, uh, oh, so I've been going through the entire

470
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,360
thing and putting in images. I've really, this is almost my penance. It's my penance for, I feel

471
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,520
so bad about both the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy lecture, not adding in images, just things

472
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:44,680
to give context. I've maybe gone a bit overboard. But my, it's, yeah, my policy, I have been doing,

473
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,880
I did the same thing for, um, Kokoro Wish and I'm doing the same thing for, uh, Chris102.

474
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,360
My policy, and I haven't stuck to it a hundred percent, but like, my rule of thumb is I don't

475
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:02,600
show images of events. I just show images of a character or like a thing. Yeah, when the character.

476
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,080
And I have a general rule that's mostly, it's like the first time a character is mentioned,

477
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,400
I show them and that's generally. If there's something that you would need to end up to

478
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,480
visualize, like to, to understand what I'm talking about, I show that. But generally, I don't show

479
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,480
like, oh, this is, if I say, oh, and then this happened, show the panel where it happened.

480
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,960
No, I, some, sometimes I do. Because you want people to wonder and to use their imagination

481
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,920
a lot of the time. Yes. What things look like. Yeah. I have been, I have been considering,

482
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:37,160
like, should I do, should I do Chris, should I do Sonichu101 Remastered where I just put images

483
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,240
on screen? I thought of that too. I thought of that too. I don't know. Like, on the one hand,

484
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,360
like, one, would people care? Two, like, would it actually like, help anyone with understanding

485
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,040
what I'm talking about? Would anyone watch it? Would it like, yeah, I don't know. Well, the interesting

486
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,560
thing is that. It's a thing that I would like to exist, but I feel like if I were to release it

487
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,720
and nobody cared, like, it's, I wouldn't, there wouldn't, like, what would be the point?

488
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:12,040
Sure, sure. One of the things that I didn't expect would be so well received, because I just

489
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,120
blatantly copied it from the RFCK lecture, was having little audio cues when images popped up,

490
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,480
because I didn't even consider that people would just like tab over and do something else.

491
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,920
Oh, they will, no doubt. But of course they would. I consider that as well. There are too many

492
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,680
images, so I'm just bailing on that idea. It is a good one, though. It is a good one. Oh, the,

493
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,600
the dings? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I decided that there were too many images, and I wasn't going to ding

494
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:41,160
for everyone. The first render I did did not have the dings. Then the RFCK lecture came out

495
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,000
in between, and I already had an error I needed to fix. I was like, well, I might as well put

496
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,240
them in. I don't have any excuse now, so I did. That's smart. That's smart. I've also, as I've been

497
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,360
going through the whole thing, I have like my audio up and like, I have everyone else muted

498
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,800
for optimal audio quality. And then only at times when the audience speaks, I raise the audio of the

499
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,600
ambient noise and then lower it once they're done. I've done that through the entire thing so far,

500
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,600
and it's pretty much the most time-consuming thing of the whole project. But yeah, that's why I do

501
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:18,440
stick with it. I'm not sure if Oblivion mentioned wanting to do some of that. I don't know if he

502
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,880
ended up doing it. I didn't think that it, I don't think it was that big of a deal. It's going to be

503
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:30,280
a classic overproduced best guy ever video, no doubt. Yeah. The audio in Sonichu 101 is like

504
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,320
bad, and I get quieter and louder when I face the mic or away from the mic. It's bad, but it's got

505
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:42,040
a million views. Nobody gives a shit. It's true. It's true. I was looking at the lapel mic audio

506
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:51,080
for the Sonichu 102, and there's one side is clearly louder. The left channel is louder than

507
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,080
the right channel, and there's probably a really simple way to fix that or compensate for it.

508
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Maybe I'll do it. Is rendering audio through Vegas bad? Does that make it audio bad? Should

509
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,320
I render the video in Vegas and then get the audio from another source and just apply it through

510
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:18,120
another program? I generally do that stuff in Audacity, but I've never been sure it's actually

511
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:25,080
necessary. I wouldn't, I mean, I don't think so, but I've always used Audacity like for this

512
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,280
purpose, so I can't tell you exactly. Yeah, but you can't render a video in Audacity. Oh, right.

513
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:37,160
Do you then put the audio into Vegas and render it in Vegas? I mean, sometimes, but only for

514
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,280
things that I don't really care about the quality of, just because I've been afraid it'll be worse.

515
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,520
So is what you're saying, that you do the audio in Audacity, you render the video in Vegas,

516
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,480
and then you apply the Audacity audio to the video through an external program? Yes, I have

517
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,400
done that many times. What program do you use for that? Well, Audacity. Audacity in Vegas.

518
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:05,480
No. What I'm saying, do you... Oh, you're asking how do you strip the audio from the video?

519
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:14,200
Yeah. I can't remember offhand. Well, if you want to get audio from... No,

520
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,280
you just said you do it. What do you do? Well, I mean, it's been a while since I last did it. Maybe

521
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:27,160
I did render just the MP3 or the like the FLAC file or whatever in Vegas to get the best quality

522
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,520
possible and then edit it in Audacity because I do that fairly frequently. No, stop. That doesn't

523
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:38,600
make any fucking sense. How would you render a video file in Audacity? No, everything I'm talking

524
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:44,120
about in Audacity is that I've stripped audio files from other projects in some way, like such as

525
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,240
rendering a FLAC file from Vegas or whatever, then you import into Audacity where I do lots of cleanup

526
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:56,760
stuff, then I move it back. Move it back? How? To Vegas? Move it back. So you put it in Vegas

527
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:04,440
and render it in Vegas? I mean, yes. Okay, thank you. Oh boy. All right, cool.

528
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,680
Just for future reference, you can save a step of rendering out a FLAC file. If you install the

529
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,960
FFmpeg extension for Audacity, you can just import video files and it'll just automatically grab

530
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,440
the audio file from whatever video you import and just dump it in there. That's the sort of thing.

531
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,600
Can you then put that audio onto a video file? No, you have to save it as an MP3 or WAV file and

532
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,400
then sync it back up. Oblivion Fallhead, I forgot what he said, the software, Oblivion Fallhead

533
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:38,280
software that could just take an audio file and just swap it into a video, like just just

534
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,400
something an audio guy would have. Just apply it to a video file without re-rendering,

535
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,440
which is pretty convenient, but I don't think it's free software though.

536
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,000
Anything's free if you know where to look. Maybe. That's true. Maybe.

537
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,560
Well, after this, I've got one more lecture to end. Well, I guess I'll just say, I mean,

538
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,600
I have been charged with the heightened responsibility of getting Brad's esteemed lecture

539
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,320
done, which won't that be a fun thing? He's got lots of useful information,

540
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,200
everybody, so stay tuned. Won't that be fun? Look in your sub-box in the old PCP.

541
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,120
What is the next lecture coming out? Whose lecture's coming out next?

542
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,920
I really think it's going to be mine, because I'm almost done.

543
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:30,120
Okay, cool. I am really looking forward to the response to Digi's lecture. That's the one that

544
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,240
I'm like. Yeah, that's going to be juicy. That's going to be juicy.

545
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,800
That's definitely true, but I'm the most hyped for Munchies, because Munchies was so much fun to

546
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:45,640
listen to, and it's fucking great. I mean, true, but also, have we said, should I say what it is?

547
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:53,400
Yeah, you said it. He's announced it. I wonder if people will not want to hear about real history,

548
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,160
as opposed to like- We need to sell them on it.

549
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,520
You've got to have a really insane title. Like, the French Revolution is the best anime you've

550
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,000
never seen, or some really dumb shit. That's pretty good. Honestly, that's probably the way to go

551
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,400
with the title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he starts saying, he says, what does he say? He's like,

552
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,160
oh, history's boring. Actually, no, you're an idiot. I'll kill you. He says history is anime.

553
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,160
It's like the tagline, right? Yeah, he says it, yeah. That's why I said that.

554
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Oh, right, right, right. Spoilers, Teehee.

555
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,480
Bring it out, Munchie. He probably pawned it off to a sweatshop laborer, Ethan, again,

556
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,600
and took six months to get the shit out. Maybe. He needs to be disappointed.

557
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:39,400
Munchie needs to be working on the Vaporette. That's true. We don't need this lecture. We need

558
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:47,960
the Vaporette. It is- Okay, Nexus is working on his. Jade Moreau told me yesterday that she was

559
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:55,080
going to work on hers. Don't know what's going on with Munchie and Kazes, but God, I hope soon.

560
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,160
I hope they'll be done soon. Who is done? Are there people who are done?

561
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,560
Cheesy Manfredo and Hippo are done. Good man, good man. Yes, yes.

562
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:11,080
My money is sitting somewhere. I've got- I want my product. I just want to give,

563
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,560
I just want to give these artists money. I just want to pay them for their work.

564
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,800
I just want to consume the product so I can clap and start waiting for the next product.

565
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:29,400
Yeah, true. Hey, you know, Ben said before, he wasn't thrilled with how his episode, or

566
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,600
you know, having to repost and whatnot, and that got me thinking. Maybe we should do a thing

567
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:42,040
where we sell DVDs of the lectures as one big box set after all of ours come out,

568
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,680
and people can fucking buy them and watch them. I think that's unironically a good idea.

569
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:55,000
One time, boy, that's a weird, weird to imagine, and yet I can't help but think it probably is a

570
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,200
good idea. Yeah, yeah. One time I downloaded some software, some DVD, like design software,

571
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:09,960
and I tried to, actually I probably made some progress with it. I tried to design a DVD menu,

572
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:17,320
and like a DVD design for the Nuzlocke genocide. Right, right. And it was really hard,

573
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,280
and really frustrating, and I think I abandoned the project. I don't remember how far into it I got.

574
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,840
I don't know. So, yeah, I mean it's a thing. It's a lost start, the DVD menu. Back in 2007,

575
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,880
I played around with iDVD on my Mac constantly. It was super simple. It worked great. I made

576
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,720
tons of DVDs of like all my pirated. Did you really? What did you put on them? I just put all

577
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:47,240
my pirated TV shows on DVD, so I could watch them on my TV. Did you make like menus? Yeah,

578
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,840
they had a quick, you just drag and drop some menus, you put some images in, and they just work

579
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,440
like, it was an Apple thing. Back when Apple was actually cool, and it was the easiest thing in the

580
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,520
world. Oh man. I want to make my Naruto DVD playing in the end, with a sick Naruto versus

581
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,600
Sasuke background. You could do that. It was super easy. You're fucking sick. Oh, and to press play,

582
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,360
you have to like press the showering gun on Sasuke's eye to start. Fuck yeah. I use using a

583
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:20,440
program called DVD Architect. Damn. I didn't enjoy the process very much. The Virgin iDVD versus the

584
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:27,800
Chad DVD Architect. No, I think it might be the other way around. Basically, it's cringe. Both

585
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,000
cringe. Yeah, yeah. I can't remember where I saw this. I just saw a video the other day. I mean,

586
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,880
I haven't fucked with a DVD in years, so it would never occur to me to create one. You know what

587
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,320
it was? I just watched Cinemassacre, the angry video game nerd, made a video about like, I forget

588
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,040
what else it was, but it was, among other things, like the lost art of the DVD menu, how they used

589
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,160
to be set. It was in the context of some bigger video. That sounds pretty cool. I feel like it's

590
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,800
completely about like a Blu-ray, and then I think it expanded to all his Blu-rays, and how he was

591
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,960
fucking sick of these awful, like basic bitch. Oh, I think I remember this video. I don't remember

592
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,000
what it was talking about. I don't remember which one it was, but I know I remember this point,

593
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,680
because he's saying like, it's just like a static screen. It's really boring and dumb. And they all

594
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,960
use like the same format, and it totally sucks. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to do a scan real quick

595
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,680
in this channel and see if I can find it. All right. What if we had a DVD box set or a Blu-ray

596
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,560
box set of the lectures, and then for like bonus content, we could have like, like the commentary

597
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,360
on the lecture. So like, if you already seen it. Commentary. Yeah, like commentate on the lecture.

598
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,920
Sure. Sure. Although some of those are pretty long. That'd be a long commentary track. Oh,

599
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,360
god. Like we would like record like a new like commentary track to play over it. Yeah.

600
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:47,400
It'd be a big ask, but it would be pretty cool. I mean, we're in the lecture. We're asking questions.

601
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,800
Yeah. They have actors do commentary on movies. They're in all the time. This is standard DVD

602
00:54:51,800 --> 00:55:00,200
Extras 101. But like, we were doing the commentary in the video. We're there raising our hands and

603
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:07,720
saying stuff. Ben. Making comments. Ben. It's a joke, Ben. No. It's supposed to be funny.

604
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,360
Yeah. Well. Oh, wait. I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. I found the video. It's the top 10 reasons

605
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,440
Blu-ray sucks by Cinemastaker. That's the one. I will post. I can't wait. Get ready for our Blu-ray

606
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:25,400
box set, guys. Cinemastaker disapproved. No. We can put some stank on that menu. We can like

607
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,040
Munchy asks a question in the lecture and then in the commentary is like, yeah. So when I raised

608
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,280
my hand, I was really like, I was really concerned about a certain thing. You know, I'd heard, I'd

609
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:41,480
heard like, maybe we can provide one additional piece of content in such a DVD or Blu-ray box set

610
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,280
or something to like one secret bonus lecture. That would be a good place to float the short

611
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,960
lectures, like the remedial class ideas that we were talking about forever.

612
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,440
True. But like, we don't, we haven't made one yet. No, we're not doing one.

613
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,160
Remind me what the remedial lectures were about. We were just, we were just talking about like

614
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:05,640
trying to do short, like half an hour, 45 minute lectures that were just like, not a four hour

615
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,760
monster. Next, I want to do one big lecture. I've already got some ideas and I want to do

616
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,560
like one small lecture, like deliberately, intentionally, like 20 to half an hour minutes.

617
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,920
I was thinking, if we were going to do that, I was going to do this in general, but now they

618
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:26,200
were talking about the box set. Maybe I put on that like a mini lecture on the Animorphs TV show,

619
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,360
because it's so much different and it was so shitty, like a half an hour thing going through

620
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,280
that and being the changes and how like the budget fucked it over and all that crap.

621
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,800
You know what, Tom? I think someone said this, but I did think this was an amazingly good idea.

622
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,000
I don't know the, I'd have to do research. Maybe you're a better student for this, but a lecture on

623
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,320
all of the doom lore, because there is extensive lore of doom and it's fucking crazy.

624
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,480
Eternal, eternal canonized like everything, like all the dooms of one storyline now,

625
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,440
it's pretty ridiculous. Yep. I don't know, even analyzing retcons and stuff. The thing is,

626
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,360
my first doom, I mean, I played doom one back in the day, but like I didn't pay any attention to

627
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,400
the story. My first real doom was like 2016. So I mean, the story in doom one is like,

628
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,400
there's four paragraphs. Yeah, yeah, you're right. You know what's fucked up, man? Your rabbit's

629
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,920
dead and you're really mad about it. We were playing doom the other day or like a while,

630
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,480
a couple months ago. Why is the font so fucking horrible and impenetrable and impossible to read?

631
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,360
Like all the letters, the kerning is awful in the original doom and nobody talks about it,

632
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,600
but that's the real reason why that game is a zero out of 10. I can't read shit. Because a VGA

633
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:40,920
monitor when it came out was like high tech. I don't give a shit, man. Also, you don't give a

634
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:46,680
no excuse. Check your 2020 privilege, dude. Maybe I will. The banjo tui, which I played as I was

635
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:52,440
prepping from like the big banjo smash video or whatever, like the kerning again, of the font

636
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,360
at the beginning of the game, as it does like the text crawl, like telling you the story so far,

637
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,800
it like the letters are literally over each other. It's a nightmare. Why did they do it that way?

638
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,400
It's it was actually hard to read. I couldn't believe like this game is so good. So much love

639
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,240
and craft was put into every aspect of the game. But then these letters are like impossible to

640
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,320
read. It's a fucking nightmare. I want you I just want to show you what I was talking about before.

641
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,040
Look at the this is this is these are the views on the Animorphs lecture. Oh, there they go.

642
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,280
All right. It is accelerating. As I'm taught, it will reach infinity. You could say it's going to

643
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:34,680
the moon. If current trends hold, we will it will actually circle back around into infinity.

644
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,400
You know, on the lectures in general, in the next month, I've really been trying to

645
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,200
take stock of which one succeed and, you know, beyond others. I really think just the best

646
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:53,400
formula is like unexpectedly cool or unexpectedly interesting stuff presented with like a certain

647
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,200
reverence, and perhaps, you know, some some jabs of the thing, but with like a sincere love for

648
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,720
the thing. I mean, that's why people didn't know about. I mean, that's why I think that

649
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,280
the Kokoro wish lecture is the best lecture in why I should be doing these Iron Man numbers,

650
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:12,280
not you. I deserve those views. We got it. Yeah, we got to pump those numbers up. Well, Ben,

651
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,840
according to that one guy on Twitter, the Animorphs lecture was your win just as much as it was mine.

652
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:24,040
Oh, yeah, somebody said somebody's because I posted that I was like feeling bad on Twitter,

653
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,440
and someone responded like, but hey, you've got the animal, you did the Animorphs lecture,

654
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,560
and someone else was like, actually, Tom did that, and the guy responded like, yeah,

655
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:43,080
but Ben was like really contributing. I mean, it's not wrong. You could choose to see it like

656
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:49,080
that. Ben's Animorphs lecture really was success. There's no doubt about it. Ben's debut role as

657
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:57,480
the TA was really well done. Hashtag Ben's Animorphs lecture. Get a trending. That sounds good.

658
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,520
Everyone in the comments of the Kokoro wish lecture is like, I thought this was going to be

659
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,480
cringe, and you all said the same thing too after that. You were like, I thought this was going to

660
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:11,160
be cringe, but it was actually based. I can't believe it. It was actually cool. Yeah, I totally

661
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,160
stand by that. Yeah, I completely think that. The second year in a row, you've done that.

662
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,280
Last time with Tales of Gets Troll, we all thought that was going to be done, but it was actually

663
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,360
fucking lit. That's true. Tales of Gets Troll was the same. Although it's time to ask the hard

664
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,760
question. I think that perhaps there's a reason. Okay, Christian is obviously exponentially more

665
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,880
famous, but I think that there's a certain thirst for blood. I think the people, in a

666
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,640
sense, they want to see the person shit-talked. They want to see them reamed a little bit.

667
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,240
I think there's a certain hunger for that. I'm just not that interested in doing that.

668
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:52,280
Sure, sure. I go on every now and then I'll check the CWC thread on Kiwi Farms. I never went on

669
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:58,040
Kiwi Farms, but back in college, I would check the Something Awful forums, which was where the

670
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:04,360
hotbed for Chris discussion back in the day. Kiwi Farms seems basically similar, maybe a bit more

671
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:14,840
mean-spirited, but it is so boring. It is so lame. Here, let me fucking peep some right now.

672
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:22,840
Okay, sure. This is the state of default, just negative shit-talking. It's like,

673
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:28,360
oh, Chris is a lulcow. I'm going to misgender them because they're hypocrite or whatever,

674
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:34,840
and they're bad. This is moralizing. Okay, god, there was a...

675
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:42,680
There was a... Oh, god. You're losing me, man. I'm really... I know. Okay, here we go.

676
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:49,480
Someone says, oh, for sure. No sapient being that's even remotely in their right mind, in any

677
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,760
dimension or reality, would ever enter willingly into a loving relationship with Chris, not even

678
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,040
his hedgehog abominations. He has nothing to offer anyone, so unless they were being blackmailed or

679
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,920
were enslaved or forced into it some other way, every one of them would run far, far away from

680
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,280
Chris. That's arguably Chris' biggest delusion, and they're talking about his marriage to his

681
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:16,360
tulpas or whatever. Right. And then something about the idea, guys. I agree. That's why I just

682
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:21,000
can't feel pity for Chris. For the most part, he has only himself to blame for his situation.

683
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,360
It was his shitty life choices, laziness, will for ignorance, stubbornness, and forcing away

684
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,280
anyone who doesn't kiss his ass and humor his delusional crap that brought him to his current

685
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:37,320
situation. What was the idea, fags, did to Chris shitty and cruel? Yes, but it was Chris who chose

686
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:43,160
to ignore reality for comforting lies. This is the state of Chris Chan discussion as it is now,

687
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:50,680
and I want no part of it, because not only is it like gross, imagine 1500 pages of a thread

688
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,360
that are like that, just like pointing out, here's what, just like just stewing and like,

689
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,040
I hate Chris so much, let me just say over and over and over again what I think is wrong with

690
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:05,480
her. Yeah. Right. It's boring. Not only is it mean spirit, it's boring, and I hate it. It's definitely

691
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,560
boring. I don't want to fucking do it anymore. I don't want to be a part of that. Well, I mean,

692
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,920
I think the good, the great thing about the lectures, and I think the reason why they

693
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,040
resonate so much is that they come from an authentic place for all of us, like we all

694
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:24,120
choose topics that we're legitimately invested in, and it's not like an ironic, like, haha to he,

695
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,560
which is why a lot of the times, you know, when people make great suggestions for lecture topics,

696
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:35,400
like, I don't act on them because like, I have no reason, I'm not into it. Like someone's like,

697
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,240
oh man, this is like such a great lecture on anamorphosis, you got to do K Apple Gates

698
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:45,160
Everworld series next. I'm like, yeah, never read it. Never read it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's

699
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:51,400
just like, like, like, it has to, it basically has to be something that like we're already interested

700
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:57,160
in that we've already spent like our life, you know, thinking about and reading about and we,

701
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,040
you know, like, to do a lecture, I mean, I guess you could just like go look up something you've

702
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,920
never heard of, like, like do some research and present a lecture on like you could do that.

703
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,320
Yeah. But like, it wouldn't be different. Yeah, we totally know what makes the lectures

704
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:17,000
are like good is like the tangible details. And a lot of those, I mean, we were saying that the

705
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,960
other day, it takes a lifetime to prepare for a lecture, and then 30 minutes to like, you know,

706
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,200
arrange the board, or whatever, you know, actually hours, but you know what I'm saying.

707
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,640
And like, it's the tangible details that like, for example, I mean, I'll just say I'm doing one

708
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:37,880
piece, you'll be out by now, you'll see it. Like if you hadn't read the SPS's, there's so many

709
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,600
amazing details that like as I'm going through an editing right now, yeah, that's like, that's a big

710
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,200
little details that people don't know. Like the fact that Sanji doesn't get burned by his fiery

711
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:54,680
Diomeli Jambi technique, because canonically, while his leg is hot, his heart burns hotter. So

712
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:59,480
that doesn't even make sense, but it's the exploration. And it's great. Yeah, that's the

713
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:08,680
kind of shit in my mind that makes the lectures good. Definitely. Man, great stuff. I want,

714
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:16,200
I want the Kokoro Wish. I think Kokoro Wish is just as interesting as, say, Tails, I think

715
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:21,560
Kokoro Wish deserves to do as well as Tails gets trolled. It might not because of like comparable.

716
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:27,560
It might not because of lower name recognition. Would you say Kokoro Wish doing well is your

717
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:35,400
Kokoro Wish right now? Yeah, I would say so. Yeah, I would say so. Definitely. I don't know.

718
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,360
Shit, I feel like I had more to say about that, but I've kind of, I've kind of lost the thread.

719
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,320
No matter. No matter. I don't know. We've been talking about that for a while. We can go to the

720
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,640
voicemails if you want. I was gonna say about the mini lectures. I feel like people tell me to do

721
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,560
Oolulilia. I would do, I had kind of thought maybe I could cram in Oolulilia into Radcon 4.

722
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:00,280
It didn't work out, but I think that that would be a short lecture. I think it might be under an hour

723
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:08,120
because, I mean, I focus on like the work that they've done. Like, I can talk about Oolulilia

724
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,920
and how he's like a weird guy with OCD and all these like strange personal habits,

725
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,040
but it doesn't really take that long to explain. I would mostly be talking about his books,

726
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:23,080
and he's written two books, and they're pretty simple, and they wouldn't take like a huge amount

727
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:28,120
of time to like summarize. You know, they've got their funny moments. They've got their funny,

728
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,360
funny bits in there. Yeah, that's the stuff people want to hear. I think it's worth doing.

729
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:38,280
Oh yeah, yeah, I would do it, and at Radcon 5 I probably will, but it'll be short. It won't be

730
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,240
like a two hour lecture. I've heard suggestions for like a budget. I mean, I'm interested in what

731
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,680
people are, you know, want to hear and stuff. Like somebody the other day, because I think I was

732
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,720
on stream and I just said, I was talking about how much I love Legend of Dragoon. Someone's like,

733
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:53,880
do a Legend of Dragoon lecture. I was like, okay, I mean, first of all, Legend of Dragoon does have

734
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,720
some cool lore. We're talking about one game. Yeah. And there is some cool stuff about like,

735
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,920
did you know, I just learned this the other day, that apparently Dart was like the next character

736
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:11,960
being considered to be included in the PlayStation All-Stars right before the game got like canned

737
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,800
and they stopped making like new characters for it. That would have been wild. That's too bad,

738
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:21,400
because that was the one character I was really hoping to see is maybe a preference to like a

739
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,800
revival of the series, because I really do love that game and stuff. But I mean, and then there's

740
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,120
other ones like, I mean, Metal Gear, people have suggested, now that would probably be better,

741
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,880
because there's lots of crazy lore in there. And like the real life drama and stuff,

742
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,160
that could be pretty interesting. But I mean, yeah, it depends on how you want to do it. But

743
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,960
I mean, who knows the real lore of like the first two Metal Gear games, something about Gray Fox,

744
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:48,520
you fight him, Big Boss, Zanzibar, I don't fucking know. Metal Gear is a good, is a pretty good one.

745
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:55,000
It's a good idea. Yeah, like the thing about the lecture, I think the lectures are, they benefit

746
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,360
if the thing you're talking about is something that you could, that you would benefit from additional

747
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:05,080
context for other than if you just, like if you just play a Dragoon, you would know everything

748
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,120
there was to know about Dragoon. Like Kokoro Wish and stuff, it's like, well, there's like,

749
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:16,760
there's context about the author that helps, that is interesting and informs the work.

750
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,040
Michelle just made the best fucking tweet I've ever seen in my life.

751
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:27,960
Did she? What is it? Did you see, yesterday I posted a tweet that said three stage evolution,

752
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,080
and it was my three faces from the three radcons. Yeah, yeah. And how I've, I look way different

753
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:42,040
in everyone. She just tweeted three pictures of a spinel. There's like pre, pre, like happy

754
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:49,080
spinel, like sad spinel from the garden, and then like, like evil spinel. Yeah. That's supposed to

755
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:55,080
parallel my journey, and I think it is pretty much accurate. That's good. Way to go, Michelle.

756
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:01,240
Okay, okay. I think I'm done. I think I'm done talking about that.

757
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,880
I'm pretty, I'm pretty tapped in general. We could just move on to voicemails now,

758
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,960
if you want. We got them. That's fine. Yeah. Okay, let's do it. Let me see. Got them pulled

759
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:17,320
up right here. Okay, everybody, of course, you know, go down and click on the link to the speed.

760
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,960
Wait, I want to very briefly, I do want to expand on something that I mentioned last time.

761
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:27,640
Last episode, I said some stuff about how I thought makeup was cool. On reflection,

762
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:34,920
I think what that is, is that I just like the idea of being like an edgy goth teen and wearing

763
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,120
eyeshadow. I think, I think just being goth is what I like about it. Hashtag not gay.

764
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:46,520
I think they, I think that was the appeal on further reflection. Okay, fair enough. Just for

765
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,760
me to quickly mention something. I just want to be the front man of an emo band. I disavowed

766
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,800
everything I said about Droom Eternal last week. Droom Eternal is great. I love it now.

767
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,520
Oh, yeah. I wanted to mention that because I saw you change your mind about that or say something

768
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,200
online about how much you like DOOM Eternal. What sounds like, I mean, you got to the end. I'm

769
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,800
right before the last area. You had some issues with the last boss and stuff or whatever. I still

770
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:11,400
think boss fights aren't that great. Sure. Because I have a whole video coming out in like two days.

771
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,800
Do you like waiting for the Marauders eyes to flash before you can shoot the fucking axe, man?

772
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,320
The Marauders didn't kill me once. I don't know what everyone's bitching about. What? Oh my god,

773
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,440
I died so many fucking times to those guys. I'm playing, I'm playing on normal though. I know

774
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,760
everyone is playing on ultra violence. I'm not. I'm playing, I'm playing on not easy,

775
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,120
the one above it that looked hard enough. So that's probably the same as you. Yeah. Yeah.

776
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,480
I've killed, I killed all the Marauders without ever dying to them once and I felt like a god

777
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:41,080
because of it. Shocking, based. Well, yeah, you're good. You do video games, clearly.

778
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:47,880
He is video games, you fucking idiot. Courses through my veins. So what changed your opinion?

779
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,720
Game stops in essential service. I remember we talked about how I like to talk to my

780
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,640
Twitter and you didn't like it. What changed? I'm going to change my Twitter handle to Game

781
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:03,800
Stop is an essential service. Good idea. Great idea. So tell me, Tom, what was your thought

782
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:11,160
process? Well, you can, I'll have a link to the I Am Games video that goes over everything in the

783
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,040
description when it's up because at this time recording it's not. But it's just like coming

784
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:22,360
to grips with, OK, the first thing that I realized that I did not know for the first like three or

785
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,480
four levels is that unlike Doom 2016, the chainsaw is constantly recharging. So you almost always

786
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,560
have at least one charge. Oh, I didn't even know that. OK. And that changes the entire dynamic

787
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:38,440
of the game because in 2016 you hold on to your chainsaw charges unless you really need ammo or

788
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:43,320
if you want to take down big enemies. But in this game, like because your ammo capacity is so much

789
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:50,280
lower, you're supposed to be chainsawing constantly. So I noticed that the whole flow of the game

790
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,080
starts to click because you're like, oh, that's why there's ads in every encounter because

791
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,720
they're ammo boxes with legs. I get it now. Yeah, that's true. I noticed in one of the loading

792
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,880
screens, it specifically said there's like a four, it's like a list that's like, OK, like,

793
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,920
well, I forget what it's called. But what's it called? When they glow yellow and you do a kill,

794
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:16,120
get health. Brutal. Yeah, like it's like a brutal kill for for HP, you know, like flamethrower

795
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:21,560
for armor, chainsaw for ammo, and then like bloody punch or whatever to build up whatever the I

796
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,640
don't know whatever the fuck it is. Actually, you you do brutal kills to build up your bloody punch.

797
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:29,320
So like they're they're clearly they're trying to get you into a flow of using these like in

798
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,880
rotation to keep all your stats up and keep your health up. You need to use everything. I really

799
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,760
enjoyed that. And once you do, OK, the best fucking thing, like the game basically becomes

800
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,600
first person Devil May Cry once you have everything unlocked, because like you can like

801
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,360
double jump and then double dash and then meat hook all the way across and like,

802
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,800
then like super shock on someone in the face, turn him into Gibbs, then you land and turn

803
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,440
around and you can blood punch and they turn into Gibbs. It just you can make an encounter just a

804
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:01,480
nonstop sequence of increasingly cathartic violence. And it's 10 out of 10. It's great.

805
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,880
Except for the parts that are awesome. What's your favorite weapon? Just a curiosity.

806
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,400
Dude, the meat hook and the super shock and so good. Yeah, it's good shit.

807
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:16,280
Like I I feel I feel a little bad. I feel like I'm missing out not playing Animal Crossing during

808
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,600
the the quarantine. I also want to play it, but I haven't been Doom yet. My my roommate has it and

809
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,640
like I could play it if I wanted to. But like, I don't know, on the one hand, like it's such a

810
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:32,600
time sink. Yeah, on the other hand, but like everyone on Twitter is doing it. And it's like

811
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:39,400
it's someone said that like us play like it's the opposite energy from that one summer where

812
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:45,000
everyone was out playing Pokemon Go. It's very now is everyone is at home playing Animal Crossing.

813
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,920
Hey, I heard though, this may be of interest to you if you're considering playing on on someone

814
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:54,360
else's switch specifically, because I heard that like there's only one island per switch. So even

815
01:13:54,360 --> 01:14:00,040
if you made an account, you'd have to like share the land with that person. What? That's why I heard

816
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:05,640
a different account that doesn't that's that was like an annoying thing that like Nintendo,

817
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,360
I don't know. They I don't even know what the point of it is. That would be very weird if true.

818
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,120
I haven't explored it, but that's what I had heard and it made me dubious because me and

819
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,640
Michelle were thinking of getting it and splitting it. I was planning on getting Animal Crossing

820
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,640
now that I'm done with Doom. But then I watched Jim Sterling video on it and he said that there's

821
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,280
item degradation and items break out the time. And that made me not want to play it anymore.

822
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,360
Like what? Like your chairs and your furniture and shit? Just like, I don't know. They're just

823
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:35,640
like, he's just said like, yeah, there's like your, your like, your tools, your tools all break

824
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:41,480
and shit. I'm like, I'm not fucking with that shit. Maybe I'll play. That's not, that's not so

825
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,480
bad, though, because those can be replenished. And none of those are, you don't get like legendary,

826
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,320
like golden shovel or something. His like, his, his, his video basically broke it down to saying

827
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,200
that like Animal Crossing has always been like a grindy game, which I'm already not a huge

828
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,080
fan of, but he's like, Nintendo just makes everything more grindy in this one. And I'm just

829
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,880
like, I'm out. The point of Animal Crossing is the grind. Right. Which is why I've never played

830
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,880
an Animal Crossing game and why apparently now I definitely never will. Sure. Sure. What's a shame?

831
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,440
The guys are, what, what if you shipped Isabelle and Doom guy? Cause what if game was in same game?

832
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:23,960
Oh God. Yes. I'm coming. What if Gabe and Tycho found themselves trapped inside their favorite

833
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,720
video games? I don't even want to think about that. All right. Let's, let's do voicemails. We got

834
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,920
voicemails over here. Yeah. Let's do it. Gamer news covered. All right. As we said, speak pipe,

835
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,920
link in the description, leave us voicemails. If they're good, we'll play them. That's what you

836
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:47,160
get. Okay. First up, we've got Girona question as a corona question, I assume. Let's hear what he

837
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:53,240
has to say. Okay. On the count of three, hit play. One, two, three, go. Ayo, shots out to all my

838
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:58,520
needs out there hooping on this living in pod, eating bud, wave for a minute before this corona

839
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:05,800
quarantine should happen. My question to the PC people is, what's the most unexpected difference

840
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,800
or like alteration that you've noticed in your life as a result of like this quarantine or like

841
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:17,640
just Girona panic in general? Make sure y'all stay safe out there and keep sipping on that pure

842
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:26,040
out piece. Just sit back in a nice bubble bath and a tall flute full of a hand sanitizer.

843
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,880
I think we've, I think we touched on this already. The biggest difference for me is not that I'm

844
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,800
doing anything differently, just that I feel worse about it. Yeah, I pretty much agree.

845
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:44,120
Cool. I love to feel bad and it's been a great excuse. Oh, well, actually,

846
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:50,360
my roommates are all home more now. They're all like working from home more or just not able

847
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:55,160
to work because of it. And the result is that there's more, they're playing board games all the

848
01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:00,920
time. And I've been playing some more of those occasionally, not that often, but once in a

849
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,720
while. So yeah, I guess that is a little different. Playing a game called Gloomhaven.

850
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:11,160
I've wanted that one. I want to try that. I haven't played it, but I've heard good things.

851
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:18,520
It is, Gloomhaven is weird. It's like, it's, it's like continuous. Like you buy Gloomhaven and you

852
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:24,440
don't like play discrete games of it. Like every time you play it, you like change the, like the

853
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:29,160
game itself, like it comes with this big map. And when you like do missions in the game, you might

854
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,720
unlock like a new area and then you'll take a sticker and like put it on them. Like you'll

855
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:40,040
uncover a new area and you unlock classes by like fulfilling quests with your current classes.

856
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:47,640
I, the character, the only character I have played thus far is a, he is a little psychic ratman.

857
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,080
Actually, this is funny. Sounds like you, man. Yeah, he's a little psychic ratman from the sewers.

858
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:59,480
And he basically, he basically, he kind of like just kind of skulks around and he like tries to,

859
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,400
he like in limited ways, like mind controls enemies, like makes them attack each other or

860
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:10,120
makes them move or makes them do stuff. I'm pretty bad at it, to be honest. But his,

861
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:17,160
his, his quests that I drew randomly is to, he wants gold. He just wants to accrue 200 gold.

862
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,520
And that's, once he does that, he'll have unlocked a new class by

863
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,040
finally afford that operation.

864
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,200
And, but so, so in encounters, like everyone else, like everyone else would be like, oh,

865
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,240
okay, I'm going to heal the party. Oh, okay, I'm going to like stun everyone. So they can,

866
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:38,360
okay, oh, I'm going to like get, hey, guys, move everyone into arrangement. Guys, be sure to like

867
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,200
move, don't go here, don't go here. I'm going to do a big AoE attack. I'm going to like, I'm going to,

868
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,760
you know, like, like do crowd control. And I'm like, I'm just going to let you guys do that.

869
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,240
And I'm going to like hang in the back room and like loot everything. Like fuck, fuck that,

870
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,720
like fuck the enemies. I just want money. I'm just here to get money. I will help you if it's

871
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:01,400
convenient for me. And you know what, it's fine. It's fine because if I unlock that quest, everyone

872
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:07,480
benefits, right? Good. Yeah, sure, sure. Makes sense. Yeah, that's my goal. Also, I named, I have a

873
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:15,560
backstory for my rat. I named him target practice because the idea is that he was like a little,

874
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,520
like freak, like in like a city or something, like in the sewer drains or whatever. And like the

875
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:25,080
local kids, whenever they'd see him, they would throw shit at him because he's gross. But he didn't

876
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,960
like speak English well. So he would hear them say, they would yell target practice as they threw

877
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:36,280
things at him. And he thought it was his name. That's charming. Thank you. I like that. It never

878
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:42,280
comes up in game, but I thought it was cute. In answer to the guy's question, not much is changed.

879
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:46,280
But soon he'll have 200 gold and he'll be able to buy and sell all those kids on the black market.

880
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:51,000
That'll be great. We're all looking forward to that. Not much. I've done a little more socializing

881
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,080
in the sense that my sister came to visit and she was here for two days and that was very nice.

882
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,760
Grace is a cool girl. Fun to hang out with. You're a dog. You're a dog and I'm sick of it.

883
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,840
And that was her claim to fame. Other than that, nothing's changed.

884
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:09,000
Yep. That's it. Based. Tom, any changes for you? Notable. No. Unexpected. Just

885
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:19,240
doing the same old, same old, but it's more annoying because things I can't, I got to worry

886
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:23,800
about wiping my ass apparently. I'll tell you, I'm running a little low on toilet paper. I'm

887
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,320
hoping there's going to be some in the store. That's the worst part is now I got to wipe my ass.

888
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,160
Never had to do that before. All of a sudden it became a big deal.

889
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,600
Everyone's shaming me on Twitter for not wiping my ass now that there's a pandemic going on.

890
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,800
Everyone's bitching about toilet paper. I'm just like Amazon.com, get a bidet.

891
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,640
Where in the constitution does it say I have to wipe my ass?

892
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,360
Negative rights or positive rights? Fucking big government.

893
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,920
All right. Let's go on to our next question here. This is from the unironic gang weed guy,

894
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:05,160
KK Corona with another K. How fun. All right. Let's check it out on the count of three. One,

895
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:12,680
two, three, go. Hey, PCP. It's everyone's favorite original voicemail character,

896
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:21,720
the unironic gang weed guy here to talk to you sheep out there. You normies think you have it

897
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:28,600
so bad because of social distancing. You celebrities having mental breakdowns in your

898
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:36,520
multi-million dollar mansions while we suffer. Bitch, please. This is what we introverted

899
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:44,600
enlightened version gang weed gamers deal with every single day, bitch. Gang weeders rise up.

900
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:52,360
The joke's on you. There you have it. I mean, just hard agree.

901
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:59,480
That's all there's to say. I saw a comic posted on Twitter by Ethan Cool. You know Ethan Cool?

902
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,480
Don't think so. Ethan with an EA at the beginning for some reason. Don't know.

903
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:11,880
He's cool. He's an animator. But he posted a comic that's like it's like a little neighborhood

904
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:17,800
being attacked by face eating reptile mantis people. And the news is like stay indoors,

905
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,640
stay indoors, world in peril. And his mom's got a shotgun and she's like I'm going out for groceries

906
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:30,120
now and the gamer kid is like stay inside. Don't mind if I do, right? Gamer heads, level up.

907
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:40,760
Someone's getting devoured out of the window. I laughed. I lulled. Oh, I'm lulling. All right,

908
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:46,840
let's move on to our next voicemail. Here we go. We've got a three-parter. This is from the Scooby-Doo

909
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,600
Mystery Murder Files presented by Rhythm I Asked Back. I'm a bit of a murder file myself,

910
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:58,680
if you know what I mean. Indeed, indeed. All right, let's listen to our intro track here

911
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:06,360
on the count of three. Here we go. One, two, three, go. Hello, it's me, your host. Holy,

912
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:11,720
not gone, Trump. You may call me the interviewer. You're probably asking yourself right now,

913
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,040
what the fuck have I gotten myself into? Well, let me tell you,

914
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:22,760
Bucco, you are about to listen to the best voicemail series ever. It's the best because it's hosted

915
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:30,600
by me. Holy, not Donald Trump. I have the best voicemails. Okay, let me lay it down for you.

916
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:36,920
Every week, I'll interview one of Scooby-Doo's victims, then Scooby-Doo himself, a fairness

917
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:44,440
or something. Okay. Also, viewers, aka the PTP, they're free to ask any questions on the

918
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:50,520
podcast. I'll answer them the following week. Don't come yet, the show is about to start.

919
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:59,240
Right the fuck now. All right, totally not Donald Trump. What's that? I have one question

920
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,240
right off the bat, which is how do you interview, if this is a murder mystery, how do you interview

921
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:09,480
Scooby-Doo's victims? Aren't they murdered? Presumably, not every victim is specifically

922
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:13,320
murder. Unless they're ghosts. Unless they're ghosts because it's Scooby-Doo and they like ghosts.

923
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,720
Well, that's true. That's true. That's gotta be it. There's your answer. All right, well,

924
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,680
let's listen up because we've got the creeper, not the Minecraft one, as they understand it,

925
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,680
but the Scooby-Doo one, who is a distinct guy, although he's also green. All right,

926
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,200
let's hear what he has to say. Here we go. One, two, three, go.

927
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:37,880
Welcome to the Scooby-Doo Mystery Biles. Our interviewee today is the creeper,

928
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:45,240
or do you prefer Mr. Creep? Creeper. Creeper, it is then. Now, could you tell us a little bit about

929
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:52,440
Scooby-Doo? Creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper. I see. You're saying Scooby-Doo

930
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,720
gave you the TSD so badly that that's why you have to talk in this way.

931
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:03,000
Creeper, creeper, creeper. What exactly did he do to traumatize you so much?

932
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:09,640
Creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper. He raped you in the butt. He must have been

933
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:17,880
paid for considering his massive doggy dump. Creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper,

934
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:24,840
creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper. He used his tail to rape your mouth simultaneously. You say

935
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,360
where it makes sense to die until you're coming and enjoying in the raping. It seems

936
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:42,840
to make the same circus. Creeper, creeper, creeper. I understand. It's hard. Some things are too

937
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:49,240
difficult to talk about. Creeper, creeper. Thank you for your time, creeper. Okay, there you go.

938
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:56,280
Thanks. Well, Trump. Now we know. It's totally not Trump though. It's not Trump. It's definitely

939
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:03,240
totally not. No, you're right. You're right. All right, let's check in with the rapist. Let's see

940
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:07,880
what Scooby has to say. All right, here we go. We gotta get both sides. We need to hear both sides

941
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,680
of this story. That's right. This is balanced, fair and balanced news always. Okay, here we go.

942
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:19,000
One, two, three, go. So, Scooby-Doo, we just got done talking to that creeper. Can you tell me

943
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:26,120
anything about what you did to that creeper? I raped him in the butt. He was real nice. Yeah?

944
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:31,880
Why did you rape him in the butt? We weren't just going to rob him, but then we found out he had no

945
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:38,040
money. Me and Donnie raped him in the butt to punish him. His wrath was real nice and tight.

946
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:42,840
Must have been a origin. It's hard to listen to. It's the first time you met Donnie,

947
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:47,880
wretch, but I'm sure it won't be the rest. It might be the times when you pick up on these days,

948
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:55,240
but he would enjoy your ass, waste or interviewer. I don't think you or Donnie will be getting any of

949
01:26:55,240 --> 01:27:02,440
my booty anytime soon. I see you like to play horrible wretch or don't kid care of you. Enough

950
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:08,440
of that. Why did you leave the creeper alive? Too little time. Not enough fucking. Be shocked.

951
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:13,880
The cops showed up. And with that, that was just one of the other poll shows who lost its innocence

952
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:20,200
to the pause of Scooby-Doo. Next time, we meet another poll show on the Scooby-Doo mystery

953
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:30,280
modifiers. Same PCP time. Same PCP channel. There you have it. Episode one. Thank you,

954
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:34,440
interviewer. Good luck not getting raped. What an unfortunate state of affairs.

955
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:44,360
Yeah. This is not good that this is happening, but it is. Maybe big government can save us from

956
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,400
this as it can with all our problems. I can't think of any other mechanism that stands a

957
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:59,960
chance, frankly, about dealing with this travesty. More to come next week. Thoughts and prayers

958
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:05,880
for creeper. Yeah. He didn't ask for this, but we did spook those kids, so maybe he deserves it.

959
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:11,720
A popular opinion? He deserved it? Funny, funny. You know, we said we had to hear both sides of

960
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:17,880
the story, but they were pretty much the same. I committed a rape. I was raped. Yeah. I mean,

961
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,880
this is locking key right there. It checks out. Yeah, it does. It's credible. It's credible.

962
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:32,040
In a word, credible. Yeah. All right. Let's go to our final voicemail of the day, and we really

963
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,440
got to set this one up. All right. This is the one we've been waiting for. This is important.

964
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:43,160
This is a humble, Ugandan interviewer who has a series of pointed questions for the PCP,

965
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,720
and you guys need to pay attention, listen up, and get serious, because this is important.

966
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:51,640
Okay. So you're ready? All right. Here we go. Count three. Here we go. You got an interviewer,

967
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:57,880
take it away. One, two, three, go. Why are you gay? Thanks for this, everybody. That's the end

968
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:05,480
of the PCP episode for this week. Wait, I have an essay. I have a thesis written on this topic.

969
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:20,360
That's it. How did you read my Google Docs? I read the script of this episode. They're all

970
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:25,400
pre-prepared. This is a fake. We're tricking you. This is a friendship simulator in every sense.

971
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:32,920
It's all been carefully formulated. It's a focus group. Indeed. These are the optimal choices made

972
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:38,600
on every episode to optimize enjoyment and monetary returns. We're surging. Jesus Christ,

973
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:45,960
we need to get a sponsor immediately. We're surging. Yeah, yeah. We just had a rapist on our

974
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,640
show. Can't wait. The sponsorships are going to start rolling in. The viewers love it. It's hard

975
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:55,800
hitting journalism, goddammit. We neither confirm nor deny our support of rape. Please sponsor us.

976
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:02,920
Ray-Band headphones or whatever. It's Ray-Khan. You got to use the right names. Ray-Band sunglasses.

977
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,720
Also them. That's cool. I'm down for that. Anyway, leave your voicemails, everybody,

978
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:11,720
on the Speak Pipe link down below. There was a mere pittance this time, and that's perfectly fine.

979
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,760
If you want to leave them, go ahead. We'll check them out. This is decent. Yeah, this is fine.

980
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,400
This is a good number. I got no problem with that. That's it, everybody. That's it for this episode

981
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:27,000
of the Procrastinators podcast. We'll be back next week with another episode. In the meantime,

982
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,640
support the show and get bonus episodes. Oh, there will be a bonus episode out by the time you hear

983
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:37,560
this. Most likely. We have not recorded it yet. Whoops. I forgot about those. I forgot about those.

984
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:43,160
Shit. Patreon.com slash The Procrastinators. I'm sure it'll be great. You can count on that.

985
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:48,840
There will be like 36 fucking ones by the time you hear this. There's good. There's gold in them

986
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:53,320
hills. Indeed, indeed. So even if we can't think of anything good to do for this one,

987
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,560
even if we just slap this one together and shit it out, you know, it's fine. There's other gold

988
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:03,240
in there. No doubt. It'll average out to be good because of all the other good ones. Indeed, indeed.

989
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:09,240
Maybe we'll play Animal Crossing. Watch, go back. I laugh every time I remember the time when we

990
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:15,000
played poker and I c***. That bonus episode. Oh, shit. Spoilers. I spoiled it. Oh, you ruined it

991
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,920
for everybody. Bleep that out, Eleazar. Bleep it out. Bleep it out. It was funny. It was funny.

992
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:24,280
It was funny. That's my favorite. Of course, follow the news, updates, any Twitter posts.

993
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:28,840
Look, there's lots of rad content still coming out from Radcon 4 on the Twitter. So follow

994
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:33,320
at TPCrastinators. It all gets retweeted there and more news and updates. I've been seeing on the

995
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:39,240
Twitter like PCP, like highlight moments. Is that new? Oh, that's right. Of course. I'm so glad

996
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:43,480
you mentioned that. I forgot. Eleazar, at his suggestion, was like, hey, Nate, we should bring

997
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:48,040
back the PCB highlights. And I was like, yeah, so we all talked, we agreed. And so Eleazar has

998
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:52,840
been making little highlight bits on the PCP highlights channel, which there will be a link

999
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:57,720
to and you should go subscribe to because we're going to now, at least monthly, release more

1000
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:03,320
PCB highlights of some of the best moments of the PCP historically. We've already got Nate's

1001
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:09,320
legendary roller coaster story and his, I don't want to be a cog in the machine. We've got Ben's

1002
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,880
Molly doing story. There's a bunch of other ones on there. There's the elephant masturbation

1003
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:20,040
discussion. I'm actually going to give that one a retweet. Please do. That's relevant to my content.

1004
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,880
And we're going to try to get more from everybody and have a good spread. Eleazar is the man in

1005
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:30,680
charge. So if you're in the PCP patron discord, there is like a highlights channel in there.

1006
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:35,080
Go post in there moments. You want to see highlighted and Eleazar will be looking there.

1007
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:40,680
That would be great because I don't fucking remember. There's a lot of episodes. This is a show

1008
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:46,120
to you guys, but this is just our life and it all blends together. Yeah, please. If there's like

1009
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:50,920
moments like, oh, that was really funny. That is a thing that sticks out in my memory. Just tell

1010
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:57,560
Eleazar, go in the patron lounge, be like, we need a highlight of this. Eleazar, this is good shit.

1011
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:02,760
I think his name's at Facundo on Twitter, but put your link in the description Eleazar for

1012
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,360
Twitter. If you want people, maybe you don't want people to. But for people to give you suggestions

1013
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:11,080
for highlights, he's the man in charge. So that would be a good thing to do. But yeah,

1014
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,640
more coming. We just released like four new ones. And yeah, we're going to try to get some.

1015
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:21,800
I don't think he's Facundo. That might take his name on like discord or whatever it is. He's got

1016
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:26,760
a name on discord or on Twitter. I'm sure he'll post it for your viewing pleasure. It'll be in

1017
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:31,880
the show notes, I'm sure. Okay, there you go. So more highlights are coming and we're going to make

1018
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,560
more. Give us suggestions. We love them and they're a great idea. And we want to get that

1019
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:40,440
channel to 1000 subs already so we can make money off of them already. Jesus Christ.

1020
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:45,720
BASED. Absolutely, absolutely fucking based. We've got to merchandise, man. With a podcast,

1021
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:49,960
you've got to have highlights. You've got to have, I don't know, fucking merch and stuff. Jesus Christ,

1022
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,120
let's make some money here. It's time to go. Let's do this thing. All right, there you go.

1023
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,720
So more stuff coming. Add to your crossings on Twitter. Updates and whatnot. My lecture will

1024
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:04,280
be out by the time you hear this. I have no doubt at this point, it's very close to done already.

1025
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:08,920
We'll see if that comes true. And more stuff coming. We've got a lot more. More lectures,

1026
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:13,720
more content, the big stuff working on, a certain diss track. We'll be getting together pretty soon

1027
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:19,320
and you'll see that in your sub box when it stays. So there you go. I'm excited for all of us.

1028
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,960
All right, that's it. See you next week, everybody. More PCP.

1029
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:27,000
Eventually. There you go. All right, see you then. Bye.
