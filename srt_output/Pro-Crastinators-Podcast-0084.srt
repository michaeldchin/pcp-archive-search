1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
It's me, it's Future Munchy. It was kind of right here. We have Future Hippocrit, any PCP.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,880
It's me.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,600
Okay, we just want to stress real quick here. We're scared baby cowards. We are good people.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,920
We are the good guys in this situation. We represent wholesome intellectual values,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,800
and we have nothing against people. If you look bad or are ugly, we don't hate you.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,720
Yeah, the things that go on in this podcast will make you cry. It doesn't matter who you are.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,280
So the thoughts and feelings and words said by me and Munchy do not reflect the thoughts,

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,960
feelings of me and Munchy. We were joking. It was a robot. It was someone else.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,600
Yeah, it was a clone. It was an evil twin. It was a badass. He was a really cool guy,

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:03,440
and he upstayed just in every way. I believe everything that I said, but I said it in a mean

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,120
way, probably. I felt like it was unfair. It's just a trigger warning. Just don't kill me.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,760
Just please don't kill me. I don't want to die. I like you, all of you good guys, all of you

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:27,280
men and women, and all the other ones shout out to those guys. We're on your side. I am the biggest

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,760
liberal cuck of anyone to ever exist. Martin Luther King Jr., shit, he's gone. Get rid of him. Bye.

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,920
It's me now. I'm on your side just a little bit of intellectual curiosity. Just putting words

16
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:53,360
out there. Just a little bit of an idea. I'm going to die. I will be dead. I will be dead.

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,800
Anyway, enjoy the podcast. Just remember, everyone else is evil, not us. That's why we're doing this.

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,880
We are the good guys. Everyone else is bad guys. If everyone's transphobic, I just throw it on

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:15,120
everyone else. We aren't bad. We promise. Don't kill me. Hello, everyone, and welcome to another

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,160
episode of the Procrastinators podcast. I am the best guy ever, and this is the PCP. We're a bunch

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,520
of internet people get together. We all make stuff here, and here is us talking about it. We're joined

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,640
today by Ben St.

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Hippocrite is here. Hippocrite, everyone. Sorry, I was saluting the flag of whatever that song was.

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
What song is that? I don't know. I guess it's probably Scottish, because in my head it's not

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
played on the bagpipes. It does sound like bagpipes. Okay, Munchy, where's Tiny Hats?

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,560
I just got back from Papua New Guinea. I've been spending my entire, the past 10 years with a

27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,040
native tribe, and they've taught me wisdoms you wouldn't even able to be comprehending with your

28
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,120
dumbass white boy brain. They taught me secrets such as don't look at the sun and also play in dirt.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,720
It's fun. So I'm here to spread these invaluable truths with the population. Did all their lessons

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:30,000
rhyme like that? Oh, they talk exclusively in rhymes. Dr. Seuss is a black aboriginal.

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,080
And we're also joined by Tom Oliver. Yeah.

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,760
Okay, well, speaking of African places that we just came back from, which is the topic of this

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,920
video, I just came back from Nejair. Nejair, that's how I think it's pronounced. Funnily enough,

34
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,800
I actually wrote down for a school test. Am I in trouble now? I wrote down for a school test,

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,640
I wrote down nigger instead of Niger on an actual test that I put in. What are they going to do?

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,720
What are they going to do? No, they gave me full credit that there's actually no penalty.

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,200
They gave you a gold star. You actually get bonus credit, bonus. You're right. Okay. Can I tell my

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,000
n-word story? No, no, because we don't know what this topic is. We're lost in the fucking dark.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
We need to be guided by African countries that we're not allowed to go to, right? We need a

40
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,720
dictionary of non-rule descent to guide us. Here's what we got. Here's what we got for you,

41
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
everybody. The topic for today is things you're not allowed to say. Things kind of like George

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,640
Carlin's old skit about the seven words you're not allowed to say on television. It's that sort

43
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,040
of thing. It's a little bit broader here. And it's kind of a broad topic. There's no

44
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,320
one urban dictionary definition that really fits this. I tried searching for a bad word.

45
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,280
That's what I found. There was a definition here. The first one's just a list of swears not supposed

46
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,720
to say, ass fuck bitch, skank slut, asshole, ass wipe, cunt, hoe, whore, bitch, ass, damn. But then

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,080
there's a little definition. That was weak. It was very weak. And here's the longer definition.

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
Words that are said in order to make someone or something look or feel bad, cursing is a type

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,040
of bad word usage. Okay. That's like, okay, but we're going broader than just bad words here.

50
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,240
There's no definition here. There's no bad ideas of which Nate is full of.

51
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Of course. But Ben wanted to tell his n-word story. What do you got for us, Ben?

52
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Well, it's, I might have told it before, but I'll tell it again here. When I was like,

53
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,040
I was probably in like fourth grade or something. And remember how our parents used to,

54
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,840
used to cruelly and inhumanely leave us at like an after school program while they were at work?

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,640
Oh, of course. That's unfortunate. Yeah, yeah.

56
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
Stephen Mullenew would be very upset if he heard this. He would be very upset.

57
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,240
And I remember I had, I had a black friend when I was like in elementary school.

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,520
This just gets worse and worse. Yeah, yeah, the problems all started here.

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,080
And we had like a little electronic, like digital dictionary. It was like a little like toy thing

60
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,080
where you could look up words in this like little database. And he was like, oh, look up,

61
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,640
look up this word. And he types in n-i-g-e-r. And I'm like, what, and it's like,

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,560
doesn't find the word. And I'm like, oh, what's that? And he's like, oh, I guess it doesn't

63
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,600
know the word, but it's a bad word for black people. And I was like, oh, okay. And that's how

64
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,840
I learned about that word. Did you try putting in n-i-g-g-e-r or anything?

65
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
I don't, I think he, yeah, I think he then was like, oh, wait, wait, wait. And then he tried it

66
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
with two Gs. And it also did not, it also did not return anything because of course it fucking

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,360
wouldn't because this was like a fucking toy kids dictionary on a fucking little micro computer.

68
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,560
Dude, I didn't see the guy who programmed that in. Like, I wonder, they got to learn somehow.

69
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Just type that. You know, it's a funny thing though, us like adults policing what kids

70
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,120
shouldn't, shouldn't know as like just, just words that exist. Even it's like, I guess specifically

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,480
with like racial slurs, it's like we don't, the concept of the racial slur comes with a lot of

72
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,760
baggage that we just don't want children to have. Like we don't want kids to like differentiate

73
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,320
between racial groups because not a lot of good comes from doing so. So I guess I understand

74
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,920
like not wanting kids to hear that. Like when it comes to words like fuck and shit,

75
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,520
I don't really see the need to keep kids from hearing words like that. Yeah, I don't know. I

76
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,680
never have. I think the kids who do find out about it are then like they use it as currency to become

77
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,760
popular. That's true. And I guess if it wasn't those words, it would be something else.

78
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,560
As have I right now. Kids like hiding things from other kids to be like stupid and stuff.

79
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Here's my Jordan Peterson archetypal moment. Okay, that functions just like the story of

80
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,240
Adam and Eve, the forbidden fruit of knowledge, was actually just some sick ass swear words that

81
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,520
Eve found out from Satan himself. And Adam was like, yo, share that with me, bro. And then when

82
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,200
big daddy God found out, he was super pissed and he grounded them for life, which inspired the show

83
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,760
grounded for life. It was a big daddy God is actually the name of my first.

84
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,120
We found out that that that that Eve had taken by the apple. He wouldn't give them

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,080
Cummys anymore for like an entire big ordeal, which is why Adam had to make his own Cummys,

86
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,720
which inspired original sin. Oh my God, we figured it out.

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,160
Well, guys. Okay, so what do we this is like the concept of like forbidden knowledge almost

88
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,240
like bad words, like words themselves are simply tools like anything, right? Yes. So where

89
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,080
why do we get this whole idea? Yeah, what do you got? Well, I was gonna say, I have I have a thing

90
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,840
that you're not allowed to say, say like, especially on the internet, especially on a like a red

91
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,920
pill podcast like this. The idea that social justice isn't all that bad. And in fact, some of

92
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:08,080
them have a point. I have a point where I literally support not freedom of speech in this

93
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,640
scenario. Like like self policing. So well, self policing is very different from the kind of social

94
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,840
justice mob justice, you know, like, like social justice warriors are like stupid people who I

95
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,960
think are very funny. But social justice as like a thing is like, it's not a bad idea. Like,

96
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880
yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, on the on the face of it, it sounds pretty good, right?

97
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,760
Okay, I guess you're getting there with like, is that really like the racial slur thing? Or

98
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,040
like how we expect? It's just that the idea that I was bringing forth a thing that you're not allowed

99
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,720
to say on the internet. Okay, okay, that's your point. But like, you know, it's because like,

100
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,560
like the idea of like, policing it is stupid, like making sure like quotas and stuff. No,

101
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,840
you don't need that. But the idea that we got a character, should we have a woman character or

102
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,640
a black character or like a gay character? Like, yeah, yeah, sure. No, not if you want me to read

103
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,080
the correct answer is who cares? Yeah, like, why not? Why not be okay with it? I mean,

104
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,880
the yeah, yeah, it's just it's not really just so much as like the idea of normalizing it is like

105
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,720
completely harmless. Okay, here's here's my here's my quote unquote counter argument, which

106
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,400
isn't really a counter argument. But kind of is the reason I have no when when when these things

107
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,440
happen, there's like the social justice injections of like minorities and other shit into media.

108
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
My problem is never the fact that there's more more minority representation. It's always,

109
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,800
I know the reasoning behind it now because they pulled the curtain out way right and that's what

110
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,440
pisses me off because like, I know this wasn't a natural artistic development in the production

111
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,840
of this thing. Someone checked off some boxes. There's nothing wrong with making a character

112
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,160
a non white cis male. But in fact, in fact, I think it's it's nice. I do I like I like

113
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,840
the idea of representation in principle. But when it comes when it comes off as contrived,

114
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,320
then you've you've done I feel like you've done more damage. Yeah, or even if it's not contrived

115
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
when it comes off as like it when you feel that like what you're seeing there is not so much

116
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,280
an artistic, you know, expression as so much of like, like, micromanaging of a creator's desire,

117
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,920
like that's that just speaks to like, okay, well, we just want to create a specific example

118
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,240
that I'm going to talk about because I like I went to Germany recently and I was pitching a show.

119
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,480
This was a show I hadn't made. But yeah, a lot of the show characters, you know, are gay or like,

120
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,600
you know, race, many races in this, you know, but like, it's a fantasy. Is that hard to animate,

121
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Gibb? The fact that there's so many races, like that everyone's running all the time.

122
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:04,560
You know what I'm saying, dude. Okay, yeah. But like, I had no problem because like the way

123
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,960
that the story was written, because I was brought on to write with the story, I didn't write it,

124
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,440
obviously, about the the race and the gender, you know, stuff like it's not a show about

125
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,200
a woman being the main character. It's a show about, you know, cool shit. And a woman just

126
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
happens to be the main character. And I made my pitch and stuff. And then I the the person who

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,480
came directly after me was the complete wrong, like the opposite of like, you know, they had the

128
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,200
same sort of thing, just all that shit was like the focus. But yeah, they literally like their

129
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,520
whole pitch was like, every single social justice were a buzzword. And nothing about what the story

130
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,920
was or why we should give a shit about this show. Well, that's just that's exactly because it was

131
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,920
basically the same thing on the surface level. But nobody gave a shit, especially me. I was like,

132
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,040
why would you tell me about this show? This is this was the person that was pitching their show

133
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,840
after you. Yeah. Okay. And it was just about, I really wanted to show that, you know, women can

134
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,720
be main characters and represented blacks. I'm just I didn't even mention that in mine because

135
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,240
it was important. And it just annoyed me because that's my point basically entirely is when you

136
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,360
do this for the wrong reasons, like you're you're the integrity of the product isn't there because

137
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
there is none. Yeah, like what I would really want to see is like that person to like finish their

138
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,920
show, like at like display it to the public. And then like, if that show like tanks, because nobody

139
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,520
gives a shit about it, because all it does is like, that's kind of what you see with like this,

140
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,640
like right now, Marvel is pushing a lot of diversity in their comics and shit. And yeah,

141
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,600
exactly. And like the comic industry is doing very badly. People are turned off by it in a big

142
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,080
way. And they're being forced to reevaluate their position here. So it's like, the marketplace

143
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,040
does not support just ideological brow beating, you know, through through their comics, you know,

144
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,600
with something like the comics, changing the gender or the race of characters people know

145
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,480
and love is not the way to do it. You make new characters that are just good and that have

146
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,280
We can't have that. We can't make original IPs anymore. The market saturated with them. And we

147
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,600
got to play it safe. Oh, well, we've had too many ideas in the past. We've farmed we've farmed the

148
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,400
future. We've we've stripped mind the future of ideas. And now we've pulled them all out. And

149
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,360
there's no more new ones to be had. We've just got to work with what we've got.

150
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:38,720
Unfortunate. This was a problem, I guess I had back in the good old days of the Wild West of

151
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,680
Gamergate, where it was hard for me to like, it's hard for me to tell all the time when a like

152
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,440
when a black person is a black person for corporate or for artistic reasons, you know,

153
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,240
that's the issue right there. There's obvious, you know, there's obvious examples of, you know,

154
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,280
a black person never corporate, you know, gain of which I can name exactly zero, but I'm sure

155
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,160
they exist because everyone says that they do. But I it I a lot of time I would imagine if it's

156
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,040
a small like, you know, indie game as it was with a lot of Gamergate people, you know, talking

157
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,080
points, but there's probably just done because they like black people. And I think it's hard to,

158
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,600
you know, I would say that like as a general statement, I would say like, like, I like,

159
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,840
yeah, like Ben said, I like black people, I like seeing them in video games every so often,

160
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,640
pretty good. So I think as a Blake and statement, I want to encourage that. And I, and I don't,

161
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm skeptical of the like, how often is there really a border mean of all right, we need like a

162
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,960
couple more black people here, like, I just need it. It's probably more often than any of us would

163
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,320
like to admit like the BBC is on record saying they have like quotas that they have to meet now

164
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,040
and they post jobs all the time where they're like, white people can't apply like straight up.

165
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,800
Like this is my majority job. I want to I want to take I want to take sorry, you can you can go.

166
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,200
No, no, no, it's fine. Okay, well, well, I think this is a good time for me to stake my claim

167
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,200
because I want to put this out there. So everyone knows where I stand on this issue. Oh, no. There

168
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,360
is a well, it's not a big deal. It's stupid. You're all going to be disappointed. There is a

169
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,840
there is a Mr. B tongue video that was controversial and it's about like the one about diversity

170
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,400
and the one about I got I forget what it's called but it's the one where he talks about

171
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,400
CD project and how like their games are different because they come from like a Polish culture,

172
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,720
which is not like a well represented culture and stuff and how like more diversity leads to like

173
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,680
fresher ideas and stuff. And I fucking love that video. And anyone that disagrees with it is stupid.

174
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,560
And well, wait, was he was he making a point that like the buzzwords for the discussion of that was

175
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,040
that there are too many white people in this Polish game. But was he I forget what he was

176
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,960
saying about that was he agreeing that like there should be black people in the winter? No,

177
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,000
no, well, he said that he said that maybe there should be. But was he saying that because the

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,880
game was all about Polish like folklore and stuff. And yeah, because CD project is Polish and Polish

179
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,400
people don't make that many games, like that's why CD projects games feel a little different.

180
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,480
And that's what he likes about it. And I think that's great. And I was already kind of I was

181
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,600
already kind of blue pilled. But then I watched that Mr. B tongue video. And then I was fully then

182
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,680
I took my big I took a big vat of blue pills and blue gel capsules and crack them all open to a

183
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,000
swimming pool and just die right now. That's not even really a blue pill point. It's not.

184
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,760
Well, and why did I get in so many bitter arguments about people are the stupidest people

185
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,560
ever. So I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about people on YouTube. I'm talking about people in

186
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,280
this very PCP that we're in people in the PCP fought me to the nail on that issue. Well, then

187
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,160
I could not everybody in this podcast who isn't me is retarded and because that point is totally

188
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,800
fine because it's not I love it. It's not contradictory to anything we were just talking

189
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,000
about because that has nothing to do that. That's the reason that that game feels refreshing isn't

190
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,200
necessarily because it was Polish people's because it was Polish folklore. It was a concept that it

191
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,000
was a it was a well of inspiration that hasn't been tapped on a lot. And while those the Polish

192
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,560
people are in a better position to take those ideas because they're familiar with them, anybody

193
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,560
could have just really said, hey, look at Poland, let's take some ideas from there. And they could

194
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,720
have no I don't think would have been would have been his nuance and authentic, probably not,

195
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,120
but it still would have been different. So it's an intellectual thing that's being brought to the

196
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,880
table. It's ideas that make it refreshing. And yeah, but I think that I think that the thing

197
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,360
here, the idea is that like, people from different backgrounds bring new perspectives and ideas to

198
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,160
things. So like, okay, yeah, I think it's would be over. I think it's oversimplifying to say that,

199
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,800
okay, if we're talking about games, like, yeah, the games industry, it's a lot of white males and

200
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,800
stuff. But like, that's not, I don't know. There's lots of different types of white male. Yeah,

201
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,920
the term is so wide. I think I think it's not important to point out the specifics of like,

202
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,840
oh, it's white cis males that are doing it. That's not the point is that it's a monoculture and

203
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,840
it attracts people of like a like minded culture and societal values and outlooks and similar

204
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,680
and similar ideas and sensibilities. And is it like an exclusive thing that kind of pushes people

205
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,120
away that I do not share that same minds, including, you know, minorities and women and things like

206
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:50,240
that. So I, yeah, basically, I just really like the idea of inclusive inclusiveness and that

207
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,800
fucking because he says that Mr. Butung says in that video that like, we're not doing them a favor

208
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,520
by letting them make video games. It's more like we're, we're allowing them to do us a favor by

209
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,680
like, bringing their fresh perspective. No one's allowing anybody to do a goddamn favor. They made

210
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,200
their own studio and made their own fucking video games. They built it up themselves. They didn't

211
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
need anybody. The end result is that you get something that you wouldn't have otherwise.

212
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,680
And it's not positive for you. And I'm not here. I'm not saying, I'm not talking about like a

213
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,280
conspiracy to keep women out of video games or anything. It's the, like the problem,

214
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,680
how the fuck did I get on fucking women in video games? And this is a fucking game or game.

215
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll finish the point and then we can move on. The problem is that the culture is hostile to

216
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,160
outsiders. And that's what key, that's what it's not a hard kind of what cultures are.

217
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,000
Cultures inherently have barriers around them. Well, people who are not within the culture.

218
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah. Well, there's, there's, there's degrees. I don't want to get into this. I'm just gonna

219
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,840
let that point go. Let me just say one point about this. And is that ironically, Ben,

220
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,760
Poland is by far the most red-pilled MGTOW country in Europe by far. That's neither here nor there.

221
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,640
It's still illustrative of the point. But then again, so we're like, so it's like, I mean,

222
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,600
they can't hold a candle to like Islamic country is like fucking, you know, Iran and shit. They're

223
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,480
pretty. But what about Sharia law, Ben? What about Sharia law? What about Sharia law?

224
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,920
Dude, that's a game about Sharia law. But it's just, it's red-pilled as fuck. And yet it's like

225
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,360
loved by like feminists and SJWs. Okay, but whatever. Let's get off this shit. I want to ask for

226
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,360
clarification on that, but I'm scared to. I was very confused that entire time because I didn't

227
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,600
know what side anyone was on. But here's the thing. Imagine like there's like a game where,

228
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,320
or a story where the law is humanity was underground for fucking millions of years.

229
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,520
And they do this. And you're talking about homeless. Yeah. And imagine, imagine that's a show. And

230
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,160
then, you know, everybody's like real white and pasty because they've never had any son. And then

231
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,600
there's a black guy in there for like, for like diversity. I hate stuff like that. It doesn't

232
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,280
make any sense with the law of the world. So get out of here, blackie.

233
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360
Alternate timeline where Nate watched her in the gamba. You couldn't get past the first episode

234
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,360
because they were all black in this timeline. Oh, that's my, that's, that's real life.

235
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:25,360
Let me, let me touch on this thing that I sometimes feel weird about. It's that like, okay.

236
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,520
Okay. Okay. Pretty much all my, all in my comics and stuff. Everyone's white, more or less. And

237
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,120
it's not that like, it's not like a deliberate like, everyone's got to be white. It's just.

238
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,720
That's gonna take about a hour in my brain. But we grew up, we grew up around almost exclusively

239
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,920
white people. There was so little diversity. The truth is that we are not racist for just

240
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,840
like that sort of being our vision of like a default human being. There's nothing wrong.

241
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,640
Yeah. Like it's just, it's just the way that it should be. I don't have a lot of like,

242
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,240
I never had a lot of like black friends or anything. And yeah, the way that I see it,

243
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,080
if I made a character and made them black, I would have two options. I could either treat them and

244
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,880
characterize them exactly as I would anyone else, which would be the same way as a white person.

245
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,720
And that would be fine and everything. Or I could like, unless the story is like about

246
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,560
their race, but then it'd be like, well, how would I even fucking write about that? I have no,

247
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,120
I have no footing in that culture. No, I have nothing meaningful to say. This is a whole

248
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,360
interesting point with social justice and how they push this forced diversity shit is that

249
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,240
they, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't, because if you, if you're just doing white

250
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,280
people and stuff, and that's your characters, they'll be like, well, you need to have diversity.

251
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,400
And then it's like, okay, I guess I'll add a black person. Then it's like, well, this is an

252
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,640
inauthentic representation of X, whatever representation we want in this show. So basically

253
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,880
what it's really about is it's they, what they're, they're saying we need more representation,

254
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,760
but at the end of the day, what they really want, they want you to get the fuck out of their whitey.

255
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,880
That's, that's the end goal. Look, here's what I'm thinking about this. It's like, okay, I,

256
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
let's say I make a comic. I, it's all white. They're like, okay, put a black guy in. Okay,

257
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
put a black guy in there. Like, okay, you did this all wrong. Like, why is he talking white?

258
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,360
And I'm like, oh, let me fix that. So I make him sound black or something. They're like, well,

259
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,800
why are you being so fucking racist right now? Exactly. Why isn't he acting just like the white

260
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,080
people you fucking racist? Like, is, is race relevant or not? I don't know. Yeah. Take a,

261
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,080
take a side. The problem is, I say no, by the way, I say completely no. It's a complete social

262
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,800
construct. I think there's almost no value in it. And I'd rather just go away. For sure. If, yeah,

263
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,720
like, like, no matter what your race is, you're going to grow up acting like the people around

264
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,920
you. And to go back to a little bit of genetic stuff, to go back to a second to what Ben was

265
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,680
saying about Poland and stuff. The interesting thing is that like, well, the, the, the Poland

266
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,920
example works, like, when people push for diversity and stuff in like America, I kind of don't feel

267
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,560
as, as, as like it has the same thing, because we're, despite the fact that there's a bunch of

268
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,160
different races and sexual orientation stuff here, despite the very like surface level, like

269
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,240
different experiences, we're all growing up in the same culture. So our experiences aren't as

270
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
different as someone growing up in an entirely different country with an entire different set

271
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,920
of cultural experiences. So what, when you have something in an American setting, like that's

272
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,640
the whole thing. The reason America worked and now like is kind of falling apart as this whole

273
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,840
like race thing goes crazy is because America was built on a set of values and everybody

274
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,240
regardless who they were, shared those values. And that's why the whole thing works. So when

275
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,640
you start doing all this race shit, it falls apart. This little, this little race kerfuffle

276
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,760
we're involved in. This little race war we're about to start is right. Here's, here's, here's

277
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,560
one example of my intense red pilling. So here I go. I am actually angry about how much I have

278
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,520
to think about trans people, despite them being such a tiny percent of real people in real life.

279
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,960
You know what, I'm mad about that. I kind of am too. I agree. I agree. Why the fuck do I have to

280
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,480
think about trans people so much when I like never ever met one? 99% virtue signaling. Yeah, it

281
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,560
makes me mad. It makes me mad that a thing can be popular for no other reason than because it

282
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,080
references or is somehow relevant to trans people because trans issues are what are trendy on the

283
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,680
internet right now. Just in the fucking marketplace, they should have so little stake. And I get that

284
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,840
we don't want them to be fucking, you know, trampled or discriminated against. I'm with you on that.

285
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,520
Why the fuck do I have to think about your problems all the time? But I got my own problems.

286
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I see a disproportionate with his wicked ideas. Yeah, phantom horn,

287
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,360
angry horse man. There he is. Insanely, Ben insanely transphobic saint. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,400
Insanely. I've never met a more red pill man in my entire life than Vincent.

289
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,120
And you never will. Because if there is one, I'll kill them. Yeah, yeah, I just want to agree that

290
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,600
yeah, I feel like I hear a lot like a disproportionate amount of media is relevant to trans issues.

291
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,880
You know what I'm saying? I'd like to hear more about furry rights. At least they look funny.

292
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:23,040
I agree. At least they're cool. At least they work really hard. Because my mom grounds me when I say

293
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,280
fuck. It's really, it's really getting to me. My mom says I can't say nigger when I'm at the dinner

294
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:36,000
table. I want to talk about one time I saw, I don't remember why, but I was, oh, I think it was

295
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,440
when I was practicing for one of the races. You had to really try to get in that way. I was

296
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,560
practicing the black race. It was really going hard. I saw, I think I was looking at some speed

297
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,440
running records and I saw that a couple of records in I forget what game were held by a woman. And I

298
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,800
was like, oh, whoa, well, this is interesting. Like, it's just like a high tier pro speed running

299
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,160
female. Like, well, let's go check her out. Go to her YouTube channel. It's a trans. It's a trans

300
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,040
woman. It's a trans woman. Proving that even men are better women than women. That's what we've

301
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,280
learned here today. It's one of those ones who wears like a pink, fluffy, low-lead dress and like

302
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,800
big, like, big, like blue banana curls. Just does way over the top and does the like ultra,

303
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,640
ultra, like anime girly style of that version of being a woman. I would beseech any legitimate

304
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,880
trans person, I think would have no choice but to completely agree with my points. Like,

305
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,440
for what reason are your issues forced on the like such a huge amount of media relates to your

306
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,640
tiny little niche thing? I don't like why the glasses fetishists of the world, such as myself,

307
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,560
do not consume the massive amount of airwaves that like these other things do. And why is that?

308
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,040
It's because nobody gives a fuck about our problems. They are our own to deal with and no one should

309
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,280
ever care about them. And same should here. Same should here. I'll go ahead and say something

310
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:06,400
that you can't say. Please do. There's, all right, here's what I think. Here's what I think. If you

311
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:14,240
are of a mindset where you do not feel okay unless you are dressed, say, as a woman, if you're a

312
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,120
biological male, if your mindset is such that like if you're not dressed as a woman, you're like,

313
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,640
you're not okay. Dressing as a woman is not the solution to that because like the problem is way

314
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,320
deeper, you know. Uh-oh. Insanely transphobic. But it strikes again. And I want to say I'm not

315
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,840
saying that someone who wants to wear a dress shouldn't wear a dress. Not what I'm saying,

316
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,240
but I am saying that the solution is that it's not it's not it's not a solution to be like,

317
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,480
oh, well, I'm just going to wear a dress and everyone has to call me a woman or else I fucking

318
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,360
will be I'll just break down and cry. I'll just break down and cry if someone refers to me as a

319
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,960
man, you know. Since this is just what the podcast is now, I have something to say about the transgender

320
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:09,840
community. I think a lot of the time the way transgendered people like present the issues

321
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:17,840
are like are transphobic and like sexist. Yeah. Oh, oh my god. They're so they're so sexist. They're

322
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,040
so sexist. Oh, okay, okay, okay. The way my ideal society would work is Mulan because at the end

323
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,840
of Mulan Mulan has like gone through all these trials and tribulations trying to be a man trying

324
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,960
to act like what she thinks a man is to, you know, do all the shit written into a Disney movie,

325
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,400
but just bear with me. But at the end Mulan does cool things and she is a good person in a dress

326
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,880
and the thing about being a man or being a woman is that it doesn't actually matter. Like you can

327
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,000
be a masculine girl and wear a dress. You it just is a set of actions and ideals that you have like

328
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,160
like it's just super undefined and trying to like act like oh I'm going to be a man that doesn't mean

329
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:11,520
anything. That isn't actually anything. When they say that gender is performative

330
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,200
and then they're like okay well I'm going to put on a suit and like cut my hair short and like,

331
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,480
you know, take hormone pills so I'm growing a beard. Well this means I'm a man because I'm

332
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,680
performing as one. Well shit, aren't you fucking pigeonholing what men are like? Like not all men

333
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,320
have beards, not all men wear suits, not all men work out or drink beer or whatever. Well you don't

334
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,440
appropriate that culture. The only time it's okay to be like a classically beautiful woman

335
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,400
right now according to you know the current feminist ideology is when you are a trans woman

336
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,960
because then it's okay to adhere to the stereotype and you're not just you know feeding the patriarchy

337
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,800
by giving them what they want. Okay I know this is like an unfair blanket statement and I'm sure

338
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:58,160
that there are exceptions probably a lot of them but so but so many trans women their idea of what

339
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:05,680
being a woman is is this is this overblown fucking like china doll like hyper like hyper feminized

340
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,280
yeah and it's like that that's you that's the great thing to say it is no no it is you know what

341
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,840
is it's female blackface it's female fucking blackface is what it is and this isn't to say this

342
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,760
isn't to say that like if you're a man you can't wear a dress or if you're a woman you can't wear

343
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,680
a suit that's what I want no I want you to just wear what you want because it's what you like

344
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,520
if there's some guy who's like okay I just want to look like a woman because that's just what I'm

345
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,520
into I guess then of course but it's like what is there's no problem there I just don't like

346
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,960
when you're saying that all men or all women are a certain way that you try and perform as

347
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,920
like it's a fucking kabuki theater act. There's a real element there's a real element of like

348
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,440
imposing their worldview onto the language of others and demanding that the way that others

349
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,480
speak in a way that conforms to what they believe and it makes me mad okay well here's the thing

350
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,520
it's really makes me mad if we're we're gonna go down this rabbit hole like this is because we just

351
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,520
fucking are apparently this is the thing and I've always had a question about and I haven't been

352
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,640
able to get a good answer I've talked to a couple trans people about it and I never really get a

353
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,280
straight answer at least something I find satisfactory to to satisfy my kind of like cognitive

354
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,320
dissonance with this is that yeah we have this whole like kind of like blue-pilled you know leftist

355
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,640
ideology that talks about all these issues and that's where all these talking points really come

356
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,200
from. By the way Tom I just want to put it in here I am those blue-pilled person in the entire world.

357
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,280
I agree for sure of course. Okay okay. I I may I'm catching up to you much you one day I'll be as

358
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:50,320
blue-pilled as you are. I aspire to it. Well my point is that we we talk about like or they talk

359
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,600
about I guess I talk about I'm talking about now too about how gender is a social construct right

360
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,680
and there's no difference between men and women men and women are just as capable they're the same

361
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,720
thing it's all about a performance and then you're talking about trans people and how you can be a

362
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,840
man's brain trapped in a woman's body in vice versa and it's like these two statements you can't

363
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,080
have them at the same time right because if you if if gender is just a performance and your trans

364
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,440
you don't need any surgery you don't need anything to kind of correct anything you just start acting

365
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,800
as something else and so I know like a lot of this like social justice stuff I feel is

366
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,240
faces so much I guess pushback from people because they make everything needlessly more

367
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,240
complicated like that point like we've added like 10 billion genders like what we should have done

368
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,120
just like none of this matters there's just there's we shouldn't have any difference in gender there

369
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,280
should be no gender performance you like added you just subtracted instead of adding things

370
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,920
would have made it that point you blah sorry keep going that I'll go for it that that point you just

371
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,800
made about how gen the the performative gender thing it makes me so mad because it literally

372
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,760
means that tomboy's aren't women like they don't like if you if you act masculine then you're not a

373
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,480
woman because you're not performing the gender and holy fucking shit how fucking sexist and like

374
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,280
fucking and fucking like conformed to my world you because what you can you possibly feel like I

375
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,320
feel like acting like a man so I need I must be trans and it's like well okay but if you just feel

376
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,640
like acting like something just act like it like you don't have to make a huge fucking big deal out

377
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,600
I've had this like thought for like a while uh uh because like you know I like boobs

378
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,160
what if I what if I just what if I just had them what if I just got some grafted onto me and then

379
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,640
just stayed the same and say people would say uh so you were trans and I said no I just have boobs

380
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,320
now I just have boobs I just like them why are we getting there there was a chapter of a manga that

381
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,280
I forget the name of it's like miss so and so's uh nurse clinic and it's about monster girls the

382
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,960
main character is a is a Cyclops with massive tits and she is a nurse in a school full of monster

383
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,720
kids and that's cool yeah and one of the chapters is about like a dude who is obsessed with tits

384
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,120
and like in this world whenever a kid like goes through puberty they like develop their like

385
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,640
monster characteristic and they're all they're always different this particular guy who's like

386
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,160
obsessed with tits he himself turns like just into a woman like he just gets tits uh actually

387
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,240
I guess that's probably the only thing that happens I think other than that he's still

388
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,400
got a dick and stuff but he's just like you know what I like how your voice cracked when you said

389
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,160
dick I like how your voice I uh so the the the the ultimate point of the guy is just that like he

390
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,360
he just like because he just owns it like all the guys that he was like encouraging to like be

391
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,920
ledges and look at tits now he's just like well now I just have this so I will just like enjoy it

392
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,480
and be able to look upon myself as like a sexy tit having individual and so he starts dressing up

393
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,960
like a girl and just being that but he's like no like I am the manliest man in the world I just

394
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,920
have this awesome set of tits that I rock and it's fucking fantastic and uh I'm just gonna live

395
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,960
like this forever and it's great so he just even being able is able to appreciate like his own body

396
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,040
as a sexual object uh and it's great and I don't know I'd like that like the way that he just like

397
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,840
accepts what he is like he doesn't feel the need to like chop off his dick I gotta tell you this is

398
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,760
where I have some issues with this I just don't see the solution to any kind of psychological

399
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,480
discomfort to being cutting off body parts what that's just my other psychological come out with

400
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,160
some crazy pictographs nowadays yeah what other psychological condition is the solution that

401
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,040
you make the outside look like the inside like that's not done for anything else like yeah like

402
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,360
it like the solution if you like are depressed and and think you're ugly they don't tell you oh

403
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,440
well you will you better get some plastic surgery then so you can look the way you feel on the inside

404
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,320
well hey let me it's like fucking I get yourself a steam stored it stored let me push back on that

405
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,600
a little bit though but let's bet if there was a magical like wand you could wave to just make

406
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,920
these transformations instantly like would that be a different case um you know like if there was

407
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,320
no no no because I'm not saying that you shouldn't get surgery I'm just saying that like getting

408
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,280
surgery is one is one thing but like the problems that are making you sad are another yeah you know

409
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,960
well gender dysphoria is like an actual mental condition I'm not trying to underline it's been

410
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,680
redefined now it's been redefined it's no longer one it's being redefined and I think that's kind

411
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,160
of dangerous because like if if these people actually have a condition I think it should be treated

412
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,200
as a condition and not as a fad and I feel like it's devolving into well you know I'm sure these

413
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
people would say that it really should have never been like a disorder of any kind it should have

414
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,000
always been treated like again to talk more about this weird kind of like SJW hypocrisy isn't it

415
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,680
interesting that people wear depression and like you know the headbates and all these weird conditions

416
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,760
as a disorder as a badge of honor but then when it comes to being trans like it's not a disorder

417
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,960
that's offensive what is the line being drawn there even though I'm with everything said here

418
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,920
I just want to say that I haven't like actually seen any like headmates or like I haven't actually

419
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,680
seen any like absolutely crazy out there um trans people most of the ones I've seen have been like

420
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:26,320
pretty normal people so you know this is not a comment on trans people this is a comment on the

421
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,800
ideology that's pushing this agenda I think I think that goes without saying but just to say it again

422
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,800
just in general like this is I try not to argue with people I try to argue against ideas because

423
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,600
I feel like this is a philosophy discussion show this is not a listen to me you loser I have known

424
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:49,600
at least one crazy trans person who was fucking bizarre and she wore she wore goat horns everywhere

425
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,360
she went like giant goat and like a crown and like a crown of flowers is that weird

426
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,560
and um is this like a trans species thing or are you trying to be like yeah yeah she was like a

427
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,520
goat yeah she was a trans goat she talked all the time about getting like real horns transplanted

428
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,960
onto her head did she change changed her name to clover because that's a goat name oh the ultimate

429
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,280
furry the ultimate furry uh like but you know she was actually she she she was actually kind of a

430
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,840
nice guy most of the time so whatever hey hey I just want to state to go back like like like

431
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,480
the general ideas of things I don't know if it's gonna out me as like a beta cuck loser

432
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,920
but I don't know what these people mean when they say like I feel like a man like yeah I don't

433
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,840
know what that feels like that can't possibly mean anything yeah and even if it did how would

434
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:48,080
you fucking know I think I think what they mean is I feel like the social the societal um like

435
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:54,080
normative like generic like this is what everyone decides a man is I feel like that guys I feel

436
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:02,240
like a generic sitcom dad from the 1950s aka a man that like that's what I think a man is I feel

437
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:10,240
like that like one one time I was talking one time I was talking to a guy um well a trans woman

438
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,080
or trans girl whatever and they were and they were like well I just I feel like a woman in my head

439
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,480
and I was like well how do you know what a woman feels like and and like they they fucking cussed

440
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,360
me the fuck right out I respect your challenge there but on the other I do want to be like how

441
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:34,320
could we really understand what they feel like like I don't I don't care about how do they understand

442
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,360
like like there's more going on here there's more going on here because yeah they feel how they feel

443
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,760
but then they're translating it and they're saying well I feel like that I feel like that other group

444
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
of people and it's like okay do you know okay how do you know how what your feelings compared to

445
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,720
theirs fuck you god damn it get out of there I mean I have never um like seen like a crazy

446
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,120
trans person but on the topic I have like something it's still like a thing you can't really say

447
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,440
because it's kind of like uh insulting um but I feel like a lot of trans people people who call

448
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,480
themselves trans they're not trying hard enough with the gimmick they're not going far enough

449
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:18,080
things like they say oh I'm this different gender but they don't do anything about it

450
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,280
besides maybe changing the way they dress and sure they take with that like the whole pronoun

451
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,520
thing like all this special like you I don't know whether these people actually have the dysphoria

452
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,320
that others actually really do and they're just sort of along for the ride because trans is a thing

453
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:37,760
now and you can be a part of a group with it well like there's no well like there's no test right

454
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,720
like there's no there's no test that you can run to tell whether someone is really trans like all

455
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,200
that makes someone trans is just that they say they are which is fine and it like if we're all

456
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,600
agreed when when there's like actual like people who are like really suffering mentally and they

457
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,400
need help and then there's other people who are just sort of like uh yeah I feel like I feel like

458
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,040
wearing jeans I feel like wearing jeans and boots sometimes so I guess I'll be I guess I'll join

459
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,840
it right and and I'll guess I'll join this culture that like gives me a feeling like I'm a part of

460
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,680
something right because it's not just because it's not just about yourself it's about being a part

461
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,880
of a social it's totally about getting social currency yeah that's what all of this is about you

462
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,440
know that that's why it's all done it's like I want to be a part of this group I want to feel

463
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,560
validated I want to feel part of something bigger than myself they they and the trans community is

464
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,560
so welcoming that they will even accept Christian Weston Chandler as one of their own and and like

465
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,200
actually love him and respect him and be his fans even though he is the worst person in the world

466
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,440
and should be shot dead where he stands right now that's that's the final fucking straw for me

467
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,520
I that's how you know that this shit has gone too far on this on on any subject of this nature I

468
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,760
feel completely consistent in that I just I don't care about anyone who isn't useful to me that's

469
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,840
how I completely feel and man are these people not useful to me so I don't care about any of your

470
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,000
problems listeners any people in any of these subjugated communities your problems are your

471
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
own they have nothing to do with me and I hope they work out great for you but you know I just

472
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,920
don't care I just do you know where this does become your problem Nate you know how this does

473
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,920
become this is uh the the culture that surrounds these movements of ostracizing and destroying

474
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,480
anyone who disagrees with them that's where the book did you hear about what happened this guy

475
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
he was a teacher he's been a teacher for years um and he went up to these two girls who are working

476
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,040
on like they were working diligently in his class he was like oh nice job girls like you're doing

477
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,040
good and one of them's like how dare you misgender me and he got fired oh my god he got fired because

478
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,880
some little girl said decided she was a guy and the parents reported it to the head of the school

479
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,040
and he got fired I mean he should have known she was a guy because she was working hard

480
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:57,600
oh my god yeah she was she was really performing

481
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,040
you can't say that you can't say those words oh my god that was excellent

482
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,680
oh zing oh there we go that's what you were gonna do you stole my point and ran with it

483
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,400
I mean oh my god I never intended this discussion about trans stuff to like even begin I wanted to

484
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,240
talk about like the concept of how you're not allowed to say certain things which actually is

485
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,880
relevant to what we said but instead we've just spent the entire podcast saying things you're not

486
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,520
allowed to say which I don't like any of my notes whatsoever well we can we can just switch

487
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,840
a web back to what Tom's point we're gonna go into yeah uh where's point sorry go ahead man go

488
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,840
words I can't say uh what's what's to sheer sauce

489
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,440
what's the sheer sauce yeah this is a lunchy life hack right now it's it's what's the

490
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,240
shit like I've heard what's the shit I've heard I've heard what's I've heard what's the sheer and

491
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,440
I've heard what's the sheer like without war chester sauce is that a war chester here

492
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,760
well that war sauce sauce which is just Jew blood mixed with a gold

493
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,840
war chester shire I mean it it is in England and I assume I feel like it's Worcester like like

494
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,840
that's how you're supposed to there there actually is a Worcester Massachusetts as well is that where

495
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,480
is that where you live uh tower caramel yeah bent and ornate have you guys ever had people from

496
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,320
out of new england come into new england and try and pronounce the words and laugh at them because

497
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,960
like they're saying how they should be said and they're all weird because they're normal to me

498
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:41,520
yeah it's it's it's hilarious it's like war chester English spot just a thanks cube uh you're

499
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,360
well yeah fucking here's a munchie life hack and like like rest here's like a new munchie recipe

500
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,400
for you if you're out of a one sauce I'm gonna teach how to make munchie shaw's which is just

501
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,120
okay you mix ketchup and wishes your sauce together and it's like it's like tangier than

502
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,160
a wonder like it's basically the same but like this is the first episode of the new hit youtube

503
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:09,760
series munchin with munchie oh my god that's a good one that is banded right now trademarked

504
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,640
don't even that's that's gonna be the future that's coming up well hey that that that point that Tom

505
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,040
got to right at the end of that trans woman that that is okay so we could talk all day about specific

506
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,080
things you're not allowed to say but but what's what's interesting to me is the the consequences

507
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,760
of saying the things that you're not allowed to say yeah and specifically uh like yeah it's like

508
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,240
there it seems to me that the way it goes is you say something I don't know like anyone listens

509
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,800
to this podcast decides that something we said is particularly offensive to them or their community

510
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,600
and would then go time right and then they would go begin to cultivate within that we're gonna get

511
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,040
we're gonna get roasted we're gonna get roasted for this no no for this podcast this is like those

512
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,600
those guys who are those guys who are who are who are shitting on them they're gonna they're gonna

513
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:59,680
be back I have no doubt that we'll all be called very ignorant which I admit to I'm totally ignorant

514
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,400
around subject although I think that philosophically I have found I have ground to stand I just feel

515
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,840
like when people shit on me for thinking this way they're really like reading a lot more into

516
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,200
my opinion than I'm actually saying like they absolutely like they hear they hear me say

517
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,160
that like you know well well how can gender be performative if like a tomboy is still a girl

518
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,280
and they're like well quit being transphobic man live and let live uh uh why do you hate trans people

519
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,240
the fact that they jump from you just like asking a question or trying to examine it they interpret

520
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,440
as an attack on like this identity in some way it's not even that it's because there's I think

521
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,760
it's worse than that I think they they they see it as an attack but I think it's because this is

522
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,880
such a feelings-based thing that this ideology has no logical defense because you'll they'll

523
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,160
be like you need to educate yourself and it's like okay teach me and you know I don't think it's

524
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,080
even I don't think it's even controversial to say that it is all about feelings like there's

525
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,640
nothing else there that's true and I mean I guess there's some studies I guess there's some studies

526
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,040
but the studies are all about feelings you know my whole thing that I said before about how I don't

527
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,840
give a shit about how anybody feels or anyone's you know feelings or whatever like that's only because

528
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,800
that's not out of like uh malice or anything it's because I don't think you can get to truth by just

529
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,400
listening to the way people saying how they feel about shit because all these other things get

530
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,680
bottled in I just want to examine fucking data that as as objectively as possible categorized

531
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,400
I want people to be as happy as possible including trans people and like I don't know like the suicide

532
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,560
rate is really high for trans people even after operation so yeah it's really necessarily the

533
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,800
best way to go yeah I want the best opportunities for them possible and like and like people's

534
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,200
feelings are valid and like people feel the way that they feel and I would never tell someone no you

535
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,160
don't actually feel the way that you say they feel but you can't make sweeping generalizations about

536
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,800
your your feelings in comparison to others because you can't you can't fucking tell another person

537
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,480
how they feel which I really think a lot of this a lot of this ideology really toes the line towards

538
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,800
doing that's the thing the reason but we value facts over feelings even to begin with because

539
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,040
it's easy it's easier to to have feelings than to get the facts right but the reason the facts are

540
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,840
more important is because they're universal right yeah and that's the whole thing because when you

541
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:16,160
when we start taking feelings super seriously it inevitably leads to nothing because your

542
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,560
feelings are different than my feelings communicate with each other with and understand what we're

543
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,920
saying it's a it's a it's a it's a shared baseline that we can build things off of whereas if we

544
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,000
start taking feelings in consideration I feel different than Ben then feels different than

545
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,240
Nate that feels different than much and none of us could ever get anywhere I don't know that sounds

546
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,800
like fake news to me I don't know yeah there's no red-pilled enough for this fucking truth

547
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,640
there's no basis there's no basis for comparison when we're talking about feelings you know right

548
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:51,120
so it just gets really complicated and tricky well here's a feeling for you I love you guys

549
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,160
give gave were you saying something there well I was just gonna say I'm pro-phobic I I love homophobes

550
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:06,880
and transphobes I love fear I'm a big proponent of fear yeah okay let me just say okay we're

551
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,720
talking about homophobes let me just drop a bomb on this things you can't say okay what let me this

552
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,000
is just me giving an example of something that you cannot say or like it's over for you okay here's

553
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,160
here's this thing that I do not actually believe but here I go feel free to cut this everybody

554
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,240
and pretend this is what I actually think for the rest of time okay it is impossible for the white

555
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,640
race to share a nation-state with other races therefore the white race needs their own ethno

556
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,800
state like what do you there there's a lot of people think compelling right that's that's the

557
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,000
alt-right position it is like okay what if you believe that what happens when you believe that

558
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,720
and say that publicly you are you're fucking you're done you get punched in the face and I mean

559
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,520
sidewalk during an interview I don't know because now you've got a lot of friends that are with you

560
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,160
well that that that is true you've got the alt-right movement with you the real one it's not very big

561
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,680
though it's real it's well it's big enough that it scares me so you know that's my feeling

562
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,240
the estimations I've heard is this maybe 15 000 people in the alt-right well okay but you know

563
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,240
what it's kind of like it's kind of like with like the jihadist movement 100 people that's a lot of

564
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,280
people I mean I have I have personally known people who well I mean I don't know I guess they

565
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,560
didn't come right out and say that they're all right but like they definitely had like leanings

566
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,120
in that direction well it's hard it's hard to be white person and not sympathize to some degree at

567
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,640
this point considering considering considering everything's about race now it's like well I

568
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,480
guess I'm a white person so I guess considering everything that we as a people have been through

569
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,720
well okay here's here's a thought uh uh you know the the white race specifically uh like gets gets

570
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,760
lambasted in a lot of ways these ways these days publicly as uh and it's like totally acceptable

571
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,320
to make sweeping generalizations about specifically that race and no others uh but but here's I think

572
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,200
it's totally useless and extremely harmful because that's punching up right right that's that's

573
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,280
punching up right well there's like a statistic floating around that I heard that like 50 something

574
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,120
percent of white people in america feel that they're being discriminated against now like that's

575
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,720
an insane metric but when you hear about but like yeah they're not actually discriminated against

576
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,800
right but then you all these talking points like you're you're culturally lambasted all the time

577
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,840
like Nate just said and of course of course people notice that we just you're just not allowed

578
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:32,240
socially to say anything about it so yeah it's it's it's really just I gotta say there's there's

579
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,560
definitely there's definitely a frustration when you're just like okay here's what here's what I

580
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:42,960
feel I am I consider myself basically above even considering the concept of race and it's like

581
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,160
basically useless to me so so here I am just being like okay I'm a human individual and this is like

582
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,640
the individualistic philosophy of just like everyone run your own shit and just like get ahead do

583
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,720
whatever you can do and everyone should just try and I want the people who are the best to succeed

584
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,360
Nate are you in the galatarian because you're not allowed to say that either

585
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,000
exactly but then like but then like okay but then you see I don't know like the neo-black

586
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,160
panthers or just whatever like the islamics or whatever I don't know any like racial group

587
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,040
is right any other racial services group sure I don't fucking know but any any like racialized

588
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:21,760
group then says like okay uh no like we're here to root for like uh you know I don't know uh

589
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,280
like Arab people like we're here champion Arab people and then okay if they're they're sort of

590
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,920
weaponizing their racial group and then you're over here saying like okay but I don't identify

591
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,120
with my racial group I'm just an individual operator it's like you can't contest them it's

592
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:41,360
like they are just they just go unopposed in saying that like we need to advocate and they're

593
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,880
like reinforcing thinking along racial lines you know which is an issue I don't know if I agree with

594
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,280
I'm gonna I'm gonna come out and and say something uh that I don't know if you'll

595
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,560
agree with but like okay white white people because they're the minority sorry because

596
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:02,880
they're the majority or like culturally the majority at least in our culture um they have

597
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,160
they have the benefit of being the the default and they have they have the privilege and it is a

598
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,040
privilege of they have the privilege of like living without thinking about their race whereas

599
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,200
like people in marginalized groups and people in minority groups don't really have that privilege

600
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,160
and they are kind of forced to confront like the reality of race and I don't argue with that

601
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:28,720
I don't argue with that yeah so so I get it like I get why marginalized groups need like

602
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,080
yeah like it's do you think okay this is what I'm coming from a position of privilege but I wish

603
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,800
they wouldn't do that and that no one ever would like I wish white people and every group wouldn't

604
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,160
like be racist I mean I wish people would feel the need to inculcate themselves in the racial

605
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,720
identity because I think it's all bad yeah yeah it would be nice it would be it would be nice if

606
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,360
nobody felt the need to do that but like right by being by yeah by being in the minority and

607
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,760
marginalized you know I I I get it I get I get the the reasoning where like we got a band together

608
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,760
and like it's like it's like how I it's like how I see people who are religious and everyone's like

609
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,720
oh but yeah like religion is is a helpful tool okay but like even if you talk to like a lot of

610
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,760
atheists like like Stefan Malinu is an atheist but would say like okay religion like is sort of a

611
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,800
support structure that helps humanity and I'm like okay but it's not true and he's like yeah of course

612
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm like okay uh so how do we like fix this he's like what do you mean I don't know uh we just

613
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,360
keep doing it it's like okay we can recognize this this this has a place in the world like it makes

614
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,240
sense why it's here but let's just try to get past it as soon as possible let's let's let's let's

615
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,200
leave the shit behind because it is an old thing that drags us down and we should move past it

616
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,520
eventually and I'm thinking about doing that I want to do that as soon as possible that's where my

617
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,280
focus is uh yeah yeah yeah that's what I think about religion religion is interesting there's a

618
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,680
there's a guy Dennis Prager who makes the argument and he's not the first person to make it without

619
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,920
religion Dennis the menace hardcore you know he kind of looks like an old guy this guy's a big

620
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,360
conservative guy Prager University and shit yeah but but he made the point um I mean he's made it

621
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,640
before but I saw it on the Rubin report he made the point that um without without without religion

622
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:22,160
there's no uh objective morality society like in a social context right so because without without

623
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,480
one fake thing you can't assume belief in another totally right because the the argument is that I

624
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,640
mean he is religious but even like saying even saying that it's like I don't believe in religion

625
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:39,440
so but even putting that aside like if if everyone believes in something then the entire social uh

626
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,920
construct like the social contract has a baseline of ethics or value systems to work up from it's

627
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,040
the same thing we're talking before about America right that's kind of what America was it was a

628
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,440
baseline that everybody who came here could agree with and work off of um yeah but the argument is

629
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,840
once you take away religion everything becomes subjective because it's just human interpretation

630
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:04,560
well because that's the reality because in reality everything is and and while it's it's I I'd agree

631
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,480
it's way more difficult to work in that paradigm of saying everything subjective how do we come

632
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,800
to a consensus I think it's more valuable long term but I think the reason religion has been

633
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,000
around so long is because it's an effective shorthand for that yeah it's like of course all the

634
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,960
Christians work this way so in our in our Christian culture this is the value system and we don't

635
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,960
have to think about it anymore we're on the same page inherently it's like it's like I think it's why

636
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,080
Islam is doing so well too because everybody you know to some degree is on the same page it's like

637
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,400
here it's like here with with this shit with these like idea systems and systems of like belief

638
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,440
that really functions control mechanisms uh for like societies it's like you're playing spore

639
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,840
and everyone's playing I like this the greatest game I've ever made yeah like you're playing

640
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,400
and you're playing like on like on the cell level where you're just like eating cells and like okay

641
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,040
we're we're living on the cell level where we just we understand the rules at play here but at some

642
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,280
point you eat enough cells and you grow big enough where where it does it does the zoom out to like

643
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,040
the next level so now we're aware of this like larger context and like you can still play the

644
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,120
little cell game and like you can see that at a much lower level but we're not aware of all this

645
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,320
truth about the larger universe beyond this and and it's time to we need to slowly adjust from

646
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,600
thinking just on that cellular level to the like small organism level or whatever it is and I think

647
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,600
that that's the way that like understanding more of the truth that the universe has to work like

648
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,600
people are stuck down at this like lower level thinking which is like religious thinking but

649
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,000
then we realize that okay none of this is true we need to expand the way we think about all these

650
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,640
frameworks and adjust our reasoning for that I see what I'm saying you're talking about leveling up

651
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,400
my christ consciousness trying to rev up those murkabahs guys

652
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,760
it's like you know life is like life is like that game life is like uh that that mini game at the

653
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,240
end of a level of Kirby where you gotta time your jump to like see how high and it's like just like

654
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,840
who can who can who can who can ride their murkaba to the highest dimension right of course the winner

655
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:08,080
the winner gets to eat a tasty tasty higher dimensional spirit yeah it's how blitz is Kirby

656
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,200
gonna be that like the lowest level is the root chakra and then the top level is the crown chakra

657
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,160
and that's and that's that's the amount of chakras you're gonna be fucking living off of hey I have

658
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,960
one other thing just one other like idea I want to touch on that relates to just like things you

659
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,560
can and can't say and it's the idea that like in context some things that you can't say normally

660
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,400
you can say and specifically Kirby is what reminds me of this

661
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,320
it's that like so you can say nigger and Kirby well I mean that well you kind of can uh because

662
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,120
believe in the weeb episode season two episode three just came out and it's everyone should

663
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,880
watch it it's it's very good it's very funny please don't but it's like but it's like our friend

664
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,200
at munchie here like the the conceit of the episode is that munchie is the biggest race

665
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:00,800
realist uh whoever lived and is is is a big fan of the racial slur and yet I don't think anyone

666
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:05,680
has has come away from watching that video and thought like anything negative about about munchie

667
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,800
and I mean I can't imagine why you would it's it's just so like within the context of the video

668
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,280
it's so ridiculous and over the top and this is like the comedian effect like comedians can get

669
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,160
away with saying things like your average person cannot you know you know what I'm saying and I

670
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,840
just think that's real interesting I would like to this is a good point I don't want to come back

671
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:28,960
to but I just want to say for the record about the plea in the weeb uh it was it was at like

672
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:35,360
six three in the morning I've been up for like an entire day and also a year ago and also I'm sorry

673
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:45,040
I'm not funny I swear to god that I'm funnier now first rule dude no no it's right I'm so sorry I

674
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,360
will say though that I do think you've you've evolved significantly over the past year uh since

675
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,240
rad con too which is which when was your like first pcp entrance I mean you were probably on

676
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,320
one before that but like you became like a main dude after that sometime the first episode I was on

677
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:04,000
was memes that need to god need to die but I don't remember what my first like I am a member was yeah

678
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,040
okay well but I don't know you're it was after that anyway yeah yeah uh I'm so excellent about

679
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:16,640
like the context in which you can say things yeah I exist in like a weird like limbo land I live in

680
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:23,600
california in a big city and all my fans are all yeah all my all my friends are blue pilled as

681
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:31,120
fuck but the actual town that like I like go to and interact with on a daily basis is super red

682
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,640
pit like like like like like fucking blue lives matter flags everywhere you know okay you can't

683
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,800
walk down the street without seeing a trumpet but blue lives as opposed to blue pilled lives

684
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:48,480
get confused a lot right okay okay so no matter what I say if I'm if I'm in this town with my with

685
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,840
my blue with my cuck friends which is San Diego right that's that's the city I'm thinking that's

686
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:59,120
specifically like a small like suburb it's like oh yeah like it is San Diego but like it's called

687
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,880
Coronado it's like a like a like a jump away but like basically it's in the metro area like like

688
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:11,280
they're the same city basically uh yeah so like like if I were to say something there then no

689
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,960
matter what I would have someone who hates me and it's just like like you just have to play

690
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,840
the mood constantly in whatever context that you're in you know it like if what I'm gonna say like

691
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:27,440
here beneficial to me because I'm just gonna come out right here and say it like I censor myself

692
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:34,400
sometimes like while I like realize the value and meaning and saying nigger I realize that like

693
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,720
you know like this will make this will make my friend sad if I say nigger and like you know

694
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:47,360
like like like saying like fuck you know a generic swear word is incredible and makes you a better

695
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:55,280
person on average but like going to a funeral only sometimes it only sometimes experiences yeah yeah

696
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:03,200
only sometimes can you say fuck and like you know like like it only sometimes improves the experience

697
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,320
but I've been kicked out of far too many morgues to continue my hedonistic lifestyle of going up

698
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:14,880
to random corpses and screaming obscenities you know like like I like say nigger but I just have to

699
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,920
realize the mood and you know like like I'm fine like like I care about relationship with my blue

700
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,040
blue friends more than I care about saying nigger in this exact moment like like in this context I

701
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,040
don't it just goes to show that like feelings is what dictates whether or not these things are okay

702
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,400
or not it's all an emotional state that defines this stuff yeah here's here's like on that point

703
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,040
is like another thing that you know it's kind of like stupid to say like sometimes censorship is not

704
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:46,080
even a big deal like it like people are just kind yes because like everything it's like you're not

705
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,040
supposed to to say certain things in certain places and sometimes it doesn't even fucking matter so

706
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:57,440
you know why not who cares like censorship isn't you know I was just trying to be like like like

707
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,160
extra blue pill like censorship is good sometimes like whoa that's something you don't hear that's

708
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,480
something you're not allowed to say a clickbait thumbnail they click on the video it's like

709
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,600
actually a far more reasonable point I mean like when you go and meet yeah if you go and meet like

710
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,040
you're fucking I don't know like you hang out with like your grandparents or something like

711
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,640
you're not gonna act the same way with your grandparents that you do on like your your red

712
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:26,240
pill podcast on the internet yeah exactly I act way more red pills with my I could you know maybe

713
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:32,240
there you were just in Germany probably visiting Hitler's great and saluting extensively I walk up

714
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,480
my grandmother all right guys time for another episode of arm retrieval you know Andrew house he

715
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:47,280
is a fucking nigger hack and he's like oh that much he's at it again yeah you only record arm

716
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,120
retrieval when they're in the room it doesn't make any sense yeah it just it just all follows apart

717
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:59,120
well I guess we we've gone through a gamut here so what else what else should we touch on before

718
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:04,080
we end our discussion I would like to talk about we've talked about like like the controversial

719
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,440
you know we're talking about nigger which by the way I just want to say like we've talked about all

720
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,720
the negatives and positives I love saying nigger as demonstrate the thing about nigger is that it's

721
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,680
the it's the it's the word that makes people the angriest so it's the one that you want to say

722
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,360
to piss people off which is why like nigger is such a common word okay can I can I can I

723
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:27,520
pose a question before we go for any further yeah me too good yeah yeah yeah okay is it do you

724
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,960
because I feel and maybe this is just me and that's why I want to pose the question see if I'm

725
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,160
like crazy or this is totally a thing are swear words and racial slurs the most fanatically

726
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,000
pleasing things to say yes or is that just me like that that is me as well that is like a lot of

727
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,280
it's some I think that the reason they become used as words meant to hurt people is because

728
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,040
they have a punchy sort of feeling to them like cunt you know you call somebody a cunt it feels great

729
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:58,080
yeah it's just of the way I don't know it's just all those they feel good to swear words because

730
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:03,040
I kind of hate that because it not not even just because like it gets you into trouble like racial

731
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,360
services do like you want to say them but just like I say fuck so much is because like it just it

732
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:14,080
feels good to say it yeah it feels great go to kinesthetics unironically I mean I I would I would

733
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:19,520
imagine that like racial slurs like like nigger wop kike like they're all they were come up with

734
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:25,280
like probably by like your smarmy sailor types just like leering over the bar at like those people

735
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,720
they don't fucking care for very much thank you very much uh so by christ he's a fucking gooke

736
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,760
he's a fucking wop you know like fuck that guy well well well well well well wop is the sound

737
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,200
that spadey makes me drop it down to the fucking ground like you're gonna drop a fucking italian's

738
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,400
head down to the fucking ground is that true is that where that fucking comes from I'm I'm I'm

739
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,520
fairly certain yet no that the sound of that greasy lock slapping against the floor tiles

740
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,920
wop is an abbreviation I think it stands I think it stands for without passport because they're like

741
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:59,440
illegal immigrants or something was the original idea that's what I heard like that that one's not

742
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:05,040
phonetically even um even kraut like like like the world war two thing right you call the germans

743
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:11,760
the krauts like that has like a consonants like whatever that word is like it has like a punchiness

744
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:18,720
like a like a sharpness to it any word like that is useful for for sounding like powerful

745
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,800
and in command and aggressive so any any any words that has ever been used to like hurt people has

746
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:31,280
had that sort of sound in it can we agree at least on this if nothing else that the the nation state

747
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:37,120
of knee chair must change its name to make me more comfortable looking at the world map

748
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,800
it's the only thing I it's not really dragging down the rest of us with that shit like how

749
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,840
how are we supposed to operate in this blue pill feminized cuck world that I live in and advocate

750
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,360
for every day on my blue pill podcast the pcp that how can I live knowing there's a country called

751
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:59,040
nigger how can I live with that I just it it tears me up it's truly too much to bear those

752
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,600
black people are the most racist against black people in the world and it's a big problem for

753
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,240
me we should fucking bomb the fuck out of it destroy wipe it off the map kill all people

754
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:15,280
there just just forget about it indeed nuclear bomb I the reason like the reason I like nigger

755
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:20,240
it's funny that you bring up like it's like it is the worst so it's funny to make it is the worst

756
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:27,600
but I don't I don't actually agree with like I like I don't set out none of my actions are

757
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:33,040
inherently to make other people upset that is usually actually the opposite of what I want to

758
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,480
do oh of course yeah but it's it's like it's the reason they're fun to say yeah because it's like

759
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,040
you're just you're just a ball of like insane energy and like you're obviously not like when

760
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:50,000
you go on a rant about how Kirby is your fucking nigger forget who in the world would like ever

761
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,880
be offended by such a thing it would be inconceivable to be like that's like we're talking about

762
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,960
context and that's like so important right the context of that has nothing to do with like a

763
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:04,320
racial insult you know yeah exactly people get so pissed off when you say those words because of

764
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:10,800
like the con like the historical kind of usage of them yeah but at the same time like it's when

765
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,240
you when you're saying something like that there's no insulting context like is it really more offensive

766
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:20,320
for me to go up to a black person be like you fucking nigger than is to go up to a black person

767
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,320
be like the color of your skin disgusts me and makes you feel like you're less of a human being

768
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:35,360
than i am right right dude you should do a prank video okay here's where i where i drop like a

769
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:42,960
munchy lower bomb because there's actually a reason i use nigger a lot uh in the context that i do

770
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:49,120
i almost got through the entire show and not saying it damn it i was so close i um this doesn't

771
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,600
happen always because i've kind of fallen off the bandwagon and it's just it's just too fun to say

772
01:10:53,600 --> 01:11:00,720
nigger and i say in context and i let my discipline down however the original reason i i set out to use

773
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,520
nigger a lot is because one like like the most important thing about it is that it's phonetically

774
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,840
pleasing and it's really punchy and fun to say absolutely it's just like how drawing a swastika

775
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:17,920
just feels yeah it just feels right it just is good yeah but i i i i realize i like like i am again

776
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,440
a blue-pilled cuck and you know i didn't want to make anyone feel bad that i was using the term

777
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:30,640
nigger even though i just wanted to in the base of my soul so i tried to remove nigger from its

778
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:37,200
cultural context as much as possible that's the thing right there in the curbie episode there are

779
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:45,040
no black people i am not saying this like like this african this this fucking slave here i'm

780
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:51,520
saying this like this like snail this like gross snail monster is a nigger what does that mean

781
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,280
exactly the answer is that it means absolutely nothing and to remove that from its actual

782
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,160
cultural context just makes it a fun thing to say the only way i think that someone could like take

783
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,240
this in an insulting way is they'd be like okay the fact that you're calling a character a nigger

784
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,600
means that you're saying like oh this person is as lowly as the lowly nigger would be like the thing

785
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,200
they're i want to say i'm with you though like what you're doing is robbing it of its insulting

786
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:24,960
significance yeah yeah i feel the same way because i okay i like the i like the feeling of like being

787
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,840
like an asshole and throwing out insults and like treating people you know like like like i'm so

788
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:36,720
fucking great i'll call you some i'll just be like you suck peon but i also hate hurting people's

789
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:43,920
feelings yes me too i know exactly same so exactly so what i so what i often do my favorite insults

790
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,920
are the ones that mean literally nothing that's why my favorite insult is to call someone a fuck

791
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,960
because what does that mean nothing right yeah there's there's that that insult has no content

792
01:12:52,960 --> 01:13:01,840
to it at all my favorite type of insult and like threat of violence are the ones where there isn't

793
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:08,160
actually any violence being like conveyed yeah like i'm not actually say i'm not actually

794
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:13,440
saying like i'm going to hurt you my my favorite insults i'm gonna pick you up i'm gonna i'm gonna

795
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,960
pick you up i'm gonna put you down like like like like like what does that mean what does that

796
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,760
mean exactly carries all the attitude it carries all the attitude of bravado of like a threat without

797
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,560
any actual threat being exactly it's like it's like beyond like swearing it's like a post swear

798
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:39,520
it's like so yeah sometimes what i like doing is is instead of like doing any of that violent

799
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:46,160
stuff it's just to to wish like a very mild and non-sonic die like like like i like i hope i hope

800
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,200
you stub your toe and then you know you fall over like like something like that wouldn't hurt but it

801
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,080
would hurt you know like it would just like fuck i'm really annoyed that i still you know i think

802
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:01,920
we all really like utilizing these very like light you know it's kind of magical about those is that

803
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,240
yeah if you if you say i hope you know fuck you i hope you go die like they're just like you know

804
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,680
whatever but you say fuck you i hope you stub your toe and then later they stub their toes like damn

805
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:15,280
it they did it to me that's true that's true that that that that kind of that kind of sticks with

806
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:21,360
you i feel like i feel like this post swearing world's a world i want to live in now yeah get

807
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,600
together everybody i cannot wait for the hashtag post swear to cash on i'm so happy

808
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,400
well guys everyone else i mean i feel like we've done a quiet i'm glad that we got to this point

809
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,720
at the end this is this is where i was immediately thinking that the discussion would go i i just

810
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:47,920
want to comment before on the overuse the idea of angry video game nerd syndrome as as i've titled

811
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:57,040
the use of using too many swear words okay i view it a lot like legendary pokemon like the

812
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:04,800
useless terrible yes it yes almost exactly because okay the reason i like swear words

813
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,560
and i think we all do is because they they are special as even though we will say you know

814
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,960
swear words aren't that bad and you know you should be able to say swear words to kids and you know

815
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:21,120
scream obscenities at your toddlers and that should be okay at the end of the day it's almost good

816
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,760
that they that they that is that gives them their power if i heard it's what i said at the very

817
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:32,800
beginning yeah well i'm saying i'm i'm saying it better because i'm not you get okay okay sir

818
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:40,320
on that topic i think the point you're making i watched a little video by by a man named steve

819
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,680
recently yeah it was just about how legendary i was just about to recite that is our piece of

820
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:51,040
shit and terrible and how you had to fucking search for mute two and the original birds and

821
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:56,000
dig in deep down deep inside and catch them uh that was the good shit uh stop giving me legendary

822
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,520
pokemon pokemon your your shit okay they really give you a very straightforward in sudden moment

823
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,600
they just give them to you basically yeah yeah wait yeah you get to the end of the game and then

824
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,840
you get them what you have to catch them and the game will not let you proceed until you catch

825
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,000
them so you you are forced to catch them and they won't even object they immediately go in the ball

826
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,120
if you just throw the ball so i guess look i i guess lucario is not a legendary but they just give

827
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:25,120
you a lucario well that's bad too i want to earn my black and white i forget all right well pokemon

828
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,880
sucks gen two was the best gen two was the best objectively actually gold and soul silver that

829
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:36,480
is the peak pokemon experience and if something you're not allowed to say i like gen three that's

830
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:41,760
the good one nobody likes gen three get that is literally the most popular opinion as i say

831
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,400
nate says no one likes gen three i hate those fucking trumpets i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna

835
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:09,200
what takes at least six points off the metagame score it does critic score six out of ten too much

836
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:14,720
trumpets ign reveal anything anything like gen four or later if that's your favorite pokemon

837
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:19,760
you're a literal baby and you don't matter will you like the day that you're black and white too

838
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:25,040
black and white too is a great fucking oh you're a baby get the fuck out of here if you're not you

839
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:30,560
guys into one other how about that gen three is your favorite pokemon game you're you're you're a

840
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:37,120
literal autistic uh uh uh sixth grader is what i'm gonna say gen four is the best generation

841
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:44,640
you're objectively no no no i have no respect for you i i'm so fucking elated an option for

842
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,440
favorite gen of pokemon i'm so fucking happy that the the the the big argument was just pokemon

843
01:17:49,440 --> 01:18:00,080
okay we're all on the same page we're all on the same page about trans issues about gamergate

844
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,720
about all of that like that like we've solved that we've solved that we're onto the real problems

845
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,520
now look look all the trans issues and the racist stuff that was the cellular level now we're

846
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,840
moving on to work what does it mean to feel like you're that you like the generation one pokemon

847
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:19,200
more what does that mean to feel like the discussion about which pokemon gen is is best is so much

848
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,640
more relevant to my life than the trans debates and the trans issues so uh that's why i care about

849
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,600
it to go back what i was saying just to just close this up uh i don't like it when you know

850
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,760
people just say fuck or shit randomly as i demonstrated in the plea of the weeb oh god kill

851
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:42,320
me the reason that's not cool is because you there is no classroom there's no there's no sense of like

852
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:48,320
oh god he's saying that word right now he's making me conscious ever to say that now it is important

853
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:54,000
and it's just yeah like everything you know what i will say if you're if your undertale is like is

854
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,560
is at maximum intensity all the time yeah there will be no peaks and valleys in your undertale

855
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,840
and it'll be a bad undertale so here's i think specifically in media i think that over swearing

856
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,880
had its time like i think i think the angry video game nerd in particular is a great historical

857
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,520
snapshot of how media has evolved with the rise of the internet because if you watch an episode

858
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,400
of south park or something on tv back when the internet like youtube was still a wee babe and

859
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,880
they had like a swearing spree it was just like a bunch of bleeps and it just turned into nothing

860
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,560
whereas you watch like an episode of the angry video game nerd having only been able to watch tv

861
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,480
and youtube being a baby thing all of a sudden this guy's on a screen stringing swears together

862
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:35,120
that you only hear with your friends like holy shit this is crazy and that was really novel

863
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,680
for a time now it's like past sake because everybody can do it so now we're now we're in the

864
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:45,200
post swearing uh society makes me feel bad i really i think i think that's true i think that

865
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:50,560
like i think that like the older generations like are more like baby boomers are really offended

866
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:56,160
by swear words and like millennials as been saying the ultimate baby boomer you know what's

867
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:00,560
interesting uh i've actually been getting some comments recently on like unlike my star wars

868
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,280
video for example that i made on my channel um we're like i've distinctly noticed like some older

869
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,800
people you know probably like old school star wars fans like clicked on the video to watch it

870
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,120
where i'm like comparing star trek doesn't matter which i say star wars i meant star trek i meant

871
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:19,760
star trek um and uh i know i would never talk about star wars grace yeah you cannot say star wars

872
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:25,360
to me don't say it's all it's all star trek all day uh and i know like i've actually been taking

873
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,400
some notice of this myself how i use the word fuck like a lot all the time just in like my

874
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:35,760
daily speech and i actually think it's a little bit getting in the way of the message i'm trying

875
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,320
to convey like in my weyagawa videos so i've actually been thinking that i'm trying to actually

876
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:45,440
reduce it just because i don't like for the for the vehicle that that show is i don't think it

877
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,440
actually like adds to it particularly and i think if it distracts people from the point i'm trying

878
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,720
to make then like i wouldn't want to whereas you know something like uh like but what i will say

879
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:59,120
is like guys like digi or like i don't know uh like other other youtubers who are just common

880
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:04,160
like interweaving just the word fuck into the script just you know like once in a while has

881
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:09,840
become super common and like everybody does it now whereas like older like on tv of course it

882
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,080
would never happen so i i actually like that the words these swear words have been like more

883
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:19,440
interwoven into everyday usage and to use them sparingly is like not even blinked at people

884
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:25,120
don't even bat an eye at like just the insertion of the word fuck at like a uh a relatively

885
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:30,160
appropriate moment and i think that is a very positive way that we're gone i like it i i i

886
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:36,240
completely agree it yeah i mean swear words they really always have been like um if you want to

887
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:42,400
be controversial you use them so and now like in the internet you can find all types of different

888
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:49,360
people you can find you know if i'm in a world on a like a potato cam if i'm in a like a like a

889
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,840
like a place full of red peeled people i'll say something blue peeled to rile them up because

890
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:58,960
i like doing that i mean it's funny yeah for me it's like in a place full of blue peeled i'll say

891
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,200
it you know maker or whatever it's for me it's like it's like uh it's similar to how i think there

892
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:09,600
should be a state enforcement to include a certain percentage of like erotic content in all media

893
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,800
i think they should be enforced and the reason is because with increasing control parents have

894
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,720
over their children and how they won't let them go out and just like fuck strangers the way they

895
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,680
used to i think it behooves us to make sure that children are exposed to a certain degree of sexual

896
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,400
content so they know what the fuck's going on this is a literal thing i'm passing legislation in my

897
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,480
state at the moment and we're going to expand it globally soon enough so uh i really like i really

898
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,400
like that's the quotas that people want to see everybody that's what you're going to be saluting

899
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,560
that's the flag you're going to salute in the morning had fucking uh a christmas day everybody

900
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,760
get ready for it what are you gonna do when they start having like uh racial and sexual orientation

901
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:53,840
quotas in the the the sexual content they expose children to that's just oh no well you know i'm

902
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,640
i'm 100 anti-race mixing i can there could be none of that there could be none of this right okay

903
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,680
yeah that'll be a big problem we'll deal with that when it comes out where are you still here

904
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,840
you'll have a pow wow with richard spencer it doesn't matter it was it was a fucking joke

913
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:08,080
card of me and i just want to say briska just so you can cross that out before we move on to

914
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,720
questions i have a i have a question for all you just what you're what's your read on this

915
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,680
okay our opinion on like the whole trans thing are we in the majority or are we in the minority

916
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:25,600
of what the real majority of like real people right yeah well i don't know i'm like i really am

917
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,560
no i do you know what i think it is i think we're in the majority i just think because of the the uh

918
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:37,120
the culture uh you're not allowed to say it yeah so it's not presented very off so i guess we've

919
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:42,880
been punching down pretty hard this episode i would imagine zero point one percent of the

920
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,560
population well they have a loud voice they have a loud ass voice online so i don't feel that bad

921
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:55,120
i would imagine that like the majority of people who are explicitly against trans people are probably

922
01:24:55,120 --> 01:25:02,560
not as nuanced as we are and while we may be in like the majority of like we're skeptical of this

923
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:08,480
our exact opinions and formations of our thoughts are probably different i don't know i don't know if

924
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,280
we would be necessarily in the minority i'd like to think i i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure that the

925
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,840
people in the comments aren't going to see it that way it's just i i think literally oh no we

926
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:24,640
will be dead we are done goodbye i want everyone to be as happy and healthy as possible i simply

927
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:30,000
do not agree that the methods that these people have selected as the optimum one are necessarily

928
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,080
that and i would like to see more evidence that that's the case i agree that's my position i mean

929
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,760
that's my opinion the reason i overflow with empathy for these people but go on the reason we

930
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,880
would you know reason we were talking about it in in the first place was is because like because

931
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,920
we can't talk about it but that you can't talk about it because they have their claws i mean

932
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,720
not to imply they have claws it's like they're fucking deep monsters but like that's the master

933
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,760
kids who have the claws you just you're just everybody's like like the majority of people can't

934
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,760
speak the the way they want right yeah it's kind of silly but that's right here on the on the pcp

935
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,600
we have an open mic for any ideas all the time well they're they're gonna it's it's gonna be like

936
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,240
those dudes that were fucking around on me on twitter they're gonna say like well you can have

937
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,280
your opinion but you shouldn't say it because it's regressive and because like you're you're like

938
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:26,080
hurting you're like hurting society by spreading around the way you feel about this issue that

939
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:30,960
usage of the word regressive really got me that's them just saying like no my opinion is confirmed

940
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,560
the correct one you cannot argue yeah like i said i'm not i said i'm not gonna agree with anything

941
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,360
for the sake of progressivism and then he took that as a as an admission that i was that i was

942
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:47,040
regressive which it was not oh my god fuck yep i love the the words and that should be another

943
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,320
episode fucking like bullshit semantics that people use i hate that oh god that i couldn't

944
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:57,280
do an episode on that we got speaking of this but here's a great question i love this one actually

945
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:02,240
there's a lot going on with this so this is from the twitter everybody we do the thing follow us

946
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:07,040
at tpcrastinators on saturdays we record so that you see the tweet where we ask for them questions

947
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:12,800
using the hashtag ask pcp thing we also pull questions from the procrastinators chat so if

948
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,920
you're right of course you get access to the discord server and we'll pull questions from

949
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:21,040
there more often because you love us and we'll love you back that's how indeed but listen to this one

950
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:31,520
okay at gabe 11 gabe w underscore 11 asks is it wrong to want to see others not succeed in life

951
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:38,640
if their career is already heading towards failure oh no there's a lot i think i think that

952
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,640
well i think if i think that's i need a minute to parse that good i think that means you care

953
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,720
about them if you think well exactly if you think that's exceeding at their chosen thing is going

954
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,600
to be bad for them in the long run yeah i think you should i think yeah you should want them to

955
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:57,360
fail at it yeah that makes sense to me yeah um well i mean i'm trying to think of like an example

956
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:02,160
where that would not work hey i've got one for you i've got an example of this so there was this

957
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:06,960
there was this guy who went on the shark tank and he advertised this game and it was called like

958
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,360
boulder ball builder ball it was some like game oh yeah i know i know what you're talking about

959
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:18,720
yeah like this man had spent like a decade a trying to make this sport an olympic sport

960
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,880
and was like going around had sold his house had had divorced his wife or he like his marriage

961
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:28,000
had collapsed like his life was in shambles because he was trying so hard and he believed

962
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,960
to a pathological degree you might say that this game was going to be successful and he would not

963
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:39,360
stop until it became as successful as he wanted to be and like the sharks were like dude you need

964
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:45,280
to stop this is not going to happen it's not going to work out and it was called bullet ball

965
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,160
i have bullet ball yeah okay bullet ball and uh it was it was a nightmare like he listening to his

966
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:57,200
story but the amazing thing is ultimately he did find some small success with it in like uh i don't

967
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,720
know exactly how but like he did manage to get a little bit of his toe in the door yeah like it's

968
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:07,920
i'm seeing that it's it's it's part of the senior olympics now right or it became part of it so

969
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,560
yeah someone somewhere picked it up it didn't become an olympic sport but jesus christ someone

970
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,840
someone maybe he met senior olympics all along it just wasn't saying it i don't i don't know i mean

971
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,880
i'm sure it's a perfectly playable game and i'm sure it's an okay game it's an okay game but like

972
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,880
okay but the question is was it worth it was it fucking worth it did he losing his wife that

973
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,520
depends on the metrics you're measuring like is it personal satisfaction or is it like tangible

974
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:38,320
asset like i think i think the only reason i think the only reason you should um wish for the

975
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:44,080
the failure of someone is because if they succeed it will be like actually bad for you in some

976
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:51,040
tangible way yeah otherwise it shouldn't really be part of you but like i mean if you care about

977
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:55,600
them and like this is gonna kill them then you know that's that's different but if it's like

978
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:00,480
they're they're living a worse life but they appear happier like if they're going down a road that

979
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:04,720
you cut like the sort of drifting apart from you is it really your place to like decide where

980
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:09,520
their life goes if they like it more i think you have to respect their time like don't interfere

981
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,840
you can hope that if something looks really bad like man i hope that i hope i think it's less

982
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,000
about if it's someone you care about it's less about hoping they fail but hoping they change

983
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
directions right you're not right you hope right yeah like if you get some sort of something

984
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,280
improves if you're getting a sadistic pleasure from watching your friends fail like i mean that's

985
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:31,920
that's not that's you know maybe i guess i shouldn't judge what makes you happy either but like

986
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,720
that's not really like what we want society to be built on so i think that that would be uh

987
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:42,160
fairly safe to say that's a negative thing to do and you probably wouldn't want to do it um

988
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:47,200
yeah i think but no i think gibbs right the only time you really want to actively hope for someone

989
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,320
failing is like if you're in for an interview and the person before he's interviewing first

990
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:55,440
man i hope they fuck it up right right anything like that anything like that that's that's perfectly

991
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:03,760
reasonable i got a question from the procrastinator's patreon lounge you can donate for just one

992
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:09,920
dollar uh get in here you can fucking scream as loud as you can and we're all contractually

993
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:16,000
obligated to hear you yeah it's true um by griffy what is your least favorite i'm gonna

994
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,400
expand this to least favorite and possibly the favorite thing that's happened as a result of

995
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:27,920
the existence of the pcp uh okay so i mean this friend group or specifically the podcast

996
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:34,000
i would i would imagine like the podcast i would i would like or the podcast or you know like like

997
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,680
the culture surrounding it as a result of it being a podcast uh i make money my favorite thing

998
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:44,960
that's the best thing that's true that's not bad yeah the best thing about the pcp is that it

999
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:52,960
lets me do my other stuff yeah absolutely yeah but i think my favorite thing about it is uh radcon

1000
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:58,800
that was the fun radcon and i mean i mean well i'll take it i mean i do enjoy being on the show

1001
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:04,880
and and hanging out with y'all like i always have fun actually doing the podcast yeah that's my i mean

1002
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:10,080
long before the pcp made money i mean it's no secret that i am the beating heart of the pcp

1003
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:14,720
that keeps this this machine lumbering along and a lot of that i think just came from the

1004
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,760
fact that i had moved out to a new city and i didn't like have friends out here or anything i

1005
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,520
didn't know anybody and i felt a strong desire to to keep conversation going with these guys online

1006
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,320
so like i was always there like let's do it let's fucking do this because like this was my excuse

1007
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,640
because like again this was a big thing before the podcast there was like never an excuse to like

1008
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,880
getting calls and talk it's true with you guys like you have to be like you guys i'm so sad i

1009
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,520
need to fucking talk about i think it's safe to say nate that if you hadn't started the pcp we would

1010
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:48,240
not be nearly as close as we are now i probably would have fallen off the map with a lot of you

1011
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:52,720
just because we don't because we didn't we don't have like a fandom thing to keep us all talking

1012
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:57,680
and stuff like we all kind of went off in our own directions and if we didn't have this to to galvanize

1013
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:02,800
our our group i think it would have would have definitely weakened if not and i it's true i think

1014
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,320
some people might be inclined to think i don't know i just want to say like on that point some

1015
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:11,200
people might think that's the mark of like a a weaker bond or a weaker friendship and i just

1016
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,600
want to challenge that completely if anyone's thinking that that there is nothing that is that

1017
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:22,400
is the mark of of a group of intellectual gods going to your own thing yeah we're we're i mean

1018
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:27,200
capitalism in general and like the the free market decision to do what you want in life

1019
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,280
like allows you to self-select for the kind of people that you want to spend your time with

1020
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:36,400
and interact with and so like like you can't choose your fucking parents you know so like you

1021
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,160
should have i don't know i was tweeting about this the other day like you should have standards for

1022
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:44,960
like whether or not you want to continue to even associate with like the people that you had no choice

1023
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,400
of being involved in when you were growing up like if your parents are monsters it's perfectly

1024
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:52,560
reasonable to not associate with them and if like you guys were shit i wouldn't hang out with you

1025
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,640
but i choose to because they're all my brothers and it's great and i love you all thank you and

1026
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:01,280
like and like even before the pcp made any money or even looked like it might ever make any money

1027
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:06,800
like we were all we were we were like there was never any question of like let's not do this anymore

1028
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:13,120
because yeah i love i love my paycheck from the pcp but i'd do it for free yeah and we did a lot

1029
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:18,240
of us for a long time for a long time yeah well some was part of his question the least favorite

1030
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:24,000
thing yeah as well oh that's true i forgot i want to say my favorite thing was either like like

1031
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:29,440
hippo the rad con too or just recently going out to meet ben that was truly incredible and it was a

1032
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:36,080
great time and it was fun great so it was fucking great uh it was blissful yeah i can't wait to do

1033
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:41,520
it again i mean the worst thing about the pcp as an organization by far is is the kind of issues

1034
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,400
that arise just from a group of people working and have clashing ideology sometimes and uh you

1035
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,640
know we they may have not have been an incident where someone had to leave you know that wasn't

1036
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:55,920
fun and uh things like that are pretty much stand out as the things you don't want to have to do

1037
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:03,440
for me i think i think we can all agree that this i think i want to say uh i i i i'm sorry monkey

1038
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:11,520
i i i i don't hate you uh but i i feel bad about the whole situation oh yeah it was real it was

1039
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:17,760
real shitty it was real shitty yeah actually i'm mad i was gonna make a joke but then you made it all

1040
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,720
serious and yeah i'm just gonna echo that it was you know that oh well here's gib cutting off jokes

1041
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:27,680
how does it like taste in your own medicine i can't even make the joke now because my joke is going

1042
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:35,040
to say the worst part was jeff and i can't even make that it's real got him jeff's career i love

1043
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:40,240
you jeff um yeah the monkey situation make no mistake we were all upset about it awdy and so

1044
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:45,360
none of us were happy about it no no yep yep yep yep it's some of us for different reasons

1045
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:51,280
and others yeah but any of the worst things uh i can't really think of any no i mean that's pretty

1046
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:58,880
great in it yeah everything else is great yeah yeah yeah especially the money yeah i i love every

1047
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:04,080
month this is like it is literally my favorite part of the month to just like calculate the finances

1048
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:08,640
of the pcp and like divvy it up appropriately and make sure and check off my little boxes when

1049
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:15,120
everyone's gotten paid i feel so great about it it is it is a pleasure to do it and uh i just watch

1050
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:20,640
as our financial empire slowly grow and can feel that's my favorite thing it's my favorite you're

1051
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:25,280
always posting like you're always posting graphs of like look at like look at our performance like

1052
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:30,400
look at our revenue yeah look at the upward trend and i gotta say i appreciate it a lot damn right

1053
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,680
right it does make me feel like my life is on an upward curve in some way despite everything else

1054
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:41,200
being a dumpster fire it's good to know that there's some glimmer of hope there that's good that's

1055
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:47,120
everyone's saying the generic like oh yeah i i i like money i like money and i do like money

1056
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:53,200
however i want to go with like to the black pilled extreme and say that that that that my favorite

1057
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:00,480
aspect of the pcb that might be my favorite about vanity is seeing people say that they like me and

1058
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:06,160
that i am the best pcp member that's what i striped or yeah whoever someone says that i'm the best pcp

1059
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:11,200
member i know like oh of course that is true thank you very much you're a polarizing figure but you

1060
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,280
do get a lot of people saying you're the best and that they're here for you and i will say

1061
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:21,040
social currency is just as fun to collect as the actual currency so you know you're not wrong yeah

1062
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:26,240
i feel like i feel like um i feel like i'm a i'm kind of a dark horse kind of a cult favorite

1063
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:31,200
i feel like i'm not the most popular but i but i feel like there's a like there's a like there's

1064
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:36,800
sizable minority of people that are that are solidly in ben's camp and i appreciate them so much

1065
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,000
i feel like i don't know what i'm doing lately but people i've gotten a couple comments who

1066
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,160
like oh tom's pretty cool i'm just like yes notice me you know the mysterious satisfaction i need

1067
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:54,480
yeah i i feel like i'm like the the token favorite like everyone has to say they like a hippo because

1068
01:37:54,480 --> 01:38:00,160
you know i like you just do anything negative at all like as the the absolute everybody gets

1069
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:04,320
tired of some weird utilitarianism every once in a while or they're you know they

1070
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,480
whatever or ben you know like there's only so much trash you can eat out of the dumps before

1071
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:14,400
you take it before but before they just get old but yeah exactly but never you stop the podcast

1072
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,920
this episode dead in its tracks twice with like three words great just yeah it was great it was

1073
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,320
great so i i certainly agree uh that it's it's great there's a reason you're the one pitching

1074
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,960
shows and not us it's because yeah well that's not because i made funny jokes you're like you're

1075
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:34,320
like the the you're like the the blueberries in the blueberry pancakes of the podcast you know

1076
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,960
juicy sweet bits that you love it's true you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying that's

1077
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:47,920
that's what i don't like blueberries oh i don't like you yeah i don't like you berries yeah uh

1078
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:53,360
excellent what was i gonna say oh oh it related to this topic uh there happened to be on four

1079
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:58,480
chan the other day a thread uh it was actually about digi something about mario odyssey i think

1080
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:03,680
or something you know that shit um stupid and within it there a discussion about the pcp emerged

1081
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:09,120
and three individual tier lists were posted as for who were the best i just want to say now this is

1082
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:14,240
four chan which i am a close ally of so it makes sense that they would like me but i was the top

1083
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:21,200
contender on all of them on all of them i was number one so that's not true i was i was the

1084
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:26,640
top contender on a bunch of them i specifically remember that i was a different thread i was

1085
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:32,640
consistently ranked high tier one guy was like liking ben saint and someone else and someone else

1086
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:40,240
came in and shat all over him for his for his deviant opinion who may or may not have been me

1087
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:45,840
you're in every episode it's all it's your show and so and i was going to say though the fact that

1088
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,560
i talk so fucking much and i'm still liked is a pretty good indicator that my that the quality

1089
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:56,240
of my average contribution is is good is positive so you know i'm the best we'll see about you're

1090
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:01,440
gonna see about that more than you would like in a few minutes i think you're getting a little too

1091
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:08,080
big for your britches i will say that one time i hosted the show i got a lot of positive comments

1092
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:13,120
and people wanted me to replace you more often so just keep an eye out for that buddy it could just

1093
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:16,240
be that host bump it could be the host it could be the host it could be the host it could be the host

1094
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:22,880
angle for the pcp dictation so hard i'm gonna roll in my communist revolution here you just

1095
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:30,560
yeah oh that was the best part of the pcp no like like saying that tom is a communist and having

1096
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,400
everyone agree with me and then being that then him saying like it was what makes you think that

1097
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:43,440
and we're all like oh we don't know we didn't question it was a real strizan effect moment

1098
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:49,120
in the pcp like there was no moment of origin but we were all unanimous that of course this is

1099
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:53,920
the funny thing is i didn't even know it was a thing until we had the the wrestling thing and

1100
01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:01,200
everyone's like oh you're a communist like i am why i don't know i don't fucking know it was good

1101
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:11,200
good times all around it was it was um it's because you wear a beret it's like a shake of art you

1102
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,600
know that honestly could be a real connection that might be like a real source of the though

1103
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,320
that's a tutor cap which is not quite the same but you know it's it's a we don't we don't talk about

1104
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:26,560
the tutor on educated americans they're all the fucking same right right another question from

1105
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:33,200
patreon lounge by the vacuuminator are there any songs you've listened to so much uh at one point

1106
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:42,400
in your life the lyrics have started to inform the way you've lived your life every song every song

1107
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:52,880
from the sponge bob musical um not not lyrics wise but i have listened to a lot of like led

1108
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:58,960
zeppelin songs to the point where i like off of the like off by heart i know exactly how all the

1109
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,280
drum solos and guitar solos go and i could play along with them you listen to them on the thing

1110
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:11,680
so much you are the black dog you are the stairway to heaven you are that yes yes i i just hum it to

1111
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:17,680
myself in my brain like every every day like i can i can replay a song a classic rock song in my head

1112
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:22,240
without having to turn on my mpc dude if this were a video game you would be like the designated

1113
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:27,120
npc that like you talk to to begin the bgm playing like a different song in the background after you

1114
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:31,680
collect the item oh my god associated with it that'd be you that's you in real life uh wait what

1115
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:37,600
was exactly the question like have you listened to it so much that you're gay yeah that you turn

1116
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,000
into a gay person wait no you talked over to her i didn't actually hear oh that it changes

1117
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,960
your life well it informs it informs the way you live your life uh like it changes you and it gives

1118
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:57,360
you new ideas in your old craning there i mean here's i don't know i like i'm hallowing at the

1119
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:04,320
moon a lot these days uh uh like i don't actually know most of the lyrics to like sorairo days the

1120
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,720
the garin login main theme but like i know i'm always on about it but like i listen to that song

1121
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:14,000
a lot and it like deeply emotionally moves me every single time i was thinking about like what

1122
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,080
my point was going to be that i it's not so much like lyrics of songs yeah like me but just like

1123
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:23,040
the context of songs presented it and kind of just the emotional gravitas of the instrumentation

1124
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:30,400
fucking you're not alone from final fantasy nine is like like that song just evokes such a strong

1125
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:35,440
moment like from that game of like i mean i'm not even going to go into it but it is by far

1126
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,840
the most emotionally powerful moment in final fantasy nine and it's devastating i actually have

1127
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:45,280
one you know i do actually have one uh if i can pink floyd's welcome to the machine yeah informed a

1128
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:50,720
lot of uh like like uh coming out of college having to think about looking for work uh not really

1129
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:55,280
knowing what to do and be like yeah now you're in the machine this is what it is all of hybrid

1130
01:43:55,280 --> 01:44:01,120
theory informed my my middle school years i'm not gonna lie i bet it was a walking meme at the time

1131
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:09,120
this is a like a little bit of a recent find for me so i i've got to see if it's truly changed my

1132
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:15,120
life but it's uh put in a lot of like like ideas in that i've been cooking in my brain it's like

1133
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:20,960
popped out and you know made me fully understand uh this guy this guy on bandcamp who did like like

1134
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:27,520
homestuck music he's a guy who made the music for s enter he like he's that guy michael bowman

1135
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:33,440
he's a real good singer songwriter guy and he's real is real fancy go listen to him uh

1136
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:38,480
fucking comfortable bugs that's my shit and uh that that's he learned all i love all of his

1137
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,920
lyrics and they feel like me there are me has there been a has there been a ceasefire in the

1138
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:48,080
bug wars that allows you to listen to comfortable bugs yes yes yes there has okay and and it's

1139
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:52,320
actually it's it's it's like cultural diversity i'm learning about so many different backgrounds

1140
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:57,200
i'm i'm unsure if this fight is you know good enough to continue oh by the way i just want to add

1141
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:02,160
like on a practical note like that that's serairo days and like like that song in lots of other like

1142
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:07,760
songs that evoke strong emotions in me i actually strategically deploy those songs like during my

1143
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,600
runs oh yeah i do as ways to like or like just when lifting to like force my like when i'm like

1144
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,320
halfway through a run if i just put on like serairo days like it like the i've been psychologically

1145
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:25,760
tricked it just kicks in in dorphin that just allows me to finish my run like easily so using it

1146
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,600
that way to like force my body to just obey its stupid biological impulses uh is very interesting

1147
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:39,680
and uh very fucking funny i do that all the time i like like i only listen to music in context of

1148
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,760
would it be cool if like i was in a movie and this song was playing right now to the audience

1149
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:48,400
like what this could be what's happening right now that's the only context i listen to any music

1150
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:54,560
i think i think of all music as like what would what would an s like a home stuck flash look like

1151
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:59,840
with this music yeah yeah what if what if i was having the baby and the baby was you what would

1152
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:06,240
that be what if i was a great arm retrieval right now what would that sound like the baby is you

1153
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:10,160
the baby is you changed my fucking life nothing was ever the same after i heard the baby is you

1154
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:17,680
yeah god it's it's like actually like my favorite album oh and by the way people that that is a

1170
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:09,440
is what i would describe my profession uh in stark contrast my favorite breakfast is uh to get a very

1171
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:16,320
small frying pan and put two bits of bacon and two eggs uh just in at the same time and just crush

1172
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,720
it around it like crush it and squish it around and then flip it over and it becomes like a

1173
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:26,320
like a like a writhing squidging mess of like a like an omelet pancake like bacon things please

1174
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:30,080
it's like it's like it's like a bacon omelet but it's just really messy and you you end up

1175
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,320
like mopping up all the grease wait i've got a problem with that i've got a problem i love that

1176
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:39,840
this sounds great just do it like fry bacon and then halfway through just put in okay i was gonna

1177
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,680
say i was gonna say the bacon's gonna take longer to cook so you gotta put that in first but i have

1178
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:48,960
one more there's one more i forgot there's actually a breakfast named after me um named after my real

1179
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:55,680
name uh it's not the ben saint it's the perfect beverage for the chat on the go uh the ben i'm

1180
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:00,800
listening the ben i won't say my last name even though i literally don't care if anyone knows it

1181
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,520
uh uh but uh it's coffee coffee with a scoop of chocolate protein powder in it and that is a great

1182
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:12,800
that is a great uh powerful breakfast treat that people people turn their nose up at the ben at

1183
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:18,960
the ben saint guy's last name two two points the wonder you just don't want to say it first first

1184
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,680
of all it inspired by that it's a bunch of Polish gobbledygook that's why i don't want to say it

1185
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:30,480
indeed it's a waste of everyone's time inspired by that drink ben i i have made my real name as well

1186
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:37,200
which is just the same thing however it's slightly different and for literal like like kill yourself

1187
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:44,320
you will die of a heart attack uh yes i guess the the toby fox an excellent yes yes an honor as

1188
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:50,240
always to have you here today here's if you want to be awake and also you're a fucking disgusting

1189
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:55,840
fat freak you take a scoop of chocolate ice cream and you put like two shots of espresso in it there

1190
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:01,440
you are going to be awake and also it's delicious i eat it it's a great uh all right all right all

1191
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,280
right you idiot it's extremely important about your fucking breakfast extremely important

1192
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,840
here's how you eat eggs you crack open the oak so the so the yoke spills out and then you dip

1193
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:14,800
your pancake slash steak into the yoke so it's like a sauce of course that's exactly yeah runny

1194
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:19,520
yokes are central ooh Nate Nate i used to i used to i used to think you were a big fucking weirdo

1195
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:23,680
for liking your your yokes runny but i saw the error in my ways and i would never have many other

1196
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:28,720
way and people if you are cooking your yokes you are just making your life worse just don't do it

1197
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:33,120
you're just wasting eggs they're wasting that flavor don't do it okay uh now everybody shut the

1198
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:37,600
hell up your your suggestions are terrible those are the worst because all that matters is that you

1199
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:43,120
are meeting your nutritional macro goals in your breakfast that's all that matters so here's i'll

1200
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:49,120
give you an option as well uh you have a bowl of oats just fucking steel cut oats you put uh uh you

1201
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:53,120
can put strawberries in the frozen strawberries cook that in that's for flavor if you're a weakling

1202
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:58,320
and need flavor like and that's fine indeed you can put sugar in but that's just extra calories

1203
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,960
count those fucking calories you coward uh and then you have a thing of water and chocolate

1204
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:08,160
protein patterns eat that all and i'll give you the option of having black coffee in addition

1205
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:13,360
if you're weak and need that kind of thing to wake up which i i actually do now so uh there you go

1206
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:18,720
that's it that's what you think it's all i have to say on the subject of things you can't say

1207
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:23,840
what about what about what about tom though tom didn't come i'm just i i i actually am starting

1208
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:29,840
to do the oatmeal thing a lot now uh because it's cheap and it's easy and it's fine and i don't care

1209
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,480
i want to turn into a machine if i could if i could remove my sense of taste i would do it

1210
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:40,000
it would improve my life dramatically absolutely but when i when i'm a weak boy i'm i'm fan of omelettes

1211
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,160
i like making omelettes i make omelettes all the time they're good i need protein because i don't

1212
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:50,480
eat meat because i'm a bitch so that's a good source and that's it protein and beans eat them

1213
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:56,000
i get canned beans all the time it's the best i was doing that before it became a pcp meme

1214
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,240
guys i i i would eat beans if you could eat them in an omelette could you do that could you do

1215
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:07,520
like a bean omelette anything in an omelette do you eat burrito yeah no problem no friday burrito

1216
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,640
i think they sell those fucking taco bell but beans are just delicious and especially fried or

1217
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:16,000
something they're they're really good it's good shit it's good shit i'm all about the bean life but

1218
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,320
i'm lazy and just eat them out of the can because fuck yeah fuck some parents things i don't

1219
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,440
know who's got time for that it's like 50 percent of it i just don't want to do dishes later so i'm

1220
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:28,320
like fuck i don't need a dish to get in the dish right here oh yes oh yes i hate no dish life that

1221
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:33,280
no dish life oh dude all right here's the thing you're not allowed to say i like washing dishes

1222
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:39,600
oh my god it's good what even are you i get it i get i can be relaxing it's not the worst thing

1223
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:44,240
in the world and like as chores go it's probably one of my no no no this is where this is where i'm

1224
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:48,000
gonna pull a weird utilitarianism that's wasting your time that's wasting your time doing things that

1225
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,560
don't matter he is right oh yeah you're just gonna do it again later it sucks i hate it and dishes

1226
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,360
are the worst because i'd still rather just not use a plate i don't think i don't well i i i i like

1227
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:03,200
it because of like the the the therapeutics sort of like i can just sort of like zone out while

1228
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:09,200
doing this it's it's as opposed to just vegging out watching a youtube video like it's it's you

1229
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:13,520
know the same amount of work is getting done in that i'm trying to relax i think you're maximizing

1230
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:18,480
your your happiness levels by watching something you enjoy as opposed to like doing a monday attack

1231
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,800
i mean i would i would like to listen to you to watch what i would do well yeah i mean i could do

1232
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:28,880
both i just i just like the the relaxing and the like sort of like standing there like the sound

1233
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:34,720
of water it's it's good it's good for my soul and therefore good for my motivation and productivity

1234
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:40,880
i eat i'll grant you it even though i don't agree i i i like cook soup i like boil the soup

1235
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:47,040
and then i eat it directly out of the pot i will never use a bowl ever because you have to handle

1236
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:51,600
on the pot yes it's true it's more convenient you're making it less convenient by using a bowl

1237
