00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today we're going to look at the term plebeian, often shortened to pleb.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Plebeians or plebs were Roman citizens, and they're often disparaged for being a very low status.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
However, this is not actually the case.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Plebs were much higher than slaves, for example, or even people who were not Roman citizens.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They were often looked down upon, especially in Republican times, by the much higher in status, patrician class.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Houses in the city were made of timber, mud brick, and later concrete.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Houses in the city were called Insole, and were 67 stories high.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello, are you a Roman citizen?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Drop and give me five push-ups.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Whatever you say.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In early ancient Roman history, women were strictly under the control of their husband or guardian.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They had very few rights.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey, you my wife, what are you doing out there?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I think I shopped a little too often.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, no, no, no, no. Today I expect you to take care of the house and do all the chores.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But I was kind of thinking since you'd be home, you could take care of that.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, you have no say in this family. I run it. You, back home.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I fucked up the first recording. I'm as bad as BenSaint at Patreon.com.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes. BenSaint, introduce yourself.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's 10.50 a.m. I'm hungover, and I have not been awake at this time since I was a baby.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And hippo shit.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hip replacement.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And, okay, let's get right into the news.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Our topic for the day was plebs.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Plebs, however you want to pronounce it, that's what it's about.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's this word defined by Urban Dictionary as,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to bring it back, to bring back the old tradition,

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
one whose inferior intelligence results in them making a complete, complete,

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I did that again, just like I did last time, what the fuck,

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
making a complete tit-face out of themselves in public.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This fails to go into the minutiae of the details, plebs.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So it's a Roman word that was like the opposite of patrician,

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
meaning one who's an idiot and a dumbass, and I don't give a shit about it.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that really what it means, idiot dumbass, or is it more specific?

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I mean patrician meant like the educated aristocratic class of the Roman society.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Would it be a kinted peasant, like you're just a peasant guy?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's pretty much exactly right.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, that's not how it's used now, and that Urban Dictionary definition

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
just means that it's stupid, and that's definitely wrong.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know, I think I just realized that pleb was the wrong word

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
for us to all cling to, because Philistine is what we really mean.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The way pleb is used now is what Philistine actually means,

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which is someone who doesn't understand the arts and is ignorant of...

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lacks appreciation for it.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Pleb implies some lack of appreciation as well.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, but that's not what it means originally.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I guess we use pleb more as noob, though.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't think it necessarily implies that you can't appreciate the arts,

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
is that you're just too noob.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When I see the thing of this word, I picture two people staying next to each other,

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
a patrician who's a gay art student at Rhode Island School of Design at RISD,

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and the pleb I think of as...

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Katy Perry posting rare pay-pays in her tweets.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right. That's exactly right.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, so I wanted to say...

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think one of the things about pleb is that it's usually used against somebody

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
after they've formulated an opinion on something.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If somebody says, I haven't seen that show yet, you don't call them a pleb,

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you tell them to watch it, and if they say, then you call them a pleb.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's an important distinction that I was going to get into.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I wouldn't call them a pleb if they watched it and were like,

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought that this part was out of character, and I'd say, you fucking pleb.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You don't understand character.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's where I would say Palestine, though.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's where I'd pull that one out.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, they're basically interchangeable in that level.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, yeah, just to set it, it's distinct.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We were thinking that it might be a little too similar to Normie's,

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but then I thought about it, and they really are totally distinct.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And I've got the perfect example.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
As we in the storytelling game like to call it,

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
the inciting incident for this podcast was a conversation I had with my roommate,

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
who's coincidentally also named Ben, who I now hate.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Who you accidentally called instead of actual Ben.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, yeah, this morning I was calling Ben.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I called the other one. He was still asleep, yeah.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so we were driving down the road, we were going to lunch,

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and the topic of just anime came up,

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
which I don't talk about with these guys too much,

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
because, frankly, they don't know nearly as much as me,

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so it's kind of boring for me to talk about.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like, have you seen Cowboy Bebop?

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, yes, I've seen Cowboy Bebop, I like it.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes, 15 years ago, I was a child, actually.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So we were talking about that, and to my amazing surprise,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
he had actually watched Konosuba last season.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He had watched it on Netflix or something,

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and I was shocked, I was shocked.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So this guy, I'm starting to think,

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
well, maybe this guy does get it,

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
because where's this Final Fantasy VII shirt sometimes?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He plays a lot of Vigia, we talk about games and shows,

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and he's got decent, yeah, that's right,

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
if you weren't a Final Fantasy VII shirt, you're a smart individual.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So I'm thinking this guy's got some pretty decent taste.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But then, when I asked him what he thought about Konosuba,

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
my favorite show of last year, or the last season, whatever,

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
he just said, meh, it was okay.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He thought Konosuba was just okay?

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He thought it was meh, he thought it was okay,

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and this is what really did it, when he said,

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it was like Sword Art Online only boring.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
These are the words he said to me,

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and he didn't know he was signing his fucking death warrant

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
when he said those fucking words,

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it's like he put a curse on himself.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So I then tried to explain to him why Konosuba,

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I mean, I didn't even get into the Sword Art Online thing.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I just tried to explain why Konosuba was better than what he thought,

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
because he was bringing up all these points,

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and this is where the pleb factor comes in.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He was bringing up all these points about like,

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
dude, it's just another game, it's just another show,

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
where a dude gets sucked into a video game world,

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and gets all these powers, and meets a bunch of girls,

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and they have these silly adventures,

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and the lighthearted tone is funny at times,

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but isn't as interesting as something like a death battle

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
like in Sword Art Online.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is exactly why Sword Art Online is,

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not gonna, you know what?

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's a big problem.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know what he's doing? He's a big problem in the universe.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's just latching onto the tangible details

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
of the fact that they both take place in a game,

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
so he's like, oh, they're similar shows.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's what most people do.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And the reason why he's doing that is because

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
he doesn't have as broad an experience with these,

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
he doesn't understand what Konosuba is trying to do,

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and that's what makes him a plebe,

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and that's why plebes are the biggest problem in the universe.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And that's where I want to start.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I would agree with everything.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm just, I'm imagining myself in this scenario,

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and my first reaction.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If he said that to me, I know the first thing I do

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
would be to burst out laughing,

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
like his sterical hyena laughter would be my first response.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then I would probably insult him,

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and his intelligence, because I'm a dick,

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and I don't have that.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, when I'm on YouTube,

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can type the comment and delete it,

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but in person it's just like the first thing that comes to mind

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is like, ha, you're wrong!

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then I might, depending on how he took the insults,

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I would then go into my 50-point breakdown

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
of why he's wrong.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes. That was the plan.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I mean, that also implies that he didn't find sort of online boring.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's like one of his favorite shows.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He says it's one of his favorite shows he's seen.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, you know, we got, there's a lot to sort out with this dude, you know?

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey, I'm curious, have you actually seen Sort Out Online?

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Nope. I've seen like episode one.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I have never seen any of Sort Out Online.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you guys could be considered a little unfair.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Um, no.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh yeah, I don't have any, I can't judge anyone.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't even care about his opinion on Sort Out Online.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I only care about his opinion on Konosuba,

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
which I know for a fact is a great show.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And to say it's meh, it's unforgivable.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Like Sort Out Online only boring.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you guys had seen Sort Out Online, you'd understand

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that what particularly bothers me about that statement

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is that Sort Out Online is fucking boring.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Like, by far and away, my biggest criticism of Sort Out Online

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
is that it's unbelievably and sufferably boring,

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
because it has like this really strong start

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
where the first two episodes set up this death game thing

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and like set up all these high stakes and stuff,

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and like episode three is dramatic,

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and then after that the entire rest of the show is nothing.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nothing happens, it's fucking boring, nothing matters.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I think he's one of these guys who is satisfied in a show

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
by it being, and we don't need to talk about Ben forever.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We can let him off the hook eventually,

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but I think he's one of these guys who like,

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
like the show is about this death game

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
where like the stakes are really high, like that's true,

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and so I think that's kind of enough

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
for them to be like carried through the show

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
just like sort of keeping that in mind, you know?

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No, what I think about people who,

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
they don't see these sort of like the boring flaws and stuff,

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is that they think that like,

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
if there's like boring talky scenes or whatever,

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
there's just exposition,

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
they've seen that in other things that they kind of liked,

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and they just assume that for a show to be good,

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
it has to have you know, lulls and excitement and stuff,

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and they don't realize that there's a difference

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
between something being like interesting,

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
but like low energy,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and something just being really boring,

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
they just assume that that's what this is supposed to do.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think I know where it comes from,

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and you know, because the red letter media videos

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
on the Mr. Plinkett reviews of the Star Wars prequels,

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think were integral to this,

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
because when I was a little kid,

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I never saw-

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The mind-numbing action that the Fran Boris brave.

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, I never saw the original Star Wars as a kid,

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and like I saw it like,

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think I saw parts of the first one

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
around the time the Phantom Menace came out,

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but I saw Phantom Menace like probably in theaters,

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and I was fucking bored to tears by that movie, right?

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I thought it was the most boring thing I'd ever seen,

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and for a long time,

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I believed that I just thought like,

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
space and politics were boring,

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you know, like the idea of space politics

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
was the most boring thing in the world.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I could see why that movie would do that.

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right, and I believed that all the way up until adult,

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
like I've never been into sci-fi,

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I've never been into political stuff,

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
until I played Mass Effect at like age 20,

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and completely changed my outlook on both things,

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and now that's like my favorite genre is political sci-fi,

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and then I watched the Plinkett reviews,

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and I realized that political sci-fi was never boring,

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the movie is just terrible,

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and like, as a kid, I thought I just didn't understand

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
what they were talking about,

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
because it was too, like it was over my head, you know,

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
but then the reality of it is that it was just bad,

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
it was just badly written,

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and that's why I didn't understand it.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll tell you, you know.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There's like, there's the fucking people that kill me.

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think what you're trying to,

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
or what you were at least trying to say last time,

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is that people who watch those scenes in a show like Sword Art Online

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
think it's necessary for that to be there, you know,

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
like they think...

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, what I was going to say is that people,

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
they sometimes feel like they might recognize

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that something is like boring and stuff,

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but they're scared of like whining about it,

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
they don't want to be that person who says,

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
oh, I didn't like it, and then everyone turns around and says,

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but it's a great movie.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This kind of American anti-intellectualism,

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
they just accept that it's like really,

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it's good even though they find it boring,

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
they say, no, it's a good, it's a boring,

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
but that's okay, you know, that sort of thing.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When you complain about something,

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
people can find it a real buzz kill.

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have a friend who like,

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
he asked me, he said, Ben,

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you're the coolest guy ever,

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
what do you think about the new

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Fully Coolie sequels coming out?

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh boy, here we go.

263
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you know,

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I didn't see this at the time

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
because I couldn't see through

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
just the red veneer of rage

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that came over my eyes,

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and I just went on this fucking

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
bender about how it's all just an

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
evil fucking...

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
how it's an evil corporate money grab

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and everyone that is responsible

273
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
should be in hell and how I pray every night,

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and I pray every night

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
for another tsunami to come

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and finish the fucking job and wipe out Japan.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Just wipe out Japan.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Japan's done some good stuff,

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but you know, it needs to die

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
right now before it ruins its honor

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
by destroying the best thing it ever made,

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Fully Coolie with a sequel.

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you know, I could see

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the childlike wonderment went out of his eyes.

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This was a guy who really liked Fully Coolie

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and was like, I like Fully Coolie,

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I can't wait for the sequel.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And as I went on, I killed his joy.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I killed his joy.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I saw this so clearly

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
when I made my Final Fantasy 7 video

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
which is, you know, very divisive

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
among the people who've seen it,

294
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
where just to raise the idea

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that the thing that you're talking about,

296
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
like, because my whole life,

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
me and my friend Colin, when we were kids,

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
made a pledge that we would do whatever it takes

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
because we were young, we didn't have any money

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to get whatever money was required

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
to buy the console

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or whatever we needed to play the Final Fantasy 7

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
remake when it came out.

304
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And that was from a time...

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
A tall order.

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
At that time, we didn't know if that was even going to be fucking possible,

307
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but we just like...

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It was something that we just

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
blindly believed would be the best thing ever

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
because it was like our favorite game

311
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and we trusted Square Enix

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and we didn't understand how these things happen.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But now that we're older, I mean, I don't know about him,

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but I understand

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that's just not how things are going to pan out.

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not going to be, you know,

317
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
what I expected to be.

318
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's going to be, you know, this whole other thing.

319
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's going to be its own thing.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You only know that

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
if you have the perspective

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
of someone who like understands how these things happen.

323
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So that's where being a plebe

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
will shoot you in the foot because you encourage

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
bad things to happen without even knowing you're doing it.

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Here's the thing that I think is

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
not necessarily the same as being a plebe.

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I'm aware this comes off as the most condescending podcast

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
that I've ever done, definitely.

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think Normies was pretty close, pretty up there.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Here's the thing that's not necessarily the same

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
as being a plebe, but I think it can be related.

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
A lot of people don't

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
want to

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
see anything negatively.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They want to be excited about things

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and they want to like things.

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We could just make this about

339
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
how people don't appreciate negativity enough.

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That could be like the theme of this.

341
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You know, I think if I wanted to speak

342
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in defense of

343
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
like,

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
plebness is like ignorance is bliss, right?

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's right, that's right.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The less you think about it, the more you can enjoy it.

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I think that...

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, I think there's a double-edged sword

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
with being a pleb.

350
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Which is that if you just

351
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
like everything

352
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
because I see this sometimes

353
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
where there's people who aren't very critical.

354
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
People who give everything like a 7 out of 10.

355
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Or a 10 out of 10.

356
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They give everything this baseline.

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's either amazing or it's good.

358
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But then the difference between those

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
isn't even that strong.

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I feel like when people

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
aren't very critical of stuff, then everything

362
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
is just kind of the same.

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They kind of watch something and they go,

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
oh, it was great. And then for all time,

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
they just go, oh, it was great.

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But they never experience more.

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Whereas for me,

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
because I'm so critical of some stuff,

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
then the stuff that I do

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I like way more.

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
For something to

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
break down all those barriers

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
of things that it can do wrong.

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
For a show to just

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
not fuck up in any way.

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And then to just excel

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
in certain ways is like mind

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
blowing to me. It's like I can't believe

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
this is really happening.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That genius and beauty

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
exist in the world.

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know what I am?

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I am Matt

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Genius and beauty is like a rare pepe.

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

386
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Posted by Katy Perry for all to enjoy.

387
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I can't believe.

388
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, anyway.

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm like Matt Damon from

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Good Will Hunting.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, actually I'm not Matt Damon.

392
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm like Skarsgard.

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm the professor

394
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
who discovered Matt Damon.

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The genius kid.

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, it's like this.

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's like there's only a few men in the world

398
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
who can tell the difference between you and me.

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But I'm one of them.

400
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And you know, it's like you gotta know

401
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you gotta be able to see the difference

402
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
between Sword Art Online and fucking Konosuba

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
if you wanna survive meeting me.

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You say that to me again.

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I would

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
consider myself a bit of a

407
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
pleb in a

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
few ways. I mean,

409
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
because like I try to be

410
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
it's not that I try to be

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
optimistic all the time.

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I actually enjoy being really critical

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
on things that people like.

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But that's just because I'm

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
lost the word.

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Contrarian, yeah.

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But I do like

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
just giving things

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
letting things

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
you know, just

421
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm accepting of things that

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
like people in this chat

423
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
in this group really

424
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
all rag on. Like I'm still

425
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
kind of like Nerdwriter and all that stuff.

426
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I like Nerdwriter. Well, I know you do

427
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but like everyone else. I don't care

428
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
for him personally.

429
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And even though I hate Dark Souls 2

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
a lot, I still don't think I hate

431
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
as much as you do now, did you?

432
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't think anybody hates as much as I do.

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

434
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You've overtaken me there. I don't know.

435
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I just I've considered myself

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
a pleb maybe because

437
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
as a defense mechanism.

438
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, I don't want to be.

439
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Here's the thing. Here's what I think.

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There's no such thing as plebs

441
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
because nothing in this world

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
is truly worth appreciating at all.

443
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
All right.

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So some people think

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
they have a real good nose or taste

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
or whatever for beer.

447
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But they're wrong. They've been tricked

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
by big, by big alcohol companies.

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The culture of

450
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
beer is one that's like, oh this,

451
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I mean, beers do taste different, but none of them

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
taste good. And all

453
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
artists like that. None of it's really good.

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You've just been tricked into thinking you like it

455
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
by the media and by marketing.

456
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So plebs are...

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
To a certain extent. No, completely.

458
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I like Guinness.

459
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think Guinness tastes good now. Now that I've drank

460
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
it so many times, I just like to drink it.

461
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I guess there are better and worse beers.

462
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I know what you're saying. For the most part,

463
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it's about, I mean, you could like anyone.

464
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
People like getting tied to the railing

465
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and raped. If you do it enough times.

466
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They learn to like it.

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Do they?

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you sure? I can confirm that.

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, no.

470
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So we've just

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
all got Stockholm syndrome

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to art. Art and culture just

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
have us all fucking hostage.

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's funny.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I actually think that a lot of people

476
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
like a lot of stuff

477
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
out of Stockholm syndrome

478
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
because of... Absolutely.

479
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm not kidding about that.

480
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's essentially the argument we were having

481
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
about Sword Art Online and

482
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that those first two episodes

483
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
were so gripping that people will watch

484
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the whole fucking show and no matter how

485
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
stupid and boring it gets, they

486
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
might just... That's what Attack on Titan did to me.

487
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's what Attack on Titan did to me.

488
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It just hooked me really hard at the beginning.

489
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I think like the greatest cultural

490
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
example of that in recent years was

491
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The Walking Dead. That like

492
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
it had this really strong first season

493
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but that was only like six episodes

494
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and then it's just been like painfully boring

495
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
for like five fucking seasons.

496
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, but it's culture. But it was enough, man.

497
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's all they need to do and now they've got it.

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I want to see how it ends or whatever. Right.

499
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah, who gives a shit, they all fucking die.

500
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Everyone dies. Spoiler alert.

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
My parents who are not like particularly

502
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
critical or picky and even they like

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
by season three were like this show's fucking

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
dumb as fuck. But they're still watching it

505
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
because they cannot, you know.

506
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, now they're invested. That's what they do.

507
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They get you invested in the characters

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and they numb your like

509
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
critical thinking and then they just like find

510
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a... At first they

511
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
tap into like your...

512
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's like a base human reaction to like

513
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
oh shit, things are happening to these people.

514
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Are they gonna be okay? They get you with that

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and then they build a little bit of like

516
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
narrative weight into it. They build like a

517
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
thread line. They make you relate to these people

518
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and they get you invested in them personally.

519
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And then at that point they can do whatever the fuck they want.

520
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It doesn't matter. You're already got.

521
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's what happened to me with Naruto and Bleach.

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I still read them even though I don't like...

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Well, Naruto's finished.

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I read it all the way to the end even though like...

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, well, who cares.

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't need to get invested in the new characters.

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I've done my bit.

528
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've seen how it ends.

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And now I can never look at it again.

530
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm glad I don't have this impulse.

531
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because for me,

532
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I guess it's because

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
it's very all or nothing

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
with me because most shows aren't over

535
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
when I start watching them and then I

536
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
catch up and then I just never watch it again.

537
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Well, reading Naruto

538
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
wasn't too much of like a hassle.

539
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I would always go to the

540
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
manga sites to read the new one piece chapter

541
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and there's usually a Naruto there as well.

542
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes, there is.

543
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I do have the strong urge

544
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to finish like anything that I start.

545
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But to balance that out

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
is I don't start things very often.

547
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It takes multiple

548
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
separate people independently

549
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
recommending me something for me to even think

550
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
about watching it.

551
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I gotta ask, is this weird

552
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
that I think the reason I don't feel the need

553
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
to continue is that I feel like no matter what

554
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
what happens is either they die

555
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or they don't die.

556
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, that's weird.

557
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's always what it comes down to.

558
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They don't die by the end of the story.

559
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But that's life.

560
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And adding on to that

561
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
they will eventually die.

562
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So like even then, none of it

563
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
fucking matters, you know.

564
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This is the part where I

565
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
showed up in the call.

566
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, I wanted to go back to the

567
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
sort of the idea that people

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
are afraid of

569
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
being judged for being critical.

570
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And I want to bring in the new

571
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Harry and Original term from the Hello Internet

572
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
podcast, cheer pressure.

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Which is where there's pressure

574
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to be constantly

575
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
positive

576
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
to all things.

577
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Do you say cheer pressure?

578
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You gotta be cheering for them.

579
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You can't possibly...

580
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We've all had people

581
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
attack us for being against...

582
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh god, I'm seeing red! You just reminded me of the thing

583
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the angriest I've ever been.

584
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay, that's totally relevant.

585
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Because yesterday,

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
when Digi did his fuck, he did a video

587
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that was like criticizing

588
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
boring tastes of anime.

589
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I swear I'm in a fucking murky old family.

590
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I've never been more angry in my life.

591
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Who are you talking to?

592
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Anime every day is who he's talking to.

593
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's not him.

594
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
He makes this response

595
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
about how Digi isn't allowed

596
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
to criticize things.

597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Because he has a fucking platform,

598
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
people are gonna not like

599
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
things that he says he doesn't like.

600
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And that is not fucking allowed.

601
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You can't do that. You're spreading a cancer.

602
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You're spreading dislike of something.

603
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh my god, fuck off you piece of shit!

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I wish you were dead! That's the most retarded thing

605
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I've ever heard in my entire fucking life.

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh god, I'm so mad.

607
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So this guy said that

608
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
it's irresponsible of you to say that things are bad

609
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
because it'll make people like them less?

610
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's what he was saying.

611
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What community have I heard

612
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that kind of argument in?

613
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Wait, wait, hold on.

614
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What anime every day was saying was that

615
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you're judging people by their tastes,

616
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
but you think that people shouldn't be judged by their taste at all.

617
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's not so much being judged

618
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
by your taste.

619
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Digi didn't even judge anyone taste.

620
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He says every fucking time that you can like any show you want.

621
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's more like this.

622
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This isn't what it's like.

623
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Why doesn't he understand?

624
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Look, what it really is is

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
evaluating people's tastes.

626
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You look at your favorites and you go,

627
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
it seems like you're into this kind of thing.

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So it's not him saying

629
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
some people have worse tastes

630
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
than other people.

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's just saying, he's just saying that me personally

632
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
some tastes bore me because I'm

633
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
unfortunate all the time.

634
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Did you say he's bored?

635
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm right now looking at this reply I got to a comment

636
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
on that video that was like,

637
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
why can't you just admit Digi bro fucked up?

638
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Why can't you just admit it that he

639
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
lapsed in judgment?

640
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm gonna give this guy a response.

641
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know what, I didn't

642
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
want to bring this up but it's

643
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
out now so whatever.

644
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Congratulations, you now have your first public beef

645
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in the anime community.

646
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah, great.

647
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I completely understand

648
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
where all these people

649
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
are coming from because like

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
in this chat

651
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
where we do these calls

652
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
we shit on people's tastes

653
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
all the time but when we

654
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
shit on people's tastes we don't mean it in the same way as

655
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
some people mean it

656
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
when some people are like

657
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
if you're like K-On, you're completely retarded

658
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
that show has no substance whatsoever.

659
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, I wonder if you're really good at

660
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
face stuff actually.

661
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So people like that, when they say that

662
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You guys can almost compete with mine but you have to

663
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
have a shitty echo effect to really make it sound

664
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
sounds like an evil thing.

665
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You got to cop the mic.

666
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think you're gonna speed it up 10%.

667
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So anyway, when he says that it doesn't mean

668
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the same thing as when we are like

669
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
why does such and such continue

670
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to shit on such and such

671
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
thing that we like. When we say it

672
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
it means a different thing. You're just gonna have to take our word for it guys.

673
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You're just gonna have to take our word for it.

674
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The reason that I

675
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
because I know Nate you didn't like that

676
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
in my response I was

677
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
overly fair to him.

678
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You were so fair and it made me so mad.

679
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You should have ripped him apart. The only reason for that is

680
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
the realization I had when I was watching his video

681
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and he kind of makes this point

682
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
that those shows

683
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that I'm talking about are mostly

684
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
kind of obscure shows

685
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and like

686
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I think the problem is that

687
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
from my perspective all I see these

688
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
like the only times I ever see these shows talked about

689
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
is in fucking 3 by 3 threads.

690
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's when people are putting them on their favorites list

691
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because they make you look really smart and cool.

692
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But then I thought about it and I was like

693
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
no one's championing these on

694
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
YouTube except for this guy.

695
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like anywhere else for me

696
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
anywhere else on the internet it's annoying

697
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
to see like a million anime

698
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
every day is going oh this show

699
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
is so beautiful and that makes

700
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
it the best show that I've ever seen

701
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and I'm like yeah I fucking get it.

702
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But then I thought about it and I'm like well

703
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
there's no video of me on my channel

704
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
going hey guys go watch Anne of Green

705
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Gables because it's a classic.

706
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And so if

707
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I had more videos

708
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
about those shows then I would really

709
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
feel like he completely

710
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
deserved to be ragged on.

711
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If you guys are just now hearing about all this

712
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
believe me like if you hearing us talk about this

713
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
for the first time it may sound

714
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
like Digi made some video where he's like

715
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
hey everyone I'm here to tell you about who to not

716
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
take seriously around here. It wasn't like that

717
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
at all it was more like a thought experiment

718
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
it was sort of like I don't know

719
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
you just have to...

720
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Don't defend it it doesn't need a defense

721
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
it was just a fucking whatever.

722
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It was just like a thought experiment type of thing

723
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and I understand that people don't like

724
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
understand the depth of where we're coming from

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't know

726
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It was a video that wasn't meant to be

727
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
watched by as many people as it was

728
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
it's really what it comes down to.

729
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's a video that has 30,000 views

730
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that was just a random rambling

731
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I mean you did give it a really click baby

732
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
title and a thumbnail even.

733
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know why I did that because in retrospect

734
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
that made no sense because I did

735
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the title I had in mind from the beginning

736
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
but I did give it a thumbnail

737
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
like this will get more clicks

738
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and then I looked at it and I mean

739
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I meant to get more clicks

740
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm not sure I even agree with the argument

741
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that like I didn't intend this to be seen by more people

742
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
because once you post it out it's out

743
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
but like nonetheless I think your points

744
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
are nothing to be argued

745
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This reminds me

746
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Here's my thing about this is that like

747
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
he's talking about a vague generalization

748
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and if you feel like

749
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you aren't like posturing with your opinions

750
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
then you aren't part of that group

751
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and you don't have to like be defensive about it

752
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
like if you feel like you aren't part of that group

753
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
then you aren't.

754
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Well I did literally call him

755
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
being out.

756
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you get called out then you can make a response

757
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
what I told him was

758
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
you should have just made a response proving

759
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
all your favorites are better than everything else

760
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I also thought that's what it was going to be

761
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
like when I clicked on the video I was really hoping

762
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
he was about to like play defense for the show

763
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That would have made you look way stupider

764
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
When I saw that the video was only 8 minutes long

765
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I figured there was no way

766
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
he could defend 9 choices

767
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
His response to me was

768
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
well I have, I explain it all in my videos

769
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
themselves. I'm like oh well

770
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't want to hunt down all of his videos

771
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
so I'll just take his word for it

772
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Let's move this into a discussion

773
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
of another kind of pleb

774
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and once again I'm just accusing

775
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
anime every day of something

776
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
so I'm just throwing the pot even more

777
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Whatever let him have it

778
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I think that the fact that

779
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
he thinks he's put up a defense of

780
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
why those shows are on his list

781
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
is exactly the problem

782
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
of why I made that video

783
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
in the first place

784
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
because he hasn't really

785
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
not in any depth

786
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
or meaningful way

787
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
he's talked a lot about how they're

788
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
very well written and beautiful to look at

789
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and the art design is really strong

790
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Is that really his voice?

791
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I haven't seen his videos

792
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's sort of his voice

793
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I know he's capable of

794
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
making analytical points

795
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
in the film

796
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and arise

797
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and made some great points in those videos

798
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but most of his videos

799
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
are like

800
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
these are the top 10 anime of 1990

801
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and then he'll just

802
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
just describe

803
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
they're kind of like YMS reviews

804
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
where he's just describing the fact that

805
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
the show is good and not why it's good

806
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
in any specific

807
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
kind of detail

808
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and my problem with those 3x3s

809
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
this is what I was trying to get across

810
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
about ergo proxy

811
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is that I don't understand the appeal of ergo proxy

812
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and no one has explained it to me

813
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
well enough that I get it

814
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
it is like

815
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
proven

816
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
that in some fields at least

817
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
people will posture for

818
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
a sophisticated looking opinion

819
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I remember Jimquisition talking about that

820
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
in regards to certain features on video games

821
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
but also correlating it to coffee

822
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
how statistics show that

823
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
when people are interviewed they say

824
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I like a rich dark roast of coffee

825
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
but then buying habits suggest

826
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
that people mostly buy milky weak coffee

827
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you know it's not like

828
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
the very notion he's proposing

829
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that people don't

830
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
just put things on there to look smart

831
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
or cool is the most retarded thing

832
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I've ever heard in my life

833
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
even if like

834
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
we love everyone

835
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
we're the most positive people ever

836
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
we're not saying you're not a good person

837
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
we're extremely cynical

838
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and that's the issue

839
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
is that I don't think he's cynical enough about it

840
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
because I got a lot of responses

841
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
we're just saying we don't automatically dislike anyone

842
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
for anything

843
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
we're not saying you're a bad person

844
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
we're not saying you're not allowed to watch anime

845
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I personally don't care about this whole boring taste thing

846
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
because I'm not on 4chan all the time

847
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
just letting you know

848
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
please don't take it too seriously

849
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
it's just like a thought experiment or something

850
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't think it's as cynical as it could be

851
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
people make lists like that

852
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
3x3 lists like that or whatever

853
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
it's not like they're setting out to deliberately deceive people

854
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it's that

855
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
this is what they're defaulting to

856
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
out of an instinct

857
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
or out of a sort of sense they have

858
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that this is what's appreciated

859
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and everybody does it

860
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I totally think

861
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that I have a sense of

862
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
if something feels

863
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
good in such a conventional way

864
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that can make me like a little bit more

865
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
than how much I enjoyed it

866
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
when watching it because it gives me so much more appreciation

867
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
for it afterwards

868
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
so I totally get it

869
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
it's satisfying to agree with people

870
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and to like say

871
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
oh I love this show

872
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and to have everyone nod in agreement

873
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and go yes that is a good show

874
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and so if you've got two shows that you like equally

875
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
one of which is going to be controversial

876
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and get you like insulted and the other of which is

877
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
everyone's going to be like yep same

878
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you know

879
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
actually inclined to pick that one

880
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I agree and I think it's

881
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I definitely find some deep satisfaction

882
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
with the few times I get to agree

883
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
with pop culture and that's like

884
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that's why I actually

885
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
like when people call me a hipster and stuff

886
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I always feel like it's

887
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it's so

888
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
mischaracterizing who I am

889
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
because of the fact that I hate

890
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I hate that my taste is hipster taste

891
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
like I wish everyone liked everything I like

892
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't want to be the guy

893
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
who likes the things that nobody likes

894
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
see that's the thing

895
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
this whole plebe thing

896
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
simply comes out of a lack of understanding

897
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
what the fuck is going on

898
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
if you don't like something

899
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
just explain why and if you're right

900
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
people will agree with you

901
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and that's what we all do in our fucking videos

902
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I made a fucking 40 minute video

903
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
it took me six months of my life just to explain

904
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
why one show is a little bit

905
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
better than everyone already thinks it is

906
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that was substance

907
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
going on there what this is what we see

908
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
from the fucking plebes is them just saying

909
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
nope you're wrong and I'm not going to explain why

910
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
you're just wrong

911
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm not impressed by that

912
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm not impressed by that argument come back to me

913
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
when you've got something intelligent to say

914
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I was on my way to my point about

915
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
that other kind of pleabeness

916
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
that I was accusing anime every day of

917
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
the fact that he thinks

918
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that he has made the point

919
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
about those shows

920
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
is like

921
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
in regards to being a writer

922
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
like that I think that

923
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
there's a standard that I think most people

924
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
is the standard of reviews

925
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and it's

926
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
shit tier like if you're writing

927
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
reviews that could get published in a major magazine

928
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
those are the shittiest reviews

929
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
possible

930
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
unless you're that one guy who writes for EGM

931
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
about how everything is a dick

932
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
sucking cock

933
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
it's like Tom Cruise sucking my dick

934
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
yeah that's the one

935
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I think there was a time

936
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in history where

937
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
consumer reviews were really important

938
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
right?

939
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
because a new movie came out

940
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and no one knew if it was good

941
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
unless they went and watched it

942
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and so you would open up a magazine

943
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and the magazine would give you a very short description

944
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
of weather

945
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the thing people have to understand about

946
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
writing from this so called objective

947
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
perspective

948
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
the point of it was never to

949
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
film's quality it was to present it

950
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
in a way that the most people

951
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
would resonate with

952
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
most people will feel

953
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
that a movie is shittily paced

954
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
so if someone says in an article

955
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
the film is bad because the pacing

956
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
is bad they're saying that because

957
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
most people will feel that way

958
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
it doesn't mean the movie is actually

959
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
bad because there's probably someone out there

960
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
who doesn't care about the pacing and will love

961
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that movie but like the general

962
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
a critic is someone who has to channel

963
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
what they believe to be the general consensus

964
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and put it into words and that's what

965
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
a consumer review is and that's what

966
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
someone like Roger Ebert was so good at doing

967
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you know but like

968
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think that that age is gone

969
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
consumer reviewers are completely

970
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
fucking unnecessary because we have rotten

971
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
tomatoes and all you have to do

972
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
is open it and look at the number

973
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and go okay

974
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
now I know

975
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
which is an aggregate of a bunch

976
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
of those mainstream consumer reviews

977
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
but like if you're fucking on YouTube

978
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
doing like consumer reviews

979
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
of anime it's like we have anime news network

980
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
for that we have

981
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
regular publications we have magazines

982
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
we have you know you can look at the

983
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
score that is given on my anime list

984
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
or something like what is the point of this

985
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
make your channel the story of your taste

986
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
because if you're a good writer

987
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and you're like authentic with yourself

988
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you can make you more interesting

989
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm not accusing anyone of not being authentic

990
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm just saying like maybe play into that

991
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
more like again let's be

992
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
very clear we're not like judging

993
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't think you were judging anyone

994
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
based on your tastes you were

995
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
making statements like a reverse

996
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
spectrum the worst thing that you could

997
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
accuse did you was saying that someone's

998
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
taste was boring

999
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
like a reverse spectrum a guy who I think

1000
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
listens to these he added me on Mal

1001
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
recently and I looked at this top 5

1002
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
well his top 4 are Red Line

1003
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Madoka, Samurai Flamenco

1004
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and Ping Pong and I was like well I see

1005
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
a connection he likes stuff that goes

1006
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
all out insanity or something like

1007
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that that's kind of a cool taste for him

1008
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and you know everyone's taste is fair

1009
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
it's just that not me this isn't me

1010
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
because I don't spend all my time on

1011
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
4chan but Digi has certain opinions

1012
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
make him go oh I know

1013
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
this kind of thing

1014
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
DerpyDoo

1015
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Hi I'm interrupting the podcast

1016
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
man I had

1017
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
just gotten out of bed when I got

1018
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
on to this podcast

1019
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I guess I'm really

1020
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
slurry

1021
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
when I first wake up and a lot less

1022
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
articulate

1023
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
also this was recorded

1024
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
probably 3 weeks before

1025
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
it was the point at which

1026
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
it gets released

1027
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
because

1028
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Nate said because

1029
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
you came into it late

1030
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
that for some reason means you have to

1031
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
be the one to edit it

1032
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and I was like

1033
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
well okay

1034
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
when I'm done with everything else I have

1035
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
to do

1036
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and so this is what happens

1037
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
well I just I'm bored by

1038
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this idea of like making a

1039
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
video or making a list that says

1040
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
like here's what are the best

1041
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
anime and I'm like I don't think

1042
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
we need someone to tell us that

1043
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
like it's obvious

1044
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in a way like I need you to explain to

1045
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
me why people care about it like because

1046
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and those shows are fucking ancient

1047
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you know like more people need

1048
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to watch more and broader anime

1049
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and come to their own conclusions

1050
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
right and that's the other thing

1051
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
is that like I think that when we

1052
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
like because like I understand

1053
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
from his perspective he's thinking like

1054
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
well here's all these masterpieces

1055
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and not enough people have seen them

1056
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
so I need to promote them but I'm

1057
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
over here like I know all these other

1058
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
shows I consider masterpieces

1059
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that even less people are watching

1060
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and so like it would be so much

1061
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
more interesting to me if someone came out and they were like

1062
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
my top nine shows are like

1063
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Minabi Straight and fucking

1064
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm just gonna look around

1065
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
my room at the

1066
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and fucking Simone

1067
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and yeah and

1068
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
like if someone came out with a list

1069
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
that had camphor on it like the

1070
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
thing is if you were on that guy's deal

1071
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
if you were on 4chan then someone's

1072
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
gonna go camphor but

1073
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
if that guy if I saw it

1074
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
if I saw in top nine and like there was

1075
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
like eight great shows and camphor

1076
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I immediately

1077
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm gonna text like I'd be like please write a review of

1078
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
camphor please like

1079
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
nothing could be more interesting to me

1080
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
than that guy's review of

1081
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
camphor you know and so like

1082
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
if I see a list and it's like

1083
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
nine shows that I've read a thousand

1084
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
million popular reviews of

1085
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you know like at the end of

1086
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
at the end of 2009

1087
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
this guy

1088
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
basically every anime blogger on the planet

1089
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
made a top 50 anime of the

1090
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
decade list just because

1091
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it was the end of the decade everyone wanted to do it

1092
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
so this guy called aqua blue

1093
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
aqua blue sweater who's like a statistician

1094
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
took all of them

1095
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and compiled them into like

1096
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the list of what were the top

1097
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
rated ones and it was like

1098
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Haibane Renme, Mushishi

1099
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Kaiba like all these you know

1100
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
all the fru fru shows you expect to be up there

1101
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and it's like they'd all been

1102
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
reviewed by everyone because

1103
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
like everyone who made those top 50s

1104
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
they had like you know their little blurb

1105
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
about each show so that means

1106
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
like there were more blurbs written about

1107
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
fucking Mushishi than

1108
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
any other show so when someone makes

1109
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
a video that's like Mushishi's the best

1110
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
show I'm like yeah I know

1111
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
everyone knows we all know

1112
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
right about something else

1113
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
please here's something that confuses me

1114
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
a little bit I think

1115
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
a lot of people what they want out of

1116
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
a review is that

1117
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
it agrees with their opinion

1118
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and which makes it kind of

1119
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
doesn't that make it inherently uninteresting

1120
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't

1121
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
that's what I was saying to my

1122
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
some commenters I didn't like I was like

1123
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
guys listen a video is

1124
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
like an editorial it's a think piece

1125
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
it's not an opinion

1126
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
agreement delivery service

1127
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
you phrase it like that and you shut them up

1128
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it feels good to hear someone affirm

1129
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
your opinion but I also think that it's

1130
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
not interesting to hear your own opinion

1131
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Ben I totally agree

1132
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but that's why I am firmly of the stance

1133
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that I think happiness and good feelings are vastly

1134
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
overrated

1135
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
no I agree with that

1136
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
think about this real quick kind of viewers

1137
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
if everyone was happy all the time

1138
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
what would get done nothing

1139
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I actually at this point

1140
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I've way gotten past

1141
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
the point where I actually get really mad

1142
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
when I read positive reviews

1143
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
of stuff I like that don't explain anything

1144
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
like the worst review to me

1145
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
is when someone like

1146
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
if I see a review of Kaon

1147
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and the review is like

1148
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
oh this show is really cute and fun

1149
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and it's good

1150
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
go watch it and I'm like what the fuck

1151
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
how is that going to like

1152
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
yeah no shit I already knew that

1153
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
you know dude that's

1154
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
very much the reason

1155
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
when I was making my Gurren Login video

1156
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I watched everyone's review and they were so

1157
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
shit they were so bad

1158
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
it had to be corrected so

1159
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
of the exact same opinion

1160
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that's actually like that was realizing

1161
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that like what you realized watching all those

1162
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
was a huge part of what

1163
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
affirmed me into like doing this

1164
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
because of the fact that I had always

1165
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
assumed that this would

1166
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
already have been done by a million people

1167
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that like there was already

1168
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
like with Ava you know

1169
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
like you assume there must have been every Ava analysis

1170
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
possible because it's been around for so long

1171
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and you know and I know there is a lot

1172
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
like there actually is like a whole channel

1173
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
of Ava analysis

1174
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and there's like the Ava Geeks forum

1175
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and all that stuff but like in spite

1176
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
of all that I feel like

1177
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
most of the stuff I've said about the show is stuff

1178
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I've never seen someone else say

1179
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and like I think

1180
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
there's still so much room because I think up until

1181
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
recently consumer reviews

1182
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
were what people thought criticism

1183
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
of art was and like

1184
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
analysis was mostly like a

1185
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
like a school

1186
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
what's the word I'm looking for

1187
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
for I don't know like a school project

1188
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
sort of thing is that what you're saying?

1189
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
No academic that's the word I'm looking for

1190
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
like it's more of an academic thing

1191
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
it's more of a university thing

1192
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and like I don't think the market's ever going to be

1193
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
too crowded of like personal

1194
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
like thoughtful pieces

1195
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
related to your own life of any show

1196
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
you know whereas it's

1197
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
like I think if

1198
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
you can

1199
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
like if you wanted to write just a review of a show

1200
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
like go to google

1201
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
type like KonoSuba

1202
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
review and you're going to if you get any results

1203
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
don't write a review

1204
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
like write an analysis write a

1205
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
think piece write something original

1206
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
that's fair like I don't need

1207
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
there to be more than one review

1208
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
of anything and this has gotten to this point

1209
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
with all these fucking new movies coming out

1210
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
where because every youtuber has decided

1211
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
that they're going to review every new

1212
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
fucking Marvel movie makes that money dude

1213
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
right we get YMS putting out these quickies

1214
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
that are

1215
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
worthless like completely critically

1216
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
worthless they tell you nothing about

1217
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
the film they are usually like

1218
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
him nitpicking two random elements

1219
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and then spending five minutes going well it was good

1220
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
but it wasn't as good as it could have been

1221
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but it's pretty okay wasn't quite as good

1222
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
as great but it wasn't quite as great as amazing

1223
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but it wasn't as good as not good but it was almost

1224
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
like three levels of good over good five

1225
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and like like I watched all these

1226
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
fucking reviews of Civil War and it was like

1227
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Movie Bob had probably

1228
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the best consumer review

1229
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
possible for that movie and even

1230
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
then all I could think the whole time was

1231
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
who cares

1232
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
like everyone's going to see the movie

1233
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
anyone who gives the slightest

1234
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
fuck about this movie is going

1235
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
to watch this movie this will probably be one

1236
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
of the highest grossing films of all time

1237
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
why do we have

1238
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
800 consumer reviews coming out for a movie

1239
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
literally everyone will see

1240
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
why are these people doing that

1241
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
those were invented before the

1242
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
information age guys we don't need those as

1243
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
much anymore you know I was going to say

1244
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
this before but like I was thinking before

1245
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
about like how I got into

1246
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
the video games I like and like there were

1247
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
two ways like my friends would tell me

1248
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
about them and then like Ben and like people I knew

1249
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and then I read Game Informer

1250
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
or like I would like oh my god

1251
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I love Game Informer I used to love that

1252
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
shit it was so useful but

1253
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
like even more than that

1254
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I would just flip through it looking for reviews

1255
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
with scores under five and

1256
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
just read them like trash a game

1257
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
because I wanted to hear what like shitty

1258
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
things they would say about them but see

1259
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
yeah it was super great it was super fine I love

1260
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
that magazine but like I don't read it anymore

1261
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
largely because I mean maybe

1262
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
because I don't have time but like it doesn't serve

1263
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
the same purpose it once did of like educating

1264
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
people on what a game you can just fucking google it

1265
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
and find a thousand pages about whatever

1266
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
go on V and everyone's talking about it

1267
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
it aggregated all of human information

1268
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
go to wikipedia

1269
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
so bringing up Movie Bob

1270
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
reminds me of another another

1271
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
layer on the pleb

1272
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
seven layer dip

1273
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
and that is the sour cream

1274
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
another like root cause

1275
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
of pleb-ness of chronic pleb-ness

1276
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
do you not like sour cream didgy

1277
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I actually like

1278
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
physically can't eat sour cream

1279
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
oh fuck you sour cream

1280
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
it's like I throw up

1281
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
if I eat it like it's disgusting

1282
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
well get over it bitch

1283
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm gonna sneak sour cream into your

1284
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm gonna puke on your nuts

1285
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
if you do that

1286
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
anyway um yeah

1287
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Movie Bob

1288
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I think people are invested

1289
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
in liking things

1290
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
just by nature of the fact that they watch them

1291
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
in not nuts of or in the Avengers

1292
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
in his really that good about Avengers

1293
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Movie Bob brings up that like

1294
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
going into watch Avengers

1295
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
people aren't just rooting for the Avengers

1296
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
like rooting for the Avengers themselves to win

1297
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
is the same as them rooting for

1298
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
them to like the movie for the movie

1299
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
for the movie itself to succeed

1300
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
yeah that was weird that was his point

1301
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
though I think Bob is someone who can just watch movies

1302
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
whatever like he is

1303
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
he is no pleb when it comes to movies in terms of watching them

1304
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
it seems like he's watched all movies that exist

1305
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
like his like I thought his point was good

1306
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
about people like that go into the movie

1307
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
are already invested like

1308
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
financially and time wise

1309
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
in their own enjoyment of the movie

1310
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
they want to like it because they are there

1311
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
watching it and I thought it was weird that he

1312
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
made it out like Avengers was the only

1313
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
movie that did this or that it was brilliant for doing it

1314
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I thought it was applicable to pretty much any

1315
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
movie yeah just the fact

1316
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
that I have watched something kind of

1317
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
makes me want to give it the benefit of the doubt

1318
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
so that I won't have wasted my time

1319
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
that's entirely true but that brings up

1320
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
perhaps the biggest core problem

1321
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
with plebdom in general which is just

1322
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
an an an interest in

1323
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
liking it over being critical of it

1324
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and like viewing it from an intellectual lens

1325
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you know particularly something that you use to

1326
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
like you don't really like as much anymore

1327
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
but you want to keep hanging on to it

1328
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
that keep going on these long tanges

1329
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
don't give a fuck about

1330
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
yeah I know it's true

1331
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Ben you're absolutely right about that

1332
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I mean yeah I mean that was the thing that I used

1333
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to I think I used to feel that more

1334
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
strongly nowadays I

1335
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I find disliking something

1336
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
to be just as interesting and satisfying

1337
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
as liking something after the fact

1338
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and no longer bothered by the idea that I

1339
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
didn't like something you've got to get to that place

1340
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
from plebdom you got to rise I think that's

1341
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
where I think that the same

1342
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
exact emotion you're talking about

1343
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
is why people do

1344
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
these things like I did with sort

1345
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
on online or asterisk war where like

1346
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I think that when you

1347
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
watch something and you don't like it at all

1348
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
you feel that you need to

1349
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
squeeze something out of it like you

1350
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
have to get like because you've been so

1351
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
wrong like my brother

1352
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Victor he's

1353
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
but like long before I was even doing

1354
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
YouTube like a couple

1355
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
years before and I kept wanting to do videos

1356
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
out of this but he would every time he saw

1357
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
a movie he hated he would go on these

1358
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
epic rants about them like

1359
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
he saw like

1360
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that sounds like me in my youth he saw

1361
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
fucking what's it called

1362
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Clash of the Titans like the new one

1363
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and he just like went on this

1364
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
fucking tirade there's like 22

1365
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
minute amazing beautiful tirade

1366
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
it was the best thing I'd ever seen

1367
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and I realized that it's just because

1368
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
he felt so robbed by the movie

1369
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
that he had to like you know

1370
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
feel something so like

1371
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
he had to express his rage

1372
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
so that he could then feel

1373
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
a response to the film

1374
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
have to feel anything at all

1375
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
it's better to feel something than nothing

1376
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
by the way D'Vu want to extend the olive branch

1377
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I didn't mean to be so harsh there I was

1378
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
just finishing a point

1379
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
anything you care to comment on now D'Vu

1380
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I said that was the whole sentence

1381
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you like stopped me at the end of my point

1382
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
well then well done Nate alright

1383
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
let's go into another facet of plebdom

1384
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
that um

1385
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
this is sort of changing the subject

1386
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
but I feel like we've gone like

1387
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
for a while we were doing reviewer rules too

1388
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
so uh

1389
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
getting back into plebs

1390
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
really every video is a reviewer rule

1391
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
it kind of is we tend to go back into that

1392
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
that's our perspective yeah

1393
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
but here's one that drives me crazy

1394
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
is just the closed mindedness

1395
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
of plebs

1396
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and I think that

1397
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
a big part of being a pleb

1398
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
is not realizing

1399
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
how much more is out there

1400
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and how many different ways there are

1401
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
to enjoy things

1402
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
and just like holding up

1403
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
in your idea of yourself

1404
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
and what you like

1405
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and it's most common with I think

1406
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
basically everyone gets into most

1407
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
things through action

1408
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
like we all probably

1409
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
grew up watching more action oriented shows

1410
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
than the ones we watch now

1411
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
yeah would you say

1412
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
yeah I remember like in like Power Rangers

1413
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
and stuff like that when I was young

1414
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and then getting into DBZ

1415
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
like next gen when you were

1416
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
8 you know

1417
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
well I mean not

1418
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
no I mean I really liked Winnie the Pooh

1419
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
well beyond the age

1420
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
well beyond the age that I was supposed to

1421
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
like Winnie the Pooh

1422
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
which is now right

1423
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I mean I haven't watched it in a long time

1424
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I was really big into Winnie the Pooh

1425
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and it was great and colorful and fun to watch

1426
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
it's great so comforting it's the best

1427
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
the point I'm making is sort of that I think

1428
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
when you're young you like action

1429
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
because it's immediate and it's not boring

1430
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and you get the point right off the bat

1431
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
like everything is clear to you

1432
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
and like that's why

1433
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
shows for kids are all action or comedy

1434
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
like it always is and there was even a

1435
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
like a quote from

1436
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
like I first realized that

1437
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
when I was like 12

1438
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and they were showing like some behind the scenes footage

1439
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
of the movie

1440
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and the guy was saying like

1441
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
because this is an adult cartoon we don't have to

1442
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
animate shit because like with kids

1443
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
great he was like with kids

1444
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
stuff has to be moving

1445
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
constantly or else they won't pay attention

1446
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
but with adults to watch anything

1447
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
well yeah I mean it's kind of true

1448
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
that's such a weird reversal of like the normal

1449
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
the normal attitude that like

1450
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
things for kids can be shit

1451
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
the funny thing about it is that it's just

1452
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
animation because what carries

1453
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
awkward teen hunger force is entirely

1454
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
the voice acting and dialogue

1455
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
it's really well acted

1456
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
it's this weird offbeat humor

1457
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but like most of the show

1458
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
is completely not animated

1459
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
like it's just lit movements

1460
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and like nothing actually

1461
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
moves and so

1462
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
like yeah but he was like

1463
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and the funny thing is that of course

1464
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
plenty of kids did watch that show

1465
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
because it's still a cartoon

1466
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and it still you know

1467
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
is the imagination of kids who've never seen anything

1468
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
like this before but like

1469
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I just think that for

1470
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I think that for a lot of people

1471
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
they never quite graduate

1472
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
out of the mindset of liking the same

1473
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
thing that they liked when they were young

1474
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
because like you eventually have

1475
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
this identity of I'm a guy who likes

1476
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
action shows and then

1477
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
until something disproves that

1478
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
it just keeps getting stronger over time

1479
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
that you just never believe that you'll like

1480
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
something else unless it's proven wrong

1481
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
dude that totally reminds me

1482
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that just makes me think of an example in my life

1483
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
that you guys can probably all relate to

1484
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
like because I want to make a distinction

1485
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
between and probably should have done this in the beginning

1486
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
between like plebdom and intelligence

1487
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
because they are not necessarily

1488
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
correlated at all

1489
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
despite what Urban Dictionary would have us believe

1490
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
case in point is my own dad

1491
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
because my dad is a super smart guy

1492
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
smartest guy I know probably

1493
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and like

1494
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
he likes to watch on TV

1495
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
like the trashiest shit

1496
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
that you could possibly he loves

1497
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
big bang theory

1498
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
we're in it I hope you're recording

1499
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Jesse I'm making a fucking point get back to me when you're recording

1500
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
already 15 minutes into this Jesse

1501
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
well Ben jumped in like for the last

1502
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
five minutes or one once that was fine

1503
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
what okay I was just saying

1504
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
that my dad likes super trashy shows

1505
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
that really he just watches

1506
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
like to turn off his brain

1507
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
like to relax he's not

1508
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
he's not us he's not a guy who's like

1509
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
looking to like make the best art possible

1510
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
he's a guy who wakes up works for like

1511
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
12 hours a day doing like this

1512
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
this you know doing

1513
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
his job and at the end of the day he's ready

1514
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
to fucking chill he just wants to like relax

1515
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and that is super pleb

1516
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
but like it's not a reflection on the kind of man

1517
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
he is it's just that when it comes to this art

1518
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
he doesn't give a fuck you know it's a reflection

1519
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
on it's what he's

1520
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
looking for out of it and you can be looking

1521
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
this is why people think that did you bro

1522
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
use him as another example

1523
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
so really I'm defending

1524
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm your I'm your people's champion so you

1525
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
know don't cry into me but like I

1526
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
think maybe a lot of people you know

1527
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
if they get some opinion in their heads

1528
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
they go into every show or everything

1529
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
that they do thinking whatever it is

1530
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm gonna make sure it reinforces my existing

1531
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
opinions as much as possible and that

1532
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
may be why a lot of people to use did you as another

1533
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
example think that he hates a one

1534
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
shows because they're a one shows

1535
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and we'll go out of his way no you go in

1536
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I mean what you've told me is you go into a one shows

1537
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
hoping for it to be the one that proves you wrong

1538
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
right that makes you finally like it

1539
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm sure the people who say that don't believe

1540
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
when he says that but we know him and we know

1541
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
that I mean I mean not everyone

1542
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
not everyone wants to be critical

1543
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
of their media not everyone not everyone

1544
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
really values art

1545
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
in a way that we do

1546
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
not everyone

1547
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
it's way more interesting

1548
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
it's way more interesting to go into a thing

1549
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
thinking how is this going to change

1550
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
into an evolved my taste

1551
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
is this gonna be the country album

1552
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
that gets me into country

1553
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't like country

1554
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I've

1555
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
not been paying attention for a very long time

1556
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I honestly forgot you were here

1557
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and I

1558
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I realize that it's just because

1559
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't care about

1560
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
people being plebs they can do

1561
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
whatever they like

1562
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
well you don't care about anything

1563
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
let me go back to

1564
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
let me go back to what guy was saying

1565
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
real quick

1566
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
let's talk about my brilliant points

1567
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
about people

1568
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
they get an idea of what they like when they're young

1569
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and then it never changes

1570
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I think that part of that

1571
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
no it was me it's all me

1572
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I think that's

1573
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I mean people just don't

1574
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I mean when you're a kid you have all the time in the world

1575
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
to consume all the shows and whatever

1576
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
in games and stuff in the world

1577
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
you tend to not have

1578
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
either the time nor patience

1579
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
nor even the desire to like watch more stuff

1580
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
so you don't yeah so that just

1581
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that just kind of

1582
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
my point is just don't act like

1583
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
you have legitimate opinions

1584
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I wanted to get into Nate because

1585
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
you were talking about your dad being a pleb

1586
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and like my dad's plebness

1587
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
fascinates me so much

1588
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
because like

1589
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
like your dad he's a smart guy

1590
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
not as educated as yours but he does read a lot

1591
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
loves philosophy and stuff like that

1592
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
so it's pretty knowledgeable

1593
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
cool cool yeah

1594
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
like all he does when he's not at work

1595
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
is watch TV he comes home he turns it on

1596
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
he leaves it on

1597
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I mean he doesn't necessarily pay attention to all of it

1598
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
he'll like check his fucking tablet and stuff

1599
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
but yeah he will get

1600
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
instantly invested in

1601
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
anything it doesn't matter

1602
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
if something's on TV and he watches it for more than

1603
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
one minute he is immediately

1604
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
invested and you cannot distract him or else

1605
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
he'll get mad that's not pleb

1606
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
that's patrician as fuck yeah it

1607
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
does not matter what it is

1608
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
it's interesting because on some level

1609
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
it is super patrician because like he actually

1610
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that's like me when

1611
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
that's like me when law and order special victims

1612
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
unit comes on and even though I don't give a fuck

1613
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I can't not watch it

1614
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
special victims unit is great at baiting the hook

1615
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
it's funny because I'm the type who like

1616
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I walk in and like

1617
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I can even like get interested

1618
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and I'll leave anyways because I'm like I want to do

1619
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
something else but like

1620
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
my dad will he'll just watch everything

1621
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and like

1622
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
any TV show that's like actually good

1623
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
or any movie that's actually good he retains

1624
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
all of it he can remember stuff about movies from

1625
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
like decades ago even though his memory

1626
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
is ordinarily complete shit

1627
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
but the funny thing is that

1628
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
he's explained it to me before that like

1629
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
TV is just because he grew

1630
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
up with it and he like understands it

1631
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
then it's very easy for him

1632
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
to like just watch all of it like

1633
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
he was like you know when I was growing up

1634
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you just watched all the TV that's just what people

1635
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
did you sat down with your family at the end

1636
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
like he said you know my parents would

1637
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
come home and we'd all sit in the living room

1638
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and we'd all watch TV together and that was just

1639
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
what life was you know so like yeah

1640
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
that's so ingrained in him and he's

1641
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
always said that like he's a he's

1642
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
legitimately like afraid to play

1643
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
video games because if he thinks

1644
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
that it would take so much more investment

1645
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
that he would become super addicted and it

1646
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
would consume his whole life like that's

1647
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
why he doesn't want to play games but like

1648
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
but when it comes to music

1649
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
for whatever reason he can't

1650
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
as he put it he doesn't hear

1651
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
music like

1652
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
it just kind of starts playing and he

1653
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
immediately stops paying attention to it

1654
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and like the only songs he listens to

1655
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
are like stuff with catchy hooks and like

1656
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
anything that's good for working out

1657
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
he downloads these fucking

1658
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
these like running mixes of songs

1659
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
where it'll be like it's basically like

1660
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Eurobeat but like with a dance like

1661
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
a dance version of a song

1662
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
they're fucking hilarious but he'll

1663
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
have like all this like trashy music

1664
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
running to initial D music is just the most

1665
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
awesome thing you can do with your life

1666
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
well it's not like that intense

1667
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
but like

1668
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
he listens to like all this like

1669
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
you know incredibly

1670
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
plebbed here shit he once was

1671
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
my favorite quote from him ever was

1672
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
that Billy

1673
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
what's his name Billy Joe Armstrong

1674
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
he said Billy Joe Armstrong is the

1675
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
greatest songwriter of all time

1676
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
the guy from Green Day

1677
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and I was just like it blew my mind

1678
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
so hard that he legitimately

1679
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
thought that and then like

1680
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and he is like I could

1681
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
endless treasure trove that's about

1682
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
who's to say that he isn't though

1683
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I mean he could be but his reasoning was

1684
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
that he had sold the most records

1685
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
obviously I'm actually the greatest

1686
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
songwriter of all time but taking myself

1687
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
out of the equation I can see how

1688
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
the way I would describe what my dad's logic was

1689
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
for why Billy Joe Armstrong is because

1690
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
he's the most successful

1691
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
musician who my dad is also a fan of

1692
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
like yeah not that

1693
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
that's not good I like that because my dad

1694
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
really values

1695
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
like success like he thinks that if you

1696
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
are the best seller then that means you

1697
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
are the best but at the same time

1698
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
if he doesn't like it then he's not going to

1699
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
acknowledge it as the best so it's like

1700
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
he should say

1701
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Gangnam Style is the greatest musician of our

1702
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
generation then well that is a fucking

1703
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
song I would say but

1704
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I mean he is but okay his name is

1705
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Psy by the way

1706
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Gangnam Style

1707
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
his name is definitely Gangnam Style

1708
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
he makes K-pop

1709
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and doesn't have anything to do with it

1710
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
let's be honest what other songs is he ever going to write

1711
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
he's Gangnam Style until the day he dies

1712
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
he made Gentleman was good oh I like to hang over

1713
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't believe you stop it stop making up these

1714
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
fake songs he's not a real he's not even

1715
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
that song was literally just Gangnam Style

1716
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I don't even believe that Psy

1717
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
is a real person I think he's like computer

1718
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
animated like gorillas or something

1719
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
he's secretly created

1720
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
by Kesha so that she could make music

1721
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
while still being locked into contract that

1722
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
rapist she created

1723
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
you know what I want to talk about

1724
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
a small defense of plebs

1725
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and I want to make this a distinction because

1726
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
there's I think there's a very big difference

1727
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
that is extremely overlooked

1728
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
between having

1729
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
like pleb taste as

1730
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
in you only like

1731
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
shit and you have no good reasons for it

1732
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
and then I think there's

1733
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
an underrated populace

1734
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
of people who

1735
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
don't know a lot of different shows

1736
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
but actually do

1737
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
really appreciate the few things that they're into

1738
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
on a really deep level

1739
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and I think a great example is

1740
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Jesse's musical taste

1741
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
because if Jesse wants

1742
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I was what are you what is this

1743
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
what is this attack on my character

1744
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
as soon as I joined the podcast

1745
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm defending you first of all

1746
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
but you sent me

1747
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
not just insane clown posse

1748
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
but like I had a bunch of my friends

1749
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
make top 100 album charts once

1750
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and Jesse sent me one that had

1751
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
like entire discographies

1752
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
of five different artists it was like

1753
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
all the gorillas albums

1754
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
that doesn't mean I don't know of other music

1755
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'm not saying you don't but I'm saying that like

1756
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
it just seems like you really

1757
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
appreciate those few bands

1758
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
rather than like

1759
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
getting into like a fuck ton of different

1760
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
yeah because they're objectively the best bands

1761
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
yeah like Jesse would say that like

1762
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
the song he was listening to when he

1763
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
when he plowed puss for the first time

1764
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
you know that's a 10 out of 10 song just by virtue of that alone right

1765
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
you're being a personal connection stuff

1766
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
right I just remember

1767
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
thinking like I saw the list and I was like

1768
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
if anybody else sent me a list

1769
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and their top 10 was

1770
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
what your top 10 was

1771
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I would probably assume they were a

1772
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I think that song actually might have been the Rambo theme

1773
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
now that I'm thinking back to it

1774
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
but because I was watching

1775
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
first blood baby first blood

1776
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I was watching first blood part 2 on Valentine's Day

1777
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and I think that's what it actually was

1778
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I know for a fact that there's nothing

1779
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
that Jesse loves that he couldn't explain

1780
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
to me in great detail

1781
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
why it was there you know

1782
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
like if I said

1783
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
like if someone else told me like

1784
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
even if it's something as simple as like

1785
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I listened to it like when me and my best

1786
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
friends had this like amazing car ride

1787
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
in tune with our spirits and like 5 in the morning

1788
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
just driving across the state border

1789
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
running from the police like that's a much

1790
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
more interesting explanation than anything

1791
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
fucking anime everyday is going to give you

1792
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
hold on actually

1793
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
this is totally off topic but I think

1794
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
it's fascinating I can actually

1795
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
get that vicariously from other

1796
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
people's stories has that ever happened to you

1797
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
like you read

1798
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
what happened to someone else

1799
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
that's a mark of a great storyteller who can convey that

1800
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
you know that's kind of how I am with everything

1801
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
and I think when you have a personal connection

1802
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
to something that's the most patrician

1803
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
fucking thing there is you can like anything

1804
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
you can like a fucking doctor

1805
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
oh my gosh I just realized a huge irony here

1806
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
saved your wife as a child and that's a patrician

1807
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
doctor the whole time you were talking about

1808
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
this I was thinking about this one older

1809
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
cousin of mine who's pleb in the most

1810
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
annoying way where she's like uh this is

1811
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
this and her name is patricia

1812
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and so she's all like

1813
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
she's like uh this movie sucks

1814
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
like she just like says it and then like

1815
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
she doesn't say anything about it

1816
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
she's all like uh anime was a mistake

1817
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
she just makes you feel icky about it

1818
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I also know this other girl who I knew

1819
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
who was all like

1820
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that's what I thought you were gonna say

1821
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
just like the people who are like that

1822
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and I think they're all women

1823
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
like the people who are like uh this is

1824
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I guess it's plain I personally in my own life

1825
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I've only known women who are like this alright

1826
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I too hate women

1827
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I think we all agree

1828
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that kind of plebishness

1829
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
is my favorite kind of I have to talk to that

1830
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
the kind of people who don't even go on forums

1831
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
that's kind of what I was talking about

1832
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
you don't even go on forums

1833
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I mean like people who go on forums

1834
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
have some level of investment

1835
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
yeah that's true

1836
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
but to get back to what I was saying

1837
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
about the personal connections thing

1838
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
like yeah I agree with uh

1839
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
with Jesse I think there's a lot to be said about

1840
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
if it still evokes those

1841
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
feelings like

1842
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
because I've had stuff where I had a personal connection

1843
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
and then now I don't care anymore

1844
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
and like it's just like

1845
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
but sometimes

1846
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
this is my favorite example because there's a song

1847
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
by the band at the drive in called

1848
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
invalid litter department

1849
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and it's one of my favorite songs ever

1850
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and every time I hear it

1851
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I think about how I read on like some random

1852
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
it was on like songmeanings.com

1853
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
or something like someone just wrote this thing

1854
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
about how they were driving

1855
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
with their friend through like some bombed out city

1856
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
or something like like just passing by

1857
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
in the middle of the desert and like blasting the song

1858
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and they were like crying

1859
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
and now every time I listen to the song

1860
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I imagine myself driving down a desert road

1861
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
with a bombed out village

1862
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
crying and now that's my

1863
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
that's why I like the song now

1864
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
no that's totally normal

1865
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it's not even my experience but yeah

1866
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I think that's yeah

1867
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
humans are good at that

1868
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I think that's what keeps

1869
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
like me knowing that that's happened to me

1870
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
is why I love my job

1871
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I see it from an outsider perspective

1872
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
but I get emails from people who are always telling me

1873
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
how like you know I've changed the way that they saw

1874
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
certain shows and stuff and like

1875
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
there's been times where

1876
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
like my opinion of something was fundamentally

1877
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
changed by reading a review

1878
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
like uh

1879
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
like these two Agiloch albums called

1880
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
The Mansell and Ashes Against the Grain

1881
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and like at first I liked the first one

1882
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and didn't like the second one and then I read

1883
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
this review where this guy made this like

1884
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
really strong case for why the other one

1885
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
was the better one and then once I listened to it again

1886
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I completely understood

1887
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and now it's my favorite one you know

1888
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
yeah or like you bring up

1889
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
sometimes that like when we did our Kill La Kill

1890
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
podcast long ago we were both

1891
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
warm to lukewarm but then something changed

1892
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
and you fell in love and I don't know what it is

1893
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
but it didn't happen to me so

1894
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
well he was 8 out of 10 right out the gate

1895
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
like hey yeah you know what that's a good definition

1896
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
of pleb anyone who thinks Kill La Kill

1897
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
is not patrician is a pleb

1898
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
that is definitely true I agree

1899
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
well I agree I suppose

1900
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
but I don't think it's not patrician

1901
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I just don't love it I don't know whatever

1902
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I don't want to get into a whole thing

1903
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I came into this podcast late so I don't know if we discuss this already

1904
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
but we discuss how

1905
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
how completely stupid

1906
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
this topic is and how

1907
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
the word pleb itself is a word that only

1908
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
fucking idiots use and elitist swine

1909
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
would ever even use the word

1910
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
pleb in the first place

1911
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
like when I think of the word pleb

1912
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
when I think of the word pleb all I can picture

1913
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
is that anime snob

1914
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
yeah we win over that

1915
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but I want to make one of the anime snob

1916
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I know how I want this

1917
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I know these kinds of people

1918
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
when I hear pleb I think of my cousin

1919
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
even though her name is patricia

1920
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I think of her and think yeah

1921
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
this is a real kind of people and if you have to

1922
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
talk to them it's a real problem

1923
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
jesse if you want to talk about the snob

1924
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
you have to do the voice

1925
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
oh god

1926
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I want to suck so many dicks

1927
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I want to suck didgy bros dick

1928
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
that's why I poke him in the back

1929
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
like a little girl in third grade

1930
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I throw gum in his hair because I want to suck his dick

1931
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
guys hold on I actually legit

1932
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I logged into skype earlier

1933
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
and I had a message from him and it said

1934
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
if I paid for the trip

1935
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
would you come to the con in

1936
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Detroit

1937
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
that's all it said and I was

1938
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
so confused

1939
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
that little fucking fuck boy

1940
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
he's so desperate for your attention

1941
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
no idea what Connie's talking about

1942
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
or why

1943
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I don't know man but I

1944
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
actually you know I wouldn't take anything from him

1945
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
speaking of messages

1946
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000

1962
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
going to Detroit for an anime convention

1963
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
was the only part of America that's similar to this

1964
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I was there yesterday

1965
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000

alright cause this was a guy

1968
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
who wanted you to do some work

1969
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
for him and because you didn't like his work

1970
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
he accused you of being a pleb

1971
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
for not appreciating it

1972
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000

1975
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
just out of the pony

1976
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
sort of stuff I stopped making videos

1977
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and he approached me

1978
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
on deviantart and said

1979
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I saw you as a brony analyst

1980
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and I thought you could do an animation

1981
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
for my music and he sent me his music

1982
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
and it was absolutely terrible

1983
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and

1984
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
like hilariously terrible even for

1985
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
like a pony can we link that

1986
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
just to bully that person and have everybody

1987
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
thumb it down link in the description

1988
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
yeah go ahead

1989
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
he eventually got an animator to do

1990
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
something for it so whatever

1991
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
but I told him that it was terrible

1992
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and I didn't like it and I just

1993
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
you know cause I was angry

1994
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
the whole pony

1995
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
stuff I didn't want to be associated with it

1996
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I told him to fuck off and he responded

1997
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
immediately with a really long rant

1998
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
about how I was a piece of shit

1999
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and how he had been a guitarist

2000
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
for 20 years

2001
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
and he knew what he was talking about

2002
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
and then he accused me of

2003
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
like lots of strange things

2004
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
that like you couldn't

2005
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
infer from what I said but he

2006
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
you could tell he just had problems with people

2007
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
who felt these certain ways about certain things

2008
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
and then like

2009
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
then like three months later

2010
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
he responded to my same message again

2011
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
as if he had forgotten

2012
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
that he saw it before

2013
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
yeah he just did it again

2014
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I guess he just went on deviantart and saw it again

2015
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and got angry again

2016
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and then a few days ago

2017
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
it happened again

2018
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
they're all completely different

2019
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
very long

2020
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
angry comments against me

2021
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and it was really hilarious

2022
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
maybe he thinks you didn't read the first one

2023
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and he's trying to get you to respond

2024
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
but why would it be like

2025
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
the first one was a year ago

2026
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I think all this time

2027
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
he's been waiting for you to respond

2028
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
defeated and like apologetic

2029
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and he hasn't gotten his apology yet

2030
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
so he keeps reiterating

2031
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
the argument because he thinks you just haven't read it yet

2032
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I think that's what was going on here

2033
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I do want him to post again

2034
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
so I'm gonna wait and see if he does that

2035
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I think that the attribution

2036
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
of pleb-ness in this scenario

2037
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
is really interesting if you pick it apart

2038
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
cause like he's a pleb

2039
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
he's someone who sucks

2040
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and he doesn't get that he sucks

2041
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
but he's done it for a long time

2042
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
which he thinks means he's better

2043
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
but actually means he's worse

2044
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
because he's been a guitarist for so long

2045
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and he doesn't know what's good

2046
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
he has no ear for it

2047
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
he made this song but he thinks it's good

2048
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and it's not bad

2049
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I listened to it by the way back when he first posted

2050
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
but because you think

2051
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
that it's bad

2052
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
because he

2053
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
has done it for a long time

2054
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
thinks he must be good

2055
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
it must be you that's the pleb

2056
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
because you don't appreciate how good this thing

2057
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
must necessarily be

2058
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
due to how good he must necessarily be

2059
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
not only that

2060
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
but in some of his things

2061
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
he accused me of being

2062
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
he assumed that I wasn't a musician

2063
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
because I didn't like his music

2064
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
why don't you put down the guitar hero

2065
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
controller and let the real guitar hero

2066
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
you just brought me to what I think

2067
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
is now in my opinion

2068
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
the truest definition of pleb

2069
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and the fucking hilarious irony

2070
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
is that that anime snob is the perfect example

2071
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't find that surprising at all

2072
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
well it's only surprising

2073
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
because that anime snob has seen

2074
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
way more anime than anybody else ever

2075
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
he's seen

2076
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
an unbelievable amount

2077
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
so you'd think he would have figured some shit out by now

2078
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
but I think if I had to put

2079
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
a word to plebness

2080
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
and lack of intellectual curiosity

2081
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
just believing that

2082
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
you have reached the end

2083
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
and that there's not further to go

2084
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
and that is as opposed to

2085
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
normies who just don't involve themselves

2086
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
in any of this shit

2087
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I mean if you've seen

2088
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
all the anime

2089
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and you still can't appreciate the good stuff

2090
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that's way sadder than

2091
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
if you've seen every anime

2092
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
and you don't understand why someone might like

2093
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
kaon

2094
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
it's that

2095
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
at some point in his life

2096
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
that anime snob reached the conclusion

2097
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that he understood what is good

2098
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
and what is bad

2099
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
and he's just applied that exact formula

2100
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
to absolutely everything

2101
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
and I think that is exactly

2102
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
what

2103
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I don't want to accuse anime every day

2104
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
of that but that's the impression I've gotten

2105
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
from him and that's why that taste bothers me

2106
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
because I think that's how you end up

2107
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
with that taste is by being

2108
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
that way

2109
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I think a true pleb is just

2110
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
anyone who refuses to

2111
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
see what someone else might see

2112
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
in something

2113
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I totally see what you mean that you consume so much media

2114
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
you don't get it, reminds me of a great quote

2115
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I know people who read

2116
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
enormously, book for book, letter for letter

2117
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
yet whom I would not describe

2118
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
as well read

2119
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
they possess a massive knowledge but their brain is unable

2120
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
to organize and register

2121
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
the material they have taken in

2122
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Adolf Hitler

2123
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
who said that?

2124
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Adolf Hitler

2125
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
TWIST

2126
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
FIGURE TWIST

2127
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
it's amazing

2128
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
wealth of Hitler quotes

2129
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
no it's just that one

2130
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
it's just that one

2131
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
wait is that why I heard this before

2132
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
because you did that one to me before

2133
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
we're all sitting here nodding

2134
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
agreement like man whoever said this

2135
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
really knew a thing or two

2136
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
oh my god

2137
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm blown away

2138
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
we've reached critical mean guys

2139
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
bam

2140
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
he pulled that one out before

2141
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I guess we're Nazis now

2142
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
this is the Nazi past now

2143
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
the funny thing is I actually for a second thought it might be Maddox

2144
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
because the way you read it was so different

2145
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
oh man

2146
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
well okay let's be real

2147
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I mean are we just gonna

2148
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
disavow anything Hitler says just because he's

2149
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Hitler

2150
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
well he was a vegan

2151
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
if Hitler says the sky is blue

2152
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
are we all gonna say it's green now

2153
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
isn't this also a quote

2154
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
no

2155
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
that's the quote from me

2156
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
if Hitler does X is it bad

2157
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
no no no that exact phrase

2158
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
if Hitler says the sky is blue are we all gonna

2159
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
maybe Jesse said it in a different podcast

2160
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I've heard that exact phrase

2161
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
yeah Hitler wasn't wrong about everything

2162
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
we can all admit that

2163
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Hitler might have made

2164
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
a lot of bad things

2165
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
but he definitely wasn't a pleb

2166
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
he was not

2167
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
he might have made one small guffaw

2168
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
once in his career

2169
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
he might have been a pleb about painting

2170
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
though maybe that's why he didn't make it

2171
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
yeah that was definitely the case

2172
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
he was so pleb with that it

2173
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
created a deep frustration with him

2174
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
about the world

2175
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
plebness caused 9-11

2176
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
that's what he did right

2177
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
can I tell you guys about

2178
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
you know I have a

2179
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
do you guys have this as well

2180
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
where you feel like

2181
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
if you don't know enough about a subject

2182
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
do you feel like inclined

2183
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
to not talk about it

2184
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
absolutely absolutely

2185
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
absolutely not let me tell you people about homestuck

2186
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
let me tell you about

2187
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
the worst thing ever created

2188
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
in the history of it

2189
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Jesse I would love to see you make a homestuck

2190
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
review with exactly as much power

2191
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
exactly

2192
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
you know what guys

2193
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
it's funny because we were arguing about homestuck

2194
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
the other day for like 6 hours

2195
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
it was horrible you guys are bad people

2196
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I went to motorcity

2197
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
comicon yesterday

2198
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
as soon as I walk in the building

2199
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
was the first thing I see

2200
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
two fat troll cosplayers

2201
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and I just instantly thought of you guys

2202
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and how much I hate ya

2203
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and how much I hate homestuck

2204
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
it was you, it was digi and ben

2205
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
dressed up as homestuckers

2206
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I found it in my convention

2207
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
see the sad thing Jesse is that

2208
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
it was the only one they ever dressed up as

2209
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
the grey guy with the horns

2210
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
that's all you ever fucking see

2211
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
oh my god

2212
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I'm so fucking mad

2213
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
anyways

2214
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
what's his name

2215
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
what's his name

2216
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
vagina or vaginal or something

2217
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
there's 12

2218
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
actually yeah there's 24 of them now

2219
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
actually technically there's 26 with the

2220
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
24 identical character designs

2221
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
wow what a great property

2222
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
what a great work of art

2223
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
so the point I was trying to make

2224
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
before Jesse completely derailed it with homestuck

2225
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
is that like

2226
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
the biggest reason I do so many anime

2227
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
videos is that I just don't feel

2228
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
comfortable that I'm like

2229
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
like I have an authoritative voice on anything

2230
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
else like I know

2231
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I know enough about anime to talk about it

2232
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and not that I know more than everybody

2233
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
but like that I

2234
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
feel that the shit I say is not bullshit

2235
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and it comes from a place of knowing

2236
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
what I'm talking about and like being able to

2237
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
comment on it and then like

2238
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
when it comes to stuff like films

2239
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
and comics and stuff like that that I don't

2240
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
like even though I do know a lot

2241
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
about them there's just this feeling of

2242
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I haven't seen

2243
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
enough you know like I haven't seen enough of the

2244
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
classics I don't know enough of the like the

2245
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
real shit and I've seen these

2246
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
it's like if you're gonna go into writing an analysis

2247
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
post about it you're gonna have to constantly

2248
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
double track to make sure

2249
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
you don't get something wrong

2250
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
not much about factual inaccuracies but like I've

2251
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
noticed this and this is something that bothers me

2252
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
about plebs and it's not

2253
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
even that they're doing a bad job

2254
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
it's the lack of perspective

2255
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
where someone will sometimes I'll see

2256
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
this happens a lot with like newbie anime

2257
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
reviewers the perfect example would be

2258
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Madoka Magica where like

2259
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
like my review that I wrote of it was

2260
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
largely in response to the

2261
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
the pleb-ness of so many reviews of

2262
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Madoka because

2263
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
that show had a

2264
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
really broad appeal like a ton of people watched it

2265
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
like it was a lot of people one of their first

2266
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
anime like it was

2267
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
the biggest show of 2011

2268
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and there were so many

2269
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
people who wrote about it as this

2270
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
deconstruction of magical girl

2271
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
shows or as this

2272
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
they kept saying like oh it's like this dark

2273
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
take on magical girls and I'm like

2274
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
the fact is none of you

2275
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
have seen any magical girl shows

2276
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
and I know that like I know

2277
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that because like the next

2278
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
most popular one card captor

2279
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Sakura is also dark

2280
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
like it also has

2281
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
death and themes of

2282
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
like a like a

2283
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
you know just like darker themes like more adult stuff

2284
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
that you wouldn't expect because like Madoka

2285
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
like the way Madoka is written

2286
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
it's sort of as though like hey magical girls

2287
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
let's be a magical girl it'd be really easy

2288
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
it'll be really fun oh turns out there's a lot of death so

2289
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
it makes people go oh so it must be representing

2290
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
the entire genre

2291
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
that it comes from right yeah that's the thing

2292
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
like and it was funny because it was one time

2293
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I tried to I wrote a post

2294
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
called like how Madoka Magica could be

2295
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
a deconstruction of magical girls and the only

2296
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
conclusion I could come to was the

2297
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
fact that she never transforms

2298
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
until the very end of the show

2299
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
like you know it's not until the very end that she makes her one

2300
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
big transformation and that's the only major

2301
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
one but then I thought about it and

2302
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
technically in card captor Sakura she never

2303
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
transforms she just puts on costumes

2304
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
that Tomoyo gives her so that was already

2305
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
like deconstructing the trope

2306
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
of the magical girl transformation because

2307
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
clamp the artists they didn't

2308
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
want to just have her transform into one outfit

2309
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
they wanted her to wear different cute outfits

2310
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
every time so there was no transformation

2311
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
she just literally put on clothes

2312
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
that her friends was making for her so it

2313
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
seems like this happens with a lot of different genres with the anime

2314
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
like I saw a clip of like an old Gundam

2315
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
thing it was like you have to get in the robot

2316
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
man he's like I don't want to I'm scared

2317
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
the plot of the original Gundam

2318
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
like it was like this is from the

2319
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
80s like 15 years before even Galleon

2320
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and you're already scared what's going on

2321
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
here I don't know man I'm just scared

2322
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
everyone would be scared to get in the robot not just Shinji

2323
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Ikari come on man you pleb it's not

2324
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
it's not wrong to say that like

2325
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Eva you know did new things with it because

2326
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
obviously that's true but it is wrong to say it's

2327
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
never been done before which is just showing

2328
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
that you don't know fucking jack shit

2329
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
there's really nothing always that Eva did

2330
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that had never been done before it was

2331
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
a conglomeration of a bunch of good ideas

2332
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
into one super good idea

2333
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
you know

2334
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
when it comes to reviews I'm always

2335
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
really scared of being

2336
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
caught out as

2337
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
not knowing my shit

2338
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
it's not

2339
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
so much that people will turn and laugh at me

2340
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
like you fucked up it's like

2341
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
from that point on people will take me less seriously

2342
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
because I was incorrect

2343
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
well like if I want to do like a video about

2344
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
movies I specifically writing

2345
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
a way to where I'm not like putting on airs

2346
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
of knowing what I'm talking about that much in regards

2347
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
to video games I know enough

2348
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
to where if someone who knows more than me

2349
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
is going to correct me I don't feel embarrassed because

2350
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
those people are like legit next level

2351
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
like hardcore gaming 101 fanatics

2352
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I'll say though like

2353
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
to give two examples of two similar

2354
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
YouTubers who one

2355
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
of whom comes off

2356
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
as a pleb sometimes in a way that bothers me and the other

2357
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
magically doesn't

2358
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
PBS idea channel

2359
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
that guy I know he has

2360
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
an incredible breadth of knowledge I know

2361
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
he always tries to get into every new

2362
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
nerd thing and like if it comes to music

2363
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
he knows everything he knows everything

2364
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
there is to know about music he's into the most obscure

2365
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
shit he's into the craziest stuff

2366
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I know he knows film pretty well but

2367
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
he does this thing because

2368
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
on idea channel he always tries to like

2369
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
jump into every like big name

2370
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
topic and sometimes

2371
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
you can just tell he doesn't

2372
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
know shit about that medium because

2373
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
like it'll be something like

2374
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Madoka where something comes along that everyone

2375
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
makes a big deal out of and he talks about

2376
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
it in the way that everyone else is

2377
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
without having the context that it's actually

2378
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
not that impressive or different it pisses me

2379
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
off that he like thinks it's valuable to like

2380
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
restate what everyone's already stated while

2381
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
adding nothing to the conversation those videos he makes

2382
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
piss me off let me guess you're going to compare him

2383
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
to nerd writer right because

2384
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
with nerd writer he has

2385
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
like this amazing ability that

2386
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I cannot like I don't

2387
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
know how much like for instance

2388
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
with comics he made this video about the

2389
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Sandman comics and like

2390
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
it was so mind blowing to me

2391
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
that after this guy had made all these

2392
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
film analysis all these song analysis

2393
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
all this other shit and then he brings

2394
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
comics into the fold and not just like

2395
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
a like one everyone knows it was

2396
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
fucking Sandman and I was like does he

2397
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
know a lot about comics

2398
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
can he possibly know pretty well

2399
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
much about so many different

2400
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
mediums you know like he's fucking

2401
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
he just does

2402
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
he does analysis of such a broad variety

2403
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
of subjects and he always gives this impression

2404
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
like he's known about it forever like he's been a fan of

2405
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
it since he was in high school you know like

2406
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I do I feel like

2407
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
maybe it has to do with his writing style like

2408
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
he's able to write it in a way to where it comes off

2409
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
correctly whereas I did channel I remember

2410
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
in his kill la kill video he was talking about

2411
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
like the names of certain things

2412
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and kill la kill and he was saying you know it could

2413
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
have been named that because maybe

2414
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
they had their like play on words with

2415
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
their words in the Japanese language and he

2416
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
listed all these things and I'm like I made a comment

2417
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
like dude yeah that you obviously only

2418
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
know that by looking at it on Wikipedia

2419
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
yet you wrote it as though you came

2420
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
to that conclusion on your own

2421
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
that was very strange and I remember

2422
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
that's a good example because what made

2423
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
that so plebby to me is that

2424
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
that's every fucking anime

2425
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
everyone's named after puns like that's

2426
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
just yeah that's like one of the most

2427
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
like Japanese humor is like

2428
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
all puns they love

2429
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
word play they love kanji

2430
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
you were born to the wrong civilization

2431
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like because so much of

2432
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
how so much of how they

2433
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
title stuff is always that like it's

2434
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
a play on the way the characters are read

2435
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
because almost every character can be read

2436
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
multiple ways so they have all these

2437
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
fucking word play gags that never

2438
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
are fucking translatable well yeah for me

2439
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
it was just weird because he was saying it as though

2440
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
he came to that conclusion but there's

2441
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
no way he didn't just read that on Wikipedia

2442
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
but he read I was like

2443
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I've never seen that before

2444
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
in any video yeah I got you

2445
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I got you I have seen that

2446
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
videos it's called body video

2447
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
where everything he says is

2448
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
recollected information from forums

2449
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
true but uh

2450
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
but yeah well he does a

2451
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
nice strip presenting yeah I don't mind

2452
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I like his channel but

2453
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
yeah he's been very

2454
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
widely accused of plagiarism

2455
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
you know what's cool is that all this time we're talking about

2456
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
plugs we're talking about patricians and I'm

2457
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
watching a super mario 64

2458
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
speedrun the most patrician thing

2459
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
depending on how far you want to get into it

2460
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I am watching a speedrun of an entire

2461
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
alternate level map of entirely different

2462
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
levels at someone's speedrunning super mar 64

2463
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
super patrician go watch panic

2464
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
koic 2012 patrician

2465
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
actually you got me yeah man

2466
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
brings me to another thing about like what I was just

2467
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
describing though is like I don't know

2468
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
about you guys but I feel like I will

2469
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
never in my entire life

2470
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
will I be the guy who knows the most about

2471
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
anything like yeah no

2472
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
subject on which I mean out of like the

2473
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
seven billion people it's exceedingly

2474
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
unlikely that you will be just because

2475
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I don't even think panic koic is the most

2476
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
knowledgeable about sm64 is just he's the

2477
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
only one with that level of knowledge who makes

2478
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
videos right like I think there's always

2479
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
going to be and I'm always jealous

2480
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
of those people because like as much as

2481
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I love chaos and could talk about it all

2482
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
day like I don't know I couldn't tell

2483
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
you the episode names even you know

2484
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
like and even with when I was into my little

2485
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
pony and I could do that like I didn't watch

2486
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
them over and over again I couldn't tell you

2487
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
as somebody out there does somebody does

2488
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
there's definitely someone I recite every

2489
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
episode of the show to you I think

2490
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
there was a period where a couple years

2491
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
ago where I was probably in the top

2492
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
500 globally of South Park

2493
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
knowledge and like everything about it

2494
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
like I could tell you things but that's I

2495
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
haven't updated my knowledge you know like

2496
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I watched the South Park movie

2497
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
it was with a like my brother's friend

2498
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and he had his older brother who was

2499
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
like 16 or 17 at the time

2500
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
and he was literally

2501
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
word for word reciting

2502
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
the movie as we were watching it

2503
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
because he had seen it so many times

2504
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
he had memorized it. Now see that's

2505
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
that's fine you can do that if you want

2506
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I just I don't really feel the need to get into that

2507
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
because I know I don't either I feel this

2508
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
yeah but I just I'm much interested

2509
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
when I watch a show I'm interested

2510
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
in like what I can

2511
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
get out of it intellectually you know

2512
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
well yeah I think there's something more than just

2513
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
wrote memorization like I feel like I may

2514
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
have been one of the top people in terms of

2515
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
like being able to understand

2516
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
South Park in certain ways like

2517
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
like after watching like every

2518
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
interview I was able to figure out

2519
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
exactly why their production cycle

2520
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
is so hectic it's because they

2521
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
back in the day they could never get around to writing an episode until they had no time left they just kept

2522
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
procrastinating there's not a single interview

2523
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that says this but I watched all of them until

2524
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I was able to piece it together that's why by the way

2525
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
that's why it's done like that it's just back in

2526
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
the day they could never stop

2527
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
procrastinating until they had no time left

2528
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and so they would just come up with whatever was in the news

2529
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
and write that that was that's why they made

2530
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
it like that and they just stuck with it because it was a

2531
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
successful model but no one knows that but

2532
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
me and now everyone listening to this podcast

2533
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
well I think my envy

2534
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
of those people is just that I think

2535
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
to me you can never

2536
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
analyze something too much because at some

2537
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
point you get to where like the timbre

2538
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
timbre timbre of someone's

2539
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
voice top timbre like the timbre

2540
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
like the timbre of their the way

2541
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
that they their inflection when they say that

2542
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
one line of dialogue and like why it

2543
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
makes you feel something that they said it that way

2544
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
like you know that could be

2545
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
interesting thing or like why I just

2546
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
watched this color being used in this

2547
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
scene is like why it makes you feel something

2548
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
and uh you know and

2549
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
well we can ignore the color of the curtains

2550
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
in the background make shit up right

2551
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
again watch panicoic he just came out

2552
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
with a video about Monty Mole spawning

2553
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000

01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
pan and kiyok because he doesn't

2556
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
want to do narration that much it takes

2557
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
too long so don't ask him or else

2558
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
