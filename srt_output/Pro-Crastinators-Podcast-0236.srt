Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's another episode of your favorite podcast

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:23,080
that sucks. Hi everybody. Hi Ben. Gibbont's here. Digi's here. I'm here. And our guest this

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,700
week is Kazzy. Hey guys. I'm Kazzy. From the internet. From the internet. Hey guys. It's

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,480
Kazzy. It's Kazzy. Do you want to introduce yourself? Yeah, sure. To explain who you are.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,240
Most of our listeners probably have heard of you. Yeah, sure. You can introduce me and

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:47,400
then I'll pick up whatever you like. Kazzy is an artist and a fursuit maker. Wow. That's

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,760
it. Yeah, that's it. I mean illustrator. I don't know. Yeah, illustrator. Primarily illustrator.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,280
Yeah. Yeah, she paints. You make really good art that everybody should look at now. Thank you. Go

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,560
to Instagram and Twitter linked in the description. Yeah. Yes, based. Yeah, I do that mostly and then

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,080
I'm starting to be a fursuit maker. Just starting might do more of it. I don't know yet. Well,

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,640
you say you're just starting. Well, how much does it cost to buy a fursuit from you? That depends

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,520
on a lot of things like what like how detailed your character is and like do you want the full

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,120
thing or do you want like the head and the price range? Would you imagine the price range? Well,

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,800
um, I am working on one right now that is just a head set of paws and a tail and that was like

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:55,240
$750. Um, and that's almost done. It's not that bad. I guess if you wanted like the the big the big

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,040
dick one that's got like the padding in it, it's like your full body. Yeah, yeah. You know, standard

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,560
like normal complicated character design. Probably like, I mean, over over 2000,

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,320
um, somewhere around like last last year around there last year for like months and months.

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,840
Every time I saw you, you had a piece, you had like you would you would have like a hand or a

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,360
or a foot or something like in your bag and you would pull it out and be sewing on it and it took

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,200
you forever. It did. The thing about me to make it to make Colby Jack. Yeah, Colby Jack is my

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,040
show Colby Jack on screen right now. This is the thing I saw. I saw be pieced together like

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Frank. I think we I think we showed this when it was completed on the PCP. Thank you. I remember

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,520
you telling Ellie Azar to show it. Yeah. And he did. Well, show it again. Yeah, show it again.

25
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,240
Yeah. I mean, the thing about him was that I mean, he was my second one that I had made.

26
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,560
My first one I made way back in high school and then the second one

27
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,280
um, took quite a while because I just decided to hand sew him and I really don't know why I

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,960
have a machine, but the pedal is missing for it. Um, so I don't know. I just decided I'll just take

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:23,400
forever on it, I guess. Hell yeah. Hand sewing is relaxing. Yeah. I would like to, I want to get

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,480
into sewing or keep convincing myself that I will, but like, this, you know, that's just another

31
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,720
thing to be doing. And I already didn't do too many goddamn things. I want to, well, I figure it's

32
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,480
probably a good thing to do while you're like watching stuff, right? Like, yeah, how mindless

33
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,520
is it? Like, can I, can I, is it more like I have to listen to a podcast or could I actually like

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,680
watch anime? Could I read subtitles and try to sew? It's like, um, like hundreds upon hundreds of

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,960
repetitive tasks that you could easily, like after a few thousand times, you don't even need to think

36
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,600
about what your hands are doing and yeah, you can listen to a lot of stuff. I'm just wondering if I

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,240
can read subtitles. Um, yeah, I mean, what would you want to make? Like clothes or, or what? Well,

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,360
yeah, I'd love to make, I don't know, everything. I would love to, I mean, ideally in my mind,

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,920
every aspect of my life would be DIY. Like it would have either be able to make everything myself

40
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,520
or have people around who know how to make everything and I can pay them to do it. But I would,

41
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,600
I want everything to be in house fashion. Yeah, if you had like, I mean, if you, if you, if you've

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,400
got a sewing machine, which is what you would use, you wouldn't hand sew clothes. Um, I have a sewing

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,080
machine. So, well, there you go. I mean, if you know how to use it and you just run the fabric

44
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,760
through. Yeah, I do know how to use it, but there's lots of different like types of stitching and

45
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,040
like ways to do it for different stuff. I guess I just gotta, you know, decide what I want to make

46
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,600
and then watch the video about how to make it. I guess it's probably not that different from cooking,

47
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,000
right? Like just follow the recipe. Yeah, it is exactly like that. It is just like, there is a way

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,480
to do it and there's plenty of resources to learn how online. And the same goes for fur suit making.

49
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,920
I always think about like, fucking, you know, sewing or, or, or like the,

50
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,440
what does it even call it, crochet that I was doing a while back and I made those little boots.

51
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,440
Stupid things. For, um, for Vriska, right? For Vriska. Yeah, I put this, she's still wearing

52
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:35,000
them because it is cold still. Um, um, and it's like, I think I just like the action and just

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,960
repeating the action. I don't really like following like, like having a big complicated like blueprint

54
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,240
and having to follow it precisely. I just want something to move my hands with while I think

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,440
or while I listen to stuff. So if, if I had like, like a big piece of fabric, I would just like,

56
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:00,360
I don't know, sew into it for no reason. Just, just put thread in it. I guess the only other

57
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,000
thing about me is that, um, I mean, I've, I've known you guys for, for quite a while. Um, and

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,560
that's true. Um, I guess you could say that this is Munchie's return because he is in the same

59
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,440
house as me. So he's technically here a little bit. Wow. That's amazing. That's incredible.

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Wow. Maybe we'll hear a fart in the distance or something. Oh, that man does not fart. He does

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,720
not do it. I don't know why. I think he insists. Yeah, I think he mentioned that before that he

62
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,520
like insisted he does not fart or something. Yeah, no, it's true. After living with him for a while,

63
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:42,360
I can confirm it's true. It's fucked up. It's way fucked. Um, we were supposed to hang out on

64
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,120
Halloween. That's right. But then I canceled. We all canceled. Because of COVID, because of COVID

65
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,840
and snow, two, two big, two great tastes. Two of the worst things in the world, actually. Yeah.

66
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:03,960
Yeah. Yeah. You know what? My two least favorite things. Uh, I got exposed. I've been exposed to

67
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,840
COVID now. Yeah. Tell me about that. I'm, I'm a little bit worried about you. I saw on, on Twitter.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,080
Well, it's probably okay. There's not that much to tell. It's basically just two of my roommates

69
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,920
work for this. Um, I guess it's a landscaping company. And I guess someone who they work with

70
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,800
got tested positive. And so they're, they're testing a bunch of other people from that company.

71
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,440
Those guys are getting tested on Wednesday. And so on Wednesday, I will know for sure whether

72
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,960
like, oh, did any of it get transmitted to them? Has it, has it been in my house? Right. Um,

73
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,440
okay. So it's not like sure if I, or anything yet. No, it's not, it's, it's not even like that

74
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,040
likely that either of them would have got it. Uh, and if, even if they got it doesn't, wouldn't

75
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,800
mean I would get it, but you know, it's, it's possible. It's quite, I mean, if you're in a

76
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,640
house together, it's pretty likely. I don't know what the chance is, but I feel like it would

77
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,040
probably happen. I've, well, I've heard that like, it's possible like within an apartment,

78
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,720
like with roommates and stuff, if you just have the person who is, has COVID use a separate

79
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,440
bathroom from everyone else, they can just keep it to themselves. That's what we did. We said,

80
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,080
those guys now, those guys got to use the downstairs bathroom now until, until they

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,840
get tested. Oh, the fucking, the fucking gross disgusting one. Which, which one? Well, you know,

82
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,120
I guess you could say the upstairs one, the upstairs one's clean now. The upstairs one

83
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,120
actually looks great. The upstairs one is, is fine and normal downstairs. I've seen,

84
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,080
I've seen some shit. Right. Well, I don't use that one. So that's, that's not on me.

85
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,360
You see, it feels like this, the place you would expect to see some shit is in the bathroom.

86
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,920
It's true. I saw some literal shit there one time and I never went back.

87
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,520
I thought this is unacceptable. It's a little, it's a little concerning. I mean,

88
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,160
before in the first wave, like I didn't know anyone that had it or like was in contact with

89
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,760
someone that was exposed to it. And now there's this with you, Ben. And then there was someone who

90
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,880
I used to be quite good friends with posted on Twitter that, you know, she's got it and her

91
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,080
whole family's got it. And it's scary. Yeah, the third wave is coming. It's going to be a big one.

92
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,720
It's a, we're fucked. We're totally fucked. I'm happy that I don't keep up with anything

93
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,440
that's ever going on anywhere. And I've no, I don't, didn't know there was a second wave

94
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,000
or a third wave on the way. What is the second wave? I thought this was the second wave.

95
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,080
Well, Matt, there's no third wave. We didn't have a second wave in Massachusetts yet because

96
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,960
we weren't into like super lockdown all through the summer. So we like didn't have the second one.

97
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,240
But now, yeah. I was literally unaware. It was big in March. And then they said lockdown.

98
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,200
And it went all the way down real low during the summer. And then it started creeping up again.

99
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,440
Now we're in a second lockdown. It's a second wave trying to cut that. We should probably,

100
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,000
we probably need a second lockdown right about now. Are we not in lockdown now? I guess not. Yeah.

101
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,040
You're back at school. Well, I mean, yeah, but I'm not going, I'm not going anywhere.

102
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,360
Like my classes are remote.

103
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,960
Right. Well, I don't know. I don't know if there's, I don't know what technically

104
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,400
constitutes lockdown versus quarantine versus whatever, whatever, just shut everything down.

105
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,840
Just, just, just burn it all down is what I would say. We got to start over.

106
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,040
You should return to monkey. Sure. Monkey.

107
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,560
Monkey, please hold out thine hand to me.

108
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know. COVID's pretty good. Can't wait. I will, I will, if I, if I get it,

109
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,440
I will buy the I Have COVID shirt from Teespring. I promise.

110
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,880
Why did you guys make that? The procrastinators affiliated I Have COVID shirt branded

111
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,360
procrastinators. Link, link in the description.

112
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,680
If you have COVID, you should buy it. That'd be like a monetary incentive for us to spread COVID

113
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,880
as far as we possibly can. I Have COVID and so can you. I mean, I can only imagine wearing that to

114
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,480
like a grocery store and getting subsequently kicked out of said store even if you don't have it.

115
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,840
It would just make, it would just make everyone avoid you and then you'd never get it.

116
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,520
You know, it's the best defense. No one would come near you. I don't know. If I saw someone

117
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,840
wearing a shirt that said I Have COVID, I would be very uncomfortable. Just because of the uncertainty.

118
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,360
Like, is that real? You probably assumed they were trying to warn you, right? Like,

119
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,960
I mean, they're doing a service. Either they were taking their warning very seriously or

120
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,320
they were like fucking with everyone. And, you know, that uncertainty I'd be like, I don't like this.

121
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:09,240
Uh, well, you know, you, you too listener can make everyone uncomfortable. I can't wait. I'm

122
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:18,120
looking forward to it. Um, hey guys, president of the United States of America, we got him. Here

123
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,480
we go. Our boy Jay Rob. We got our boy Jay Rob in there. I know now it's time. He's in there.

124
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,280
Kick grandpa's ass. I want corn pop for VP.

125
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,520
No, I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna stand Biden ironically anymore. It's not

126
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,360
funny anymore. I think I'm hugely excited if Biden really is president for the fact that

127
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,640
hating on the president, I feel like will be an uncontroversial opinion for almost everybody.

128
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:58,680
Hmm. It's, you know, it'll be very hard to hate. So far for the Trump presidency, it's like

129
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,200
we either really hate this man or you don't. Yeah. And you pretty much have to be on one side

130
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,720
of the other. I hated him, but like only as much as a normal president. So it was kind of weird

131
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,960
for me. But I also hate Biden as much as a normal president. But like, I don't think anybody in the

132
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,960
world like is going to step up to bat for this bad. Like nobody's going to get like weird defensive

133
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,320
over me shitting on Biden, including liberals. Like, I mean, certainly less so than with this

134
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,360
past presidency. Some of them do, but yeah. I can't think of anybody who I would encounter who would

135
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,160
be mad that I was talking shit about Biden like ever that in real, in real life. No, I don't know

136
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:49,160
anybody. I don't know. I feel like if anybody is is like, like, like legitimately excited for

137
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,280
Biden, they love him right now. Like, I think it's it's very much they probably got paid by him.

138
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,400
No, no, no, they're just like so happy that Trump is not there. And they're just re reconstituting

139
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,000
that happiness into Biden's so fucking cool. And then that'll wear off when they realize,

140
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,960
yeah, he's just the guy. I mean, it's just what it's just one of the other presidents,

141
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,600
like standing Biden is just a meme. Hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. For me, it was a meme, but now it's

142
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,840
over. It's not a meme. The one thing that is potentially good about Biden is that he does

143
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,000
just kind of do whatever he gets like paid or told to do. So like, maybe we can just literally

144
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,800
bully him into doing whatever we want. Like, I mean, that's the hope. That's the plan. Yeah,

145
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,040
I wonder how well that will work. But hopefully he's not gonna be like a super reactionary like

146
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,720
law and order like fucking crackdown kind of guy. He's more he's like, he's a little more

147
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,600
conciliatory. He has his base has a little bit more expectations of him to like, not, I don't

148
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,760
know, like violate the Constitution. I just think like Trump's way of doing things was like,

149
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,440
if you told him that he was wrong about something or did something bad, he'd just be like, no,

150
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,760
fuck you. And then, you know, maybe he'll stop doing it. Maybe he won't. But like Biden is like,

151
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,800
if you were if everybody was like, fuck you, you did this, then he would try to reason with people

152
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,680
and fail. Yeah. And that's why he might be invincible. Yeah, I agree. He's he

153
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Democrats actually care about criticism for better or for worse. They they their feelings can be

154
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:40,920
hurt. Right. And like, I think that Obama was just like so charismatic that it was a lot harder

155
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,080
for people to want to just like tear into him. But like, Joe Biden's just like an old creepy

156
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,560
child molester. So it'll be really easy to tear into him. Yeah. No, I think you're right. Yeah. I

157
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:59,720
think hate hating on the Prez will be just something we can all as a nation get behind.

158
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,680
I agree with that. I don't know if you guys saw this, but I saw a clip getting passed around on

159
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:12,920
Twitter that was John McCain's concessions concession speech from 2008. And it was really

160
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,520
interesting. Have you not seen it? No, I don't think so. I would take a look. It's really interesting

161
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:27,320
to compare that to now because I mean, what we see now is the the president of the United States

162
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:37,640
throwing an absolute temper tantrum. Yeah, he looks very funny. He he is just like, I don't

163
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,960
I don't I don't know how to describe it picture of him in the white hat, like walking into the

164
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,880
White House like forlorn over his shoulder. Absolutely. And I watched this. I watched this

165
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,640
this speech from John McCain from when he lost in 2008. And, you know, aside from, you know,

166
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,640
his policies or whatever, when I listen to that speech, I like the the crowd starts

167
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,640
booing Obama at the beginning and he he settles them down, he gets them to stop.

168
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,040
And he's like, No, I'm happy for the guy. Like, I know that he wants to do what's best for this

169
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:21,800
country. All I care about is the good of America and the good of the people. And so, you know,

170
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,040
well, we have our differences. You know, you know, you know, he he he stepped he he lost with

171
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,520
grace. And it's such a world of difference from what we're seeing right now. It's it's incredible.

172
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,480
I mean, you got to you got to lose with if you lose, you might as well lose with grace. So like,

173
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,320
you don't look like an asshole to the current admit you should play nice with the people who

174
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,120
are going to be, you know, your bosses for the next four years. Also, I won't be the case for him

175
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,440
because he's not a politician. So for McCain, no, for for Trump, I'm saying that's why he wouldn't

176
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,640
have to play. Yeah, that's that's true. That's true. Yeah, I'll just try and like make his own

177
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:06,040
country. He's going to do Trump TV. Oh, yeah, I'm going to start a media empire. It's going to be so

178
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:12,840
sick. I'm so hyped for Trump TV. I really think I really think it's going to be great. And I think

179
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,360
this is like it's going to split. It's already or like officially announced to like multiple sources

180
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,400
have better be quote unquote better and less fake news than the media. He just wants to make

181
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,760
his own media. Oh, that's interesting. I mean, it'll be just propaganda, but

182
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,400
yeah, sure. I think I think I think it could really split the Republican vote,

183
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,680
which would be so great. That would just be the that would be the sickest thing.

184
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,040
I don't know. I don't know how much of the base he'll take with him. I've never been happier

185
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,480
about libertarians because of the shit that happens. Oh, yeah.

186
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,920
They literally cost him the election. I literally really did. And honestly, my favorite thing to

187
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,800
come out of this so far is to watch, you know, beside aside from Trump's meltdown himself,

188
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,160
the meltdown of the MAGA people is hilarious because in 2016, all they were doing after the

189
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,000
election was going like, oh, my God, look at these look at these liberals, you know, they're so

190
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,680
triggered by snowflakes and they're doing the exact same thing. There's like a slightly different

191
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,280
tone to it. But yeah, they're doing their version of it. I mean, what we see now is like all the

192
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,720
coping. I know, I love the cringe comps. I want more cringe comps. I've been I've been on poll

193
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,920
a bunch and it's all like, it's all like, you know, it's fraud, like, oh, look, the curve has a

194
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,640
squiggle in it. Oh, that's fraud. And like, it's like, no, no, Trump's going to take it to court.

195
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,920
Like, this is all part of the plan, guys. I don't know. That's very funny.

196
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,400
I think it's settling down. I don't know. I wonder how long, you know, no, no, it's not

197
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,840
going to settle down because I don't know, do you think Trump is going to fight it like all

198
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,320
the way up until Inauguration Day? Yeah. I think he will posture that he's going to fight it. I

199
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,200
don't actually know whether he's willing to go through all of that. But it's still possible

200
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,240
that he could, like, disrupt things all the way up until that moment. Yeah, I guess it depends on

201
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,400
how much people want him to do it. From what I've seen, it seems like people are mostly just kind

202
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,240
of like resigning. Like, I don't see a lot of people like, I mean, people are kind of assuming

203
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,080
that he's going to try to push it off. Like anybody I know who's like a Trump support,

204
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,320
like who cares about Trump at all is like, well, it's not technically decided, but like,

205
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,200
it's probably over. It could be overturned in the courts, but like the way the wind is blowing,

206
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,600
it's like even the people that want that are like, there's really no precedent. It's just not

207
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,480
close enough. It had to overturn multiple states. It just doesn't seem like something that's going

208
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,720
to happen. I watched, oh my God, did any of you like watch the fucking count come in on Georgia?

209
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,840
Yeah, I was up to that one. Oh, I didn't see it. I didn't see it turn. I didn't see it turn,

210
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,120
but I was keeping up with like exactly how many votes, you know, like several hours. It was

211
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Georgia Georgia was was the margin was like 4,000 and then like 3000 and then like 2500. Yeah,

212
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,120
it went down to like 1700 before I like went to bed.

213
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Um, yeah, I saw I think then I think you might have retweeted it, but it was something that was

214
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,480
like, you know, um, it was like retweet this if if your follower account, like, yeah, I did,

215
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,120
you know, could flip Georgia, could flip Georgia. And I looked and I was like even mine could at

216
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,360
that point when I looked when you when you posted that it got down to like, I think like, like

217
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,920
a thousand or less, yeah, like before it was like, oh my God. And it was like the the the report

218
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,520
was saying like 90 like over 98% of the vote was in. So it's like, well, what does that mean? Does

219
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,600
that mean like there's like a couple thousand votes left to count or does that mean there's 10,000

220
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,800
votes left to count? You know, uh, that was exciting though. That was and then, um, people were

221
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,520
people were talking about Pennsylvania flipping, but I was looking at the numbers and Pennsylvania

222
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,680
didn't seem anywhere near as close as Georgia. I thought like Georgia Georgia might flip and

223
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,080
that would be the only one. I felt the same way. And I just assumed that it was people who,

224
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,880
you know, understood politics more than me and that just are like, no, like we've run the numbers,

225
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,320
like we know it's going to flip, like we know how this is going to happen. It's just like,

226
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,040
all right, I guess I'll trust you guys. I don't know, though. It looks pretty,

227
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,600
it looks, it looks pretty much like an uphill battle. I mean, I wake up and it's flipped.

228
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:52,120
I felt, um, nervous because, you know, I had watched the results come in and like the New

229
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,320
Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucus and stuff. And I watched it like come out with like, oh,

230
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,560
Bernie looks like he's ahead really early on. And then like fucking Pete Buttigieg or whatever,

231
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,640
like closes the gaps, like, no, no, it's all slipping through my fingers. So, you know, I was,

232
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,360
I was prepared for a bad, for a bad time. Wait, did you guys see the, um,

233
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,960
like the Trump like, I don't know if it's a concession speech, but the, the Trump address

234
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,960
in like the, the like landscaping or like the hardware store parking lot?

235
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,960
No, not yet. No, I was planning on watching that after this.

236
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,120
I haven't watched it yet. But like they booked it. They tried to book like this speech at the

237
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,560
Four Seasons Hotel, but they accidentally booked it at like a landscaping company called Four Seasons.

238
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,840
So they're just, I'm still looking at the picture right now of fucking Rudy Giuliani giving a speech

239
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:55,000
in this like dirty gravel like driveway. Here, um, I'll, I'll, I'll show you. I, I saw like a photo

240
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,760
of it or something in it. I was like, guys, what the fuck is this? It all, it all ends here.

241
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,720
For holding press conference of Four Seasons Garden Center.

242
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,560
It's like, there's like construction going on in the background. It looks like next to like

243
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,880
some rusty beams. There's like an orange cone there on the ground.

244
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,960
The paint's peeling off the wall. Oh my God. I love it.

245
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,440
Oh man. I still haven't seen a Borat too. I guess I am probably going to watch it at some point.

246
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,240
Oh, I've just seen that screenshot floating around of Giuliani. Like,

247
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,000
looks like he's unzipping his pants or something. Yeah. On the bed. I saw that. I do. I didn't know

248
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,920
what it was until yesterday, um, because Munchie was telling me about it. I had no idea and he

249
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,080
showed me the clip. Um, and yeah, I haven't even seen the clip. It's, I mean, I don't, he's like

250
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,160
lying back on the bed and like, I mean, like shoves his hand in his pants and it's like fucking,

251
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,720
yeah, it's pretty clear to me. Yeah. What's going on there? I mean, yeah. I saw the, um,

252
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,320
Red Letter Media just did a half in the bag where they talked about Borat 2

253
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,560
and they discussed that and they, they said that it's like that part in particular is like clearly

254
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,760
they edited around to make it look worse than it was. It's still bad, but like, I don't know.

255
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,040
There's something sort of, well, they talk about it. I haven't seen the film.

256
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,040
I don't, I don't really know the whole context for like what's going on there.

257
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,760
There's an, oh, I'm seeing an, there's an Antifa thread on poll. That's interesting.

258
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,520
I'll have to check that out later and have to bookmark that.

259
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:43,080
Wait, are you part of poll's transition into being a leftist board? Well, well, I checked,

260
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,600
I checked poll. I haven't been posting there, but I checked it like as Georgia was flipping

261
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,040
and like, you know, everyone's making fun of, uh, uh, the MAGA atards or the meat or the

262
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,960
MEGA atards as they call them there, which I assume stands for make Israel great again.

263
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,920
Everyone on poll thinks that Trump is like super pro Israel, which I guess he probably is,

264
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,840
but like that's their, that's their big beef with them. Um, I've been reading it and yeah,

265
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,760
there's a lot of like, a lot of, I don't know, and I might settle down. I assume that it was like,

266
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,560
I assume that 4chan was like very like MAGA just because it made people mad and maybe now the way

267
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,040
to make people mad is to, uh, is to make fun of them. I think that's part of it. I don't think

268
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,040
they were as MAGA as people think. I think they weren't like a unified front for sure. I think

269
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,840
poll is just a lot more like of a weird radical identities. Just like, I mean, you, you can,

270
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,280
people have their like flags on their trip codes or whatever and like even, even before like, you

271
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,960
know, there are people in there who are like anarchists and communists. I guess it's like the

272
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,720
biggest, they might be trolls too. The biggest mistake people make about 4chan is that people

273
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,520
always think it's like a monoculture, but like the point of it in my mind is that every position

274
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,040
is represented there. So like, usually if you step into a thread, like if somebody starts a thread

275
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,000
with a dumb title, like, uh, is this anime good or bad? The first two responses almost without

276
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,200
fail will be it's great and it's shit. It's just like, like, I don't even know if those two people

277
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,880
really believe that or if they're just trying to make sure those are the first two responses,

278
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,920
just to like set the bar that like the dumbest possible responses have all been said right up

279
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:29,640
front. Now let's try to talk about it, you know, like, right. And so like, there are people who

280
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,080
are definitely playing devil's advocate. But not because they do or don't believe the things they're

281
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,440
saying, they only just want to argue about shit until they understand things better. They don't

282
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,880
care. They're not probably not even voting, you know, like, it's like, it's a place where all

283
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,880
conversation and knowledge is meant to coalesce. But very, you know, that includes all the bad

284
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,240
things and aggressive things and fucked things. So like, reputationally, it's more known for that

285
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,640
stuff. But if you go to any board, like part of it is people fighting against that stuff and making

286
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,760
fun of those people at the same time. Yeah. Yeah, sure. See, that's interesting. I don't really

287
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:14,360
know. I mean, I'm someone who's never been on 4chan at all. I don't know. It's a very different

288
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,000
website from, you know, the ones that I'm what I'm doing right now would be considered

289
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,280
it would be considered spoon feeding and would be considered a bad thing what I'm doing right now

290
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:32,440
by explaining 4chan. But like, oh, I know that. I know that. Yeah. Like, because in the reason for

291
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,400
that, which I kind of agree with is that like, because it used to be that I think the number

292
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,320
one rule on most boards is just lurk more, like, eventually, like if you come in and you immediately

293
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,240
react to whatever you see, then you probably don't understand why it's there, you know, like,

294
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,680
it might be that somebody just like says some incredibly racist shit or something and like,

295
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,200
you would go like, you know, freak out, I can't believe somebody said this, but like,

296
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,320
there might be a lot more to it, you know, and when you've been on a board long enough,

297
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,880
then you start to recognize like, you can tell what is a PSYOP and what is like a new person who's

298
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,040
literally just reacting to things and like, you know, who is a fed, which poll has a lot of feds.

299
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,640
So this yeah, man, I watched this one fucking speech with it was some kind of hearing. I think

300
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,760
it was when they were talking to the social media people, the government people were talking to the

301
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:31,080
social media people like six months ago. And like, three of the like governors or senators or

302
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,080
whatever, who were like the most hard ass, you had like the most serious actual questions,

303
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:42,120
legitimately dropped four Chan memes, like three different guys in a row. And I was like,

304
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,840
this is the feds on poll, like this is who they are.

305
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,840
I see. What were the memes? I don't remember this a while ago.

306
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm sure I know it somewhere.

307
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:06,200
Yeah, poll poll right now is all it's all like, you know, election fraud, COVID threads.

308
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,960
Have you seen that curve that people post like the Biden and versus Trump counting curve where

309
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,520
like at the very end, Biden's like, the blue jumps up. Yeah. And they made it into like a logo

310
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,360
with an with an F for fraud. Yeah, the one you're talking about.

311
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,280
Yeah, that's the one. There's like, people post like other images, like there's other

312
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,760
counts in like other states where like, the voting is similarly like, you know, has like

313
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,320
weird jumps and gaps in it. And like, you know, the the the the MAGA guy is like furious about

314
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,080
this one where Biden jumps ahead. But then like, there's other ones that jump, they do all kinds

315
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:53,160
of weird shit. And he's got the NPC face like, yeah, no reaction. That's that's what it's all

316
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,120
about. That's what polls like right now. So, you know, I've been scoping it out. You know,

317
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,600
maybe I'll become a maybe I'll become a big, a big four chain guy again, now that it's been made

318
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:13,160
a safe space for me. Yeah, right. Probably not. It's just like, it's, you know, deciding times.

319
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,200
Everybody feels good when they feel like they're on the winning team. And I've been in a weird

320
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:25,560
superposition for for most of Trump's presidency. I feel like I was on the losing team, but not

321
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:34,040
being upset about it, like everybody else was. And now I get to be now I get to be on the team

322
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:41,080
that like, it's like everybody wins for me. Everybody who every like, I feel like a Biden's

323
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,760
presidency can somehow only mean positive things for me specifically, but not because

324
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,480
of the fact that it's going to be good. Like, in fact, the worse it is, the more fun it will be

325
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,720
for me. What do you care to elaborate? Well, because like, so, I mean, it's kind of like,

326
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,080
we already see on Twitter, like liberals immediately turning to bully on on Biden,

327
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,480
you and I have been doing it. Yeah, because I've been making I've been making some angry,

328
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,800
I've been making some nasty tweets at some shit libs. Yeah, it's true. It's just like,

329
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:25,240
it'll be so much easier to root out the problems in the liberal party when they're not all like

330
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,840
for the last four years, if you said anything negative about liberals, then you were like,

331
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,640
oh, you're going to make it so Trump can win again. Like, nobody can nobody can raise this

332
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,960
argument anymore. You know, we have, I don't know if Trump's going to try to run again.

333
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,040
Next election, I doubt it. Like, he might, he already got the big come of being president.

334
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,480
Like, I don't know what he got the big come of being president. He might got like, Don Jr.

335
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,560
something someone could run. Everyone's saying Tucker Carlson is going to run in 2024. That's

336
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,560
not going to happen. You don't think so? No. Why would he? I mean, he's got a regular normal job.

337
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,960
People always forget like being president fucking sucks. And like, most of the people who do it

338
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,920
are like raised from birth with the expectation that they're going to do it and like, you know,

339
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,680
live like a completely different lifestyle. Trump's like the only person I think who has been like,

340
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,960
I just want to do it to do it because I want to have done I want to have my name on everything,

341
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,440
including America, you know, like, so you just don't think that like, there's anything in it for

342
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,760
Tucker to do that. Right. I just don't think that like, I think most people who people are,

343
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,400
oh, you should be president or like, no, that sounds fucking awful. Like you have to kill people,

344
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,320
you know, you have to make like terrible fucking decisions all the time with like,

345
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,920
and everybody expects everything of you and everyone has an opinion on you about you on

346
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:47,560
planet Earth, you know, like, yeah, sounds kind of shit. So yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

347
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:55,640
I probably wouldn't enjoy it. But who knows, like rapid ages years. Well, yeah. Well,

348
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:08,200
who do we? Yeah, if I guess that's kind of an optimistic for me to think like, okay, well,

349
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:14,680
now that now that liberals are in power, it's easier. It's it's yeah, it's safer to criticize

350
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,560
liberals. Right. Well, and we can bring them you can criticize them from an even more leftist

351
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,200
standpoint of being like, Oh, well, like, let's take it even further. Like y'all aren't doing

352
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:30,520
enough, you know, and I think the Trump presidency radicalized more people to the left

353
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,280
than a Biden presidency will. But yeah, I think rhetorically, it makes it easier for those people

354
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,640
to yeah, I'm just saying if we if if somehow liberals can like talk Biden into instituting

355
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:51,800
UBI, then it'll have been worth it. Oh, that's a but Biden is like Biden is pro a couple of

356
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,200
things that are good. Like, I think he's pro $15 minimum wage, and he's pro like,

357
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:05,800
maybe student student debt forgiveness of UBI. Yeah. It's it's not it's not as good.

358
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,600
So like, he's he's good on a couple of things, and then shit on other things.

359
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,200
Like, he doesn't, he doesn't, he's like, oh, no, we should expand the Affordable Care Act.

360
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:25,000
No, government health care. But I don't know. I lost my train of thought. Fuck Biden.

361
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,680
Yeah. Fuck, I'm all fuck them all.

362
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,640
How how likely do you think it is that as soon as Biden does his inauguration speech, he trips

363
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,720
and falls down the stairs and dies and Kamala Harris. Oh, my God, it's like a lot more likely

364
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,480
believe it. It sounds Kamala. I saw a post that was like it's just going to be like four

365
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,920
years of like Mr. Magoo like like a Kamala is just going to be like setting like traps

366
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,520
for him and he's just going to be like Mr. Magoo. It's going to be shenanigans. You know,

367
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,840
I've seen a couple of things where like she's like mistakenly says when I'm president, meaning

368
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,480
when I'm vice president. Wait, has she really? Yeah, it's like, I don't know that she's thinking

369
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,880
about it, but she probably has like entertained the idea that because Joe Biden's so old,

370
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:27,000
I could get it. Did y'all see the pictures of Kamala Harris' family, the second black family to

371
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:36,200
be in the White House? Yeah, I did. Oh, actually, I didn't see that. Really? Wait, are those her kids?

372
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,320
No, that's like, I think she's like half white. Well, yeah, but like, are those like her stepkids?

373
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,040
Well, it looks like her dad, right? Or maybe those are maybe that is her family. Okay, I didn't

374
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,120
somehow I just assumed this was like, like her family as in her parents, but maybe that's her

375
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:00,760
husband and kids. I yeah. Can't we just click on this link? No, no, no, those those have got to

376
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,240
be those are her kids. I mean, those kids have to be her step kids. They have to be your step kids.

377
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:16,120
Hold on. Wait, right. It says, wait, wait, I have to make sure I'm looking at the right person,

378
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,360
because it says something about the Brooklyn born attorney has two children, Colin Ella named after

379
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,600
jazz legends, John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald. And I'm just like, are we talking about these

380
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,640
two white kids named after these legendary black musicians? Wait, wait a fuck, wait, just a goddamn

381
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,400
second here. What's what's going on? I got I got to get to the bottom of this. Maybe it's just

382
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:47,160
overexposed. That's what it is. Yeah, Kamala Harris have no, no, no, they're her stepkids.

383
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,400
Yeah, I was right. Okay. Yeah. She I don't think she has any like, you know, real children.

384
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:01,640
Lamal. That's a funny image, though, with that context. The second black. Wait, wait,

385
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,280
but so wait, so they're not they're her stepchildren. So they're his children. But they are white kids

386
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,880
named after John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald, which is still white people can like jazz. Did

387
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:20,760
you don't be racist? It's just funny to me. Okay. So I have an uncle who is like myself white,

388
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,200
who married a black woman. They have mixed children who similarly were named after Quincy Adams

389
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,400
and Langston Hughes, Quincy and Langston. But it's just funny to me, because these kids are fully

390
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:41,160
white and are named after specifically like black legends, which I'm just wondering what was the

391
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,440
inspiration and impetus? Are they actually fully white as they look in this picture? What do you

392
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,400
mean they're fully white? I thought you said they were have black. They are they are. I can

393
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,560
all they're not her children. So I can all the dad must just be a be a big fan of music history.

394
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,320
You know, I guess good for him. I'm just thinking about the episode of Atlanta. Have any of you

395
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,280
seen Atlanta? No, really good show. But there's an episode about the main characters going to this

396
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,640
rich white guy's house where he's just like really obsessed with black culture and Africa and stuff

397
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,760
and like, but it's portrayed as like extra bizarre and cringe worthy. And it's really funny. And that

398
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,240
just this guy naming his kids that reminded me of that. Like like the like that professor

399
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,880
in Harambe. Yeah, like Harambe. Like taken to the extreme because he's a rich guy with a mansion

400
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,120
who's like having a like a whole soiree there. So like his whole house is just decked out with

401
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,160
like all this Africa shit. And it's pretty funny. Good show. Highly recommended. Donald Glover's

402
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:55,720
TV show, if you know him. Kamala is such a fucking cop. Yeah, it's really a Kamala. So I call them

403
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,240
by Don and Kamala like Godzilla monsters. Because there was there was something where like when

404
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,440
she was announced as the VP, they had misspelled her name is Kamala on something. And Mooncult

405
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,320
on Twitter had pointed out that like she also got like a massive facelift between when she was

406
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:20,120
like in between. If you look at pictures of her back during the back during the whole fucking

407
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,520
what's it called the tryouts for president. What the fuck am I thinking of primary primary.

408
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,280
The primary. If you look at the pictures of her back during the primaries and then like leading

409
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,560
up to when she was announced like a month or so maybe before she was actually announced as the VP.

410
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,440
She had a major like facelift. So her face looks totally different. And so Mooncult was already

411
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,920
predicting that she was going to be the VP. But it was not Kamala anymore. It's Kamala. It's Kamala.

412
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,840
The one with an E. She is now like Gamera. She is now Kamala.

413
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Everyone I knew when we saw her in the primary we we said Kamala. And then I had I had to relearn

414
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,960
because there was a little bit of a kerfuffle. It's like no. Everyone's saying her name wrong.

415
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:12,520
Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. It's now Kamala. By Don and Kamala. By Don versus Godzilla.

416
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:21,320
I like to call I like to call Biden J Robb short for Joseph Robinette. That's that's my

417
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:29,320
that's my image. Is this. This isn't true. It is. It's totally different. That just

418
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,960
no that just looks like a smear frame or something. Yeah. This is just like a it's

419
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,040
like a fucking low res screen. It's just like weird like in the middle.

420
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm looking for for comparisons. I'm looking at I don't know like I'm looking at the before

421
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:50,280
and after pictures and like I can kind of see a difference but it could look at her cheeks man.

422
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,520
Look at her cheeks. They look different. I mean she is making a different facial expression. So

423
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,640
I really like people are definitely going out of their way to find the ugliest

424
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,960
little sort of screenshots to take. She's not a pretty woman. I mean let's be honest.

425
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,600
She's fine. I think she's actually older than she looks. I was going to say I think she looks

426
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,920
pretty good for her age like like you like you thought that that picture of her and her kids

427
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,000
was like her dad and her siblings. Right. Well I hadn't like looked at her. She's 56 years old.

428
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,840
So yeah she looks. She's pretty good. She looks pretty good. 56 yeah. Not that it really matters

429
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:37,160
for anything but you know it really doesn't. These fucking pictures are hilarious though.

430
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,080
I'm sure they will all scroll in. I'm scrolling. One of them looks like she's about to sneeze.

431
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,360
Oh we got we got an imposter. We got a fake.

432
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,600
Fake Kamala Harris. There she is. It's proof. She's wearing someone else's skin. What do you mean?

433
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:03,400
What do you mean fake? Fake what? Fake body? Fake face. Fake face. It's her face on someone

434
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,040
else's body. They swapped her. They pulled the switcheroo. That's makeup. That's just

435
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,520
what? What are they circling? I don't know what they're circling. Scooby-Doo.

436
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,240
I really yeah I don't. It seems like it feels like they just took a photo and then drew circles on.

437
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:26,840
But I think it is makeup. Yeah. Of course it's makeup. It wouldn't actually be a skin thing. Face.

438
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,320
Stop trying to cover it up. Stop trying to cover it up. Stop shilling for mainstream media.

439
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,560
Stop trying to cover it up like people try to cover up your mouth with the COVID

440
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,800
masks that are fake and it's all fake. Stop trying to cover it up like you want all of our all of

441
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:53,640
our white women to cover up with the uh with the uh oh what's the with the hijab you fucking Marxist.

442
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Yeah. Is that what people are thinking? You haven't seen the like the meme that's like oh 2020

443
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,200
everyone has to wear a mask 2021. Like forced feminization. Everyone will like everyone will

444
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,400
no no it's forced Islamization. Everyone will have to wear the hijab.

445
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,320
Yeah that's where that's where it's going. That's where it's going.

446
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:21,000
Soon. Or wait is the hijab the head wrap or which one's like the full body? It's like

447
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
it's like it's gonna progress. It's gonna progress. The burqa is the full body. Yeah.

448
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,600
Yeah it's mask 2020 2021 hijab 2022 burqa. It's it's interesting that like this kind of stuff

449
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:40,200
globalism progresses to where people will say things like like the fact that we make it okay

450
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,080
for people to choose what they want to do somehow translates to people are going to be forced to

451
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:52,760
do X like yeah like I mean it's it's been like that with uh I mean I guess I guess if people are

452
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,520
really saying this about the hijab like do people think that? I mean I'm sure some people I'm sure

453
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,000
fucking like you believers yeah I think it would be like gay marriage stuff like that yeah yeah like

454
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,880
people would make it up as a meme and then like an old guy being like oh look what I saw on 4chan

455
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,760
oh it's true they're gonna do it they're gonna do it yeah they did it with like gay marriage they

456
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,280
said like oh well if we legalize it it'll normalize it and everyone will turn gay come out and they

457
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,080
do it with trans people too yeah it's like oh well you know they're they're gonna they're if we make

458
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,040
you know if we normalize it they're gonna give all our kids hormones whatever they're gonna there's

459
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:41,000
a lot of using kids to um to pretend like they're looking out for yeah they're looking out for people's

460
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
uh well that's how that's how it is that's how it is with everything like this it's like oh well

461
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,880
it's a it's a slippery slope they just know what it actually thinks they find things to be gross

462
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,280
yeah it is I mean don't expose our kids it's it's child it's child abuse to uh to have a kids

463
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,640
watch Steven Universe and see a lesbian marriage because then they're gonna grow up thinking that's

464
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:09,800
okay I mean do you turn them gay do people really think that like you know people are going to um

465
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:17,160
like performs like like there's gonna be surgery done on like five-year-olds like they know I think

466
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,720
as long as somebody doesn't see critically at all no that's not how it works like it seems like

467
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,920
that's a pretty easy fix well that that's that's the scare that's the scare uh and it doesn't

468
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,400
it doesn't matter that it doesn't really happen when people like hear about something and they

469
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,400
find it scary they'll they'll you know it'll their imagination will run away with them and they

470
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,920
won't think critically and they'll just keep that fact quote unquote in their head and whenever it

471
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,640
comes up again they'll be like oh but did you know they're gonna this is gonna lead to like

472
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,280
they're gonna do surgery on babies and it's just not right and it's like they have nothing they

473
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,520
have not thought about it for even one second well there's people who think that's already

474
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,600
happened the fear keeps it locked in there it's not even I mean there's that it's gonna happen that

475
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,160
it's already happening you because that's what they think puberty blockers are you can find reports

476
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:11,160
you can find reports of like that's like seem to corrupt I mean you can find evidence that

477
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,120
seems to corroborate like any any crazy position you want to take like there are like there are

478
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:22,120
stories there are horror stories of like oh you know some some therapist with an agenda like you

479
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,400
know brainwashed my kid into thinking he's a girl now or something and or like oh they want to give

480
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,200
they want to give my kid fucking like hormone therapy when they're like two years old and like

481
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,320
I don't know I think generally those are like either extreme outlier cases or like you know

482
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,040
the truth has been spun a little bit and if you dig in it's like it's really not as it's really

483
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,040
not as black and white as maybe the headline made it sound I see that all the time yeah I mean what

484
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:53,960
I mean by what I said is like the fringe cases will will let people assume that it is the only

485
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,120
thing that's happening and that it's always happening and then there's no there's no like

486
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:03,480
nuance to it if it's scary it's all scary all the way if there's no there's no chance that it could

487
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:10,600
be somewhat okay if it's scary and you don't like it you can always find evidence to point to

488
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,720
and be like look look this happened somewhere and you know this is this is what they want to do this

489
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:24,440
is what the the whatever the left or something wants uh uh the globalists who you can you

490
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,560
find evidence to uh uh bolster any any position any arbitrarily chosen position you you might have

491
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,320
if you want get a look at the data you're gonna follow the data so I said about circumcision show

492
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:43,160
me the data Ben you could have just seen the data by now I know people have mentioned but I didn't

493
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,560
you've you've had weeks and weeks I just don't care that much it's just I don't I don't understand

494
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,600
why we keep getting circumcision voicemails what are you talking about I don't think it's a big deal

495
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,280
I don't think it's that big a deal I'm not that interested in it but people seem to get

496
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,440
people seem pretty invested in it oh like the the whether you should circumcise babies

497
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,800
yeah okay oh I've we we've literally had this conversation before you and me I have I have I

498
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:17,080
think I have come off I have come off more pro circumcision in my arguments than I think I really

499
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:24,840
am I I'm not like really like strongly like pro we should do it don't do it don't and I would say

500
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,800
I would I would I would agree with what you said last time Gib I think it was you about like

501
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:38,200
you know if if there's no like need for it it's probably best to default to not doing it

502
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,880
yeah or give or give the kid the choice give the kid the choice if if possible I think I think

503
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,440
that's probably like if I was born with a penis and I had been circumcised I don't know other people

504
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,120
feel different but I would be pissed I would be mad but not everyone feels that way well I mean

505
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,360
but why I mean why would you be pissed if it didn't cause you any problems oh I just think

506
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:06,840
it's cool why why would like it just seems like a weird thing for someone else to decide for you

507
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,200
yeah exactly I'll give you I'll give you I'll agree with that we should we should have a surgery

508
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,760
to add extra for skin yeah like why would you default to taking an action specifically to remove

509
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,000
something rather than just let it be and then yeah take the action later I don't know I mean

510
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,400
I mean we should do every surgery you can on a baby you would make it like as strong as possible

511
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:37,160
there would need to be like I don't know if like um if there were like a really high incidence of

512
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,520
like I don't know some kind of medical problem happening in lots of people if like you didn't

513
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,440
circumcise babies I'd be like maybe it's for the best if we circumcise their babies it doesn't

514
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,400
really it doesn't really seem to be the case though so dude what if what if you could do a

515
00:50:51,400 --> 00:51:00,280
surgery at a baby that would like make them not like die of old age like that's the biggest killer

516
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,240
do you that'd be pretty sick actually do you think do you think people will be like ah that's not

517
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:12,680
fair I'm gonna die in this baby give them a choice yeah no like what if they what if they want to

518
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,120
die like I want to die says the person who's going to die oh you mean like they just even

519
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,280
though it's like just an objectively good thing people would say no don't do it because it's not

520
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,960
fair because like I didn't get the chance yeah no that's where I was going to go with it it's like

521
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,800
well I didn't get the surgery so you know I'm gonna be better about it and not give my kid the surgery

522
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:40,200
hmm uh I I would I mean I would be better about it yeah but I mean I have no argument

523
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:46,200
I haven't I have no argument against you oh yeah Ben you fear death more than anyone that I know

524
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:55,320
nice nice oh pussy that's a great that's a great that's a great uh uh uh distinction

525
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,840
to have I'm proud I'm proud to wear that it's a nice little tidbit that Ben is the most death

526
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:07,320
fearing like the superlatives most likely to thank you sad when he died most likely to be

527
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:16,200
said I will most likely to be said in the grave I'll be down it's like darn I'll be down there

528
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:23,800
like punch the tail we'll shit fuck I can't believe this happened how could I have been so foolish

529
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:32,920
as to die it's fucked up man you know we should do it's fucked up we should talk about um art

530
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,680
stuff we should talk about art shit because we're art people yeah this is for art this is art podcast

531
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,320
Kazi you're art you're an artist what is your art inspiration what do you you draw you've been

532
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,120
you've been recently I say recently but like for a while now I've been getting into a more of a

533
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:58,680
a child child ish drawing esque sort of way of drawing that's really cool yeah free and like

534
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,480
unrestricted mmm then how to describe exactly um little little space yeah the word is that you're

535
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,320
looking for you're like noggin core like like you know nick jr noggin that shit noggin super noggin

536
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:21,800
core um yeah um I don't know I I just am drawn to that style of work I don't know I I mean I I've

537
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,200
had people say that my work looks like I don't know different from shit that they've seen

538
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,760
but I really think it's just a matter of perspective because I mean like I don't know

539
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,920
I I am ripping plenty of people off as all good artists do I think I'm just ripping off a

540
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:45,800
different pool of artists than people normally look at that's perfect that's exactly how to become

541
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,040
someone who everybody thinks is good is that either they haven't seen what you're ripping

542
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,800
off or you're ripping off so many things that it no longer looks like anything else

543
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,880
yeah I think I finally I've made it to that point in my career where like I was ripping off

544
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,640
just like I was always ripping somebody off at every given time until I couldn't tell who I was

545
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,560
ripping off anymore now I'm like oh I must just be ripping off myself is that for like music or

546
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:21,640
videos or everything mostly videos or just writing in general um yeah for sure I mean I am I'm

547
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:28,920
strongly of the belief that to be a good artist you need to study good artists intensely

548
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,240
I think that you really need to look at some masterful work and really break it down and just

549
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:42,920
hard it's hard to look at it intensely wait why it's hard I just I like I look at things I love

550
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,400
and I'm like oh this is so good I enjoy watching or reading this this thing and then to study

551
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,600
intensely to understand it is like I gotta go back and look closer zoom in like what are they doing

552
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,760
bore this isn't the same as watching or reading the thing um I I don't I don't like look at a lot

553
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:06,200
of art but like I do if I see something that is very striking I do like to like look and be like

554
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,320
oh how'd they do that oh like what's the what try and try and like reverse engineer what the technique

555
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:17,400
was no I think I definitely don't do enough of stuff like that I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm stagnating in

556
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,880
my art skill it's hard it's hard yummy too it's hard to differentiate between the art that you like

557
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:30,520
to look at and the art that you like to make um I don't know if you guys have done this before but

558
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,840
I've had points where I will look at an artist and be like oh like I really love their stuff and I

559
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:40,600
really like to look at it and so like I want to make stuff that is more like this and then when I

560
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:47,720
try to um try to do that it it doesn't feel right it doesn't yeah I'm not inclined to do it that way

561
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,000
and so you I don't know it's a hard thing to to navigate and to figure out like what

562
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,160
do I actually like to do rather than what do I like to look at

563
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:07,880
that's yeah like sometimes like I will draw something like this and I will be very happy

564
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,680
with it even though it's like extremely low quality yet like low effort but like

565
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,120
you know there's not a lot of thought put into where things go it just sort of feels right

566
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,240
and then I think and then I think of like all of the other things I want to do and that

567
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,360
they don't look like this they look like other artists they like and they're better than me

568
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:34,680
and I'm like I don't know how to I tried to I tried to doodle something I tried like I just

569
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,800
like was like I haven't drawn anything in a while I'm gonna just draw something and I like

570
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,200
put down a piece of paper and I picked up a pen I was like okay here we go and I like drew a face

571
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,360
and I put a hat on it and I was like I hate this this is the worst thing I've ever done

572
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,720
how do people how do people do this and I ripped it up and I went to sleep that's a classic tale

573
00:56:53,720 --> 00:57:01,880
that's a classic artist's tale thank you it's all this time yes um I mean with with Gib like

574
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,280
I don't know I guess something that I've been unlearning is I've been going through

575
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,600
college because I go to school for illustration right now and I'm in my senior year is like

576
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:20,840
I like basically learning all of the the fundamentals and stuff so that I can undo them

577
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:28,840
and I'm sort of like I mean I was I was going through sort of a phase in early college where

578
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:36,440
I was trying to use these techniques and you know anatomy and stuff like that and like

579
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,800
I think I don't I don't really know if you have to have a strong understanding of the fundamentals

580
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:49,720
to like get to this point but I think for a lot of people and for me it's sort of like you learn

581
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:57,640
how to do things properly and then you you sort of undo that like I'm very much going towards

582
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:10,440
a simplified like very scribbly sort of style and like the stuff you draw looks very easy to do

583
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,040
to an untrained eye but like it's it's it's clear that there's a lot of skill that goes into deciding

584
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:24,280
how exactly to draw the script you know I've um so doing the doing the like um art on like the

585
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,360
inside doodles for the vapors I've been using Copics which is a lot like watercolor basically

586
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:37,320
so I've been actually like doing color which is weird for me but it's fun and I like it and I found

587
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:43,240
this that is good at colors you should do it it comes out kind of good it actually comes out

588
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:49,400
kind of good sometimes I'm like oh wow thank you um I like yeah I like it and I found this

589
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:58,360
artist on Twitter they're called corn um Magna Galina as they're at and they do like fairly

590
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,720
elaborate not not like super elaborate like at their cartoony but they do um watercolor or Copic

591
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,720
or something art and I sometimes they will post like a little like work in progress shots where

592
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,440
they'll have like they'll have the line work and then they'll show like just the shading

593
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,200
like what they do is like they they go in with like a light color and they shade in like the

594
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,440
shaded parts and then they color over it and like the shading like kind of carries over into the

595
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:29,080
final I think it's really cool to look at those sometimes the ones with just shading kind of

596
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:35,240
have their own kind of cool like they're very mono color and like and and I don't know they're

597
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:41,640
nice in their own way and so I've been I don't know I've been uh interested in that kind of thing

598
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:48,440
oh I'm looking at some right now uh uh uh let me find let me find a good one no that would

599
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:56,760
sucks I think they're all sometimes I just I don't have enough of um the the sort of

600
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:05,800
constant artist drive to improve that I need in order to improve correctly like I I don't know

601
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:14,120
like a lot of the time it just goes like I I don't care about all of this stuff for a very long time

602
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:21,080
and um I'm paying for it because I'm not improving and that's just it sucks

603
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:29,560
I think you are by default improving I've got all of these like like fucking anatomy books

604
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:37,080
uh like out on tabs and I'm looking through and I don't care I just like I leaves too easily I mean

605
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:45,080
like personally I don't necessarily get better by way of like necessarily practicing if I'm already

606
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,880
as good as I can be at what I'm doing it's like you gotta learn something new to want to do you

607
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:55,000
know like yeah like it's not a matter of like linearly improving in the direction you're going

608
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,200
so much as like okay well what can I add to this now so I think you might need to find something

609
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,720
that you want to imitate again like something that newly makes you think like oh well fuck

610
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:11,160
if I could incorporate some of that in here like that would be perfect you know maybe you need to

611
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:16,680
be doing more searching than practicing I heard this advice somewhere I don't remember where it

612
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:23,000
might have been a professor that said it to me but um it was it was like I think the a lot of the

613
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,160
moments where you sort of make these breakthroughs with your work are usually when you're just fucking

614
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:35,320
around and not when you're like consciously trying to do something yeah like if you're trying to like

615
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:43,320
I'm going to sit down and practice or I'm going to do this rather than just um I'm like I mean as

616
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:50,360
though like like practice is important but I mean those moments when you're sort of like when something

617
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,760
just happens when you just sort of make something and you're not really intending to um those are

618
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:01,000
a lot of moments where I've this is like oh I can do this it's like that John Cleese thing again

619
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:07,080
sort of reminds me of the John Cleese uh creativity lecture yeah it's about playing yeah

620
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:12,040
oh I've never seen that I mean I the other day it's really good the other day I randomly was

621
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,840
drawing and I came up with this and I think this is like pretty good compared to what I usually do

622
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,960
doodle I like yeah I love this the shadow on the underside of the hair looks really good

623
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:29,880
and it's like how cool but uh I I don't know it it's frustrating that I just can't keep

624
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,040
it like yeah it happens by these things happen by accident they happen by accident and they don't

625
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:43,160
stick around and I'm like I don't know I know that like the upward the the more you do stuff

626
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:48,440
it doesn't really matter whether you're doing it right as much as you know just continually doing

627
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:55,640
it the upward trend quality of your work will increase over time um so like the like I wouldn't

628
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:01,400
have been able to do this a couple of years ago um casually because I since then I learned

629
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,680
little bits here and there but like I don't know there's there's always this pressure because I see

630
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:13,240
good art all the time I'm always looking at Instagram and Twitter and it's like great art just by

631
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:19,960
people and it's you know I know not to compare myself to them but there's this underlying

632
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:29,640
sort of pressure that like if I practice more rigorously or or like just do more drawing generally

633
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:38,440
more often than like this would improve better and faster and I don't know I I mean I I've been

634
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:45,320
in the same position it's really hard to not compare yourself I think I've gotten I don't know

635
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:52,120
if I would say as good as I can be at it but I I've gotten pretty good at developing a mentality

636
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:59,160
where I look at art that I really like and go this is fucking amazing I can't do this right now but

637
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:05,080
like I can see a path to getting there and that's really motivating to think of it that way and I

638
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,160
I don't know because I know for a lot of people it's hard you you can't just sort of snap your

639
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:14,200
fingers and have that mentality about it but if you can try to get yourself to a place where you're

640
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:21,320
looking at someone that you really look up to and you say you know I like I can do that I can see

641
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:27,880
a way to getting there for me honestly I've kind of left the mentality that like I have any control

642
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:34,680
over what I'm going to create like I just see it as like it's one thing to fantasize about like I'm

643
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,120
going to go in this direction I'm going to like my art's going to end up like this but like it's

644
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:43,000
just not like it's going to end up being whatever it ends up being by way of like you can push it

645
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,520
in a way you want it to go but like you can't predict what your hand is actually going to do

646
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:54,680
like with by thinking about it you know so it's just like at the end of the day I've kind of given

647
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:59,160
up on trying to like scheme out like okay here's my path forward or like I'm gonna do this kind of

648
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,480
thing and this kind of thing I'm just like I'm just gonna do whatever it happens that I end up wanting

649
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:12,600
to do when I happen to want to do it and hope it works out somehow what about my plans plans

650
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:19,480
the best laid plans of mice and men are always shitty gay garbage that's what the sense right

651
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:30,360
I read I love that book uh they my problem my problem is uh is a motivation uh I think I feel

652
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,000
like I could do anything yeah but I just don't I don't want to I'm more along those lines there's

653
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,680
nothing there's nothing that I actually want to do well I've learned I mean there's there's some

654
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,560
I've there's some things that are fun to do most of them are drugs and the main reason to work is to

655
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:57,400
have money so you can buy them um I I I I don't know I feel like I don't know I can look at this

656
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,560
like this this artist is really good and I feel like I can see kind of how he does this thing and

657
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:09,880
like if I were like man I really want I really feel like drawing a picture of fucking Gabriel

658
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,160
with some skulls and some and a chalice and a sword and a cross and some scale I could be like

659
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,560
fuck yeah and then I could put some work in and it would take me a while but I could plan it out

660
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:25,560
put it in uh do this like I know how to do all this stuff it none of this looks like impossible

661
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:31,960
to me but it's like why what what would possibly possess me yeah of the desire to do that's more

662
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,960
the way I have tend to find myself it's like I look at things and I'm like okay I see how this

663
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:43,080
could happen but like they already did it like yeah do I need to do this or it is like do I just

664
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:49,000
what like can I I guess on some level it's like experiencing the ego death of just like being happy

665
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,760
that it exists and not like and not feeling like I had to be involved you know like like sometimes

666
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,200
you see something you like and you feel like oh I have to find some way to replicate this so I can

667
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,760
like show that I get it you know but it's like oh you don't have to like that person got it they

668
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:12,200
made it you know right yeah I feel like there's I don't know the the um because you post things

669
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:19,000
online and the whole world everyone in the world is watching that you know the the career of of

670
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,320
Gibb and take what is what is it what are they gonna do next um and I feel like I don't know if if

671
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,480
if it turns out that I'm only doing this to perpetuate what I've already been doing and I

672
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,320
don't actually care about doing it that would suck you know so I feel like I gotta like oh I

673
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:39,000
want to improve it out and I want to make comics because I said that I want to make comics and

674
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,800
want to improve art many times and so it feels like it's it's written in stone and I'm just

675
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,800
that's where you're continuing to do it that's where your compulsion is taking you and follow it

676
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:55,240
always follow it I mean it's just it's just hard to know because like I've been taking a break for a

677
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:02,840
while and I was just getting back into it like yeah maybe yeah I've been just kind of like

678
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:08,280
nickel and diming my way around making stuff like not really committing myself to trying to make

679
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:13,560
something with a lot of intentionality but just like letting things like I have a documentary

680
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:19,400
I'm gonna edit that's like I just took two weeks around the US and filmed whatever happened you

681
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,600
know so it's like that kind of incidental work it's more appealing to me now where you just kind of

682
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,880
look at it in the editing bay and say well what can I make this into as opposed to like going in with

683
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:42,920
a plan you know I I'm a little fucked uh my tablet not my tablet my my cintiq broke oh shit really

684
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:49,560
there is a thing that I yeah like it still works but like the screen yeah it does but the screen is

685
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:58,680
just black and I don't know I'm yeah so like without the screen uh a couple years okay um it's

686
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,640
like it's not that because mine's a couple years old too and I'm like I'm really it's a big investment

687
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:10,600
I really don't want to have to replace it it still works except at the screen except the screen just

688
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,600
doesn't show anything the screen is black so I'm hoping that maybe if I can bring it to some kind of

689
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:20,920
like repair shop or something they'll like there's something they can do about it and I have no idea

690
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:30,120
uh if that's true or not I will just have to uh uh see but like there yeah there is um after the

691
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,800
after all the vapor's kickstarter stuff there is some stuff I was gonna start working on but um

692
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,680
it I really I really don't want to draw it with a mouse I don't want to do that so

693
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:50,040
would you be able to use um the tablet without a screen because I can't I can't do it uh no

694
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:57,000
yeah I can like I used to use I had a lock on bamboo that I use like 50 bucks on ebay and like I

695
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:04,120
use that for years and years and years um and uh only like relative only like in the last like

696
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,760
maybe two years or so did I switch to the cintiq and I did come to like it and now that I don't

697
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:18,200
have it I'm like yeah fuck but I now use I use the bamboo forever I I bought a bamboo when I was

698
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:25,160
like 12 because I wanted to draw um warrior cats fan art on I want to draw on the computer um

699
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:32,760
and I could not do it I did not have the hand-eye coordination to do it and I to this very day I'm

700
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:39,320
still a little bit perplexed at people that can do it so well I can only barely I mean it's just

701
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,800
you just gotta you just like learn and it's just about like muscle memory to like know

702
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,960
where the where your hand will go and where the mouse will go it I don't know I feel like there's

703
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:56,680
just something that I just can't but that's just not clicking with me I mean I used a um I used

704
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:05,080
like an iPad to draw in my teenage years for digital and um when I was 16 I got the cintiq

705
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:11,000
that I still use today and it's my favorite thing that I have ever owned and I was just like

706
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,320
yeah I need to get this because if I don't then I have no other way of making digital art

707
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:22,920
Cassie can you type while not looking at the keyboard um

708
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:32,120
kind of a little bit um I never learned how to type properly I type I don't type the way you're

709
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:37,960
supposed to but I can type like at a normal speed what with your fingers on home row no yeah no I

710
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,280
does anybody type does anybody type like they tried to teach me and I didn't like it was too late

711
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:47,960
for me like I had already taught myself to just home row the home row is when you have your your

712
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:55,960
fingers on the ASD and the Jkl and like you know it's like oh to hit F you use your index finger

713
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,120
from the D and then to hit I it's your middle finger from the K and and you know yeah I don't

714
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:05,400
formula I don't know how to do that anybody does that I have my own system and I know people

715
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:13,080
who didn't learn that way and they do type way faster surely I well I didn't I thought everyone

716
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:18,120
did it that way I don't know I assumed that I was one of you who like didn't learn how to type right

717
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:26,600
they tried to teach me yeah I mostly default to having like my fingers on um AWD because of

718
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:33,880
video games they'll be watched yeah and then from there I can type lots real quick but I actually

719
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:39,160
don't know that I look at the keyboard when I type now that I think about I like glance down in it

720
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:44,680
I like mostly use muscle memory but like I do look down at it so I'm like half and half uh

721
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:51,480
what are we talking about talking about tablets tablets I'm just still scrolling through

722
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:56,040
magna galina's feed he's so good yeah I wasn't sure what you meant when you're talking about the

723
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:01,400
shadows um but when you posted this yeah these two like but you see yeah no I see now what you're

724
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:10,520
talking about yeah was that like a physical drawing or yeah it's water yeah oh cool yeah water color

725
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:18,040
water color for the yeah it's cool there's a oh man I just I just passed one I just passed a really

726
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:28,840
good one uh I'm gonna make you watch it I'm gonna make you look at this one where was it oh oh oh

727
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:38,200
oh yeah here we go yeah here we go watercolors watercolors are so fucking cool they are I'm

728
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:45,240
in a watercolor color class right now I'm watching it there was a there was a better one before where

729
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:50,760
like he starts in from scratch and like he's putting the shadow layer down over like the eyes uh

730
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:59,240
I don't know it's cool it's cool how like watercolor is like you like you put down the color

731
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:04,840
but like that's not it's not done you you have to like kind of like pull it and push it around

732
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:11,000
with the brush yeah it's it's it's water bending is what it is it is yeah yeah yeah it's like you

733
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,480
look at it and you're like I think my my instinct is like oh my god they're so like that's so scary

734
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,200
right like they're putting the brush down and like what if they what if they fuck it up like if they

735
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,320
fuck it up the drawing is ruined but no no no that's the trick that's what that's what the that's the

736
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:34,680
mind game you gotta be bold in fact yeah you be bold and if it works it looks great and if it

737
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,360
doesn't work you can push and pull it around no if it doesn't work you get and it'll be okay

738
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,400
if you really fuck it up um we had uh yeah if you if you're not bold you don't get anything

739
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:50,680
in my watercolor class we had um an artist come in to talk with us um he does a lot of

740
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:58,520
paintings of of boston he's local and um he showed us um sort of a time lapse video of

741
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,400
him doing some paintings and like I mean he he has like a you know a rough sketch underneath

742
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,720
and then he just sort of puts a wash of color over the whole thing and just like blocks in

743
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:14,600
these huge shapes um and I I feel like I don't know I'm trying to get over that um being like oh

744
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,920
but what if you know there's like a little part that I want to have in front of this part like

745
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,640
what if I ruin it by putting this big block of color down because you can't go over dark parts

746
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:32,520
with white parts yeah I don't know the way he did it it's very much like you you need to just be

747
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:41,240
confident just put that shit down yeah slap it on there yeah the art advice I keep giving getting

748
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:47,880
given is just like just draw sure lines stop trying to go back over your lines oh yeah everything's

749
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:53,880
gotta be done sure yeah it's the same it's the same idea if you do like bold lines then you get

750
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:59,320
then you get bold results and it and it looks more striking if you pet your lines in you just

751
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:06,440
look like a fucking cow I don't know yeah soft weak same with watercolor like it looks so good

752
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:11,960
when you're doing watercolor and you have like a section where you just have like one bold brush stroke

753
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,840
and it works yeah that's what it's like it's really impactful yeah well you know it kind of yeah it

754
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:21,560
kind of ties me into something I was saying um I don't remember if this is in pcp chat or where

755
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,640
earlier about how like I'm trying to think less in general as a human being because I don't think

756
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,600
that people make good decisions necessarily by thinking about them I think usually people just

757
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:39,560
know like like if they're if they're capable of making a good decision they will know relatively

758
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,680
quickly and it won't take that much thought like if you have to think about something a whole lot

759
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:50,920
you're probably not even fit to be like thinking about it you know what I mean you mean yeah I

760
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,800
think I know what you mean like like if I have to if I have to like finically like do my lines

761
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,320
it's because I'm like I don't know what I'm doing I don't like you know maybe I will eventually

762
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,800
do practice of doing this over and over again but like ultimately the way I will get good at drawing

763
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:12,840
lines is not by practicing about them shitty lines until they're good it's by just keep keep

764
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,600
trying to make good lines until you can do it you know like shitty lines don't build to good lines

765
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,320
is what I'm trying to say you have to be trying to make good lines and failing not like making

766
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:28,520
shittier lines on purpose I guess so it's like that's true so I think that applies to a lot of

767
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:35,240
different aspects of learning where it's like if if like when I write write a video I don't think

768
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:40,440
about it I just like have a general idea of what it's going to be about and like probably the first

769
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:45,880
sentence and then I just write it you know it just comes out of me and like it used to take

770
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,920
more thinking but now it takes less thinking and it's getting better but requiring less thinking

771
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,000
because it's just something I've practiced so much that like it is second nature it doesn't

772
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
take thought you know and like I think that's the ideal state you want to be in as a human

773
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,040
is that nothing you're doing takes thought at all like you you're just confident that you know what

774
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:10,600
you're doing and you just do it you know for sure there's a lot of value in having confidence in

775
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:15,400
general that's where I want to be there's a lot of value I think in having I mean if you're a visual

776
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:21,320
artist um a sketchbook that you know that you will never show anyone that's shit it can be like a

777
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:28,680
stack of printer paper and just like bang out really crappy drawings like in pen oh yeah all over

778
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:34,360
I do that all the time with like I don't know I'm I'm in a call and I'm just sort of fucking around

779
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:40,600
I open a photoshop document and I just draw in some crap that I will never show anyone unless

780
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:46,600
there's something funny and I'll post it just bang out like 51 minute sketches on a big page yeah

781
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:53,400
and then trash it like that's helpful um I haven't I've been doing a lot of digital stuff um

782
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,080
but you know I'm I'm recently getting back into some traditional art with the with the

783
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:05,480
watercolor and even back into um oil painting and I'm working on a project I don't think I

784
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:13,640
I should can say what it is yet but I'm very excited because um there's a guy it's really cool

785
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:20,840
he worked on homestuck stuff and I'm working with him on an orc it's not Andrew Hussie

786
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,200
and that's almost done I'm just doing the last bit of it can you not say the guy he didn't tell

787
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:34,920
me not to but I don't know but I mean like it it it might be like up by the time this episode is up

788
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:45,000
anyway so like you know um but the oil painting what'd you say look at these colors

789
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,720
look at these fucking colors I'm gonna die I'm gonna die just thinking about them

790
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:58,040
I like that pink that pink armor I like the blue like the shaggy body on that guy with the red head

791
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:04,200
yeah the all of those colors they're just really good mix with each other Greg's Greg's no Wayne's

792
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:14,760
cheekbones the yellow guy there's something about physical media it's just there's there's something

793
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:23,880
about media you can have it can if you do it if you lean into it it can bestow a certain texture

794
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:29,160
work that you just can't get with a brush yeah absolutely I mean this this oil painting that

795
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:34,920
I'm doing I'm I'm I find you've seen I named my oil paintings before um there's a painter named

796
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:41,720
Wayne Tebow you spell his last name thiebaud I think he's like fucking old the shit he's like

797
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:51,000
turning 100 um okay but he's really inspired how I go about painting um by like really packing on

798
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:59,160
the paint and using um the palette knife instead of a brush no not gouache yeah yeah yeah okay yeah

799
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:04,280
and just like really packing on the paint and it's just having it be really thick and sort of um

800
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:09,960
it's it's like it's like frosting a cake instead of painting a painting is what it feels like

801
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,280
it's like you're sculpting with the paint um that's what I'm doing for this project and it's really fun

802
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,560
hmm how do you decide what you want to paint or draw that's that's where I get that's where

803
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:29,080
I'm hung up if I if I was like if I had I feel like if I just had like boy I know exactly

804
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:35,480
what I want to like draw here I could it could it would be a masterpiece we tried drawing without

805
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:39,800
thinking about it beforehand and just see what happened yeah that's what I did I did I spent

806
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:44,200
five minutes doodling a face the other day and I was like no I'll never draw again this is a mistake

807
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:50,360
well I mean that's your problem I think you know that's your problem is that you stop yeah maybe

808
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:58,440
I mean it's like what did you said just um sort of banging shit out until you until it sticks I

809
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:08,280
guess I don't know but I also struggle with that like like knowing what like techniques I want to

810
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,840
use and like what colors I want to use and stuff but not having like a clear idea of what

811
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:21,400
it is that I want to make um yeah I've been there a bunch I guess I would just say doodle until

812
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:28,040
you come up until you're like oh I want to expand on this and I hate I hate doodling it's so embarrassing

813
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:35,160
embarrassing it's so yeah it's so embarrassing to like draw something and look at it and be like

814
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,560
what's the fan what's the point what's the point that's amazing that you can be embarrassed by your

815
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:51,800
own judgment yeah well I am easily easily fair enough uh yeah well you know it's it's just like

816
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:59,720
you you have in your head something that you you imagine when you start doodling usually

817
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,760
like you start drawing a figure and you're like I wonder if they're gonna be like posing like this

818
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,480
and you think of things like that then you look at what you're doing and it sucks yeah because it's

819
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:14,440
a doodle and you weren't really trying it makes me angry not so much embarrassed it's just angry

820
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,000
that's one of the stages is fury is white hot rage

821
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,760
yeah I mean I don't get angry quite so much anymore I just sort of like

822
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:33,240
I don't think I don't feel anything I'm just like drawing on like that sucks I haven't felt

823
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:38,040
that sense of like blockage only because of the fact that I again have not been holding myself

824
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:44,920
accountable to to do anything lately because I don't want to feel that blockage of like if I find

825
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:51,240
myself in a position where like nothing is coming out then my my stance was just do something else

826
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:56,360
like because otherwise I'm just gonna wallow in it like if I wallow in a feeling for more than five

827
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:00,440
minutes it's definitely a waste of time and I should definitely go do something else so like

828
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,760
you know if it that means I don't end up making anything for a while then it just means nothing

829
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:15,160
was going to be made you know I know the best thing is is to have characters that are so simple

830
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,400
that doodling them is you know you don't have to do very much for it to be correct

831
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:29,240
value such as a red man and yeah like there's a good way so just some stupid shit like this

832
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:34,440
where it's just like I'm just drawing a circle now it's red man he's talking about himself

833
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:45,320
Gib you have like the best character designs and like I just want like Gib I just want you

834
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:51,000
to like do these like funny like stupid little doodles that are you just like banging out really

835
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,360
fast and they're just like I don't know your stuff is hilarious I want you to like just make like a

836
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,840
book just of like drawings of this over and over again thankfully game that's what I wanted from

837
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:05,880
you I love that shit that's twitter well it was at least you were doing a lot of these on twitter

838
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:11,960
for a while uh yeah like the red man comics and an occasional doodle of things yeah I could maybe

839
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:20,680
I mean right now I'm working on making uh the bell shape book in in style of of like the the

840
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:26,680
homestuck books where they take the things and they take all of the good parts out of it as it you

841
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:33,080
know bees is it's like it's gifts it's animations it's stuff um and then ruin it by putting it on

842
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:39,640
paper and that's what I'm doing and so I want I want that to be fun that that's kind of fun in it in

843
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,520
like an art way in itself just figuring out how to lay out all these pages and making it look

844
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:50,760
professional and being like yeah these these terrible terrible drawings that were never meant

845
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:57,400
to be anything I am putting into like a book that's almost a joke in and of itself no it's awesome

846
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:05,640
but yeah I could definitely do another book of like just stupid doodle things I like yeah I like

847
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:11,240
physical media I like I like printing I like printing shitty ms paint drawings I think a book

848
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:16,680
of like really like stuff like particularly this red man one um would be a great like coffee table

849
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:21,720
book just like have on your table that people flip it open it's just ridiculous shit like what the

850
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:26,520
yeah that's what I was like it would be a great time I want that shit hardcover

851
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:35,000
or I mean even like I don't know I uh I had this I had a goal for a while that I did not

852
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,600
accomplish until recently which was um fill up an entire sketchbook with drawings that I think

853
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:47,480
look good scan the whole thing and put it on gumroad and I finally did it and it's great and I

854
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:54,040
I feel like you could do something like that um yeah that could be doable yeah I've gotten good

855
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:59,480
response from the gumroad book and I'm really happy and I'm gonna do another one that's quite easy

856
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:05,800
I know drawing's hard no no no like it's quite easy to just like scan it and put it up I mean

857
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,720
and then just like oh sure right as a like a pdf yeah just a pdf and every once in a while it's like

858
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:18,440
oh someone bought your thing just you know some some little passive how much is it um it's it's

859
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:25,560
minimum three bucks and um but a lot of people have been tipping very generously which I'm very

860
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:37,240
thankful for mm whales yeah yeah sims um I don't know I just figured it would be a good idea to be

861
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:45,000
like look it's like almost no money so you know yeah yeah you can't afford not to do it I bought I bought

862
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,240
um I should go buy it I bought I bought uh I bought the Six Tens album the other day

863
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:59,160
mm was it songs for songs for nice guys for nice guys beats for nice guys what a great

864
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:03,640
I bought it I haven't listened to it yet it's a great album well you did you could you two

865
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:13,160
both did like cover art right yeah I did yeah yeah yeah I didn't LaMau yeah and Anthony did

866
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:19,560
went to the art munchie um did one as well that's that's right um forgot forgot about that yeah it

867
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:25,480
was great I did I was like oh I'm gonna try you know sticking with the physical media kick I'm

868
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:30,360
just like I'm gonna do colored pencil and I did and I was like this looks great and then I scanned

869
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,600
it and I looked at it on my screen it looked like shit so I did a lot of editing in Photoshop

870
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:43,640
mm what did just the scan like didn't like read it well or I don't know something about

871
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:49,400
what was it on the screen there was just some areas that looked like I don't I don't explain

872
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:55,960
there was just areas that needed a lot of touching up um probably unnecessarily I think there's a lot

873
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:01,480
of um I don't know I do this as an artist I don't know if you guys do but there's a lot of

874
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,640
moments where you're looking at something you've made and you're like oh I gotta fix this

875
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:11,160
fucking thing it looks stupid and like you fix it and you notice the difference but no one else

876
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,360
would like you're just wasting your time yep truthfully I do that way too much like there's a

877
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:21,960
pixel out of out of the way like I should I should delete that pixel that's the wrong pixel

878
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:33,080
that wasn't intended by me the artist mm-hmm yeah and there and therefore therefore it is a problem

879
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:41,000
oh dang I didn't intend for this watercolor stroke to like blend with the other color and

880
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:48,920
like create a gradient like oh fuck I gotta delete it it's ruined that's the good shit when it blends

881
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:56,760
yeah yeah when when it that that face when it that face wait wait wait here we go this is this is

882
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:06,200
this is mfw it blends whoa that's what I look like good face good blend good good look good look

883
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,840
oh man fuck alright it's for losers well all right

884
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:17,400

885
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,360
how we've been good what oh we've been going for almost two hours haven't we

886
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:28,440

887
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:35,320
I forgot about those okay we do them there's there's there's like an average amount uh today

888
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:46,040
uh let me see how much is an average amount like seven maybe 20 oh we get a lot I had

889
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:50,600
there was one day where munchie we wrap it we wrap it fire him he was in charge of picking

890
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,960
which ones went on the show and so we were listening to them together so you had a dream

891
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:01,400
wait did you say you had a dream no not a dream it was not a dream it was it was real and it was

892
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:07,400
it was that munchie was in charge of picking the voicemails for an episode and so we listened to

893
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:14,200
all of them and I could not believe the level of quality how fucking bad they all were like the

894
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:21,640
ones that got in wait just like okay but the ones that don't get it on the pcp yeah wait oh that

895
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,800
must have been an old episode that oh it was I mean it was when munchie was on so it was quite a while

896
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:31,480
ago um oh okay there are some really um yeah no they're smells no they're they're bad yeah they're

897
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:40,680
really bad but it's okay um this one is called um ha ha bread you guys okay yeah yeah we're

898
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:45,960
three two one listen click play it all at the same time all right three two one go

899
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:58,200
hey so I found this really weird channel it's called rotating bread studios it's just a bunch of

900
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:07,560
videos of pictures of png's of bread rotating check it out it's prey based content I'm there

901
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:14,440
I'm there I can already picture it on my mind I don't feel like I even need to go see get out

902
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:21,080
this is uh like I get shocked I mean there's I mean my there's a little more to space no

903
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:27,000
oh just like just in it just an image yeah it's just a piece that it was just like a flat

904
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,120
I've seen the whole thing in my mind now although this one is my I didn't expect the Mike Myers in

905
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:39,880
the background of the bread 43 subscribers on a rotating bread studios okay it should be

906
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:48,440
rotating the other way I don't know why that's your critique the thing yeah the thing that's

907
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:53,720
wrong with rotating bread studios the bread rotates clockwise and I just it's too predictable it's just

908
01:32:53,960 --> 01:33:02,360
everything rotates clockwise I want to shake it up it's just like the flat side should be like

909
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:08,200
pushing down it doesn't matter if we move on okay okay okay next next one is called a message from

910
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:18,440
our troops three two one go okay so I'm in the navy and I just returned from a six month deployment

911
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:24,520
and what do I find when I get back Gib and Digi have drank so much soy that they are now women

912
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,000
Ben has stolen Nate's soul and banished him to the shadow realm that's right has gone full

913
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,080
cuck and enacted communism on the podcast man imagine coming to her now for some reason

914
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:40,520
as I understand it once she has transcended from the virtual world into the real world and can now

915
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:45,640
come to my house and beat me up in real life which is truly scary I've done that in the first place

916
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:51,480
Tom is the only normal one left for the love of God Tom just save this train wreck of a podcast

917
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,960
oh is this what you were I can't tell if that was serious or a joke it feels like a joke

918
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:00,040
Tom is this what you were talking about yeah I like that Tom is the most I think it was a

919
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:05,160
joke with just kind of a weak punchline Tom who was going to like live in his car and make like

920
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:13,320
CG in a car it was like the most normal this this is a this is a thing it's true Tom you

921
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:19,480
I think a lot of people say I think some people say Tom is the is the is the normal

922
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,880
one but I think he Tom is just Tom is just the one that nobody has the voice of reason

923
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:28,440
that does not make him the normal one none of us are the normal one there's no such thing as

924
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:36,040
a normal pcp member Tom Tom is Tom is safe apple check and uncontroversial Tom is the apple jack

925
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:46,040
yeah so the hot wand the yeah that's right that's right he wears he wears the the boots the

from probably better off not knowing next one next one is called uh milk main i don't know what

956
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:32,920
that means three two one go yeah so uh just listen to the latest episode i mean i wouldn't

957
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:39,400
have looked up that shoplifting comment for myself and uh i don't know i think i think the main issue

958
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:44,440
i see with it at least comes down to the tone like it doesn't really come across as a poor kid you

959
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:50,920
steal because they can't order so much as a spoiled fridge cube you just steal it no well it's not

960
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,720
that thing that was going on facebook no no no i don't understand what this guy's saying he sounds

961
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:01,240
i cannot hear a word he's saying i had to turn i had to turn up my headphones as high as they

962
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:06,520
would go i could make it out no he this is a vein this is a vein of of complaining this is a vein

963
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:12,360
of complaining about mallory what did he say uh you say like he said like uh the reason i didn't

964
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:19,240
like the comic where the shoplifting is because it comes off more as a spoiled rich kid instead of

965
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:25,720
a poor kid and like you you listen to the podcast she explained that no that's not what's going on

966
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:32,360
so shut up shut the fuck up i'm sick of it no more i will not fucking we had an entire podcast

981
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:08,760

982
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:15,160
did it uh well yeah kazi said why don't i get on the pcb uh and i was like yeah why not i guess

983
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,160
and then i then from then on i was like let's get kazi on at some point

984
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:28,360
okay i mean yeah uh yeah i mean i did mean i guess i i never actually asked about i did i did

985
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:33,960
kind of intend that she would come on at some point and now here we are well now that um

986
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:41,000
let's see if craig now that now that munchie isn't on the podcast anymore uh now that munchie's not

987
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,720
anymore now i'm not breaking the no girlfriends rule so i guess that's why we this is like um

988
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:55,400
this it's like uh you're like um you know like legend of dragoon when you well your your green

989
01:41:55,400 --> 01:42:00,760
party member dies but then like a new green party member dies who's basically just like a model swap

990
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:07,480
you're like that no munchie you're just like munchie munchie died but was like immediately

991
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:12,440
replaced by kazi which is basically just basically just munchie wearing a bow um yeah

992
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:21,880
yeah exactly well i mean i i mean i don't know i knew all of you guys anyway so it's true just like

993
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:31,560
uh okay next one next one is called uh sheva's guard three two one go

994
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:39,320
all right i've got a math problem i need your help with so if an anime being bad is a negative

995
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:44,680
and an anime's english dub is a negative and if a negative times a negative is a positive

996
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:49,720
does that mean the dub of a bad anime becomes a good anime because it's adding not multiplying

997
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:56,120
no you because you don't times them to you don't multiply it's it's a it's additive yeah

998
01:42:56,120 --> 01:43:03,160
unfortunately so you can't uh you can't logic your way out of this one get rekt by math get rekt

999
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:13,480
get rekt fucker uh next one we're rapid firing next one is called make mary pcp three two one go

1000
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:18,120

1058
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:42,200
right you drew a pretty cool robot one time i did i did draw i know i know exactly the one

1059
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:48,760
you're talking about for for inktober oh yeah i don't remember what it looks like but i remember

1060
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:55,000
it being good uh it looks like that pokemon that looks like a big ant the ultra beast oh yeah a

1061
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,120
little bit like the yeah it looks kind of like that but as a robot i will you know what i will try

1062
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:04,520
and scroll back through twitter and see if i can find the one you're talking about i think it posted

1063
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:14,360
somewhere um okay next next up we got uh ben i get it you're a penis centrist three two one go

1064
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:21,000
so uh you suggested say one out of a million people get their dicks fucked up from circumcision

1065
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,080
where one out of a million people gets their dick fucked up from not washing it enough

1066
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:29,480
if they are uncircumcised uh in the former group you can't control what happens to you

1067
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:33,800
in the latter group you can it's your own failing to not wash it yeah so i'd rather be a part of

1068
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:41,560
that latter group even still yes uh additionally yes the comparison to vaccines uh vaccines have

1069
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:49,400
a very very tangible benefit and have far less pain than the circumcision and i know i know the

1070
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:55,400
pain doesn't really matter it's ephemeral like who really cares this is the pain is just like an

1071
01:50:55,400 --> 01:51:03,000
addendum to the fact that it is still otherwise neutral the point is oh well if it doesn't matter

1072
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,480
then uh why bother with this thing that just has basically no benefit uh has a very slight risk of

1073
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:17,240
of things going worse and like kind of sucks for a couple seconds like there's no point in

1074
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:22,600
bothering if circumcision didn't already exist we wouldn't like create it there was there would

1075
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:29,720
be no need to create it like if i could say oh uh suppose that your armpits uh could could never

1076
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:36,440
get stinky if you skinned them as a baby uh and it's ephemeral pain that you won't remember uh

1077
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:41,000
and you won't have to put deodorant on but it's like we wouldn't do that if it were possible

1078
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,640
because that's stupid just wear deodorant okay isn't this this just seems like the most obvious

1079
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:52,360
arguing like he's right no like i don't even know why you guys had this argument his first

1080
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:57,480
argument is wrong his first argument is wrong but i like yeah i agree that if it didn't exist we

1081
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:04,360
probably wouldn't invent it in most cases it's like yeah true you're right about that but i really

1082
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:10,600
hate the first part where you're like oh like i lay out this hypothetical where oh what if one in a

1083
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:15,960
million people who circumcised gets lose their dick versus one in a million people who isn't

1084
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:20,280
circumcised you know loses their dick for a different reason like i know that's not necessarily the

1085
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:25,720
case i just but in this hypothetical situation it's like oh well i would rather be the second one

1086
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:30,600
because it's my choice like no like if that doesn't that doesn't matter like if you fucking lose your

1087
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:37,160
dick for whatever reason you you you currently would not rather to have made the choice that led

1088
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:41,000
you to lose your dick you would be talking about how much of a fucking moron you had been your whole

1089
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,880
life like it doesn't matter whether it was your choice or not i'm positing that for whatever reason

1090
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:51,320
in each scenario one person loses their dick and it's equally bad the whole point of that scenario

1091
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:55,480
is that it's equally bad and i won't do this oh well at least then it would have been my choice

1106
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:28,200
home alone two he played a really mining character in it but he's like got a job right now which he's

1107
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:35,320
about to get fired from he's trying to sue sue to keep his job but it seems like it might not go through

1108
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:41,720
so i'm thinking maybe use could try and get him onto the podcast and help build up support for him

1109
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:49,960
and stuff you know that'd be pretty cool yeah i get it i get it uh it's donald it's donald j trump

1111
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:02,440
home alone two lost to new york amazing oh unfortunately he's been fired

1112
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:09,240
tragically yeah we could have him on yeah he's gonna you know we could we could promote trump tv

1113
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:16,360
you know pcp will be the only channel on trump tv he's maybe oh god we could we could become

1114
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:22,440
media moguls this is it this is our big break this is gonna create so many new jobs and we're

1115
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:28,280
gonna fill all of them we can take all of the fake non-existent people who who work um artificially

1116
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:35,240
created um to to make fraudulent um biden votes and then funnel that into your subscriber count

1117
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:38,440
so that trump will have to notice you and he will come on the show donald

1118
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:44,360
donald j yeah donald j trump like his entire audience will be all those like fake and dead

1119
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:53,160
people who voted for biden the phantom audience uh i'll just be competing over these fake numbers

1120
01:55:53,800 --> 01:56:03,400
uh that's that's how it's gonna be uh okay next one is called um what what it's called uh

1121
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:16,120
where dat bts nibba's law three two one go uh this is pancakes with craters here listen i'm not here

1122
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:22,440
to question the validity of circumcision right you know whether it's like oh oh it's like mutilation

1123
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:28,680
baby but you know all that could be benefits to it no i'm here to ask ask the real questions that

1124
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:35,560
questions that actually matter and that is what is more aesthetic circumcised or uncircumcised

1125
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:40,840
penis circumcised frankly you know i might be biased but i'm gonna say circumcised because when i see

1126
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:45,560
an uncircumcised penis i'm like oh like what am i supposed to supposed to do this extra skin on here

1127
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:51,160
when i see a circumcised an uncircumcised penis i go whoo i go pog you go i don't i don't like

1128
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:58,120
pogging so i would really rather not my stance is that it doesn't matter they're all penises are

1129
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:06,120
beautiful if you wash them that's it that's yeah um i think yeah i mean i i don't really have a

1130
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:13,080
preference for like like an aesthetic preference um i mean i don't think it's yeah they're both

1131
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,880
yeah hell yeah i support both

1132
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:25,400
i'm down with both you're the real you're the real centrist i'm the yeah i know i'm the hero take a

1133
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:33,880
position the hero uh next next one is called pancakes the aesthetic of the male genitalia

1134
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:44,360
we wait did i miss one i did i totally missed one uh yeah that one was not where my bts at

1135
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:52,360
nibba's yeah i was wondering where the bts would come in here go three two one go yo quick question

1136
01:57:52,360 --> 01:58:00,920
for y'all where is like the other like radcon for bts like vlog type stuff like are you guys still

1137
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:07,000
waiting for brad stuff to come out or what's going on with scenes you know all that other footage like

1138
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:13,880
can you like press digi to like for that stuff or no or what's up with that thanks yeah i probably

1139
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:20,760
have it um if there's anything that hasn't been released i probably have it um you you had like a

1140
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:27,240
like a big you you collected all of our like phone videos that we were putting and you made

1141
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:34,760
like part one or something oh i did make it well i mean like during radcon i had made

1142
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:41,720
like some parts and then i think that i just ran out of time to continue doing that so

1143
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,880
i probably still have a bunch of footage that i haven't cut together into anything because

1144
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:51,320
i probably completely forgot i didn't know there was more immediately um i don't even know that

1145
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:56,840
there is but if there is i will find out okay um pretty pretty cool pretty cool i think if there's

1146
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:03,720
more shit i yeah i'm not sure that there is that much behind the scenes there will be for i guess

1147
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:11,000
the ova one once that gets put out um but i want to wait until that's edited before i think i had

1148
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:15,480
some like i had planned to release a final behind the scenes that included all the stuff

1149
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:22,120
that i didn't want to spoil like stuff that was not out yet which is still not out yeah where's

1150
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:26,360
the brodie lecture oh yeah i'm excited about that well that doesn't have any behind the scenes

1151
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:32,920
footage okay it'll come out when it comes where's the brodie lecture though i edited like i will be

1152
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:39,320
excited to watch some of it like six months ago god no i'm like the same way with the the the

1153
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:44,840
sonichu two lecture is like three quarters done and i just haven't finished it and it's just been

1154
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:52,120
like that for ever i i start like i went into it and i like thought of a way to edit it that would

1155
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:57,640
be exciting and then i started doing that and it was two time consuming so i got like 15 minutes in

1156
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:01,880
and i'm like well i don't want to undo all this editing but it'll be really weird if it's like

1157
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:08,120
starts off heavily edited and then just disappears so just put a note on screen just be like i gave

1158
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:15,720
up after this point i might do that and i also have considered adding bits into it where like

1159
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:19,960
like i already had to add in a whole bit on derpy hooves because i just like completely

1160
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:24,680
forgotten to talk about her like so like there's i'm sure there'll be other stuff i have to add

1161
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:29,000
it you added you added in a segment on derpy hooves that's awesome yeah like a two minute

1162
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,920
little bit about her yeah i just totally forgotten to mention her i think just the extrapolation of

1163
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,680
so much out of like a character design you know i think that uh i don't know when i rewatching

1164
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:45,640
this on a show i feel like there's more i could have said uh i feel like i didn't i definitely

1165
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:53,240
didn't like you know say everything added in post i guess i could add it in post maybe i'd rather

1166
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:58,520
just like leave it for a number like a hypothetical number three at some point could be done yeah

1167
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:04,520
you should do what nate does and put your face over like like a like footage of you speaking and

1168
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:10,120
then put your face over the face of you in the in the actual lecture and pause the lecture while you

1169
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:18,360
do it wait put my face no whenever nate has something that he forgot to say during his like

1170
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:23,640
but where he's speaking to the camera he'll pause the video and then put a bit of him with a shitty

1171
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:31,960
webcam camera speaking footage and put that over his own head oh okay okay in like in a lecture

1172
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:38,360
i don't know maybe just in general and in weagos and stuff okay okay well

1173
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,360
maybe maybe if there's something i would do that if i felt like there was something that like

1174
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:49,000
the audience really needs to know about to like understand the context of what i'm about to say

1175
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,120
right yeah you know i thought about it for a couple minutes i think there's a few more i think

1176
02:01:54,120 --> 02:02:00,120
uncircumcised might actually be a little bit cooler i thought about it i might be leaning

1177
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:08,280
towards that highly highly agree i don't know what the difference is what do you mean more

1178
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:12,840
when they're erect they look exactly the same there's nothing there's there's no difference

1179
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:17,560
it's pretty it's pretty similar yeah it's the only important part you're you're forgetting the magic

1180
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:22,680
of erect by the time it's out of the pants then there's no it's not even happening that's not

1181
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:29,000
true what about a half hard dick they just look cool what aesthetically that's it the half hard dick

1182
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:37,880
is is is often forgotten the half the half job is pretty cool yeah yeah i i will agree with that uh

1183
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:46,120
okay with their next one is called phallic person redux amazing wait wait i gotta upload it uh there

congratulations good job uh next up is uh timisaurus uh here we go three two one go

1193
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:59,080
hello i've just listened to the gloomy cast and if you have depression what helps a lot of people

1194
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:06,840
is taking mag magic mushrooms specifically high doses um studies have shown that it helps

1195
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:18,040
quite a lot it also makes you more creative by a lot and it doesn't make you it's very safe

1196
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:27,160
to consume also um cancer patients approve okay everything he said is true i was just talking

1197
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:33,160
to this guy uh 17 on twitter i've never heard of anyone i've never heard of anyone odying on

1198
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:38,040
magic mushrooms yeah there's no there's nothing unsafe about mushrooms other than if you happen

1199
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:43,400
to be tripping balls and do something retarded because you're already insane okay i've never

1200
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:49,960
done a drug but i've always wondered though uh well they're fine i i tried i do them every day

1201
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:55,000
i got mushrooms from a guy one time and i ate them but like they didn't work i think they were old

1202
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:01,800
and like had like lost their power yeah well that's well i mean i guess i i drank some i only drank

1203
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:11,160
with ben they are they're good for depression supposedly the mushroom well that sounds like

1204
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:19,640
a recipe for just constantly needing more of them and not actually fixing depression it's like it's

1205
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:25,880
the way that like doing major psychedelics will like open your mind is such a way that you might

1206
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:32,120
be like decompressing about it for like fucking forever afterwards so it could be like a more

1207
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:38,840
long-term solution than than that you know well i see all kinds of crazy shit then if it's if it's

1208
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:43,960
super safe then i guess i wouldn't be averse to the idea of doing it at some point i would only

1209
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:50,600
do it with something just to give it a try really i did a weed i smoked a bit come to america do some

1210
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:57,160
acid and no the acid that's different isn't it shrooms and i don't think i ever you tell me you

1211
02:05:57,160 --> 02:06:02,920
tell me if i do it all the time you tell me how safe it is i don't know it's fucking it's fun to do

1212
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:08,040
i'll tell you that much no i've heard acid is is the thing that killed well not killed well maybe

1213
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:17,000
it did kill but like it made the the the original pink floyd guy loses mind what's acid like i mean

1214
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,600
he was in pink floyd how like i guess they must have done a lot of acid but i think it was acid but

1215
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:28,520
it's yeah i don't know acids are not usually known for i mean it can't i it can't make you insane

1216
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:35,320
it might activate the fact that you're did you what drugs don't make you crazy uh basically

1217
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:42,120
your brain stops sorting between what data is or isn't important and so everything start like

1218
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:46,040
because you you cannot like if you're trying to look at something it's going to look like

1219
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:54,840
it's moving because of the fact that uh your brain can't like ignore enough things to make

1220
02:06:54,840 --> 02:07:01,240
it look solid anymore you know what i mean like like just every piece of data is constantly going

1221
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:06,440
through your brain and so depending on how you interpret this like if you if you're thinking

1222
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:10,920
of it the way i'm thinking of it like i'm explaining it then you can get a pretty good handle on it

1223
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:15,000
and just be like okay i'm just taking in more information than normal what do i do with that

1224
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:20,440
the more acid you do the more you can parse that and not feel like you're tripping or anything

1225
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:26,840
but if you are if you take enough of it that you can no longer keep track of everything that it will

1226
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:30,920
feel like you're just seeing shit and losing your fucking mind so it really depends on like

1227
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:37,800
how much dosage you do how much you let yourself go are you trying to you know create horrifying

1228
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:41,960
visions or are you just trying to think a little harder see that that feels like it would give me

1229
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:48,040
a headache is that is that accurate it does not give you a headache it puts you in a totally

1230
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:54,760
different mind state from norm like doing acid is pretty like it's not extreme as like the effect

1231
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:59,320
it has on you as a drug like oh your physical health it's extreme in terms of the psychological

1232
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:04,920
effect of like you're not going to feel the way you normally do at all you know like the world

1233
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:10,600
is going to feel like a kind of a different place um it's like everything is fractaling all the time

1234
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:16,120
like if you stare at anything it will just endlessly frack and you'll be like wow i did not know i

1235
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:22,680
could actually see this much like i did not know that you won't realize how much information your

1236
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:28,200
brain is normally ignoring until you start not ignoring it you know what i mean that's intriguing

1237
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:34,600
okay i'm looking at i'm looking at it as of as of 2008 there are no documented fatalities attributed

1238
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:41,000
directly to an lsd overdose despite the several behavioral fatalities and suicides have occurred

1239
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:46,200
due to lsd so it makes you yeah it makes you do things that would kill you just if you're somebody

1240
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:53,240
who are who is suicidal then you and like you you know doing acid by yourself near a gun

1241
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:58,680
like yeah you know who knows what could happen i think alcohol probably is more likely to lead

1242
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:05,080
to suicide than acid like i can handle it then i would i just need a baby center i'm scared of

1243
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:10,600
the it sounds like it burns you though it's acid it burns you know they call it that's let's do it

1244
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:15,480
together it's more the effect it has on your perception because it feels like stuff's melting

1245
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:19,000
like when you look at shit it looks like it's melting a lot of the time that's why i feel

1246
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:27,080
like i would freak out before i do it i would have a bad trip before i get the acid in me

1247
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:33,000
and i'd be all right probably i feel the same way i feel like i would have a have an oh god moment

1248
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,880
and then take it and be like okay i understand what it is now because the fear of like not knowing

1249
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:44,840
what it's gonna feel like is scarier than what it probably actually is yeah i was a little even scared

1250
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:51,000
of of weed before i had tried it not too scared like i didn't think anything was gonna happen um

1251
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:58,200
but i was i don't know i did it i was smoking it drugs are cool i mean i was scared of alcohol

1252
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:02,600
i knew a lot of drugs and i was like i was scared of alcohol until i learned that it just made you

1253
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:06,840
it's or at least for me it just made me like feel dizzy and just laugh at more things

1254
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:13,400
it the that's good i have like that's pretty much the basis i have i can be like a happy drunk

1255
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:22,600
or i can be like an angry then your your drunken state is unbelievable you i got some i got pretty

1256
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:31,560
drunk i got pretty drunk uh on discord yesterday and i was very i was very i was feeling very grim

1257
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:37,240
i was feeling very dour i basically told everyone on my discord that uh your problems don't matter

1258
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:43,000
the apocalypse that sounds about right for you yeah you always say that you like hey you know

1259
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:48,280

1260
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:54,920

1265
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:19,720
ben you don't think that i'll just be like yeah i don't think that i love you every single time you

1266
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:27,880
do that that's true that's true uh okay let's uh next next one wait no no there's a bunch of like

1267
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:33,960
duplicate emails here timisora sent like three that are all the same uh so the next one is

1268
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,800
called um oh god it's another fucking circumcision one it's called ben just do

1269
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:44,680
ben just do your research let's give it a chance let's give it a chance three two

1270
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:50,120
fifty whole one go we probably won't listen been through a lot of gosh up the arguments against

1271
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:54,200
circumcision is the use of they are shown as benefits are negligible and are statistically

1272
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:59,240
insignificant yes i know yeah okay okay yes i know yes i know okay you're right yes circumcision

1273
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:04,520
it's bad it's probably bad yeah probably don't probably don't do it unless a doctor's like hmm

1274
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:08,840
if you don't circumcise this kid their dick's gonna fall off then then do it if they don't say that

1275
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:15,720
yeah fine fine fine you got me i don't like circumcision there are you happy that's my

1276
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:27,960
whole personality gone next one is called uh pancakes how do you do it um wait there it is okay

1277
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:35,160
three two one go uh pancakes with creators here listen i was wondering what are you guys

1278
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:42,840
more inclined to do when creating a story do you create cool characters and like create a world

1279
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:49,240
around them or do you create a world and then like just start writing with characters just start

1280
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:55,720
writing is this is is this like an architect versus gardener sort of sort of quandary i think digi

1281
02:12:55,720 --> 02:13:03,880
would have more of a yeah i usually build characters first like i am i will i have the bleach

1282
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:09,880
method of like if i don't know what to do create 20 characters and then unlike bleach though i do

1283
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:16,920
not then create a story i just have 20 characters and i don't know what to do with them um i think i

1284
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:23,400
i think i based i think i do like an events based like it's not so much that i have like a character

1285
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:28,920
or a setting i just have like an event that i build a story around like a like a climactic

1286
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:34,120
moment then like and i see that better way and i see that moment and i'm like okay how can i

1287
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:38,760
build a story that that builds to that that's how they wrote the entire third series where

1288
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:45,880
whether the blocks that i'm starting with yeah personally i feel like i'm not anywhere near

1289
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:53,720
good enough at making stories to like offer advice um i disagree because i've i've i don't know i've

1290
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:58,920
done so much planning and world building on things that don't exist yet and probably never will well

1291
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:04,360
that's not even like when i think storytelling like i don't think about like building an entire

1292
02:14:04,360 --> 02:14:10,040
fucking world and all that like you you've you've told tons of stories like you do tell stories good

1293
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:18,120
yeah i mean when it comes to those they definitely start with a character and a point a and point b

1294
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:26,520
um like uh lord of ghosts is i know what the whole thing is going to be like very movement

1295
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:31,000
based like it's always about like a character moving through an environment i've noticed like

1296
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:38,360
almost always yeah i i don't know why that is i think maybe it's just adventure adventure like

1297
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:43,720
you don't want to stand around talking about a physical a philosophical idea because i'm stupid

1298
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:48,440
i can't think of things things like that i want to run around shoot i want to be a cowboy go it's

1299
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:55,800
like at the beginning of um spirited away vibes like that kind of like moving through the environment

1300
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:00,520
sort of oh but the few times i've written stories i've also done the exact same thing

1301
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:09,240
uh that's good i mean if you're in a visual medium that is the best way to tell a story in my

1302
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:17,080
mind is like through you know environment and not through dialogue dialogue is is is useful for

1303
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:22,760
certain types of information i guess i would say given that you draw comics like an animator

1304
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:30,120
which is to say like it's focused on movement even though it's not moving um i guess i do i

1305
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:37,880
think that um the only story the only stories worth telling are about the human heart in conflict

1306
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:43,320
with itself georgia martin i think he stole that quote from someone else so no no no the way to

1307
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:49,640
tell a story is to just have a bunch of like faces and have them expressing like very complicated

1308
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:57,000
emotions that that's fuck environments environments are for losers you can't relate to an environment

1309
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:03,640
yeah you can no that's i i tend to my excitement when i go to a city is to like look at it and

1310
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:08,040
think about the shape of it and like why it's all laid out the way it is and how that affects people

1311
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:18,120
i'll say the fucking uh seeing the the gigantic seagates in in uh one piece the you know the

1312
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:24,520
architecture the the the all of the places in one piece are like really good at adding to the

1313
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:29,400
story in the narrative of what's happening there when i see a really good environment it's like

1314
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:35,400
a big cum it literally feels like oh my god like fuck yeah dude like look at this i want to be in

1315
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:40,680
that place dude i get that feeling yeah same it's like i want to build it in minecraft i get i get

1316
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:46,360
that specific feeling a whole lot reading one piece like if only i had the time to build this in

1317
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:49,560

1340
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:14,600
you're the new dawn at the dawn of the carlson presidency imagine if joe biden was like america

1341
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:19,640
we're gonna all like go into hibernation for a while like we're gonna pause everything we're all

1342
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:24,840
just gonna sleep until like coronavirus is over or something you know i would be you know i mean

1343
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:33,400
the political project of the pcp getting joe biden elected uh has been accomplished so like this the

1344
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:39,240
podcast has served its purpose we don't need it anymore um this was the plan all along and now

1345
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:48,760
it's over uh take take take five everybody we did it uh next one we got two two more voicemails

1346
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:56,840
and then we can call it a fucking day uh they're both from james so three two one go so you missed

1347
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:03,240
the good parts on that circumcision shit so i looked up the numbers it's four and ten thousand

1348
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:08,440
people have like problems so that could be anything you know but a non zero number of those problems

1349
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:17,080
are uh one of them is degloving where the incision line separates so like all the ways you can

1350
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:22,680
fuck up your dick the dick me and then i love they have like stitched that back together there's

1351
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:27,960
not counting the kids that just straight up die from it or like have like weird

1352
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:32,120
remember epstein's egg dick i think it's because of circumcision like i don't remember

1353
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:36,120
ever kind of scrunch it all right i don't know yet a weird i mean that makes sense yeah

1354
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:41,080
circumcision videos are fucking terrifying and then also the traditional jewish way to circumcise

1355
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:46,840
a kid is to uh cut the foreskin off then uh the moille sucks the blood out

1356
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:51,880
hell yeah and kids get herpes and die from that shit too blood libel baby she's fucking wild

1357
02:21:53,080 --> 02:22:03,080
um okay and then five seconds of silence um okay you know what i mean if the number is four

1358
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:10,040
and ten thousand then that's probably too high so uh that sounds pretty bad maybe circumcision bad

1359
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:17,320
after all whoopsie daisy you came around uh there's the more you know there's another one

1360
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:21,800
there's one more from james more circumcision talk we we're almost there three two one go

1361
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:27,480
i've been thinking about this one for a minute and just got the chance so fucking um listen

1362
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:34,360
utilitarianism there's the most mathematically pure and simple way to describe it it's collecting

1363
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:39,800
slime yeah yeah so like you want to do the things that make good slime people's brains and not do
