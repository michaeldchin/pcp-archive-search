1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Routy, Cop, Killers, Inn, Getting Over It, Bennett, Foddy, I don't know what this game is, I don't know what's happening right here.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Before this episode, I told Ben that I thought it was going to be some Zoey Quinn, Depression Quest, cinematic gameplay experience, where it's just like a text-based adventure, or some mood piece with millennial dialogue. This is like a streamer game, right? This is a fucking Twitch streamer meme game.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's a thing about dealing with loss, or whatever. And it's a little bit that. And it's a little bit of a streamer game. It's an art piece. This game is an art piece.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You know, I'm just going to start at the beginning, because progress doesn't mean anything.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, this is charming. I love this.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's way charming.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know what I love? You know how Tom's all about low-poly shit? I don't care about low-poly 3D models. I care about 3D models that are creepy and scary and uncanny about it. That's kind of the 3D art that I like.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's kind of part of the point of this game. The theme of this game is... Well, actually, I know a little bit about the history. There's this other flash game called Sexy Hiking that is very similar in many ways to getting over it.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But it was made out of pre-made assets for other games that were stolen. And this game is also made out of mostly bought Unity assets.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But the narration of the game talks about how the game is trash, because it's built out of trash assets that were cobbled together from other things.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, it's a good thing I won't be paying attention to literally any of the dialogue or narration in this entire game. I will basically be tabbed out the entire time.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey, speaking of the first thing I'm going to be tabbing out over to, this is going to date the episode. I'm about to release the RFC Killers 11 meat channel live right now.

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like, there we go, it's done. Good. The meat channel, the one we did at Radcon.

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, what we did at Radcon was, like, originally we just wanted to do, like, Wii Sports Resort, because we had done Wii Sports.

15
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And we didn't do it just because we didn't get our, like, we didn't have a webcam, like, you know, a camera recording us.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So we wanted to make right on our initial promise of having RFC Killers live.

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The way it worked was that we didn't have time to do it, basically, because we were doing other shit.

18
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it came down, like, the last day, and we just decided to do, like, a Meme Maker, and then Wii Sports Resort.

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So we released all of our good material on Meme Maker. And so Meme Maker is, like, this great, great episode, like, iconic, and will be remembered throughout the ages.

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But this, but the fucking actual, like, what we wanted to do, Wii Sports Resort, was, like, absolute shit, and, like, all silence.

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The game sucks, and we were bored.

22
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, so, Ben, a lot of stuff has happened since last RFC was recorded on, like, for YouTube.

23
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And I think a good set of gray is for me to publish the announcement video for our Twitch stream service.

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah!

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
RFC Killers is not on Twitch, it's out of the video. Save changes right now.

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's a sense of truth in that lack of content.

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, well, fuck.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I haven't seen the announcement video, what is it?

29
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's, uh, back in, like, 2006 or whatever, Egoraptor made a video entitled,

30
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Metal Gear Awesome is not on YouTube, where he talked about how all the uploads of Metal Gear Awesome on YouTube were illegitimate,

31
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and you could only experience it the way it was meant to be seen on Newgrounds.com.

32
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So basically what I've done is just take everything that he said, but rework it to be about Twitch and RFC's copulators.

33
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And so I made an impassioned rant with many big words about how RFC is not on Twitch,

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but then, uh, immediately in the description, I say, uh, we've actually folded, and it is on Twitch now.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I, uh, I lean to it.

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Uh, okay, so, so it's, you know, it's art, basically.

37
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, like, all of RFC has got to be on the front, it's art.

38
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's through and through.

39
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It has a deeper meaning, but you know, it has a high skill floor.

40
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
For engagement.

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The RFC might be, like, the highest skill floor to any Let's Play series.

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like, I'm hard to, like, like, viewers.

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you can find a more, like, niche, fucking, like, clicky, like, unbelievably daunting to newcomers.

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like, like, can you imagine trying to watch RFC and not knowing what the PCP is?

45
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can you, can you imagine trying to parse what we've woven here?

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Um, it would be, you know, you would, you would be lacking, you would be lacking in comprehension.

47
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You know, once we're all, like, once being your, like, millionaires,

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and the RFC is typically as a brand has exceeded our well of expectations.

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We have t-shirts in our own amusement parks.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
People will look back and be like, you know, my first, my first introduction to all these people

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
was, was the fucking get in and over with fucking Benjamin Freddy or whatever the fuck this game is.

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So you know what? Preemptively, welcome.

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes. Well, welcome to, welcome to the past.

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Uh, it's now, now you got, now it's time to go on an extensive YouTube search

55
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and find all the previous Rowdy fuckers content and then go over to the Twitch

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and experience that, experience, uh, we're playing, um, over on Twitch,

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
we're not playing, um, Pokemon Gale of Darkness XD, lol.

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Uh, which is way sick.

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, oh, oh, I'm so glad you think so. I'm so glad.

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We recorded, like, a test video for YouTube and it was super fucking gay

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and, like, we thought the game was bad, but we were actually proven wrong

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and that it's an fantastic game, that is perfect.

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Also this, what you're doing right now is agonizing to watch Unfurl.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, yeah, that's kind of, that's kind of the point.

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean, I, I, okay, when we started recording, I was here

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and then, like, I was testing the audio and I was just kind of flailing around

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and I threw myself over that boulder, over on the left there

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and I ended up back at the start screen.

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is, I think, okay, I haven't gotten to the end of this game

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
but so far this part is easily the hardest

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and, like, I've done it many times but it's still, like, way difficult

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and, like, not at all a guarantee that I can successfully do it.

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I had to, I had to look up how to do this part

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and I'm glad I did because I didn't realize that the lamps are grabbable

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and grabbing the lamps is, like, the entire way of doing it.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Fuck.

78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh Christ.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Come on.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know what this game reminds me of?

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It is fucking, I think, I think it's Quap?

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Is this the game I'm thinking of?

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Actually, this is made by the guy who made it.

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Bennett Foddy is the Quap guy.

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, really?

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah.

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, well, perfect.

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm a fucking genius. I didn't even know.

89
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But this game has, like, themes and, you know, messages.

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm, like, Quap, who has the theme of, like, like, mental retardation

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
not being in control of your own body

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and flailing around your lips and floundering.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
People have been predicting that games would soon be made out of prefabricated objects.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So, I'm up the devil's chimney and it's kind of,

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it's kind of smooth sailing from here.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
From here?

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, getting up the devil's chimney requires luck

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and you sort of have to flail around

99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and just hope for the best to do it.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
After that, after this,

101
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
like, the next obstacles are ones that you just kind of got to take slow

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and they're not that bad.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Although you can still fuck them up and, like, throw yourself all the way back to the beginning.

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, fuck.

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh God.

106
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh God.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
God, don't let me fall back down the devil's chimney.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, okay.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's go out, like, like, what we're doing on Twitch.

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like, not just the basic, like, where we're doing Pokemon XD.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But, but, but, I forget who thought of the idea first.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But, one of us came up with the idea of doing Street Fighter and Reciprocaliz.

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Because it made sense because all of the Reciprocaliz are, like, super fucking long

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and all, like, sort of meandering and, like, fluid,

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
not, like, structured, let's play content anyway.

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And it made sense to make them do, like, be streamed.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But are they trash culture?

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, it was your idea, and it was the best idea.

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's, like, when you said it, and when I saw, like, the Twitch channel

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
with all the art and stuff there, I was like,

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
this is kind of way more logical than YouTube.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Than YouTube videos.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, we're testing out streaming.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We're still gonna do, like, YouTube videos.

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We don't really have a schedule, Reciprocaliz.

126
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The brand is to not have a schedule, basically.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But we're gonna test out streaming and see how much we like it.

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then we're gonna decide if we wanna do YouTube videos still,

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or if we wanna do Twitch streams.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's pros and cons to each side.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And as I keep saying, to remind us of our roots, as I am,

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
both the procrastinators and the Reciprocaliz Tribune of the plebs,

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
always looking out for the little guys.

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The sheer ecstasy that fans get when they just log on to YouTube one day.

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And just by chance, they've been blessed with the newer iFreq Skype Killers.

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And just, like, they have not seen this be recorded.

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They do not know any step of the way, like, like, what's been transpiring here.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All they know is that one day, instantaneously,

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
they just have, like, six hours of content, brand new, to their virginity.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The live stream, like, it's like, you announce it on Twitter that it's happening,

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and then they get themselves up mentally.

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And then they are, like, forced in a way to, like, watch it live.

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And, like, it feels, even though the streams have been shorter than Reciprocaliz,

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
they feel like they've been longer.

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Just by virtue of, like, the constant fan interaction.

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's like streaming on Twitch with, like, you know, notifications and stuff.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It feels like high fakes in a way, you know?

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like, you're in the thick of it right then.

149
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And you have to be engaged.

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Or there could be disastrous consequences.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You know what it is.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's that when it's just recording a video, it's just me and you, and we're just talking.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But when we're streaming, there's, like, a silent third party who, like, is talking,

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
but only intact.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, like, you just have to, like, like, every so often, you're just like reminded,

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
like, I have to be entertaining this person who's in, you know, who represents the chat.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Like, I have to be a good, funny person.

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Whereas it's a normal Reciprocaliz.

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's just me and you, and we're just floundering constantly, and we don't mind.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, and we're not funny, and we don't entertain anyone.

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, exactly.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I do, there's a lot of obvious good with a Twitch, though.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like I said, it makes sense, the kind of content that we do.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it's just nice.

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, no, oh god.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh god, you're so fucked, you're so fucked.

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, no, no.

168
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think I'm good.

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I got a firm handhold, a firm hammerhold.

170
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes!

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're, like, balancing this game.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Huh?

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I guess it's because of the pot.

174
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You can, like, fling yourself and, like, and, like, what's the word?

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can, like, bounce up and down.

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You can, you can, like, you, like, can jam your hammer on the ground underneath you

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and, like, pogo stick yourself.

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, you're, oh god.

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay, this one.

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is a tense game.

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I kind of forget what to do here.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, Christ.

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know how I can play in the game, but I can just imagine how fucking agonizing it is.

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Fuck.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Uh.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is definitely, like, like a total, like, streamer, like, like, this is, like, I want to be the guy.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But, like, even more Twitch-ified, you know what I'm saying?

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's got the-

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is so easily, like, like, oh, I've reached new goal, fucking test one and donate now.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's got the, um, it's got the, um, yeah, it's got that, like, super, like, frustrating,

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
like, screamer kind of appeal where someone can pretend to freak the fuck out for kids

194
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and they'll have fun.

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But it's also got that, like, goat simulator absurdity to it.

196
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Um, how distasteful.

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It is the perfect, it is the perfect, um, stream game.

199
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So it's great that we're playing it on YouTube instead.

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah.

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I-

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's just, we are kings of marketing.

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We know more than anyone ever know.

204
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I-

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I-

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
People think that we're making poor decisions, but we're just on a completely different level

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
than they even are aware of.

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We're playing the long game.

209
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We're playing chess and they're playing checkers.

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I completely forget.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, God.

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh!

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, Christ.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I completely forget, um, how I did this before.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I have done it.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you want me to look up a walkthrough?

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Um, oh, God.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, if you want to go and, like, look and-

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh!

220
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Ah, ah, ah!

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is real genuine fear.

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is not fake shit.

223
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This is real.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's, that's, that's why.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's why it's the best game for this, for, for Twitch streamers like us, boy.

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because these are always fearful for your fucking life.

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
God.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I feel like I pogoed.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I feel like I have to pogo myself, but, like, I can't.

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, Christ.

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, fuck.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I, I just opened up a YouTube video and, like, the loudest sound I've ever heard in my entire life

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
was this guy going like, hey, what's up, YouTube?

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And what was up, YouTube?

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What was the answer you were seeing?

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It was like, because I immediately muted it.

237
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, boy.

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay, okay.

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, I have made, I've made it past this part, like, maybe, like the part with the, the stairs up there.

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I've made it past that maybe, like, three or three times or something.

241
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Alright, I'm watching this guy.

242
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This part sucks.

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're just standing fucking still, though.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Climbing this tower, I hate.

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is one of my least favorite.

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, shit.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, no.

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay.

249
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Jesus fucking speed up guy.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Fucking, oh, God, this is always the case.

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, God.

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This is always the case.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, my God.

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I could not have fucked that up more.

255
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I could not have possibly fucked that up more than I did.

256
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You just got raped just then, dude.

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That was embarrassing.

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Like, I, okay, I saw my hammer doing all the things that it shouldn't be doing, and I, you know, it's my responsibility.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Jesus Christ.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You know, that's really sick that, like, like, like that you can just fucking, like, eat shit and, like, go back all the way to the beginning.

261
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's sick in all the ways that the word sick could mean.

263
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's like, it's like grotesque that he would program something like that.

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And it's also cool as hell.

265
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Ah, fuck.

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No, I don't think.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, maybe I can.

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, yes.

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're supposed to, like, you're supposed to, like, pogo stick yourself into the stairs and then wildly, like, I don't know, like, like, like, flail your hammer back and forth up, like, against the wall and the stairs to, like, get yourself height in a way.

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Um, sounds difficult.

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sounds chancey.

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Chancey?

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, it's super, super chancey and it's super fucking looks retarded.

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's what you have to do.

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I mean, this part is chancey, but there's, like, nothing, there's nothing at stake.

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This part just feels like flailing.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, oh, hey, hey.

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So, the first comment on the new reference cop killers 11, MeChannel Live, by HappyD, ah yes, good old YouTube, much better than Twitch.

281
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Great.

282
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay.

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay.

284
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Alright.

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
HappyD has spoken.

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, we know HappyD's a pain on the subject.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know.

288
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I mean, well, we don't have to do just one or the other, right?

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, we don't.

290
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We've both got big minutes.

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We could do like a monthly, we could do like a monthly stream and like a monthly video, I guess.

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I, oh god.

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, I think we should, ah.

294
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We should definitely stream all of XD, like for sure.

295
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

296
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We should finish that at least.

297
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Ah, balls.

298
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Another thing I like about streaming is that it allows us to like do like long four games because the reference cop killers like structure on YouTube videos really incentivizes us to just do exclusively one shots.

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

300
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh.

301
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

302
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Fuck.

303
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know why, but I definitely, I definitely as well viewers like the idea of reference cop killers being a YouTube show.

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They're like, I don't know why and like it kind of doesn't make sense, but just something about it feels right.

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Ah.

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Excellent rebuttal.

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm sorry, I'm very focused.

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This game is Zen.

309
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It feels like the opposite of Zen.

310
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It feels like it's fucking like waterboard torture.

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Well, tomato-tomato.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Guys, what if I made a fifth UKM that was really hard?

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Impossible.

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm, I'm, I'm so, this, this is like the most, I know, I know like a,

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I know like it doesn't actually matter like literally at all, but it feels super like it's a defined moment in reference cop killers history.

316
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The fucking, like will we do Twitch or will we do YouTube?

317
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Even though like we will do both.

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah.

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No matter what the results are, it feels important to me.

320
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Uh, well, I mean, I'm, I'm really liking Twitch a whole lot, like a whole fucking lot.

321
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah.

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

323
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Also, also people donate sometimes, which is nice.

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's nice.

325
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, we, what fucking child musters we are, we haven't even mentioned far more important than the fucking Twitch.

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, the discord.

327
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Far, far more important, the discord.

328
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The discord is a defining moment in Rowdy fucker's history.

329
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah.

330
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah.

331
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Unquestionably.

332
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
This is literally the best thing to ever happen to this fucking show.

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

334
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The show is real now.

335
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This is like on par with like the, the frog fractions saga, like no question, no question.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In some ways, I think it's even more like defining.

337
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah.

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because, because, because the Rowdy fucker's cop killers now has a cannon.

339
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There is now a, there is now cannon.

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's now more.

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah.

342
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I, I was actually like in my mind before this server was created, I was pretty adamant in

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the sense of the fact that like, like, Reverent Circular should not have lore because I was

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
surrounded by so many shows that had like, like obtuse and absurd lore.

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But now that it does, just by nature, that's just the way that me and Ben make things is

346
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
that we fill it with fucking lore to the brim.

347
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm so happy and it has literally the best lore of any narrative ever created.

349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah.

350
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's um, I've been really getting into it.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I've been like, I've just been reveling in like all of the, all the shit people have

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
made and all of the art of Slime City.

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Actually, I have a, I have a grievance, not a grievance, but I have a concern, which is

354
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
that I don't know if I like the name Slime City.

355
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know if I like it either.

356
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's on, it's too on the nose.

357
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I would like to propose the alternative name of Fuck City.

358
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I know, I know you said that, but I think that's just as bad.

359
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You think so?

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think both of them leave something to be desired.

361
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:15,000
When I was making, like, like, like, I made, I made like a map for the setting of Reverent

362
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Circular.

363
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh no.

364
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay.

365
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So, Reverent Circular is a city that is on, like, like a peninsula in the Grand Canyon.

366
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But the Grand Canyon, due to a nuclear meltdown, has been flooded with nuclear toxic waste,

367
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
aka Slime.

368
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And it's basically a gold rush and everyone is flocked to this city to get their hands

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
on some Slime, which is worth like twice its weight in gold.

370
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Slime is, Slime is the most powerful resource.

371
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Slime, if you, if he who controls the Slime controls the world.

372
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And we control the Slime.

373
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So, so the Grand Canyon, this like iconic, like American, like National Park, it's just

374
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
flooded with fucking Slime and there's just a bunch of gang warfare in the city.

375
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And me and Ben, of course, moved there to try and make it big and get our grubby little

376
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
hands on some fucking Slime.

377
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And so basically we just have an apartment in downtown, whatever the city is called,

378
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and we just record Let's Plays and we make fun of each other and troll each other online

379
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
using proxy child warfare because we're too pussy to fight it in the wild.

380
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And meanwhile our minions, like, rage through the streets committing untold gang violence

381
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and atrocities.

382
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, it's perfect.

383
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, I'm, I don't, I don't like Slime City either.

384
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah.

385
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It was just, it was just, I don't know, it felt like a placeholder name that just kind of caught on.

386
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh God.

388
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I feel like if we do want to change it, we should change it now.

389
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We don't want to have it be solidified.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We don't, we don't want to, we don't want to let that Slime settle.

391
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Slime City can always be like, you know, the nickname for it.

392
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Like the, like New York is the big Apple.

393
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The big Slime.

394
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The big Slime.

395
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The big Slime.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
No.

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Fuck.

398
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
We're tired of it.

399
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I don't know.

400
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What, what can we call it?

401
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Um, New Delta City.

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No.

403
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm pretty sure that was in Robocop.

404
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Great.

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

406
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Los Angeles 2.

407
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Los Angeles 2.

408
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
New Los Angeles City.

409
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
New Los Angeles City 2.

410
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Um, Neo.

411
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I, I, I kind of like New Los Angeles City.

412
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I kind of like that.

413
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Wait, wait, wait.

414
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's, it's, it's really fucking stupid.

415
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But it's really funny.

416
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

417
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
New Los Angeles City is pretty strong.

418
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What about like, what about like, um, wait, an idea is calcifying.

419
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Um, like, uh, I'm thinking like Neo and then like a town that is like, sounds like, oh,

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
oh, oh, oh, wait, wait.

421
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Um, hold on.

422
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Hold on.

423
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Neo Albuquerque.

424
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Neo Albuquerque is pretty good.

425
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Um, oh, Neo Spokane.

426
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Spokane.

427
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, that's not bad.

428
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I like Neo.

429
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It definitely, it definitely needs to be like, Neo Milwaukee.

431
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It needs to be like retarded and funny.

432
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Those are the two requirements.

433
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Is it to be retarded and funny?

434
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

435
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And like vaguely imply like, relation to like a populous city.

436
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Uh.

437
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Neo Milwaukee.

438
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You know, Milwaukee too, in the deserts of Arizona.

439
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Uh.

440
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It'll happen again.

441
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Keep on trying.

442
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Bullshit.

443
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's not that bad.

444
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You're at level one again.

445
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, but I have to do this part.

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This, this is like my least favorite part.

447
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Cause this part is totally random as well as like relatively high stakes.

448
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You know, I've seen my favorite streamers Rodney Dangerfield play this game.

449
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So I, to me, from my perspective, you're, you're kicking ass.

450
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't, I don't have a frame of reference.

451
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, I've gotten pretty good at the part like up to this point.

452
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And then this is where I start to like not know what the fuck I'm doing.

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Uh.

454
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Oh, I didn't even mention those important fucking part in Slime or Los Angeles too.

455
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
In, in, in, in new Los Angeles city.

456
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There is a, there is a, an obelisk standing in the city.

457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's not pyramid.

458
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh fuck.

459
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

460
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's not, it's not a pyramid.

461
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
No.

462
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's been depicted as a pyramid because people have misinterpreted the avatar.

463
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah.

464
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Which is understandable.

465
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah.

466
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But it's an obvious thing.

467
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Think like the Washington Monument only way better.

468
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

469
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Uh, there's an obvious called endless war.

470
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And, uh, I, I don't know if we have concrete rules, but just know that he,

471
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that he washes over as constantly and he, uh, and he fuels getting warfare in,

472
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
in ways even we can't fully articulate.

473
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We don't fully understand endless war.

474
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We know that the bodies of the dead are like put into him and they like power him somehow.

475
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And he like regurgitate slime.

476
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Um, and other than that, you know, it's all pretty, it's all pretty much open to interpretation.

477
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is this real?

478
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Is this metaphorical?

479
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is endless war an actual thing or just a discord server bar server bot that we have

480
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
made to troll each other online?

481
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
No one's to say for sure.

482
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Uh, uh, balls.

483
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh fuck.

484
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh my God.

485
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That was really funny.

486
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You just, uh.

487
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I just ate shit.

488
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Shit.

489
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah.

490
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You just ate shit and died.

491
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh God.

492
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh God.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh God.

494
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay.

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
This is so fucking tense.

496
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
This is nerve wracking.

497
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

498
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Imagine what it would be like to be you.

499
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Beating this game would be just so me, you know.

500
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
That would be so you.

501
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That would fit your aesthetic so hard.

502
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yes.

503
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Being the guy who's like, oh yeah, getting over within a body.

504
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah, I beat it.

505
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It took me like a couple of weeks, but I did it.

506
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Whatever.

507
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Wasn't even that hard.

508
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah, you know, you just get into a groove.

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh God.

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't want to bag anything, but you know, I talked to the developer and he basically

511
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
said I was the one.

512
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There's a part later that looks fucking retarded where it's like there is a like box hanging

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
from a chain and you have to like, I don't even know what you're supposed to do with

514
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
it, but you're supposed to like do something with this box on a chain and like jump up to

515
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
like another level using it.

516
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And that part looks literally impossible.

517
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
This game is, I'm convinced that this is the worst game ever made just by virtue of the

518
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
way that it makes me feel.

519
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No, this game is art.

520
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
This game is art, art, art, maybe terrible.

521
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes.

522
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Oh God.

523
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
No.

524
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh faggot.

525
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Okay.

526
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay.

527
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I have to stop.

528
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I feel like look away from the screen and so I stop doing streamer noises.

529
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

530
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't have that luxury.

531
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, I know.

532
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You have to be glued to this shit.

533
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm, I'm, I'm, the, the number one thing that the discord server has solidified is the

534
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
fact that undeniably you, if you want to describe or ever describe, you have to use the term

535
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
subversive or genre defined.

536
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You could not get around using either of those two adjectives.

537
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I mean, yeah.

538
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
There's just no way around it.

539
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
To not do that would just be, I mean, it would just be dishonest.

540
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It would just be intellectually dishonest.

541
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, I know.

542
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You've done more for the further of like, like let's plays and discord servers than all of

543
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
you fucking schmucks have ever even dreamed of.

544
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Hey, should we like talk about, should we like talk about what the actual server is now?

545
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

546
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, it's, yeah, it's a, it's a game now.

547
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's been turned into a game.

548
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It is a, it is a site of gang warfare.

549
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You can go there.

550
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You can, you, you kill people, you mine slime, you become powerful and you, and you just,

551
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
you know, try and try, you commit warfare in the name of, you know, the rabid fucker,

552
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the cop kill.

553
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You choose a side, you know, the factions are heavily divisive and at each other's throats

554
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
constantly.

555
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Again, to, to fuel me and Ben's trolling campaigns for one another online, you, you can join

556
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
either the rowdies, my faction, or the stinky killers that is officially named the stinky

557
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
killers.

558
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah.

559
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Ben's smelly faction.

560
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Just today.

561
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

562
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay.

563
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So a little, a little history.

564
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There was a, there was a long period there where like I took, I took the lead and like

565
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
a pretty commanding lead for a while there.

566
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
In overall slime count.

567
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah, in overall slime.

568
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I was at like three million in something and you were at like one and a half million.

569
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So then yesterday with the new patch, the casino patch, there's now a casino where you

570
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
can gamble your slime on, on craps and the slot machines.

571
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
All with any discord server by the way.

572
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This is all in a discord server.

573
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So there's that.

574
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And I just gambled away like half a million slime, um, betting on craps, uh, and losing

575
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
every time.

576
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And then today, um, you, you orchestrated a scheme with one of your rowdies, uh, to kill

577
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
one of the most powerful juveniles.

578
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I organized with one of my most trusted mercenaries, the dreaded player, uh, ready player one,

579
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
this is his official name.

580
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've contracted the, the, the, the merciless mercenary ready player one.

581
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He's in my, he's in my league.

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah.

583
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So, um, so that all happened.

584
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So with my losses and your sudden gains, we're now like way closer.

585
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm, I'm at like just over three million and you're at like, what, like 2.6 million.

586
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

587
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
2.6.

588
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Okay.

589
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So, uh, yeah.

590
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I designed some of these people.

591
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I got, I got, some of these people are looking like a snack.

592
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's all I'll say.

593
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The, the killers.

594
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay.

595
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The killers have been like mobilized and like organized and they have like, you know, they

596
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
hang out in cop killer town and they just like talk strategy.

597
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like they talk shop.

598
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah.

599
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
They're super, they're super like in like the math of it and, and like the art, they're

600
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
basically, they basically treat like it is chest, which would have no rainbow had the

601
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
eyes, no tears.

602
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Also nice job.

603
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Thank you.

604
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

605
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Well, they're treating it like it's chess.

606
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But the thing is that the rules keep changing because, uh, oh, the new, new patch, dead players

607
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
can now haunt the living from the sewers.

608
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They can steal their slime and actually crack just implemented, um, cracks the developer

609
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
by the way.

610
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Um, he just implemented a thing where now, um, dead players that haunt, they gain negative

611
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
slime.

612
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So they, they have negative slime now, um, which is fucking sick.

613
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And that's probably going to be relevant later.

614
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
There will probably be a way to like stop the dead from haunting you if you can do something.

615
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's probably all, I'll be like old news by the time.

616
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

617
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
We'll be like six more patches deep.

618
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You know, like there will be like, you know, there will be like collect, you know, there

619
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
will be like a collectible card.

620
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
They'll be like a full on collectible card game in the discord server.

621
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, then you just ruined my life.

622
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm going to have to make a fucking right.

623
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah.

624
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm writing that the fuck down right now.

625
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm super into that.

626
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Okay.

627
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Good.

628
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh God.

629
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh fuck.

630
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No.

631
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Mother fucker.

632
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Dude, I got a hollow lord of ghosts the other day in a booster pack.

633
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It was super fucking lucky.

634
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Jealous.

635
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Jealous.

636
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I need that to round out my manicurve, my slime curve.

637
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh my God.

638
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It writes itself.

639
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We're just printing fucking slime at this point.

640
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We're printing slime.

641
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh, it's too easy.

642
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Guys, viewers, think about it.

643
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Think about it for one fucking second and you'll understand the ramifications.

644
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What other let's play show?

645
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Mind you, this let's play show releases exclusively like two hour plus content in like bulk of

646
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
like meandering, flattering topics.

647
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This let's play show.

648
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What other let's play has a discord server that actively incentivizes gang warfare and

649
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
has like a playable gambling within its perimeters.

650
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What other fucking let's play show has that?

651
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The game grumps fucking.

652
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't fucking think so.

653
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The other shit?

654
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What do they have?

655
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What do they have?

656
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
R slash polygrams.

657
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Get the fuck out of here.

658
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah.

659
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
R slash endless war is what we're fucking working.

660
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes.

661
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There should probably be a subreddit for rowdy fuckers because there's so much.

662
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
There's so much lore.

663
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Like there's so much.

664
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

665
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You know what?

666
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That makes a lot of sense because that'll be that'll probably be a better way to post

667
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Fanner and shit.

668
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah.

669
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Actually, oh shit.

670
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That's a great idea that I just had.

671
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm gonna pat myself.

672
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah.

673
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm gonna back for it.

674
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
God, the right.

675
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Like right for this.

676
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We'll just will not stop growing.

677
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Like you just can't.

678
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It can't.

679
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It can't anymore.

680
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No, it's just too powerful.

681
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
There's nothing we can do.

682
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But mega slime achieved.

683
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah.

684
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That's gonna be that's like brain blast.

685
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But like now it's mega slime achieved when you have a really potent.

686
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
When ever, you know, when, when, when you've made strides, when you've made strides towards

687
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
conquest, mega slime achieved.

688
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But like you're also afraid of the consequences.

689
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I feel like, like, like I'm almost, I'm really excited, I guess I would say to see what the

690
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
viewers like, like what you like the modern day viewer, like if you're seeing this on

691
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
like day one, what does endless war look like to you?

692
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Because it's like a concept state of like development right now.

693
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And we're not totally happy with it, of course.

694
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No.

695
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So like we're continually updating it.

696
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So like, what does it look like for you?

697
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Like, like maybe some of these, maybe some of these concepts are like defunct.

698
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Maybe you can't haunt players anymore.

699
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Maybe we decided that that is not like streamlined enough.

700
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't know.

701
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Anything's possible.

702
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Uh, man, me and Crack, a while ago, we were, we workshopped.

703
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We were just like, we were just talking shop about it.

704
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
About like shit that could be added later.

705
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And it was so fucking exciting for me.

706
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I, you guys have like, like a test server where you guys iron out all this shit.

707
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

708
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I used to be involved in like, in like when, like the first couple of things.

709
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But I've been totally off the map and like, and like not playing the game.

710
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because, because I've been editing rad con shit and like doing other things.

711
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah.

712
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Which we will get into later.

713
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I have, I have, I have a little bit of notes here that I am keeping track of.

714
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh God.

715
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Uh, but I just want to say.

716
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh no, no, no.

717
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Okay.

718
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Anyway.

719
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Are you watching this by the way?

720
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah.

721
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, oh, I'm watching.

722
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm watching eyes glued, dude.

723
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Eyes glued.

724
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You're in fucking, you're in the hell pit.

725
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You're in the cesspool.

726
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
God.

727
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Damn it.

728
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I feel like I did way better on my first try and now I'm sucking shit again.

729
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, I know.

730
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You actually got to the place.

731
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah.

732
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
All right.

733
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Anyway.

734
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Uh, I forget what I was saying.

735
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Some fucking bullshit.

736
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Something about the test server?

737
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Editing rad con shit?

738
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, oh yeah.

739
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

740
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You guys have been doing insanely great, like, like constant work.

741
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like much, much like endless work itself, you guys have endless work.

742
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And it's really endearing and nice and I'm glad you've dedicated yourself to this goal.

743
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

744
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I am, I'm way into it.

745
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I like, okay, I try to do as much as I can.

746
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Like, all right.

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Like before Endless War, I was talking about Endless War before it was real and like I

748
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
was doing my best.

749
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I spent like several days studying and learning Python to try and code it.

750
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Turns out there's like all this other shit because like it's not enough just to write

751
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the program.

752
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It also has to be like run from a database and like communicate with the database.

753
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And that is some like advanced shit that I do not know how long I do not know what I would

754
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
have had to do to get them all.

755
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So just thank God crack was like, Hey, I'll write it.

756
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And because he's like an actual programmer.

757
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So he like developed it in the beginning.

758
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And that gave us like a foundation to work off of.

759
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And he still does most of like the updates, but I like, like for the casino, I like take

760
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
his existing code and I like just like kind of fuck around with it and try and like make

761
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
it into new functions.

762
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And it kind of works most of the time.

763
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
By the way, I'm eating gum right now.

764
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Fuck you viewers.

765
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Gross.

766
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Sick.

767
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm getting, I'm getting frustrated.

768
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm getting frustrated with Bennett.

769
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I can tell you're foaming.

770
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You're foaming right now.

771
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm I plan to be more reference cop killers or endless war more accurately, like like

772
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
meetings because I am interested.

773
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I am interested in this game.

774
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I mean, it's been bogged down with other shit.

775
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Now, okay, the way it works right now that there's a couple of problems.

776
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
One, it's, well, actually it was too easy to die, but now it's too easy not to die because

777
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
now the PVP flag system means that if you don't do anything, you're invulnerable, which

778
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
is, I mean, yeah, you know, you can't like accomplish anything, but like it's kind of

779
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
like people just haven't been dying lately.

780
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, well, maybe there's not enough people playing.

781
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah.

782
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah.

783
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
What I want to know is what in the beginning before endless war, we just like had the server

784
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and there was like minor elements of gang war there.

785
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And both of us on either side, it needs at any given time, there'd be online about like

786
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
20 killers and about 20 rowdies, you know, but now for some reason, our numbers are so

787
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
fucking small.

788
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
They're so fucking small.

789
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Right now there are like seven killers.

790
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
There are three rowdies.

791
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Why is this the case?

792
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Well, I mean, there's also, there are also juveniles and corpses, like the corpses are

793
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
actually pretty active.

794
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
God, it's so sick.

795
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Ghost pride is the number one plague on fucking society.

796
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It is.

797
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's, it's disgusting, frankly.

798
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's, you know, it's subversive in all the ways that rowdy fuckers itself is not.

799
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's all the wrong types of subversive.

800
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We're all the good parts.

801
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes.

802
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We've got the market cornered on subversiveness.

803
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Everyone else needs to quit right now.

804
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We've got all the subversiveness.

805
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There's none left for anyone else.

806
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
All other types of subversion are now just, you know, degeneracy.

807
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Disgusting.

808
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Okay.

809
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What I want to do is I like in this war, like this is, this is like, you're like an indie

810
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
dev, like that's been like, like breaking his back and I'm now like the corporate like

811
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
AAA publisher who wants to get your game off, you know, into steam, but you're going to

812
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
make some like, like hard buying like creative decisions and, and, and work with me, the evil

813
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
tyrant.

814
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah.

815
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I like in this war, I like what you got going on here, kid.

816
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But I think that we need to have like a conference where we like, where we like, we try and

817
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
like streamline and like simplify things and like understand like, like design philosophies.

818
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because right now it feels, it's not like actually, but it feels bloated.

819
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And I think, and I think that we can like, we can, we can get to the point where like all

820
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
the like, we can get to the point where it is literally and all of like the ends tie to

821
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
one another.

822
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And like it is narratively and like aesthetically sound and like in one.

823
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because I feel like there are some mechanics that kind of like are dead ends and aren't

824
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
really cohesive with the overall like design, if you know what I'm saying.

825
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Like what?

826
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What do you, what do you mean?

827
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The dojo specifically, the dojo.

828
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The dojo is, the dojo was kind of a stopgap measure to like keep players doing things.

829
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Like even the dojo was an attempt to stop stagnation because players that had aligned with a faction

830
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
had nothing to do.

831
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So the dojo was like, okay, well, you can't mine for slime, but you can spar and like it's

832
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
something.

833
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But yeah, it doesn't really do anything except, except get you a little bit of slime and then

834
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
like flag you for PvP.

835
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So it is kind of an under, yeah.

836
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Okay.

837
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
All of the myth that sparring is underdeveloped and doesn't really serve that much purpose

838
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
at the time.

839
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Oh God, Jesus.

840
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh.

841
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Okay.

842
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Okay.

843
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You know what?

844
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's all right.

845
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I'm okay with that.

846
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's all right.

847
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm okay with that.

848
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's all right.

849
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's all right.

850
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
We'll make you less miserable now.

851
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Abraham Lincoln.

852
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I think like we just need to examine what we want the game to be on like the average,

853
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
like like what we want the day to day of the game to be and like what are the design

854
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,000
that we want to entail because I, what I want is for the day to day to, I want to return

855
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
in any way that we can to the like 20 killers and 20 routies at any given time.

856
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I want, okay.

857
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah.

858
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I want death to be, okay, I want death to be easy, but also like less common.

859
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,760
I think that what I want is for, yeah, I want a world where like, you know, the routies

860
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,000
and the killers are not constantly killing each other, but they can at a moment's notice.

861
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,600
Like, you know, I want, I want the threat of like, because now with the PVP flags, the

862
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,000
threat of death is largely eliminated if you don't want it.

863
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,400
I like, I want the threat to be there, but also like, you know, rare enough that you're

864
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,000
not just like, well, fuck if there's no point of playing.

865
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I feel like it says, it's just a complicated web of alliances.

866
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,600
I mainly just want there to be like, again, there to be, you know, a healthy number of

867
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,000
each gang.

868
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah.

869
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,100
I feel like there has to be some sort of like, because the invulnerability for not doing anything

870
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,200
is like fine, and that's like a fine solution.

871
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Yeah.

872
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,880
But it's just, there's just too many, there's just too many corpses with, with corpse pride

873
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,840
not wanting to do things, and there's too much, there's too much like people just not

874
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
doing things.

875
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,840
Yeah.

876
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,760
It's just too, like of a passive experience, like, like, it's too, it's too easy to just

877
00:47:52,760 --> 00:48:00,680
not do anything because there's not like, aside from like the core of like killing, like,

878
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,800
like being juvenile farming and then getting killed is like not like a whole bunch to like

879
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:12,000
act for quintessential juvenile experience.

880
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,680
I love the casino.

881
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,880
I really love it because that's like, that's like a use for slime.

882
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
Yeah.

883
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,120
Like, even though like the actual benefit of it is just to get more slime.

884
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
Yeah.

885
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,640
You can like, spin the slime on something.

886
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Yes.

887
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,600
In an ideal world, there would be some sort of like slime shop where you could like, buy

888
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,360
something with slime, but I don't know how we could fit that into a discourse or like,

889
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,040
or like what the rewards would be.

890
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,040
Okay.

891
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,840
Like other items are feasible.

892
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:48,960
Like I was thinking about like maybe a way to change combat so that it wouldn't be as

893
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:56,000
like instantly lethal would be an item that was like armor and like if you can like buy

894
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,640
a bunch of them and if you've got them, like, you, it like, like the enemy doesn't know

895
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:07,600
you have them, but you can, but like you, they'll shoot at you and it'll cost them,

896
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,680
you know, what it costs to kill you, but you don't die.

897
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,040
But you just deplete one of your like armor pieces.

898
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,780
So you could like build up like a strong like resistance to death by like just buying a shit

899
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,200
ton of armor, you know.

900
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,840
And that could mean that, you know, your, your, your AFK like a, like we could remove

901
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,360
maybe not completely, but to an extent, the invulnerability for being like passive.

902
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah.

903
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,080
By just allowing you to have a defensive like option in the form of armor so that it's just

904
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,720
like, you know, if you like, like if you want to just be AFK, then get a fucking armor.

905
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Yeah.

906
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
Yeah.

907
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,720
That's, that's what I was thinking.

908
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,680
Cause like, yeah, it removed, like you still have to kind of be watched.

909
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,960
Like if someone wants to kill you through your armor, it's possible.

910
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,960
It's just, it just would be like, it would become so expensive, like so prohibitively

911
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,320
expensive that it's like, it wouldn't generally happen, but like it can.

912
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,360
I think you agree with this, let's go back to like, like the general design.

913
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:19,880
I want, my ideal server would be where like the main brute like, like, like brunt force

914
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:27,880
of the gang warfare is a verbal and shit talking that is punctuated by like frequent, but not

915
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
constant war.

916
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
You know what I'm saying?

917
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,000
Like, like a lot of, like a lot of shit talking and like when someone is mad, they can kill

918
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,960
you and people do get shot over these like scuffles.

919
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Yeah.

920
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,960
Yeah.

921
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Yeah.

922
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Yeah.

923
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:51,160
It's, it's, it's just hard to, I almost feel like a part of it is like cultural.

924
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,160
How do you mean?

925
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:59,920
Like, I feel like if we like instill what we want into the fans, they may do what we want.

926
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,920
If you know what I'm saying?

927
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,040
Obviously we should have the system itself be prohibitive and, and, and, you know, make

928
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,080
it so like, like what we want to have happen happens, but I almost feel like in a way,

929
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,960
they, like people feel incentivized to just constantly kill and I feel like they're like

930
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,360
there are ways that we could like just societally say to chill out possibly.

931
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,720
I'm not entirely sure, but I feel like we can do something.

932
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,600
Well, I don't know.

933
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,680
The thing is, I think the reason why people were incentivized to constantly kill was that

934
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,840
it was strategically valuable.

935
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,000
Like killing all the rowdies meant that like you got their slime and they could not like

936
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
kill you anymore.

937
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Okay.

938
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,320
Actually, actually wait, I had another idea.

939
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,800
I had, I had kind of forgotten about this, but I had thought that because right now you

940
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,920
can kill someone with more slime than you.

941
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,080
You can kill someone if you have about like 60, 55 to 60% of their slime.

942
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,120
I thought maybe combat would become like less lethal overall and like, you know, more of

943
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,960
a, more of like a threat than like if, if it was just harder to do, like it just maybe

944
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,840
you needed like, you know, 1.2 times their slime or something before you could kill them.

945
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:26,000
But then I mean, the problem there with that is that like the strongest person, well, okay,

946
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,840
that means like the strongest person is invincible, but also he can't really kill any, well, he

947
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,680
could kill small people all day and it wouldn't matter.

948
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,080
So that kind of sucks.

949
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,520
But if he killed anyone big, he would lose a bunch of slime and he would probably lose

950
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
his position.

951
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,520
I don't know.

952
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,560
It's a little imbalanced, but it might be overall better than what we've got.

953
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:53,840
Yeah, maybe I, I, I think one of the biggest things is that juvies, even though they have

954
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:58,560
new productions and are basically considered filled within our government system, they

955
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:05,040
like have the most to do, like, like mining is like a huge thing and they can do it constantly

956
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,560
and that's where all, that's like what the economy is like based upon.

957
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,560
Yeah.

958
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,360
Whereas like, gang fraction members like kind of don't really get to do anything.

959
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:20,960
Yeah, that's why, that's why I thought sparring would help and it kind of did a little.

960
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,320
I, I think, okay, I've not thought this through.

961
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,320
Yeah.

962
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:31,240
But I'm, I'm thinking because this will help the numbers system as well.

963
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,760
If once you enlist, you are enlisted like, you know, forever.

964
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,000
And once you die and you respond, you just are on whatever team you were on and then

965
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,040
allow the traction members to maybe not explicitly like mine, but do something to gather slime

966
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:54,360
so that, you know, you could still get slime whenever you respond.

967
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,600
We were talking about maybe making like a different, like, like a different room, like

968
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:05,160
a farm, like maybe, like maybe we change it so that faction members can mine, but Juvies

969
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,880
can farm and like farming works a little differently, but is overall like a more efficient way of

970
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,880
getting slime.

971
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,880
Yeah.

972
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,120
Oh yeah.

973
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,640
So it would be like, okay, I like that a lot because it gives, it gives like a reason to

974
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,640
be a Juvie.

975
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah.

976
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,440
I want there to be a reason to be a Juvie.

977
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,440
Wait, what?

978
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,040
It gives everyone a reason to be on whatever side that they are.

979
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,040
Yeah.

980
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
And that's important.

981
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,760
We're also talking about like, if there were items, like maybe Juvies could be, like maybe

982
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,000
Juvies would have to like make the items or something like that.

983
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Maybe something like that.

984
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,560
I like this.

985
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,920
I feel like I need to like watch the entirety of extra credits and then come back to this.

986
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Yeah.

987
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,040
You know?

988
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Yeah.

989
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,040
This is, this is not like pissy baby shit.

990
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,040
This is, this is like, I, like I, I want this to be good.

991
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,040
I want this to be real.

992
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,040
Same.

993
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,040
Same.

994
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:11,800
You're going to have to like, oh, what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to like

995
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,800
flail back and forth and like have your hammer, like just kind of like bang up against

996
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,640
both of those walls.

997
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,640
This fucking sucks.

998
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,640
I know.

999
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,640
Um, yeah.

1000
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,880
I watched, I, I looked up a video and I'm trying to, well I'm actually like not doing

1001
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
what he did.

1002
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Yeah.

1003
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
Yeah.

1004
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,880
You're not doing it at all.

1005
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Oof.

1006
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,880
Oof.

1007
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,880
Oof.

1008
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,880
Oof.

1009
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,880
Oof.

1010
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,880
Oof.

1011
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,880
When games were used.

1012
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
Yes.

1013
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
Oh!

1014
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
Fuck.

1015
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.

1016
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
This is the furthest I've ever gotten.

1017
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Save, save.

1018
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,880
Players played stoically.

1019
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
Oh.

1020
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
Now everyone's turned off by that.

1021
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,880
Oh my God.

1022
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,120
I know.

1023
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,120
That's not you.

1024
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
I know.

1025
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:02,640
This is the hardest thing I've ever done and also the least rewarding.

1026
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,640
I know.

1027
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,640
It like really sucks.

1028
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,720
There's no like, due to the fact that you can go, like you can just like die and go

1029
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
back to the beginning of the game.

1030
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,280
There's no like level, like you're entering level two or anything.

1031
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,280
Yeah.

1032
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,480
Like the only progress you make is that you like learn how to deal with the shit which

1033
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,680
you will inevitably have to deal with like many, many more times.

1034
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,480
It just braces you for more pain.

1035
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,480
Yeah.

1036
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,480
Okay.

1037
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,480
I know what I have to do here.

1038
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,120
It's just going to be really hard.

1039
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,240
I would actually be like probably like pretty like infuriated, like annoyed if I had to

1040
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,760
like listen to like, I'm assuming bullshit pretentious narrative.

1041
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,800
It's probably really annoying.

1042
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,240
It's not narrative.

1043
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:54,480
It's like Bennett Foddy talking about like game design and like, you know, like the power

1044
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,120
of like, you know, frustration as a motivator and stuff like that.

1045
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:06,240
I got up to go.

1046
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,800
That just makes me feel like, that just makes me feel like Dave, like Rose, what are you

1047
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
talking about?

1048
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
We don't, we're humans.

1049
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,800
We don't have character.

1050
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
That's what that feels like to me.

1051
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,960
Yeah, like, like the absence of a narrative is like a pretentious design choice in and

1052
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,960
of itself.

1053
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:28,120
No, I'm saying that like the fact that he's like talking about like the benefit as frustration

1054
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,240
as a motivator just makes it, I don't know, something, something about it doesn't feel

1055
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,240
right to me.

1056
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,800
Something about it just feels like I don't like it's self congratulatory.

1057
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Yeah.

1058
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Yeah.

1059
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Yeah.

1060
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,800
That's, that's exactly it.

1061
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,040
Like, like, like he's there extolling.

1062
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,640
Like he's here talking about why the thing his game is about is like a great thing.

1063
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Yeah, exactly.

1064
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Yeah.

1065
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,640
Exactly.

1066
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,360
And it's not only that, it's that compounded effect that it is frustration and generally

1067
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,680
considered a negative thing.

1068
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,680
So it's like, I've subverted like troops and here I have made a flood scheme that makes

1069
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,040
you feel terrible all the time.

1070
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Yeah.

1071
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
I mean, I don't know.

1072
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,040
I don't know.

1073
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:19,040
I kind of shout outs to Brady fuck wit or whatever his name is Borscht Mcmick Mcfowler.

1074
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,040
Incredible.

1075
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:27,040
I have a square in a way all endless war things we want to talk about.

1076
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,040
Oh, keep you updated.

1077
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,040
I mean, I mean, obviously join the server.

1078
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,040
Join.

1079
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
You'll get to see this in real time.

1080
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:40,040
Let me, let me make this, let me make this plea to the viewer, join the server and don't

1081
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,040
stay dead.

1082
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,280
The stay deads are a plague that are actually kind of like bumming me out.

1083
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,560
I mean, okay, I think they have a place in the lore and I don't mind that they exist,

1084
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:57,880
but I do mind the extent to which they have like kind of taken over.

1085
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
It's pretty lame.

1086
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,560
I mean, I guess it's my fault, you know, it's kind of our fault for like making, especially

1087
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,560
in the beginning, like in the beginning, it was so easy to die that people were like,

1088
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm just going to stay dead and like remove myself with a conflict.

1089
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,280
I get it.

1090
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,160
But it's, you know, it's a little different now and I hope the people will like give,

1091
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,080
give it a chance, you know, give war a chance is what I'm saying.

1092
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,320
I, okay.

1093
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:32,480
I like, in my ideal world, normal, normal people who just like graphic techlers would

1094
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:39,160
want to join routies or killers, then like the, the, the like funny memers who are, you

1095
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:45,000
know, assholes and fuck them want to be Juvies for like, for like the hipster reward, you

1096
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,200
know, satisfaction they get.

1097
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:53,200
And then like, like, like, like, like Juvies and gang fractions will all have like benefits

1098
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,280
to themselves and like will have, you know, reasons you would want to be on either side.

1099
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,200
And the stay deads are just like fucking like, like insane people who, and they have no benefits

1100
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,000
other than the fact of like gathering negative slime, which is just like a stupid, like,

1101
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,320
like bullshit, like hipster, hipster statistic that only retards care about.

1102
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,560
But due to the fact that like it is so stupid, there will be people, it will just be like,

1103
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,920
like five or six corpses who are just continually trying to get like the least amount of slime

1104
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
possible.

1105
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Yeah.

1106
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,960
Hmm.

1107
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,640
You know, yeah, we really, we really should not incentivize.

1108
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,960
We should not create like a, like a corpse power structure.

1109
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,080
Like corpses should have nothing to aspire to.

1110
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
Okay.

1111
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,080
That's true.

1112
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,400
That's, that's making me rethink some, so I was going to have, like I was going to have

1113
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,280
negative slime, like do something, but maybe I shouldn't.

1114
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1272
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:28,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1273
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:36,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1274
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:44,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1275
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:52,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1276
01:22:52,880 --> 01:23:00,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1277
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:08,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1278
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:16,880
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1279
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:23,880
no, no, no, no, no.

1280
01:23:46,880 --> 01:24:06,880
Okay.

1281
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:24,880
Yeah, I think I agree, but you know, I think I was kind of, I think, like, we were all

1282
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,880
really feeling kind of in a slump lately. I think we all kind of felt like distant and

1283
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:36,880
shitty and I think, I think at least some of us were counting on Radcon, like, you know,

1284
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,880
bringing us back together and like making us feel more like real friends again.

1285
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,880
I definitely did.

1286
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,880
Yeah, I do. I feel, it was great hanging out with you and Tom and everyone and, you know,

1287
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:56,880
that was pretty cool and I guess I didn't hang out much with like Hippo or Jesse. It was,

1288
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:02,880
it was good hanging out with Digi again. Also Nate, that piece of shit was there too, I guess.

1289
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,880
He was there.

1290
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,880
Yeah, but it was way fun and it reminded me that we're all human beings.

1291
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,880
How good was it to see Digi?

1292
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,880
It was great. I love Digi.

1293
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,880
I know. I do too.

1294
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,880
We were like tight when we lived together. We hung out like a bunch.

1295
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:30,880
You know, I, for a while there, for like a while there, like, like, for like a couple like months,

1296
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:35,880
proceeding Radcon 3, I forgot that I liked Digi, you know?

1297
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,880
Well, he hadn't really, he hadn't really been that active in the discord and like that was like,

1298
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,880
you know, that's like our main interaction with each other.

1299
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:47,880
So if someone's not really typing in the discord, it's like they're gone.

1300
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:54,880
And the only other thing that we could ascertain from Digi was the fact that he smoked weed a lot and all of his content was bad now.

1301
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,880
Yeah.

1302
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:00,880
And even though all of his content is still bad, I remembered that I like him a lot still.

1303
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,880
Yeah, yeah.

1304
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,880
He is to suffer.

1305
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,880
To survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.

1306
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
Anyway.

1307
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,880
Anyway.

1308
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:22,880
The PCP chat, I, I, this is so revolutionary for me because I don't feel like I'm not incentivized to like post and chat.

1309
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,880
Like I don't feel like it's weird to post in the PCP chat.

1310
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,880
Yeah.

1311
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:34,880
Like, like, I feel like I can just say a message if I want to say a message and like it won't be weird or like, or like I'm entering,

1312
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:42,880
or like I'm going over the top of the trenches and entering no man's land and I'm about to be berated with enemy missile fire from all directions.

1313
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:48,880
I, I have actually not been that active in the chat, but like I should be.

1314
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:57,880
So I haven't really, I haven't really seen that much of what you're talking about, but I have gotten the overall sense that things are like more cool and chill now.

1315
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,880
Yeah, it's great.

1316
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,880
Like everyone's talking more.

1317
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,880
Everyone's talking like way more.

1318
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,880
Yeah.

1319
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,880
And it is just an overall sense of like, yeah, we're friends again.

1320
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,880
Like, like we've done it.

1321
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:12,880
We've really done it.

1322
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,880
Well, it's kind of odd how easy, like, it's not like we did anything.

1323
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:26,880
Like, like, like the real friend initiative was like a concerted effort to make what has happened happen.

1324
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,880
But like for Radcon, like we didn't like really do anything.

1325
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,880
We just hung out.

1326
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,880
Yeah.

1327
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:34,880
Yeah.

1328
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,880
But you know, there's a lesson in that.

1329
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,880
You know, it's gotta, it's, you can't force it.

1330
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:45,880
But, well, but you kind of can't by having Radcon.

1331
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,880
Yeah, exactly.

1332
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,880
It was really nice.

1333
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,880
You know, you know what?

1334
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,880
I was upset that we didn't do among many things.

1335
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,880
We didn't do a PCP decompression chamber like we did a Radcon too.

1336
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:02,880
I was really hoping that we were going to do one of those.

1337
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,880
Oh my God.

1338
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,880
Because I wasn't even able to, I wasn't in the first one and I was cool.

1339
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,880
Oh fuck.

1340
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,880
Did you see that?

1341
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,880
I don't know if you saw that, but the way those stairs are shaped.

1342
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,880
Like, when you try and like, when you try and like pull yourself up by the hook of your hammer,

1343
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,880
the stair above like pushes back against the hammer and like knocks you off.

1344
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,880
So it's like not an option.

1345
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,880
That's devilish.

1346
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
That's devilishly designed.

1347
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,880
But frustration is so motivating.

1348
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,880
It doesn't make you just want to stop playing the game and get a refund on Steam.

1349
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,880
Or does it?

1350
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:45,880
Oh man, did you see, I tweeted a Steam review of this game.

1351
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,880
Like when I first got it, like a couple, like maybe a month.

1352
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,880
Did you see that?

1353
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,880
I didn't see it.

1354
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:57,880
It was like, it was just really funny because it was like clearly like a teen or a kid

1355
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:03,880
trying to be very eloquent in saying that he did not like the game,

1356
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,880
but just sounding ridiculous.

1357
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:08,880
Yeah.

1358
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:15,880
It was just like, I am not giving this a bad review because of, I'm not doing it justice.

1359
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:20,880
He like misused a bunch of long words or like semi misused a bunch of long words,

1360
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,880
trying to sound like like a perfectly logical being who is just like, you know, I don't know.

1361
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:34,880
Talking about how like I fail to, I have failed to receive a, you know, a supply of dopamine to my brain

1362
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,880
due to the highly, the overly, frustrational nature of this piece of digital media.

1363
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,880
And it was fucking sick, is what I'm saying.

1364
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,880
I'm scrolling through for it right now.

1365
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,880
Look at all those Biscopades.

1366
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,880
Have you made a fucking Tumblr yet?

1367
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:58,880
No, because I, I have been, I have, Biscopades is on hold.

1368
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,880
I got to finish Vapors 3 first.

1369
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,880
I forgot about Vapors 3 for like ever.

1370
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,880
And I love Biscopades and I want to do it, but I have to finish Vapors 3.

1371
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,880
It's like more, it's not more than that.

1372
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,880
It's like, you know, a lot of the way done.

1373
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:19,880
I can't be fucking sitting on all these unfinished product projects.

1374
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,880
Vapors 3 won't take me that long if I like really fucking hammer it, you know.

1375
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:31,880
So that's, well, actually, I got to do my fucking, I got to do fucking, my tail gets trolled lecture.

1376
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,880
And I got to do, I got to edit 10 paces, you know, 10 paces and draw.

1377
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,880
We might just, I might just have to be like, that's going to take a while.

1378
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,880
Like, I'm, okay.

1379
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,880
10 paces and draw might not be out for a while.

1380
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:47,880
But the draw, the draw cast and the, and the lecture.

1381
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,880
The draw has, doesn't have to happen because it's like a normal PCP thing.

1382
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,880
Wait, what?

1383
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,880
The draw cast has to happen because it's like, you know.

1384
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
Yeah, that, yeah.

1385
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:03,880
But like, okay, I'm missing footage and I want to like double check with everyone about like if they have the missing footage.

1386
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,880
But I kind of don't know.

1387
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,880
So I kind of don't think anyone has it.

1388
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,880
I think that probably it's just lost, which is sad, but whatever.

1389
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,880
Oh, found it by Nova post March 1st.

1390
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,880
You found what?

1391
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,880
I am not mad.

1392
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:29,880
I'm just not playing to proceed on attempting to release dopamine caused by the satisfaction of EG entertainment.

1393
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:41,880
Because this electronic software product only manages to cause emotional anger within the human brain due to its unnaturally advanced levels of frustration or design choices.

1394
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,880
This is made by an artificial intelligence.

1395
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,880
No, this is made by real emotional intelligence.

1396
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,880
I can't build.

1397
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,880
Because this electronic software product.

1398
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,880
Right?

1399
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,880
I love it.

1400
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,880
Couldn't just say fucking video.

1401
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,880
No dude, no.

1402
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,880
Like get, get, get real.

1403
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,880
Oh my god.

1404
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,880
Okay.

1405
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,880
I thought I was not going to be able to get out from that.

1406
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:24,880
I, I, I honest to God, I hope that no one like watches the Refikis Copulus because this is like, like visually this will be like the worst episode ever recorded.

1407
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,880
This shit is gripping dude.

1408
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

1409
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,880
This shit is unbelievably insufferable.

1410
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,880
This shit is horrible.

1411
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,880
It's, it's ugly on purpose.

1412
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,880
This game is shit.

1413
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:37,880
Fuck this game.

1414
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,880
Shit, this game is art.

1415
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,880
This game means something.

1416
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,880
This game has something to say about.

1417
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,880
It means something, what we don't know, but I guarantee you that it means something.

1418
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,880
Oh god.

1419
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,880
I'm watching with Badebreath right now.

1420
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,880
Ah shit.

1421
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,880
Christ.

1422
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:16,880
I feel like I would have better luck at doing what this guy's doing in real life than playing the game.

1423
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,880
Ah fuck me.

1424
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,880
My fucking hand on the mouse is sweaty.

1425
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,880
No, no, no.

1426
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:32,880
That's why this game is stream.

1427
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,880
Stream boys, yeah.

1428
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:35,880
That's a stream.

1429
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,880
Stream.

1430
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,880
Everyone jump in the stream.

1431
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,880
This is, why is this the game that we're playing fucking on video?

1432
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,880
It was, because it was suggested by our beautiful, by our beautiful fans.

1433
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,880
Also, because I owned it already and because I like it.

1434
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,880
The last part is suspect.

1435
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:06,880
Okay, okay.

1436
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:17,880
Ever since, Radcon 3, life, for my perspective, life has just been way better in all regards.

1437
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:18,880
Yeah.

1438
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,880
Like, like, Radcon 3 has just made everything great and perfect and there's been no problems, basically.

1439
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,880
Uh, yeah.

1440
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,880
Yeah, I agree.

1441
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:35,880
Radcon was great and things have been good and we're all, it does feel like we, it was just great to reconnect with everyone.

1442
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,880
And it just, I don't know.

1443
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,880
Yeah, you get it.

1444
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:49,880
And I, for like a while, I was like, I was just kind of like not, I just assumed that I was just going to do like a little bit after Radcon, like a rush of, you know,

1445
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:53,880
uh, everyone was talking because, you know, post-con depression and all that.

1446
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:57,880
But it's going, it's going like really steady for like the past like weeks.

1447
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,880
Like, like it's really, it's really like, it's really here to stay, I feel.

1448
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,880
It's really here to stay.

1449
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,880
Like, fucking, Nate's typing right goddamn now.

1450
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,880
Nate's typing right fucking now.

1451
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,880
That's crazy.

1452
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,880
That's crazy making right now.

1453
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,880
Okay, I'm gonna do it this time.

1454
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,880
I'm gonna do it.

1455
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,880
The chat's super active.

1456
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,880
People like DG.

1457
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,880
Dude.

1458
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,880
Anyway.

1459
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,880
This is awful.

1460
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,880
No, I'm gonna, I, when I hit that orange before, that was, that was further than I've ever been.

1461
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,880
I've never touched the orange before.

1462
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,880
How long is this game?

1463
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,880
Uh, I don't know.

1464
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:43,880
I want to say that I'm probably like, probably like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck?

1465
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,880
I've never grabbed this.

1466
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:45,880
Whoa.

1467
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:53,880
Can I like, oh, can I skip?

1468
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,880
No, no, I can't.

1469
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,880
Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest of these.

1470
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:06,880
I mean, I'll bet that someone who's really good at the game could do it, but I have like no confidence.

1471
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:07,880
No!

1472
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:08,880
Okay.

1473
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
That's it.

1474
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880
Didn't matter.

1475
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,880
I could have swung back to the other side.

1476
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,880
Andre Tachkopsky.

1477
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,880
What were you saying?

1478
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,880
Something about how Nate's talking in chat right now and how it's more active than it's ever been.

1479
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:32,880
Oh, and like DG, that elusive, that rare beetle of a man is like talking like regularly.

1480
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,880
Has he?

1481
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:42,880
Well, yeah, he's not the most active member, but like he, like, like I see DG not unreasonably often.

1482
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,880
Um, man, you know, I have, I have kind of not been that active.

1483
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:54,880
I should get more active because like, I remember how inactive it got for a period there.

1484
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,880
But if it's like more active, I should fucking hop in.

1485
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,880
You actually the most inactive member, and that is including Mage.

1486
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,880
Really?

1487
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,880
Yeah.

1488
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,880
Oh, well that's no good.

1489
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,880
I don't like, I don't like that at all.

1490
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,880
Yeah, Mage pops in.

1491
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,880
Like all, all the people who were like pretty inactive are like all like the same.

1492
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:27,880
Like, like, like, you know, it's no secret to all the fans that the PCP has become the me, Nate, Tom, and Hippo show, basically.

1493
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,880
Tom too?

1494
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,880
Yeah, Tom's on like every episode. You are too, actually.

1495
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,880
I've always been on like almost every episode.

1496
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:37,880
Yeah.

1497
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,880
I only mess them like very occasionally.

1498
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:45,880
Everyone's like on the, everyone's jolly. Everyone's on the same playing field.

1499
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:50,880
Everyone's about, like, like about the same level of activity.

1500
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:54,880
Some are a little bit more than others, but like everyone is friends with one another.

1501
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,880
Everyone is in the know.

1502
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
Everyone knows what the fuck's going on with one another.

1503
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,880
We're all in tune, we're all synced up, we're all gelled up.

1504
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:02,880
It's great.

1505
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:10,880
Oh, also like Victor is in the PCP chat for like, for like, for like Radcon planning stuff and like no one just bothered to kick him.

1506
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,880
So like, he hasn't said anything?

1507
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,880
No.

1508
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,880
Yeah, I didn't think so.

1509
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,880
Victor's just like there.

1510
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:17,880
Yeah, and that's fine.

1511
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,880
That's cool.

1512
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,880
Yeah.

1513
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,880
That's quite great.

1514
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:32,880
I felt, I felt weird like, like Victor, like, okay, like I like Victor, but like he didn't, he didn't, at Radcon, he wasn't there to like be a real person.

1515
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,880
Like, like all he did was like be ordered around, you know?

1516
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,880
Um, yeah.

1517
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,880
Which is like fine.

1518
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,880
Like, I don't know if I should feel that, wow, okay, that was a great jump.

1519
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:50,880
Like I felt kind of bad because I was like, man, we're kind of just like, we're kind of just like, just like kind of bossing him around.

1520
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,880
Like I know he's being paid, but like still, but I don't know.

1521
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,880
Maybe he just, maybe that was like what he wanted.

1522
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,880
Maybe he just kind of wanted to show up and like, you know, do his work and get out of there.

1523
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,880
He was sufficiently goofy.

1524
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:05,880
He was a bit goofy.

1525
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,880
He was really, he was very shirtless very much at the time and I'm not sure.

1526
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,880
Yeah.

1527
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,880
He would take his shirt off for no reason.

1528
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,880
He just was hot.

1529
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:16,880
He just was hot was his reason.

1530
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,880
Well, I mean, okay.

1531
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,880
Even when he was outside the fucking freezing time.

1532
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,880
Yeah.

1533
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:33,880
Oh, is there a single more iconic PCP moment than fucking the group piss?

1534
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:37,880
No, the group piss is a miracle.

1535
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,880
And part of me.

1536
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,880
That was all, that was all me by the way.

1537
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,880
That was all me.

1538
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,880
Wait, was it?

1539
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,880
Yeah.

1540
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:51,880
That was, that was when I was very adamant about there being a group piss because I wasn't a part of the group shit at Brony.

1541
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,880
Oh, that's right.

1542
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,880
That's right.

1543
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,880
The um, okay.

1544
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,880
You know, I'm of two minds about this.

1545
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:04,880
Part of me like wants to like digitally add in the other people.

1546
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,880
Which I could do.

1547
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:16,880
But the other part of me thinks that like the moment is pure and like to alter it or doctor it would be to, you know, to corrupt it.

1548
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,880
Bismarck.

1549
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,880
Yeah.

1550
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,880
I feel like it's fine right now.

1551
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:27,880
Eventually when that fabled PCP style guide comes out, then we can do something about it.

1552
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:32,880
But for right now, there's, there's no better, you know, it's a symbol of Radcon 3.

1553
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,880
It's a symbol of the PCP.

1554
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,880
It's iconic.

1555
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,880
Who, who could, who could deny its relevance?

1556
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,880
If I had.

1557
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:40,880
Who could deny?

1558
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:47,880
If I, I mean, if I had a picture like from behind of, you know, say, you know, Jesse, Mage, and uh,

1559
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:48,880
D'Avoo.

1560
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,880
And D'Avoo.

1561
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,880
I could, I could put them in.

1562
01:40:52,880 --> 01:41:00,880
And it would look cool because I would like it with more, you know what the reason why I think about that is just because I would like it to have more colors.

1563
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,880
Yeah, I agree.

1564
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:04,880
Ugh.

1565
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:09,880
I, I, I think I'm sure you're the same way because we're both artists.

1566
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:16,880
But like, to me, it's like weirdly imperative that every PCP member has like color associated.

1567
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,880
I was just thinking about that.

1568
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:25,880
And what endlessly frustrates me is that some of us do have like a strong color association and others do not.

1569
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:26,880
I know.

1570
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,880
Tom, Tom and Digi are like malleable and I hate that.

1571
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:45,880
To me, it's always, because I, when, when like, like doing like various prototype versions of like PCP design things I want to, it always comes out.

1572
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:52,880
Like, if I go with my gut and just do what, like, I imagine everyone adds, there's always way too many greens and blues.

1573
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,880
There's too many, no, there's too many like purples.

1574
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,880
Well, there's too many like cool colors.

1575
01:41:58,880 --> 01:41:59,880
I guess I can brown that too.

1576
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,880
There's too many cool colors.

1577
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:01,880
Yeah.

1578
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:02,880
Because.

1579
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:03,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1580
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:04,880
Yeah.

1581
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,880
Like hippo, like hippo and divu.

1582
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,880
And they hippo and divu and they are too close to each other.

1583
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:11,880
Exactly.

1584
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,880
Those are the exact three that I was thinking about.

1585
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:13,880
Yeah.

1586
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,880
There's that.

1587
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,880
Also, like, there's a whole, okay, like you and, all right.

1588
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,880
Well, first of all, oh no.

1589
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,880
Oh my God.

1590
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,880
Oh my God.

1591
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:26,880
Oh my God.

1592
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:27,880
Lol.

1593
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,880
That's fucking epic.

1594
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,880
That's so fucking funny.

1595
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:32,880
All the way back.

1596
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
Okay, whatever.

1597
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:42,880
You, all right, so Tom, I have generally settled on depicting Tom as red.

1598
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,880
Yes, I completely did.

1599
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:53,880
Although, okay, you know, Jade's like alignment chart that she did, which is fucking sick and I love it the most.

1600
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:54,880
Pretty good.

1601
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,880
But it made Digi red and Tom blue.

1602
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:06,880
And, like, I used to make Tom blue, but I stopped at some point because there were too many blues and because his new icon was red.

1603
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,880
And I was like, okay, he doesn't need to be blue anymore.

1604
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,880
And, like, frankly, he's only blue because his pony used to be blue.

1605
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:14,880
And that's, like, not relevant.

1606
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,880
Well, no, I guess his channel icon was blue for a while, but it's red now and that's what matters.

1607
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:20,880
Plus, like, the Rebel Pixels thing.

1608
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:21,880
Anyway.

1609
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:22,880
Yes.

1610
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:29,880
So Tom, so Tom used to be blue and sometimes he still gets depicted as blue, but generally I think he should be red now.

1611
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,880
Which generally leaves me, okay.

1612
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:44,880
So there's this kind of muddy space because I generally make Digi purple, but, like, Mage is purple.

1613
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,880
But Mage is kind of like a pinkish purple, but you're pink.

1614
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:54,880
So I kind of settle on, like, a spectrum of, like, you are, like, bright pale fluorescent pink.

1615
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,880
Mage is, like, Mage is kind of, like, a pinkish, a slightly pink violet.

1616
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,880
Digi is, like, an indigo.

1617
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,880
And then, yeah.

1618
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,880
But, like, it's crowded.

1619
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:06,880
It's crowded.

1620
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:07,880
It's super crowded.

1621
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:17,880
Because there's not a whole, like, like, only, like, only really Tom and Jesse are, like, warm colors with, like, red and yellow.

1622
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:22,880
And, like, the greens kind of get there, but, like, not enough.

1623
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:29,880
Like, like, we're pretty much, we're really on one side of, like, the color wheel.

1624
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,880
We're really on one side.

1625
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:38,880
And, like, it's hard because, like, I think the way to go is to make Digi a magenta.

1626
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:42,880
I think that because his avatar was, like, a magenta.

1627
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:46,880
But she's, like, I'm saying make her, like, a deep purple.

1628
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,880
Okay.

1629
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:55,880
I would, but, like, she, like, specifically asked me, like, to make her, like, pinker.

1630
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:56,880
I don't know.

1631
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,880
She's really picky about colors.

1632
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:06,880
And she told me that, like, she didn't like the colors of her old OC, which were, like, kind of, like, a more indigo.

1633
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,880
And she was, like, this is me now.

1634
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:13,880
And, you know, was, like, you know, used this, like, pinker version with the horns.

1635
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:15,880
You know what?

1636
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:23,880
I think, I think the only thing to do is just to pick a set of, like, nine colors.

1637
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,880
And we just have to be, like, conservative and strict.

1638
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,880
Like, like, like, like, nine base colors.

1639
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,880
We just have to assign them to people.

1640
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,880
Um.

1641
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,880
Hmm.

1642
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,880
Yeah.

1643
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,880
You're opening it right now.

1644
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:40,880
Yeah.

1645
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,880
Yeah.

1646
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,880
Okay.

1647
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,880
Let me, let me just, like, eyeball what I think it is.

1648
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,880
Okay.

1649
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,880
I think we should start with, like, the things that, like, are obvious.

1650
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,880
Okay.

1651
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,880
Nate is obviously a nice, vibrant green.

1652
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:54,880
Yeah.

1653
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:55,880
Obvious.

1654
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,880
You know, Nate, you, I think, Nate, you could argue.

1655
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,880
And, like, a green, green.

1656
01:45:58,880 --> 01:45:59,880
Not, like, a yellow green.

1657
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:00,880
Like, like, a green.

1658
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:01,880
You think so?

1659
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,880
I think he's kind of, like, a lime green.

1660
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:04,880
Oh, well, yeah.

1661
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:05,880
Like, like, that is perfect.

1662
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,880
Yeah.

1663
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,880
Okay.

1664
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:08,880
Okay.

1665
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,880
So, like, um, so that's Nate.

1666
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,880
Tom.

1667
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,880
Is this being recorded, by the way?

1668
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:15,880
What?

1669
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,880
Is this being recorded?

1670
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,880
Like, like, can they see the screen?

1671
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,880
Um.

1672
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,880
You know, let me, let me check.

1673
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:22,880
Yes.

1674
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,880
Oh, although, wait, hold on.

1675
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,880
The color correction is making that green black.

1676
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,880
Um.

1677
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,880
Let me, hold on.

1678
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,880
I'm going to turn the color correction off.

1679
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,880
Uh.

1680
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:40,880
Well.

1681
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,880
Okay.

1682
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,880
This is fucking bullshit.

1683
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:44,880
Um.

1684
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,880
Okay.

1685
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,880
Window capture, uh, properties.

1686
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:54,880
I'm going to capture, uh, uh, capture getting over it.

1687
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:55,880
Okay.

1688
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,880
I'll put that up on top.

1689
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,880
There we go.

1690
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:02,880
All right.

1691
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:03,880
So.

1692
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:07,880
Uh, you, you are obviously black or white.

1693
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,880
I'm, yeah.

1694
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:10,880
Black or white.

1695
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,880
I can see you being either.

1696
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:19,880
Like, I think, I think what we should do is, depending on, like, the saturation and values of the other ones, we decide if you're white or black.

1697
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,880
Okay.

1698
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,880
So, Tom, I think is maybe a little more on, like, the orange end of red.

1699
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,880
Like a blood orange.

1700
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:29,880
Like that, I guess.

1701
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,880
Um.

1702
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:37,880
I, I think he needs to be easily identifiable as red because, because, you know, the rebel pixel and he's a communist.

1703
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,880
Yeah.

1704
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,880
Okay.

1705
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:41,880
Sure.

1706
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,880
And then Jesse is just like yellow.

1707
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,880
Yellow.

1708
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:46,880
Yeah.

1709
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,880
Maybe, maybe a little bit lighter than that.

1710
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,880
Like.

1711
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:51,880
There.

1712
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Okay.

1713
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,880
And you.

1714
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,880
Davoo is sky blue.

1715
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,880
Davoo is, yeah.

1716
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:56,880
Davoo is sky blue.

1717
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,880
Davoo is like light sky blue.

1718
01:47:58,880 --> 01:47:59,880
Yeah.

1719
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:00,880
Yes.

1720
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:01,880
Yes.

1721
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,880
Okay.

1722
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,880
There.

1723
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:14,880
And then you are, like, like, maybe a little redder, but like that.

1724
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:15,880
I don't know.

1725
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:20,880
The fact that it's on a white background is kind of, I don't know.

1726
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,880
I usually make you like a light pink.

1727
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,880
Yeah.

1728
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:25,880
You know.

1729
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:33,880
I, I usually put myself as more of like a harsh magenta-y, but like this, like for the purposes of this.

1730
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:34,880
Yeah.

1731
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,880
Like, yeah.

1732
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:39,880
Yeah.

1733
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:43,880
I mean, this is more, I don't know.

1734
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:48,880
I may, I generally make you light to like kind of differentiate you from mage.

1735
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,880
Yeah.

1736
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:53,880
That's understandable.

1737
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,880
Okay.

1738
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:59,880
So right away I'm seeing the problem that like Tom's, what's the word?

1739
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:00,880
Not saturation.

1740
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,880
Value?

1741
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:02,880
Yeah.

1742
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,880
Tom's value is like way too high.

1743
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:11,880
I actually, I did kind of lighten his red on the group piss just to even it out.

1744
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:12,880
Yeah.

1745
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,880
I'm looking at it right now.

1746
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:14,880
Yeah.

1747
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:21,880
I actually, actually like, I kind of feel like we, like it's not that Tom's is too high.

1748
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,880
Because ours is too low possibly.

1749
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
Uh, yeah.

1750
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:27,880
Maybe.

1751
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,880
All right.

1752
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,880
Yeah.

1753
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:36,880
I'm, I'm, I'm just black or, I'm black or white depending on whichever one like shows up better.

1754
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,880
Yeah.

1755
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:38,880
Okay.

1756
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:39,880
So what do we got?

1757
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,880
And then we got hippo, who is?

1758
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:42,880
Yeah.

1759
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:43,880
It's, it's hard.

1760
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:44,880
Yeah.

1761
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,880
Something like that.

1762
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:51,880
Like he's always going to look either too much like Davoo or too much like Nate.

1763
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,880
Yeah.

1764
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,880
Like what you have there is like the best you can do.

1765
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,880
And like his logo is blue.

1766
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:00,880
Yeah.

1767
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,880
It's, you know, this is the color, like this, this color is kind of just like grandfathered

1768
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,880
in because it was his pony's color.

1769
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,880
Kind of like Tom and like the reason I used to depict him as blue.

1770
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,880
Um, but like it's not like this is like still his iconography.

1771
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,880
Like I think it is his favorite color.

1772
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:21,880
But other than that, it's not like relevant.

1773
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:24,880
You know, I

1774
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,880
I

1775
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,880
It was still to look a lot like Davoo.

1776
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:29,880
Okay.

1777
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:34,880
Try and do a little bit darker of a blue, but like keep, like keep it like still like

1778
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,880
a light blue, but just of a more like, like, like farther on the color wheel.

1779
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,880
Like further into the blue.

1780
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:42,880
Yeah.

1781
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,880
I don't know if that's really any better.

1782
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,880
Yeah.

1783
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:00,880
Okay.

1784
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,880
I'm just going to leave it as that and come back to it.

1785
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,880
So mage is like this.

1786
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:10,880
Yeah.

1787
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:16,880
And then generally for Digi, I do like this.

1788
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,880
I could go a little blue.

1789
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,880
I feel like I feel like Digi is the problem.

1790
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,880
Digi is a problem for this exercise.

1791
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:37,880
I feel like Digi has like it's it's a real fucking problem, but it's undeniable that

1792
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:41,880
due to recent events, he totally is like a magenta guy now.

1793
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,880
What do you mean due to recent events?

1794
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:48,880
Due to the fact that like there was the whole meme like magenta filter over the blog and

1795
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,880
like his, his like icon is totally magenta now in retaliation.

1796
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,880
His icon.

1797
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,880
That was a huge, huge, whole big.

1798
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,880
I made his old icon and his old icon actually was it had like the magenta line work.

1799
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,880
I'm like the yellow background.

1800
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,880
Yeah.

1801
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:04,880
Well, I mean, mage is magenta.

1802
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,880
What if I am changed to something else?

1803
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:16,880
I don't know what I got.

1804
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,880
Yeah.

1805
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:20,880
Maybe I'm like, I'm not comfortable doing that.

1806
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:29,880
I just got to say I'm very, it makes me very happy that I'm the black and white guy.

1807
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:30,880
Yeah.

1808
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:31,880
Yeah.

1809
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:36,880
I love, I love, I love that in any array of colors, I am either black or white.

1810
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,880
That's like so cool and I'm just so gratified by it.

1811
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,880
It's, it's really sorry now mage.

1812
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:46,880
Okay.

1813
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:47,880
Okay.

1814
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,880
It's, it's all three of the guys at the end, the problem.

1815
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,880
I, I, well, okay.

1816
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:55,880
Tom's value is bugging me, but other than that, it's fine.

1817
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:02,880
Also, let me, your, your pink is not doing anything for me.

1818
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:03,880
It's like,

1819
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,880
I think it's too flaccid.

1820
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,880
Yeah.

1821
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,880
That's what she said.

1822
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,880
Well, of course.

1823
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,880
I didn't even feel the need to say that because of course she would say that.

1824
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:15,880
Yeah.

1825
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,880
I like that more.

1826
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:20,880
These are like, I feel like these are like dull.

1827
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,880
Like I'm using like fully saturated colors, but they feel, they feel dull to me.

1828
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,880
Here, here, I'm going to do it.

1829
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,880
I'm going to fucking do it.

1830
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,880
But we can't see you.

1831
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,880
That's true.

1832
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:34,880
Here.

1833
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,880
Um, here, here.

1834
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:42,880
Well, I'll just like open up paint and then I will tell you what I, what I'm thinking

1835
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:49,880
about because, because I want to like, okay, here's, here's what I'm going to do.

1836
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:56,880
I'm going to like get like, I really feel like the only way to do this is to just be

1837
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,880
cruel and give people colors that like aren't perfectly them.

1838
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,880
Like, like, like, like we have to like figure out.

1839
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:09,880
We have to get the rainbow and then assign colors based first, like, like who identifies

1840
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:15,880
with the colors the strongest and the people who don't identify with like a color that strongly

1841
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:17,880
will just have to take the hit.

1842
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,880
I don't know.

1843
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:19,880
Like Burgers.

1844
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:22,880
Like some of the problem, like, I mean, this whole problem has arisen because there are

1845
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:27,880
some pretty strong color associations for some of like the, like for some, for some of

1846
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:33,880
the very close together guys, like Hippo and Nate are like pretty strongly in their color

1847
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,880
aspect.

1848
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:40,880
But like, what do we do about that?

1849
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,880
Like, I don't feel comfortable changing either of them.

1850
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:51,880
What, what have you made?

1851
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,880
I really like Nate's.

1852
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:54,880
Nate's I feel is.

1853
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,880
This actually looks really good.

1854
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,880
So suddenly I like this a lot more.

1855
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,880
Are you, are you seeing this?

1856
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,880
I don't like, I'm seeing it.

1857
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:04,880
I don't like it.

1858
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,880
Digi's.

1859
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,880
I don't like Digi's.

1860
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:12,880
I feel like, okay, I don't like Digi's and I feel like the contrast between Nate, Hippo

1861
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,880
and Davos is not strong enough.

1862
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,880
But otherwise I do like it.

1863
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,880
I could make.

1864
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,880
Hmm.

1865
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,880
Okay.

1866
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:23,880
Well here, I'm going to make like, I'm going to make like a secondary like set that like

1867
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:30,880
nudges the values a little bit.

1868
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,880
All right.

1869
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,880
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to make one as well.

1870
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:38,880
Okay.

1871
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,880
Okay.

1872
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,880
I'm going to, okay.

1873
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:49,880
Nate has to be like a vibrant, a vibrant green, a vibrant like lime green.

1874
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:52,880
He has to look, he has to look like how Sprite tastes.

1875
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:53,880
Yeah.

1876
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:58,880
He's got to be that gamer Mountain Dew.

1877
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,880
Okay.

1878
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:07,880
This is, this is highly experimental.

1879
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,880
Yeah.

1880
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,880
We just have to like start out with like what we know people are like, we know Jesse is

1881
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:14,880
yellow.

1882
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,880
We know Nate is lime green.

1883
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,880
I did that by the way.

1884
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,880
I made him lime green.

1885
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,880
I know.

1886
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,880
Well that's that because you drew his banner.

1887
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:26,880
Yeah.

1888
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:29,880
Yeah.

1889
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:45,880
I feel like you should lower some of the values for these to differentiate them.

1890
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,880
You mean make them possibly make them lighter or darker?

1891
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:48,880
No, darker.

1892
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:49,880
Yeah.

1893
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:58,880
But I don't know on which, because try with hippos, though it might be a little bit.

1894
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:05,880
No, when I say, when I say lower the value, I mean like a, like, like move the like point

1895
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,880
downward, like, like, like in the box.

1896
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:08,880
Yeah.

1897
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:09,880
Yeah.

1898
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:10,880
Yeah.

1899
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:11,880
I know.

1900
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:12,880
On hippos?

1901
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,880
It runs the risk of dulling it, but all right.

1902
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:17,880
I like that for DeVoo.

1903
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:18,880
I like, okay, okay.

1904
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,880
That for DeVoo is nice because it still is like a light blue.

1905
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,880
Yeah.

1906
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:26,880
But like, it differentiates them from hippo more.

1907
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:27,880
Okay.

1908
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:34,880
So hippos, I don't think, I think that's worse.

1909
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:44,880
Maybe we should give them like a terezi, like a lighter terezi teal.

1910
01:57:44,880 --> 01:58:04,880
I don't dislike that.

1911
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:13,880
I don't think I like it.

1912
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:21,880
No, I feel like going darker is not.

1913
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:26,880
Try making it a little bit more blue, just a smidge.

1914
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,880
But still lighter.

1915
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,880
That's fine.

1916
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,880
Just try that right now.

1917
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:35,880
They're like is pretty terezi.

1918
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,880
Yeah.

1919
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:53,880
Maybe this could stand to be just a little, actually this might work.

1920
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,880
Try making them go lighter.

1921
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:56,880
I did.

1922
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:04,880
Because both DeVoo and Nate are like vibrant.

1923
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,880
Try making Nate a little bit more green and more saturated.

1924
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,880
Nate is as saturated as he could possibly be.

1925
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,880
Oh, he totally is.

1926
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:22,880
I mean, I made him a little, I made Nate a little yellower to kind of like make room for hippo.

1927
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,880
Oh, okay.

1928
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:24,880
This is good.

1929
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:25,880
This is good.

1930
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:32,880
You know, making hippo lighter there actually, it makes sense and it works and it kind of.

1931
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:37,880
Maybe his hippo is like a quieter boy, so he shouldn't be as vibrant slash loud as you know, Nate.

1932
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:38,880
Maybe.

1933
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,880
Yeah, he's a little, it's a mellow color.

1934
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:46,880
I feel like me and Mage are like fine.

1935
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:51,880
Like all these can be twerked.

1936
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:53,880
They can be twerked.

1937
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:54,880
Yeah.

1938
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:00,880
All these like will be, like these will not be like the final, you know, rule from now on.

1939
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,880
But like, these are a good starting point.

1940
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:07,880
Like, like, like, like, like that's, that's fine for Mage and that's fine for me.

1941
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:09,880
But Digi.

1942
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,880
I really don't like Digi.

1943
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:12,880
It's um, no.

1944
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:13,880
In general.

1945
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:19,880
I've never, I've never been happy with Digi's color designation.

1946
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:22,880
He doesn't really have a strong one.

1947
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,880
It's magenta, dude.

1948
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,880
I don't like it.

1949
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,880
Oh, I'm too purple in that.

1950
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:32,880
Too purple?

1951
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,880
I think you're too light.

1952
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,880
Yeah, too light too.

1953
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,880
There we go.

1954
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:41,880
You like that?

1955
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,880
I was thinking maybe a little lighter.

1956
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:47,880
I think Mage is too dark.

1957
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:48,880
That's fine.

1958
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,880
Too intense.

1959
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:55,880
Like, look at the contrast between you and Mage and value right there.

1960
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:56,880
I do.

1961
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:57,880
Okay.

1962
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:04,880
I know Mage wants to be perceived as like, like, like, you know, a little bit more pastel.

1963
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:06,880
But like, isn't her whole thing that she's like a demon?

1964
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,880
Like, when dark makes sense?

1965
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,880
I, I don't even know anymore.

1966
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:15,880
I don't know what Mage's the deal is.

1967
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,880
Um, okay.

1968
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:23,880
You know, I actually kind of like, I mean, I think she, I think that works.

1969
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,880
And I think that's like a pretty decent like distance.

1970
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,880
I actually like that better.

1971
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,880
Okay.

1972
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,880
I think it works better with the whole.

1973
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:41,880
Let's give Digi a really, put Digi in between me and Tom and make him really vibrant is,

1974
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:42,880
is what I would.

1975
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,880
In between you and Tom?

1976
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:45,880
Yeah.

1977
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:46,880
Yeah.

1978
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,880
Oh, okay.

1979
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:48,880
Okay.

1980
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,880
Well,

1981
02:01:53,880 --> 02:02:15,880
Uh, wait, where did I, I guess I'll just stay on the end here.

1982
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:19,880
Between you and Tom.

1983
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,880
Uh, all right.

1984
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:28,880
So that would be like, that way you can be magenta.

1985
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,880
Like that.

1986
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:32,880
Yeah.

1987
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,880
Like that.

1988
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:40,880
Although I don't know if that's, I feel like that's in the right direction.

1989
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:41,880
Okay.

1990
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:44,880
So like Digi is like a bright, like chart, not chartreuse.

1991
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:45,880
Yeah.

1992
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:46,880
Okay.

1993
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:50,880
You know, it kind of like a, like a bright magenta color like that.

1994
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:51,880
Yeah.

1995
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:52,880
Like that.

1996
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:55,880
I mean, that's pretty close to you though.

1997
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:59,880
I feel, I feel like go back to what he was before.

1998
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:02,880
Like this.

1999
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,880
Maybe a little bit lighter, but like, yeah, something like that.

2000
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:06,880
Yeah.

2001
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,880
That way you cannot mistake him for me.

2002
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:18,880
Yeah.

2003
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:19,880
I don't know.

2004
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:22,880
You're both still like, you're both still like definitively pink.

2005
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,880
You know, and that bugs me.

2006
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:31,880
Well, then again, I mean, the only way to fit him in here would be to have like, the only

2007
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:36,880
way to fit him in as like a distinct color word would be like here he was indigo, which

2008
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:37,880
is fine.

2009
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:42,880
And then like, it could maybe, it could make him orange, but like, no.

2010
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,880
No.

2011
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:54,880
This is around the color that, that he was in your avatar for him.

2012
02:03:54,880 --> 02:04:04,880
It's kind of, he was a little purple, purple.

2013
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,880
That's way too close to you.

2014
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:07,880
Yeah.

2015
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,880
Yeah.

2016
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,880
I'm going to, I'm going to fuck with you.

2017
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:12,880
Okay.

2018
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:23,880
I'm going to make you, well, if you're more like that.

2019
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:28,880
I'm getting close to Mage there.

2020
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,880
Yeah.

2021
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:34,880
Well, maybe Mage can be a little bluer.

2022
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,880
Will she like that?

2023
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,880
That's like barely even a perceptible difference.

2024
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,880
Whatever you say.

2025
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,880
She sees all.

2026
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,880
Yeah, maybe.

2027
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:56,880
I don't, your pink just seems so dull to me.

2028
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:01,880
Well, it's because you're basing off the Kirby shirt, which is dull.

2029
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:03,880
No, no, it's not that.

2030
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:06,880
It's that I'm like fully saturated pink.

2031
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:12,880
And yeah, I know I'm making it light, but like, it just feels dull.

2032
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:17,880
It just feels, I don't know, I don't know how to make it brighter.

2033
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,880
No.

2034
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:22,880
No, I feel, moving it closer to the white is the problem.

2035
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:32,880
I think you have to move, make it more to the right there.

2036
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:33,880
A little lighter.

2037
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:38,880
Like that.

2038
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:39,880
Okay.

2039
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:40,880
And then.

2040
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,880
That's personally where I would identify myself.

2041
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:43,880
Okay.

2042
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:44,880
Well, that works.

2043
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:45,880
Around there.

2044
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:50,880
I'm going to make Tom a little yellower.

2045
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,880
You run the risk of losing that like red.

2046
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,880
Yeah, he's definitely definitively like orange now.

2047
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:25,880
Yeah.

2048
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:29,880
Because saturation is a problem for me.

2049
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:33,880
This is like, okay, this is actually not, I'm not making it any more yellow.

2050
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:37,880
I'm just lightening it a little bit.

2051
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:41,880
I'll actually make it a little more red, but a little lighter too.

2052
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:42,880
Yeah.

2053
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:43,880
I would make him red.

2054
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:44,880
Like red.

2055
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,880
That is like solidly red.

2056
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,880
Just lighten slightly.

2057
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,880
Then, okay, between you and him.

2058
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,880
Okay, there is some wiggle room there.

2059
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:03,880
I feel like what we had before for Digi was like peak Digi.

2060
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:07,880
Like that was good.

2061
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:13,880
I like that, but now he feels too close to Tom.

2062
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:23,880
I can make him a little pinker.

2063
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,880
I mean, that's like magenta.

2064
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:29,880
I mean, would you describe that as a magenta?

2065
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:34,880
I would describe that as hot pink.

2066
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,880
Oh, god damn it.

2067
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:39,880
Mother fuck.

2068
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:42,880
What the fuck?

2069
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:43,880
This is killing me.

2070
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:45,880
Try to lower the value of that.

2071
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:48,880
Try to make it a little bit darker.

2072
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,880
Darker, huh?

2073
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,880
Should I keep it fully saturated?

2074
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:59,880
Around there.

2075
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:03,880
You know, I don't hate that.

2076
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:06,880
I don't hate that one bit.

2077
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:10,880
Although now he's the only one who's not like as bright as can be.

2078
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,880
Well, unless you count me.

2079
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:17,880
Well, I don't think they should all be as bright as they could be in any case.

2080
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,880
I don't know.

2081
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:24,880
You know, that is distinct, but it's a little weird.

2082
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:29,880
Okay, it depends on how we want to calculate the style guide.

2083
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:35,880
Do we want this to be like every person has like a clear base color

2084
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:40,880
and then from that base color color them like as you see fit

2085
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,880
like around the general idea of each color.

2086
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,880
You know what I'm saying?

2087
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,880
Like do we just want to have them be as bright as they can be?

2088
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:53,880
So it's just easily identifiable like, okay, it is this color.

2089
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:55,880
So you can make it a little bit darker for shading.

2090
02:08:55,880 --> 02:09:00,880
I mean, that makes sense to me.

2091
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,880
Yeah.

2092
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:08,880
So that is that like, if you don't want to just have your like shading just be the color but black,

2093
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:11,880
which is terrible and bad and you shouldn't do that,

2094
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:14,880
then a lot of these will like kind of blend into one another.

2095
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:15,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

2096
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:18,880
Like this is like a baseline.

2097
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,880
Yeah.

2098
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:25,880
Hmm.

2099
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,880
I...

2100
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:29,880
Okay, like what?

2101
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:30,880
I mean, is Digi...

2102
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,880
I mean, Digi is now like kind of a maroon.

2103
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:42,880
Hmm.

2104
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:48,880
I think that like design wise,

2105
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:49,880
these are just...

2106
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:51,880
He's really close to Tom.

2107
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,880
God fuck.

2108
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:55,880
I'm gonna make him a little purplier.

2109
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:12,880
I feel like we're hot.

2110
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,880
I feel like this is...

2111
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:20,880
When you tinker with it, I feel like this is around the color that Digi should be.

2112
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,880
Yeah.

2113
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,880
Yeah.

2114
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:25,880
I don't...

2115
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:30,880
I feel like Tom is too orange.

2116
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:34,880
Well, I made Tom a little orangeer because if he...

2117
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:37,880
If Tom is like red red,

2118
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,880
then there's just...

2119
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:41,880
Then that's crowding in on the Digi space.

2120
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:43,880
All right, here.

2121
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:44,880
I'll make him...

2122
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,880
All right, I'll just fucking fully saturate him.

2123
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,880
What the fuck is this shit?

2124
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,880
Okay.

2125
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:57,880
Hmm.

2126
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:58,880
Hold on.

2127
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:03,880
You know, maybe I'll feel better about this if I just like...

2128
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:12,880
That.

2129
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:15,880
I feel better about this already.

2130
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:20,880
Yeah.

2131
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,880
You know, yeah.

2132
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:25,880
I do like this.

2133
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:33,880
Let me see.

2134
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:34,880
Now for me.

2135
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:35,880
You know what?

2136
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:49,880
You are the one that stands out as like the most weird.

2137
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,880
Try using my color from the top one.

2138
02:11:54,880 --> 02:12:00,880
First, I'm going to try making you a little bit like pink-purple-er.

2139
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:03,880
That's better.

2140
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,880
Okay, that's more distinctive.

2141
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,880
That was more munchy.

2142
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:10,880
Hmm.

2143
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,880
Maybe not.

2144
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:16,880
I don't disagree that we have to work what we're given, though.

2145
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:21,880
And we do kind of have to smudge a lot of this to fit in line with what we're given.

2146
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:25,880
This one from the top is a little too red for me.

2147
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:27,880
Yeah.

2148
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:29,880
But this one is a little too purple.

2149
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:40,880
God, no.

2150
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:46,880
Could you try lowering the value of and darkening Tom?

2151
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:50,880
Darkening Tom, okay.

2152
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:58,880
Just so that he's a little different from Digi.

2153
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:01,880
That could be worse, though.

2154
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:09,880
Hmm.

2155
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:12,880
Eh.

2156
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:13,880
Not crazy, though.

2157
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:16,880
Not me either.

2158
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,880
Also, he would be, yeah.

2159
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:24,880
Something that would, it would bother me about that is that he would be the only one who's not fully saturated.

2160
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:30,880
Like the idea that one of them is dulled when the others aren't like bugs me.

2161
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:32,880
Yeah.

2162
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,880
You know what?

2163
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:39,880
You and Tom are both known for black and white comics.

2164
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:45,880
What if, like, you are black and he's white or something?

2165
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:47,880
That's not bad.

2166
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:55,880
The only thing is, though, that like red, like red is like a color that is like calling out to be filled.

2167
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:58,880
And like, I don't think Digi should be red.

2168
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:03,880
But someone has to, and I think Tom is a solid choice for it.

2169
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:07,880
I do, I agree.

2170
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:09,880
I mean, he's the record pixel.

2171
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:10,880
Yeah.

2172
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:13,880
Although, I mean, well, okay.

2173
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:22,880
I don't think one can be white and one can be black because like one doesn't necessarily always work when the other would.

2174
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,880
Mm-hmm.

2175
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:27,880
Well, okay.

2176
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:28,880
Think about it like this.

2177
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:33,880
We have Jesse's yellow, which is like a nice, proper yellow.

2178
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:37,880
But like, what if we had like a nice, like, brown, like, piss yellow?

2179
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,880
Like a real like piss yellow.

2180
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:40,880
Gross.

2181
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:41,880
Gross.

2182
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:42,880
A yellow that just like-

2183
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:47,880
Yeah, like the color of piss, like really dark brown and like a little bloody.

2184
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,880
Yeah, yeah, like a little bloody.

2185
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:51,880
You can see some spots in there, you know.

2186
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:52,880
Some molds.

2187
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:53,880
You look really close.

2188
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:57,880
You can see yourself squirm around in it, you know, stuff like that.

2189
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,880
It just like, it just screams urine at you.

2190
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,880
That's what I'm thinking about right now.

2191
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:03,880
Interesting.

2192
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,880
I like where your head's at.

2193
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:06,880
Mm-hmm.

2194
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:10,880
Uh, tell you what, I'm gonna save this.

2195
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:13,880
I wanna get back to Bennett Foddy for a little bit.

2196
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:15,880
What do you think?

2197
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:17,880
I think it's pretty good.

2198
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:19,880
I think we can sleep on this.

2199
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:20,880
Viewer's way in.

2200
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:23,880
What do you think?

2201
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:24,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2202
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,880
Yeah, this is a viewer show.

2203
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:27,880
Yeah.

2204
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:29,880
Alright, well that was interesting.

2205
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:34,880
See, I think a lot, I think a lot about color identities of us.

2206
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,880
I do too.

2207
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,880
Then I have to be right back.

2208
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:40,880
There's just piss like all over my desk.

2209
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,880
Like unbelievable.

2210
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:43,880
Alright, well you go-

2211
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:44,880
All over.

2212
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:46,880
And then I have to pee also.

2213
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:53,880
So you go and then I will, when you come back, I also want a pee break.

2214
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,880
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2215
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,880
Interchain the mom gone.

2216
02:15:58,880 --> 02:15:59,880
No.

2217
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:02,880
I can't fucking do that.

2218
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:03,880
I need to-

2219
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,880
Alright, I fucked with my-

2220
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:11,880
I fucked with my OBS settings to get rid of the green screen effect,

2221
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:14,880
which, come to think of it, is totally pointless and unnecessary,

2222
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,880
and I don't even know why the green screen effect was on.

2223
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:22,880
And now I really hope that it hasn't been like green screening out the leaves or something.

2224
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:25,880
No, of course not.

2225
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:30,880
I also hope that the in-game sound effects have not been drowning out our voices,

2226
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:35,880
which is highly possible because I have the in-game sounds playing on a different device,

2227
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:38,880
but I cannot hear at the moment,

2228
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:40,880
because, well, for reasons.

2229
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:46,880
Actually setting up the audio and video for this stream took like an hour and a half for some reason.

2230
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:47,880
For no benefit.

2231
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:48,880
Here we go.

2232
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:49,880
Devil's chimney.

2233
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:50,880
Yes.

2234
02:16:53,880 --> 02:16:54,880
Oh my god, that was-

2235
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,880
I'm impressed with myself.

2236
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,880
I am impressed with myself,

2237
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:00,880
which is what this game is all about,

2238
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,880
just feeling like you're way cooler than everyone else.

2239
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:08,880
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2240
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:15,880
First try.

2241
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,880
Oh, how am I so powerful?

2242
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:26,880
Watching this game, it looks really easy.

2243
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,880
You watch it and you want to be like,

2244
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:31,880
dude, just swing your hammer this way and then you'll fucking grab the thing

2245
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:32,880
and it'll throw you right up,

2246
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:37,880
but actually moving the hammer is way more cumbersome than it looks.

2247
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:41,880
I'm back with the towel to wipe up all of the pits.

2248
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:42,880
Good.

2249
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:47,880
We got to start pissing slime.

2250
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:51,880
We got to get in the spirit of things and start pissing slime.

2251
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:55,880
Can you imagine your bodily waste being currency?

2252
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:57,880
Because that's what I'm imagining.

2253
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:00,880
Dude, that just gave me an idea.

2254
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:03,880
What if one of the rooms in the discords was like the bathroom

2255
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:05,880
and you could just go in there and piss

2256
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:08,880
and it would like do something to your slime or something?

2257
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:09,880
I don't know.

2258
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:10,880
To your slime.

2259
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:12,880
Yeah, like you would get slime from it

2260
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,880
or you would lose slime or like something,

2261
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:19,880
you know, like if just like peeing was like an important strategic decision.

2262
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:21,880
Yeah.

2263
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:22,880
Yeah.

2264
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:23,880
Workshop that.

2265
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:24,880
Workshop that.

2266
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:28,880
It could be like, you know, replace the dojo with the bathroom.

2267
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:31,880
So instead of sparring to get slime, you piss on people

2268
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:33,880
and it makes them angry.

2269
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,880
And there's no other...

2270
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:39,880
It just makes them angry.

2271
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:41,880
Yeah, nobody gains.

2272
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:42,880
Nobody wins.

2273
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:46,880
Ah, shit.

2274
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:47,880
Hey, I have to go pee.

2275
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:48,880
I'll be right back.

2276
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:49,880
Yeah, yeah.

2277
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:57,880
Hello viewers.

2278
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:07,880
I just would like to take a moment here to say that when I piss on YouTube,

2279
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:12,880
when I piss on this show, always, without fail,

2280
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:18,880
I am caught off guard with how much piss I have in my fucking body.

2281
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:20,880
It's like astounding.

2282
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:25,880
It's astounding to me because I was just doing a funny joke.

2283
02:19:25,880 --> 02:19:29,880
I was just comparing the color yellow to piss.

2284
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:30,880
I was pissing away.

2285
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:34,880
I was hearing it at the screen so I could make sure that my audio was fine.

2286
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,880
And I looked back down and what do I see?

2287
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:44,880
But piss all over my desk, the large Japotli cup that I was pissing into

2288
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:48,880
completely filled up, overflowing with piss.

2289
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:53,880
And so I had to stop, get a new cup, a Starbucks vente,

2290
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:58,880
and fill that up halfway before I could clean up the piss on my desk.

2291
02:19:58,880 --> 02:19:59,880
So I'm currently...

2292
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:02,880
And because I don't have like a towel near me,

2293
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:07,880
I just got a small washcloth.

2294
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:09,880
That's just clogged up the piss now.

2295
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:15,880
So now I have to use one of my shirts to clean up this piss.

2296
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:23,880
So right now I'm just scrubbing my desk with a shirt to clean up all of the piss here.

2297
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,880
That's just what my life is like.

2298
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:31,880
And I think we can all agree that this has been swallowed.

2299
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,880
This has fucking been swallowed.

2300
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:35,880
It's all the fucking killers.

2301
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:39,880
It's conspiracy against me to make my life a living fucking hell

2302
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:43,880
because they just can't deal with my unadulterated swagger

2303
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:48,880
and persuasion of beautiful women to my arm.

2304
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:55,880
They just can't deal with how much of a fucking player and Casanova I am.

2305
02:20:55,880 --> 02:21:00,880
They just have to manufacture scenarios where my piss backfires.

2306
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:04,880
And my room is quite literally flooded with piss.

2307
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:11,880
I think we can all agree that Ben is a fucking conniving, backstabbing, fucking street urchin.

2308
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:17,880
And that his crimes against piss will not go unpunished.

2309
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:29,880
I think that his transgressions are too numerous and too true to be disproven or proven faulty.

2310
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:39,880
And I think it's only a matter of time before he's convicted at a court of slime to be 100% a faggot.

2311
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:43,880
And I think that's just, I think that's what we all have to understand.

2312
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:51,880
And so we all have to come to grips with and that's what we all have to appreciate about Ben.

2313
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:56,880
I appreciate about my co-host Ben St.

2314
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:03,880
He's a villain and a killer and a sociopath and a fucking bad person.

2315
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:09,880
And he hates pee and he hates all forms of urine.

2316
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:13,880
And he's out to get me and he's out to ruin my life.

2317
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:20,880
Much like I will ruin his life when I pull a bullet through his fucking skull.

2318
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:30,880
So I'm taking this moment right now while he's gone to make grandiose claims and incentivize violence against him.

2319
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:40,880
So please, so please, before he comes back and has something to say on the matter, please, if you're a rowdy, this is my personal request.

2320
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:48,880
Kill a killer right now. Go to the chat, go to gang violence, go to the combat zone and strike down a killer right now.

2321
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:58,880
And say something along the lines of die, you prudish fuck, urine is natural.

2322
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:03,880
Say something into the fact that urine is God's gift to man.

2323
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:08,880
And we were made in God's image, so therefore God pisses.

2324
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:14,880
And it's the only truth that we have is pee.

2325
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:21,880
And you must acknowledge that when you claim life of another discord user.

2326
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:29,880
So that's all I want to say on that end of the conversation is that fuck you, Ben.

2327
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:31,880
You made my pee go everywhere.

2328
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:41,880
And also I'm going to kill you and all of your friends and your family, or is it going to be gone?

2329
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:51,880
That was me drinking piss, by the way, in case you couldn't tell.

2330
02:23:51,880 --> 02:23:58,880
Let me go over my notes. It's been taking a real long time to pee.

2331
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:05,880
And as I'm sure you all know, I cannot carry a show. I can't even co-host a show.

2332
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:09,880
I'm dead weight here, I don't know if you've got killers. And you all know it.

2333
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:12,880
And you're just waiting to be betrayed me. You're just all waiting to be betrayed me.

2334
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:14,880
I'm waiting to betray you.

2335
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:19,880
You're all cultural vultures and you're all going to betray me in a moment's notice. Thank God you're back.

2336
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:24,880
I'm back. One second.

2337
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:27,880
There we go.

2338
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:30,880
Excellent, thank you.

2339
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:38,880
Let's see here. What were we talking about? We're talking about colors, we're talking about fucking real food initiative, we're talking about fucking...

2340
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:45,880
Oh hey, there's like, obviously the actual real food initiative is long defunct and like not used.

2341
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:52,880
And like, you know, outdated and old fashioned and clearly behind the times.

2342
02:24:52,880 --> 02:25:00,880
However, there's like a new like, pseudo real food initiative that we all keep forgetting about.

2343
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:07,880
Oh, the draw boys, yeah. I haven't been working on comics lately, so I haven't had anything to post there.

2344
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:13,880
But I really love that it is there and around and just for draw boys.

2345
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:20,880
I realize that just for draw boys, we are like, we need to like better communicate with one another.

2346
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:26,880
Because we are clearly the best artists, like just in all categories. We are clearly the best people in the PC.

2347
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:27,880
You and me?

2348
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:31,880
Like, there's no doubt about it. Well, no, all the draw boys.

2349
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:41,880
Yeah, I mean, the draw cast is like the best PCP content. Well, I don't know. It's good. It's good and I like it a lot.

2350
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:43,880
The best regular PCP content.

2351
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:44,880
Yeah.

2352
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,880
The best like on a schedule.

2353
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:49,880
Also like the least popular.

2354
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:51,880
It is at least pop. I thought people liked it.

2355
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:58,880
Well, people do like it, but it doesn't get the views that like, it gets less views than the regular podcast for some baffling reason.

2356
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:00,880
Well, fuck off.

2357
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:02,880
Probably a problem marketing.

2358
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,880
You know what I want?

2359
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:11,880
Yes, I want. I think I talk to you about this briefly. And you know, this is like behind the scenes things.

2360
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:13,880
Inside baseball.

2361
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:16,880
Inside baseball. Real shit, real shit.

2362
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:21,880
I want to like turn art apologies into like a real show.

2363
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:26,880
When I got to Radcom 3 and you told me about art apologies, I was really excited about it.

2364
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:27,880
I hate the game.

2365
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:30,880
And I wanted to be a part of it somehow.

2366
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:33,880
I totally want to like turn art apologies into like.

2367
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:37,880
Actually, I haven't listened to it yet. I started it up and I didn't get very far through it.

2368
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:40,880
And then I paused it and then like the tab got closed and I forgot.

2369
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,880
So I haven't actually heard all of it.

2370
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:45,880
Oh, it's good, dude. It's good. How far did you get?

2371
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:46,880
Not very far.

2372
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:47,880
What were we talking about?

2373
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:48,880
Um.

2374
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:49,880
Okay. Probably just interaction.

2375
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:50,880
Yeah.

2376
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:54,880
I want to like turn it into like, into like, I don't know.

2377
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:55,880
I don't know.

2378
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:58,880
A bi-weekly or whatever. I don't fucking know.

2379
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:04,880
Um, show. We're like, all the drawboys get together and we complain and whine about art things.

2380
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:05,880
I want that.

2381
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:07,880
You know, they're talking about art.

2382
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:11,880
I mean, I used to really love just like listening to people talk about art.

2383
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:15,880
So yeah, that sounds like a show that I would watch.

2384
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:22,880
For various purposes, I've been rewatching old PCP and horse cast episodes.

2385
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:26,880
And one major thing of modern PCP.

2386
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:32,880
And one of my notes is to get into the weeds of modern PCP since I've been on my mind lately.

2387
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:37,880
But one of the trappings is that we don't like talk about our work ever.

2388
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:40,880
And like that was like a major thing early on.

2389
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:41,880
Yeah.

2390
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:45,880
Was that we were talking, we were all like grungy internet content creators.

2391
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:49,880
And we all like bitched about work and you know, et cetera, et cetera.

2392
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:50,880
Well.

2393
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:51,880
And you know, gone to the weeds of what we did.

2394
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:52,880
That was important.

2395
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:57,880
I got annoyed with it because it was a lot of YouTube talk that I was not interested in.

2396
02:27:57,880 --> 02:27:59,880
But it's all art.

2397
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:00,880
Yeah.

2398
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:01,880
Yeah.

2399
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:06,880
So like if we did that, but it was just the draw boys, I would be way into it.

2400
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:07,880
Yeah.

2401
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,880
Hold on.

2402
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:09,880
I'm going to take off my shirt real quick.

2403
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:10,880
Good.

2404
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,880
Okay.

2405
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:12,880
Come on.

2406
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,880
I feel like it's been, it's been a while since I did this.

2407
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:18,880
So I'm like, I have no confidence.

2408
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:19,880
Oh shit.

2409
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:20,880
Oh, you're back here.

2410
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:21,880
Oh God, we're playing a game.

2411
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:22,880
Oh gross.

2412
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:23,880
I know.

2413
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:24,880
Sad.

2414
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:25,880
Pitiful.

2415
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:26,880
Yeah.

2416
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:34,880
So like imagine, imagine like a show where it's like, you know, it comes out whenever and

2417
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:37,880
it's like an hour to two hours of like the art boys.

2418
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:42,880
Like, so Ben, like what are you going to apologize for?

2419
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:44,880
Like what have you done wrong in your art?

2420
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:49,880
And you'd be like, I haven't fucking done this or something or like it's too hard to

2421
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:50,880
whatever.

2422
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:55,880
And then we can all talk about how either you're gay for not doing something or like,

2423
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:58,880
yeah, totes dude, I know that feel bro.

2424
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:04,880
And it'll be circle jerky as hell and super clicky and like whiny and bitchy and great.

2425
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:06,880
I like being clicky.

2426
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:07,880
I do too.

2427
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,880
It's, it's, that's what this whole thing was about.

2428
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:12,880
Ah, that's what separates us from the animals.

2429
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,880
I summon up remembrance of things past.

2430
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:26,880
The fact that we need divisions, not for any practical purpose, but to feel powerful.

2431
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:28,880
I would be down to have our apologies.

2432
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,880
I want that.

2433
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:32,880
Be regular.

2434
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:33,880
Yeah.

2435
02:29:33,880 --> 02:29:35,880
And like a real thing.

2436
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:36,880
Yeah.

2437
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:39,880
Wouldn't mean you got together.

2438
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:45,880
And like, like I had the idea for like the PCP drawcast iron chef show.

2439
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:46,880
Yeah.

2440
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:48,880
But like, wouldn't mean you got together and like really brain store.

2441
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:50,880
Patience is the foundation of eternal peace.

2442
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:52,880
Well, make anger you're in.

2443
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:53,880
Anyway.

2444
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:54,880
Harm comes to those who know.

2445
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:57,880
And brought 10 patients and draw to life.

2446
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:58,880
It was magical.

2447
02:29:58,880 --> 02:29:59,880
It was really magical.

2448
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:00,880
It was.

2449
02:30:00,880 --> 02:30:02,880
It was falling short of your own goals.

2450
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:08,880
And like we were, we were doing it fast and it was easy and it was breezy and it was beautiful.

2451
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:09,880
It was covered girl.

2452
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:15,880
I went and I watched some, some, some, what's the, some strip search.

2453
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:16,880
Strips search.

2454
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:17,880
Yeah.

2455
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:20,880
To try and like inspire myself on like how I want.

2456
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:21,880
Ah.

2457
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:28,880
And like how I want 10 paces and draw to look and the, there's just not enough B roll.

2458
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,880
There's not enough fucking B roll.

2459
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:34,880
It's cutting back and forth between like two shots the whole time.

2460
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:36,880
But there's nothing for it.

2461
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:41,880
If I may add my input, I've not seen strip search.

2462
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:42,880
Okay.

2463
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:48,880
But from what I saw of the, of what you said, it was great.

2464
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:50,880
But I feel like it wasn't silly enough.

2465
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:54,880
And I feel like the PCP like, I don't think, again, okay.

2466
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:59,880
I feel there's an important distinction here between jokes and memes.

2467
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:03,880
And people will confuse them and it makes me extremely upset when they do.

2468
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:06,880
Because in mind, there's a clear division between memes and jokes.

2469
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:10,880
Where I hate memes, but I like jokes.

2470
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:15,880
This part is like actually pretty difficult and like easy to fuck up.

2471
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:22,880
This, this part's not easy, even though it's like the first thing.

2472
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:25,880
But I kind of have a system.

2473
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:30,880
You were saying jokes versus memes.

2474
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2475
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:35,880
We're like, like, I feel like, I feel like it should be,

2476
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:38,880
Ten Pays and Drugs should be like a little silly.

2477
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:42,880
It felt like it was, it was like pretty like played straight.

2478
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:45,880
Which, which like, I can't look at Digi and not laugh.

2479
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:46,880
Yeah.

2480
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:47,880
Yeah.

2481
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:48,880
Okay.

2482
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:49,880
I feel it.

2483
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:54,880
But I don't know how to make it silly with what we've got.

2484
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:55,880
Like the.

2485
02:31:55,880 --> 02:31:56,880
Yeah.

2486
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,880
Like, like, like in the footage, we kind of take it too seriously.

2487
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:01,880
Which was kind of a point.

2488
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:03,880
It was kind of the point.

2489
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:08,880
I feel like, okay, I feel like I'm glad that it is the way that it is.

2490
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,880
Because it's the pilot and it's like the proof of concept.

2491
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:12,880
And like, here's what it looks like guys.

2492
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:13,880
Yeah.

2493
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:14,880
Check it out.

2494
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:19,880
I feel like Next Radcom, when we make like episode like one or two or whatever.

2495
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:21,880
And like, and like, we know what we're doing.

2496
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:22,880
We know the structure.

2497
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:24,880
We know what's having to turn out.

2498
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:31,880
And we can turn on that, that like classic PCP improv, you know, fluidity and dynamicism

2499
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:32,880
that we're known for.

2500
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:36,880
I feel like that will be where the show really comes to life into its own.

2501
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:42,880
Because we don't really need, like, like we don't need or want or should be a super

2502
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,880
like serious game show.

2503
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:48,880
It should be like, in my mind, the ideal for 10 pieces and draw.

2504
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,880
Should we like explain what that is?

2505
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:54,880
Because I feel like we keep mentioning it by name, but I don't know if anyone knows what it is.

2506
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:55,880
Yeah.

2507
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:56,880
You can explain.

2508
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:59,880
I got to go do something real quick.

2509
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,880
I'll be back in like two minutes.

2510
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:02,880
Okay.

2511
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,880
Okay.

2512
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:04,880
Okay.

2513
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:08,880
Gin Paces and Draw is, as I described, it was originally supposed to be like a draw cast

2514
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:16,880
iron shaft type game show where it would take the draw boys, then you would have them

2515
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:22,880
like you would unveil the topic for them and basically do like a mini draw cast and whoever

2516
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:29,880
was deemed shit from that, like mini draw cast would be eliminated until there was only

2517
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:30,880
one person left staying.

2518
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:33,880
So there would be like three or four rounds.

2519
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:38,880
And there would be judges and you know, it would be like iron shaft, but for art and draw

2520
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:39,880
games.

2521
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:40,880
Gay.

2522
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:44,880
And so we did that.

2523
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:45,880
It was great.

2524
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:50,880
We came up with, you know, we came up with a lot of like, like neat shit about how like,

2525
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:55,880
like, like the artist, like, like, like, like the, uh, the fucking the artist, like before

2526
02:33:55,880 --> 02:33:59,880
each round, it would take 10 paces, like, like it was a Western and then, and then draw

2527
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,880
basically, you know, illustration draw.

2528
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,880
We're fucking geniuses.

2529
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:05,880
Uh, and it was really, it was really cute idea.

2530
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:06,880
It was really nice.

2531
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:07,880
It was really clean.

2532
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:09,880
It was really great and fantastic.

2533
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:14,880
The, uh, I mean, should I explain what iron shaft iron shaft is?

2534
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:17,880
That is like, I guess I'll explain.

2535
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:20,880
Ten paces and draw is like, you get, we got all the draw boys.

2536
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,880
They're all lined up.

2537
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:25,880
The judges explain what the show is, which is what I'm doing right now.

2538
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:31,880
They do 10 paces, then they rush, you know, the judges unveil what the theme of the round

2539
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:32,880
is.

2540
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:34,880
So for the first round, it was like enlightenment.

2541
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,880
I think it was.

2542
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,880
I think it was enlightenment.

2543
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:42,880
Uh, and so all the artists would have to come up with like enlightenment.

2544
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:47,380
They would have come up with an illustration that matched the theme and then they would

2545
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:52,380
all turn in their illustrations to the judges and they'd be like, I like this drawing because

2546
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:55,880
it captures, it captures, um, fucking enlightenment in this way.

2547
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:59,380
They, like, like the artists would have to like, the artists would explain the drawn,

2548
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:03,880
like first the judges would judge it with like no context, like just based on their

2549
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:08,680
own interpretation and then like the artists would have like, you know, a chance to say

2550
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:11,880
something about it and explain what they were trying to do.

2551
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:12,880
Uh, yeah.

2552
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:17,880
So, you know, it's a bunch of art talk and shit.

2553
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:23,880
I, I really, like, like the concept itself, I think is fucking like, mwah, like beautiful,

2554
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:24,880
like absolutely beautiful.

2555
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:33,880
Here's what I think would make it better is if like there were more, um, like, I think

2556
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:39,380
the, I think the artists need more time to work so that like what they end up making

2557
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:44,380
is better and like more discussable.

2558
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:53,380
I think, okay, I agree, more time and I think there's no real reason for them to have pins

2559
02:35:53,380 --> 02:35:55,380
and not pencils to the erasers.

2560
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:59,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, more tools and more time.

2561
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:05,380
Like, like because, okay, if we were doing like a challenge, like speedrun type show

2562
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:09,380
where it's like make the best thing in this like small amount of time, like go, like

2563
02:36:09,380 --> 02:36:14,380
like balls, you know, fucking hard as nails do it, then pins would make sense.

2564
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:18,380
But like we're trying to make a show where it's like you have a time slot but you're

2565
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:21,380
trying to make like the best drawing that you can and the time slot is just there so

2566
02:36:21,380 --> 02:36:23,380
that you stay on track.

2567
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:24,380
Yeah.

2568
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:28,380
So like by erasing, you're going to be wasting time.

2569
02:36:28,380 --> 02:36:30,380
You're decentralized to do it anyway.

2570
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:34,380
So like why not just allow you to do your art better?

2571
02:36:34,380 --> 02:36:35,380
Yeah.

2572
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:41,380
And I just, I think having like more fully realized pieces in the end just makes...

2573
02:36:41,380 --> 02:36:45,380
I mean, that's what it should be.

2574
02:36:45,380 --> 02:36:52,380
Also, this is of no fault of Nate and Digi though we need our, we need judges who are

2575
02:36:52,380 --> 02:36:53,380
like our artists.

2576
02:36:53,380 --> 02:36:55,380
Yeah, yeah, we do.

2577
02:36:55,380 --> 02:36:58,380
I mean, they did fine but...

2578
02:36:58,380 --> 02:37:00,380
Yeah, they did fine.

2579
02:37:00,380 --> 02:37:05,380
Yeah, we, at least one judge needs to be like, you know, an artist.

2580
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:09,380
I think ideally we would have like three judges, two of which are artists and one of

2581
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:12,380
which is like a lay person, like Nate or Digi.

2582
02:37:12,380 --> 02:37:19,380
The problem is just that we aren't like, we're kind of, you know, we have to work within

2583
02:37:19,380 --> 02:37:21,380
the confines of the PCP.

2584
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:22,380
Yeah.

2585
02:37:22,380 --> 02:37:25,380
I mean, at this point in time at least.

2586
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:32,380
Although I thought that, yeah, if, if the show continued like at say PCP HQ, if that

2587
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:37,380
ever materializes, I thought we could have like guest artists on as like competitors,

2588
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:38,380
you know.

2589
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:39,380
Oh, totally.

2590
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:40,380
That's totally the dream.

2591
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:46,380
Oh, like imagine if the PCP were the judges and like we had like guest artists as contestants.

2592
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:48,380
That would be dope.

2593
02:37:48,380 --> 02:37:51,380
Okay, here's my absolute dream.

2594
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:58,380
In PCP HQ Boston, I want Timbases to draw to be like a regular thing and what we do is

2595
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:03,380
we get underground indie Boston artists to be on our show so we can promote them and

2596
02:38:03,380 --> 02:38:09,380
get young blood and pump life into ourselves and signal boost and promote upcoming...

2597
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:13,380
That is a beautiful, beautiful dream.

2598
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:15,380
Yeah.

2599
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:16,380
And I want...

2600
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:18,380
That's what I want to do.

2601
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:19,380
I know.

2602
02:38:19,380 --> 02:38:20,380
Dude, okay.

2603
02:38:20,380 --> 02:38:27,380
Timbases and Draw is one of those rare projects that like I'm just so fucking into.

2604
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:29,380
I'm just so into it.

2605
02:38:29,380 --> 02:38:37,380
And like I'm so upset that like we really don't have the necessary tools to make it as great

2606
02:38:37,380 --> 02:38:38,380
as it should be.

2607
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:40,380
Yeah, no we don't.

2608
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:42,380
But it could be great.

2609
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:45,380
It could, it could be fantastic.

2610
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:47,380
I'm so into the idea.

2611
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:50,380
And I'm dedicated.

2612
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:52,380
Next time we will do another Timbases and Draw.

2613
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:55,380
And it will probably be better because we'll have finalized...

2614
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:56,380
We'll like have...

2615
02:38:56,380 --> 02:38:57,380
Oh, oh God.

2616
02:38:57,380 --> 02:38:58,380
Okay, okay.

2617
02:38:58,380 --> 02:39:00,380
Guys, when it comes out, please critique it.

2618
02:39:00,380 --> 02:39:03,380
Please God critique it and tell us what we can do.

2619
02:39:03,380 --> 02:39:05,380
Tell us how to make it better and what it needs.

2620
02:39:05,380 --> 02:39:06,380
Or like what it...

2621
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:12,380
Like suggest things that like it could take inspiration from or like be more like, you know?

2622
02:39:12,380 --> 02:39:16,380
I think to keep in mind, like what I want the show to be is I want it to be...

2623
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:21,380
As I want it to be artists, trying their all, making good art, and then like...

2624
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:26,380
And like, you know, like have it be like a silly fun show, but the end of the day you come there

2625
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:29,380
because you like the artists and you want to see them do art stuff.

2626
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:30,380
Yes, yes.

2627
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:32,380
So like, so like...

2628
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:40,380
Like art first, comedy second, but comedy like close behind, like I don't want this to be like a...

2629
02:39:40,380 --> 02:39:42,380
Like I feel like it took itself too seriously.

2630
02:39:42,380 --> 02:39:45,380
Yeah, no, no.

2631
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:47,380
But it should be about the art.

2632
02:39:47,380 --> 02:39:48,380
It should be fun.

2633
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:49,380
It should be fun.

2634
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:50,380
Yeah.

2635
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:51,380
It shouldn't be silly.

2636
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:54,380
It should be a fun, art-centric romp.

2637
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:01,380
I feel, I...

2638
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:06,380
And the point of that was to veer it off, which is fine because I loved him based in Draw.

2639
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:09,380
But like, would mean you got to do that.

2640
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,380
That was great.

2641
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:14,380
And I feel like, I mean, I would like to do something similar for our apologies.

2642
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:21,380
Where like, I don't know, if me and you want to do it, it will be done.

2643
02:40:21,380 --> 02:40:22,380
Yeah, yeah.

2644
02:40:23,380 --> 02:40:25,380
Because we have the power.

2645
02:40:25,380 --> 02:40:27,380
We do have the power.

2646
02:40:27,380 --> 02:40:29,380
We have immense power.

2647
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:32,380
Two is enough to rock the bow on the PCP.

2648
02:40:32,380 --> 02:40:37,380
When you're one guy, it's hard to organize things, but if you've got two people, then shit gets fucking dead.

2649
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:38,380
Yes, yes.

2650
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:41,380
Historically true.

2651
02:40:41,380 --> 02:40:46,380
So, I feel like, I feel like I want to workshop the idea, because I do like our apologies.

2652
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:55,380
And I want there to be, I desperately want there to be a like, a podcast or show for the art voice to discuss their work.

2653
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:56,380
Like, okay.

2654
02:40:56,380 --> 02:41:03,380
Like, we have the draw cast, but like, it's not really suited for like, in-depth conversation about the art.

2655
02:41:03,380 --> 02:41:06,380
Because like, we're trying to draw, you know?

2656
02:41:06,380 --> 02:41:07,380
Yeah.

2657
02:41:08,380 --> 02:41:10,380
What if we like...

2658
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:11,380
Yes.

2659
02:41:11,380 --> 02:41:12,380
Okay, I don't...

2660
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:13,380
Oh, fuck yeah.

2661
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:14,380
Finally.

2662
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:15,380
Okay, I don't know about this.

2663
02:41:15,380 --> 02:41:17,380
But like, what if, this would take way more work.

2664
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:22,380
But like, what if we like, did the drawings and then like, did commentary over them?

2665
02:41:24,380 --> 02:41:25,380
Because there's always...

2666
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:27,380
Are you talking about for the draw cast?

2667
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:29,380
Yeah.

2668
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:31,380
Oh, like, like the way we do the races?

2669
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:32,380
Yeah.

2670
02:41:32,380 --> 02:41:39,380
Because the problem with the draw cast is always that there are periods of silence, because we're always like, trying to work hard.

2671
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:45,380
And like, it's hard to multitax, being funny and entertaining and also draw them.

2672
02:41:45,380 --> 02:41:46,380
It is.

2673
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:54,380
That's why, you know, Stripsurge was really great, because the artists they would be sitting and drawing, they would have like, 45 minutes or an hour.

2674
02:41:54,380 --> 02:41:57,380
And I think they had like, an hour and a half to make a comic strip.

2675
02:41:57,380 --> 02:42:00,380
And there would be just like, a bunch of cameras.

2676
02:42:00,380 --> 02:42:06,380
And like, you know, periodically through the process, Gabe and Tycho would like, kind of like, comment on them.

2677
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:08,380
Or like, try and fuck with them.

2678
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:11,380
Or like, just, you know, crack jokes or whatever.

2679
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:19,380
And so it's whole like, hour long process was like, condensed into like, you know, maybe like, 5 or 10 minutes of, you know, footage of them actually drawing.

2680
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:25,380
And, but there was like, breathing room, you know, and there were like funny moments that could be like, captured from it.

2681
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:28,380
But it wasn't like they were that pressured to be funny.

2682
02:42:29,380 --> 02:42:32,380
Yeah, I agree.

2683
02:42:32,380 --> 02:42:36,380
Well, I think the thing to remember is that we are comedians.

2684
02:42:36,380 --> 02:42:37,380
Yeah.

2685
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:39,380
Like, that's just who we are.

2686
02:42:39,380 --> 02:42:50,380
So like, even, I don't know if you feel the same way, but like, I feel like even in serious situations, it's hard to be 100% serious.

2687
02:42:50,380 --> 02:42:53,380
Just that's just the kind of guy that I am.

2688
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:54,380
I like to make jokes.

2689
02:42:54,380 --> 02:42:55,380
Yeah.

2690
02:42:55,380 --> 02:42:59,380
Like, no matter what, even if it's not the goal, I think that it will be funny.

2691
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:04,380
Yeah, we, yeah, like, we can't not be funny, at least a little bit.

2692
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:08,380
It kind of sounds egotistical.

2693
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:14,380
What I mean is we can't not make jokes, whether or not they land.

2694
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:16,380
Yeah, exactly.

2695
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:20,380
Yeah, like, that's just going to come out organically.

2696
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:27,380
You know, our resplendent personalities will always shine through to the delight of all.

2697
02:43:30,380 --> 02:43:33,380
By the way, oh god.

2698
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:34,380
Fuck.

2699
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:35,380
Well, okay, I was going to say a spoiler.

2700
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:38,380
I was going to say a spoiler, but I'll just phrase it like this.

2701
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:45,380
I'm really, it's, it's, it's complete, like, dramatic, hilarious irony.

2702
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:50,380
The way that, like, the first two rounds ended after all that was said.

2703
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:51,380
Yes, and I'm glad.

2704
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:53,380
I'm glad that it went that way.

2705
02:43:53,380 --> 02:43:54,380
It's really fucking funny.

2706
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:55,380
I'm so glad.

2707
02:43:55,380 --> 02:43:58,380
I was not expecting it because I'm a genius.

2708
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:01,380
And wait, I'll strike that part.

2709
02:44:03,380 --> 02:44:04,380
Let's go in it.

2710
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:05,380
Oh fuck.

2711
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:09,380
But, but, but I'm glad that it happened the way it did.

2712
02:44:09,380 --> 02:44:11,380
I am, too.

2713
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:14,380
Yes, yes, yes, oh god.

2714
02:44:15,380 --> 02:44:17,380
Oh, what the fuck?

2715
02:44:17,380 --> 02:44:18,380
Oh, what, what, what?

2716
02:44:18,380 --> 02:44:20,380
You were just so, you were so fucked out.

2717
02:44:20,380 --> 02:44:22,380
Did you fucking see that?

2718
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:24,380
I saw that, I saw that.

2719
02:44:25,380 --> 02:44:26,380
Okay.

2720
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:27,380
You know what?

2721
02:44:27,380 --> 02:44:28,380
I think I can recover.

2722
02:44:28,380 --> 02:44:29,380
Yes, yes.

2723
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:37,380
Did you fuck that?

2724
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:39,380
Oh god, that was choice.

2725
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:40,380
Oh.

2726
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:44,380
Oh, who, who, who, who, yeah.

2727
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:45,380
Yeah.

2728
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:48,380
Stream games.

2729
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:52,380
This is the greatest game ever.

2730
02:44:52,380 --> 02:44:57,380
Ever since Radcon, I've been bursting with creative, like, flow.

2731
02:44:57,380 --> 02:44:58,380
Like, more so.

2732
02:44:58,380 --> 02:45:03,380
I, I, I told, I told this, I, like, I think it was a common knowledge.

2733
02:45:03,380 --> 02:45:09,380
Where I, where I, I felt like I've been in a real, like, creative and, like, energy slump

2734
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:11,380
for, like, the past couple months.

2735
02:45:11,380 --> 02:45:15,380
But, like, I really feel, like, super reinvigorated and with, like, a whole new passion

2736
02:45:15,380 --> 02:45:19,380
for being alive and being an artist on the internet and doing things.

2737
02:45:19,380 --> 02:45:20,380
And it feels really good.

2738
02:45:20,380 --> 02:45:26,380
In one sense, I feel that way, but, like, it hasn't, it hasn't, it hasn't turned into

2739
02:45:26,380 --> 02:45:29,380
comics, which makes me sad every day.

2740
02:45:29,380 --> 02:45:32,380
Well, it hasn't turned into comics for me yet, either.

2741
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:36,380
But it's turned into, like, like, oh, okay.

2742
02:45:36,380 --> 02:45:41,380
I am going to suck my own dick super hard real quick for a little bit.

2743
02:45:41,380 --> 02:45:42,380
Please.

2744
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:49,380
Because I have released two, like, like a couple videos that, like, I'm actually proud

2745
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:50,380
of.

2746
02:45:50,380 --> 02:45:54,380
And, like, I've never, like, really been proud of, like, videos I've done.

2747
02:45:54,380 --> 02:46:00,380
But, like, the two vlogs are, like, super, okay, okay.

2748
02:46:00,380 --> 02:46:01,380
The last one.

2749
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:02,380
The one I want to focus on.

2750
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:03,380
Feeling Closer to the Dead.

2751
02:46:03,380 --> 02:46:06,380
Have you seen the video Feeling Closer to the Dead?

2752
02:46:06,380 --> 02:46:07,380
No.

2753
02:46:07,380 --> 02:46:13,380
It is, it was originally just a straight up vlog that me and Digi recorded, where we

2754
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:20,380
talk about the two-critic Y2K Skype call specifically, where he's calling out for

2755
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:22,380
being a pedophile and a Skype call.

2756
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:24,380
I want to talk about how I like Skype call conversations.

2757
02:46:24,380 --> 02:46:27,380
I have not heard that call, by the way.

2758
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:28,380
Oh, it's legendary.

2759
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:29,380
It's absolutely legendary.

2760
02:46:29,380 --> 02:46:31,380
I didn't know there was this Skype call.

2761
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:35,380
Also, how the fuck am I supposed to handle this?

2762
02:46:35,380 --> 02:46:36,380
You're fucked.

2763
02:46:36,380 --> 02:46:41,380
There's no other way.

2764
02:46:41,380 --> 02:46:45,380
And, eventually, we start talking about how I like morbid content that's, like, scary

2765
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:46,380
and stuff.

2766
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:47,380
Oh.

2767
02:46:47,380 --> 02:46:49,380
This part sucks, Dick.

2768
02:46:49,380 --> 02:46:50,380
I know.

2769
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:51,380
Okay.

2770
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:52,380
Right.

2771
02:46:52,380 --> 02:46:53,380
Morbid content.

2772
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:54,380
Yeah, that is morbid.

2773
02:46:54,380 --> 02:46:56,380
That is some morbid shit.

2774
02:46:56,380 --> 02:46:57,380
Yeah.

2775
02:46:57,380 --> 02:47:00,380
And, okay, and so, I take that.

2776
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:02,380
And, here's what I do.

2777
02:47:02,380 --> 02:47:06,380
I get someone at 3 AM to call me on Skype.

2778
02:47:06,380 --> 02:47:14,380
And, like, the start of the video is, like, me browsing pimple popping on YouTube.

2779
02:47:14,380 --> 02:47:15,380
Yeah.

2780
02:47:15,380 --> 02:47:17,380
And, then, I get a Skype call.

2781
02:47:17,380 --> 02:47:19,380
And, then, I answer the Skype call.

2782
02:47:19,380 --> 02:47:22,380
And, then, the person, the fan, his name is, like, centerpoint.

2783
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:23,380
He's in the...

2784
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:24,380
Oh, yeah, centerpoint.

2785
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:25,380
Yeah.

2786
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:26,380
Yeah.

2787
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:27,380
Yeah.

2788
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:28,380
Shout out.

2789
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:31,380
He starts screen sharing.

2790
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:33,380
And, then, I edit out his screen.

2791
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:35,380
And, I put in the vlog.

2792
02:47:35,380 --> 02:47:38,380
And, the vlog is, like, edited, like, fully.

2793
02:47:38,380 --> 02:47:40,380
So, it takes place.

2794
02:47:40,380 --> 02:47:43,380
Like, the vlog takes place within a Skype...

2795
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:44,380
MAH!

2796
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:45,380
Oh.

2797
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:46,380
Okay.

2798
02:47:46,380 --> 02:47:47,380
Okay.

2799
02:47:47,380 --> 02:47:48,380
Okay.

2800
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:49,380
Not the worst thing ever.

2801
02:47:49,380 --> 02:47:51,380
But, they're pretty bad.

2802
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:54,380
It takes place within a Skype call.

2803
02:47:54,380 --> 02:48:00,380
And, then, towards the end, once I reach my point of I like to feel closer to death, I

2804
02:48:00,380 --> 02:48:03,380
turn it into, like, a Slender Man ARG.

2805
02:48:03,380 --> 02:48:11,380
Where, like, I splice in some, like, footage that we recorded earlier about me finding a

2806
02:48:11,380 --> 02:48:15,380
Slender Man, like, symbol in the place where we had recorded the vlog.

2807
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:16,380
Which, like, happened.

2808
02:48:16,380 --> 02:48:21,380
And, then, and then, like, I edit it in, like, like, like, some, like, some, like, images

2809
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:23,380
of Digi to make it look scary.

2810
02:48:23,380 --> 02:48:28,380
And, it ties into the whole theme of, like, morbid content and shit and feeling closer

2811
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:29,380
to death.

2812
02:48:29,380 --> 02:48:33,380
And, then, the video ends with, like, the Skype call that the entire vlog is taking

2813
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:34,380
place in.

2814
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:35,380
In being.

2815
02:48:35,380 --> 02:48:36,380
And, like, that's it.

2816
02:48:36,380 --> 02:48:38,380
And, it's fucking cool as hell.

2817
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:40,380
And, I'm really happy with it.

2818
02:48:40,380 --> 02:48:42,380
Um, interesting.

2819
02:48:42,380 --> 02:48:50,380
And, I would have never, like, had the gumption or, like, passion to do such a thing.

2820
02:48:50,380 --> 02:48:55,380
If it weren't for Radcon 3, they got me super fucking hyped for being a creative and doing

2821
02:48:55,380 --> 02:49:00,380
this again and kicking ass and taking names and doing shit.

2822
02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:01,380
And, it was nice.

2823
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:03,380
And, thank you, Radcon 3.

2824
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:04,380
Thank you, Radcon 3.

2825
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:05,380
Thank you, Radcon 3.

2826
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:06,380
Thank you, Radcon 3.

2827
02:49:06,380 --> 02:49:07,380
Thank you, Radcon 3.

2828
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:10,380
So, the best video you've ever done?

2829
02:49:10,380 --> 02:49:11,380
Probably.

2830
02:49:11,380 --> 02:49:13,380
Um, why didn't I do more just like it?

2831
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:18,380
It didn't even take that long.

2832
02:49:18,380 --> 02:49:19,380
But, it was sick.

2833
02:49:19,380 --> 02:49:20,380
Okay.

2834
02:49:20,380 --> 02:49:21,380
Here we go.

2835
02:49:21,380 --> 02:49:22,380
Here we go.

2836
02:49:22,380 --> 02:49:23,380
Here we go.

2837
02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:24,380
Here we go.

2838
02:49:24,380 --> 02:49:26,380
Yeah, right, just hand over fist.

2839
02:49:26,380 --> 02:49:27,380
Yeah.

2840
02:49:27,380 --> 02:49:29,380
Double it's weight in gold that video was.

2841
02:49:29,380 --> 02:49:32,380
Probably made like, 20 bucks tops.

2842
02:49:32,380 --> 02:49:35,380
Oh, yeah.

2843
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:41,380
No, God.

2844
02:49:41,380 --> 02:49:44,380
Oh, you're so fucked, dude.

2845
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:55,380
One of the main things is helped me achieve Godlike creative status.

2846
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,380
Yes.

2847
02:49:56,380 --> 02:50:00,380
It's like, once I got home from Radcon, like, like, I obviously, I just naturally made

2848
02:50:00,380 --> 02:50:01,380
like a to-do list.

2849
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:03,380
Like, you know, there's the stuff that I have.

2850
02:50:03,380 --> 02:50:05,380
It's, let's crank out this red content.

2851
02:50:05,380 --> 02:50:14,180
And having a to-do list is so fucking satisfying and good and incentivizing to like, get things

2852
02:50:14,180 --> 02:50:15,180
done.

2853
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:16,180
Yeah.

2854
02:50:16,180 --> 02:50:20,180
It feels so good to wake up, check your checklist, like, like, check your to-do list and be like,

2855
02:50:20,180 --> 02:50:23,180
all right, today I'm going to work on this project.

2856
02:50:23,180 --> 02:50:26,180
And then you work on that project and then it's done at the end of the day and then you

2857
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:30,180
can delete it from the to-do list and like, you've accomplished something.

2858
02:50:30,180 --> 02:50:35,680
Like, you have accomplished something in a Google doc and you are now closer to God than

2859
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:40,180
you will ever be unless you do the same thing again tomorrow, which I did for like a couple

2860
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:43,180
of days and it was great.

2861
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:46,180
Oh my God.

2862
02:50:46,180 --> 02:50:49,180
Oh God, no.

2863
02:50:49,180 --> 02:50:52,180
Fuck!

2864
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:57,180
Ah!

2865
02:50:57,180 --> 02:50:58,180
Oh!

2866
02:50:58,180 --> 02:51:00,180
Whoo!

2867
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:01,180
Okay.

2868
02:51:01,180 --> 02:51:02,180
Saved.

2869
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:03,180
All right.

2870
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:05,180
I need to fucking wipe my ha- Ah!

2871
02:51:05,180 --> 02:51:07,180
I need to fucking wipe my hands off.

2872
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:09,180
Because they're sweaty.

2873
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:10,180
Mom's spaghetti.

2874
02:51:10,180 --> 02:51:14,180
Your teeth are on the edge, dude.

2875
02:51:14,180 --> 02:51:15,180
I was wrong.

2876
02:51:15,180 --> 02:51:16,180
The Devil's Chimney ain't shit.

2877
02:51:16,180 --> 02:51:20,180
This is the worst part in the whole game.

2878
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:25,180
This is my, this is my, this is my Sophie's choice.

2879
02:51:25,180 --> 02:51:31,180
Uh, um, uh, creativity.

2880
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:36,180
Um, I've got, God, I just...

2881
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:43,180
You know, okay, so the thing about like the Radcom videos, I feel like the creative energy

2882
02:51:43,180 --> 02:51:47,180
there was already spent and the idea of just like editing them and like getting them ready

2883
02:51:47,180 --> 02:51:50,180
for release and then releasing them just makes me tired.

2884
02:51:50,180 --> 02:51:53,180
Cause like, I already did it, you know?

2885
02:51:53,180 --> 02:51:58,180
Feels like release, releasing them just kind of feels like a formality, at least in like

2886
02:51:58,180 --> 02:52:02,180
an emotional sort of way.

2887
02:52:02,180 --> 02:52:05,180
I understand what you mean, but I don't feel the same way.

2888
02:52:05,180 --> 02:52:13,180
Because most of my, I don't know, because because when, when like I did our apologies,

2889
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:16,180
I didn't like feel like I had done it.

2890
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:21,180
I only felt like I had done it when it was released.

2891
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:25,180
And like in order for it to get released, I had to edit it very slightly.

2892
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:34,180
But, uh, I just feel like, like, like, I think it helps that most of my, most of my stuff

2893
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:41,180
that I got down at like at Radcon was like components of things that like I need to work on still.

2894
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:42,180
Yeah.

2895
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:47,180
Like I'm working, I haven't like stopped working on that thing with Hippo.

2896
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:50,180
Oh, that's, oh my God, that thing with Hippo. I had forgotten about that.

2897
02:52:50,180 --> 02:52:51,180
I know.

2898
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:55,180
Oh, oh, oh, I have not. That's been on my to-do list.

2899
02:52:55,180 --> 02:53:00,180
And I actually have, oh, I don't know how to describe this in terms.

2900
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:02,180
Part of it is done.

2901
02:53:02,180 --> 02:53:03,180
Okay.

2902
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:04,180
A big part?

2903
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:06,180
Part of it is done.

2904
02:53:06,180 --> 02:53:19,180
Uh, one, like, like, like three of the components of this project is done on my end.

2905
02:53:19,180 --> 02:53:23,180
Okay. How many more do you think you got to do?

2906
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:25,180
Uh, like I think four.

2907
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:26,180
Okay.

2908
02:53:26,180 --> 02:53:27,180
Okay.

2909
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:30,180
God, I gotta fucking draw comics again.

2910
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:31,180
Yeah.

2911
02:53:31,180 --> 02:53:34,180
I gotta fucking draw, I gotta fucking draw Vapors 3 again.

2912
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:43,180
I miss Beast Capades so much, but I gotta finish Vapors 3 or I'll never forgive myself.

2913
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:47,180
I've been saying that for years, but it's still true and it always has been.

2914
02:53:47,180 --> 02:53:49,180
Let me ask you this.

2915
02:53:49,180 --> 02:53:50,180
Yeah.

2916
02:53:50,180 --> 02:53:51,180
I don't know what you think.

2917
02:53:51,180 --> 02:53:59,180
Uh, this is an investigator question, which may be like extremely influential to its,

2918
02:54:00,180 --> 02:54:01,180
it happened.

2919
02:54:01,180 --> 02:54:02,180
Okay.

2920
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:07,180
I, as you know, I'm quite a fan of the home stuff.

2921
02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:08,180
Okay.

2922
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:16,180
And so all of, like, like, like, I, and because I grew up with it, my brain literally thinks

2923
02:54:16,180 --> 02:54:18,180
in terms of like home-sucking animals.

2924
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:19,180
Yes.

2925
02:54:19,180 --> 02:54:27,180
And I know for a fact that, like, investigator would be done, maybe not like particularly

2926
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:33,180
quicker, but it would be done way easier and I would like it way, way, way more if

2927
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:35,180
it were in home-sucked panels.

2928
02:54:35,180 --> 02:54:37,180
I don't mean like, you know, are you seeing this?

2929
02:54:37,180 --> 02:54:39,180
Like, are you seeing where I am right now?

2930
02:54:39,180 --> 02:54:41,180
Yeah, I'm seeing where you are right now.

2931
02:54:41,180 --> 02:54:43,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, fuck.

2932
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:44,180
I got it.

2933
02:54:44,180 --> 02:54:45,180
I got it.

2934
02:54:45,180 --> 02:54:47,180
I got a good foothold.

2935
02:54:47,180 --> 02:54:49,180
You were, that was really dangerous.

2936
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:51,180
It looked like you just left off and you were ready to go.

2937
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:56,180
I thought I could push myself off and grab this one, but it didn't really go the way I

2938
02:54:56,180 --> 02:54:59,180
planned, but that's fine.

2939
02:54:59,180 --> 02:55:00,180
Okay.

2940
02:55:00,180 --> 02:55:01,180
That's fine.

2941
02:55:01,180 --> 02:55:02,180
Okay.

2942
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:06,180
So are you, are you considering doing it Biscopay style?

2943
02:55:06,180 --> 02:55:07,180
Well, not Biscopay.

2944
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:09,180
I don't want to do, like, read or input.

2945
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:10,180
Oh my god.

2946
02:55:10,180 --> 02:55:11,180
Oh my god.

2947
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:12,180
Oh my god.

2948
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:13,180
And you should remember that.

2949
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:15,180
Christina Rossetti.

2950
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:16,180
Anyway.

2951
02:55:16,180 --> 02:55:18,180
I don't want to do the input.

2952
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:19,180
No, no, no.

2953
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:22,180
I mean visually, like in homestay panel style.

2954
02:55:22,180 --> 02:55:23,180
Yeah, yeah.

2955
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:24,180
Yeah.

2956
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:25,180
I'm considering.

2957
02:55:25,180 --> 02:55:32,180
I feel like you would behoove me to make my first comic a traditional comic book.

2958
02:55:32,180 --> 02:55:33,180
Yeah.

2959
02:55:33,180 --> 02:55:40,180
Well, you know, on the one hand, I feel like it's worth going outside your comfort zone.

2960
02:55:40,180 --> 02:55:48,180
On the other hand, I feel like whatever it takes to get it done.

2961
02:55:48,180 --> 02:55:49,180
Huh?

2962
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:54,180
I don't think it will be a major impact on its dullness.

2963
02:55:54,180 --> 02:55:58,180
I just had a conversation, I think, with Steve about it.

2964
02:55:58,180 --> 02:55:59,180
I can see that it's a lie.

2965
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:00,180
Maybe not.

2966
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:01,180
Chad, Steve.

2967
02:56:01,180 --> 02:56:02,180
Yeah, okay.

2968
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:05,180
Somewhere in the chat that we're both in.

2969
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:07,180
About doing it homestuck style.

2970
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:11,180
We're like, I just like not considered doing it that way because I wanted it to be hard

2971
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:13,180
on myself, I guess.

2972
02:56:13,180 --> 02:56:15,180
Yeah.

2973
02:56:15,180 --> 02:56:23,180
I mean, I don't think, I mean, I don't really think it makes that much of a difference.

2974
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:31,180
Ultimately, which way it ends up being, unless you want it to be one way or the other.

2975
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:32,180
Yeah.

2976
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:36,180
Like, I think in terms of the end product, it's a lot.

2977
02:56:36,180 --> 02:56:43,180
I mean, it's like kind of almost semantical in a way, I would describe it.

2978
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:47,180
Like, it doesn't really matter.

2979
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:50,180
It's just like the language of it.

2980
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:51,180
Yeah.

2981
02:56:52,180 --> 02:56:53,180
Hold on.

2982
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:58,180
I thought that you would have like pages drawn already.

2983
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:00,180
Would you like redo them?

2984
02:57:00,180 --> 02:57:01,180
Yeah.

2985
02:57:01,180 --> 02:57:02,180
Yeah.

2986
02:57:02,180 --> 02:57:03,180
Okay.

2987
02:57:03,180 --> 02:57:10,180
I do have like pages done in the traditional comic style, though they aren't that many.

2988
02:57:10,180 --> 02:57:12,180
I mean, I guess you could always just like.

2989
02:57:12,180 --> 02:57:15,180
It wouldn't be crazy for me to restart.

2990
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:18,180
I guess you could always, I mean, they're digital, right?

2991
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:19,180
Yeah.

2992
02:57:19,180 --> 02:57:20,180
I guess you could always just like.

2993
02:57:20,180 --> 02:57:22,180
Besides one, which is reassuring.

2994
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:23,180
Huh?

2995
02:57:23,180 --> 02:57:24,180
Besides one, which is reassuring.

2996
02:57:24,180 --> 02:57:25,180
Okay.

2997
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:28,180
Well, I guess you could always just like convert them into like homestuck panels.

2998
02:57:28,180 --> 02:57:29,180
Why not?

2999
02:57:29,180 --> 02:57:30,180
Yeah.

3000
02:57:32,180 --> 02:57:33,180
You know what?

3001
02:57:33,180 --> 02:57:35,180
The more I think about it, the more I think this is retarded and I'm not going to do that

3002
02:57:35,180 --> 02:57:36,180
at all.

3003
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:38,180
And I'm just going to make it a real comic because I'm not a hack.

3004
02:57:38,180 --> 02:57:39,180
Solid.

3005
02:57:39,180 --> 02:57:40,180
Solid choice.

3006
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:47,180
Well.

3007
02:57:48,180 --> 02:57:52,180
What kind of person do you have to be to play this game?

3008
02:57:52,180 --> 02:57:53,180
Let alone design it.

3009
02:57:55,180 --> 02:57:56,180
Whoa.

3010
02:57:56,180 --> 02:57:57,180
Could you?

3011
02:57:57,180 --> 02:57:59,180
Are you going to try and hack that?

3012
02:57:59,180 --> 02:58:01,180
I know you can do it.

3013
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:04,180
It is totally a thing that people do.

3014
02:58:04,180 --> 02:58:05,180
Let me see.

3015
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:06,180
Let me see if I can.

3016
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:10,180
Let me see if it's feasible.

3017
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:13,180
I'll just try and jump as high as I can.

3018
02:58:13,180 --> 02:58:14,180
Mmm.

3019
02:58:17,180 --> 02:58:19,180
I got higher by swinging.

3020
02:58:26,180 --> 02:58:27,180
Oh, whoops.

3021
02:58:31,180 --> 02:58:32,180
God damn it.

3022
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:38,180
You're going to have to like catapult yourself up there.

3023
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:39,180
Yeah.

3024
02:58:40,180 --> 02:58:46,180
It probably shouldn't spend too much time doing this because in the end it's just going

3025
02:58:46,180 --> 02:58:48,180
to be like you could have gone there.

3026
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:49,180
Yeah.

3027
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:50,180
If you just done it the wrong way.

3028
02:58:50,180 --> 02:58:51,180
Yeah.

3029
02:58:51,180 --> 02:58:52,180
It's probably not worth it.

3030
02:58:52,180 --> 02:58:56,180
Unless I was going to spend like hours and hours practicing it so I could do it consistently.

3031
02:58:56,180 --> 02:58:58,180
But I don't need to do it consistently.

3032
02:58:58,180 --> 02:58:59,180
Yeah.

3033
02:59:01,180 --> 02:59:02,180
Stupid.

3034
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:03,180
Ah, God.

3035
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:04,180
No.

3036
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:08,180
Fucking ball.

3037
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,180
Okay.

3038
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:13,180
What were you saying about re-

3039
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:17,180
Something about redoing some shit.

3040
02:59:17,180 --> 02:59:20,180
Just fucking turn it into a...

3041
02:59:20,180 --> 02:59:21,180
Motion.

3042
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:22,180
Motion comic.

3043
02:59:22,180 --> 02:59:23,180
Yeah.

3044
02:59:23,180 --> 02:59:24,180
Yeah.

3045
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:25,180
Probably.

3046
02:59:25,180 --> 02:59:28,180
That's probably the best way to go.

3047
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:32,180
That's probably the best thing that anyone could do.

3048
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:34,180
Shout out to Tom.

3049
02:59:35,180 --> 02:59:38,180
He's made mistakes, but it's okay.

3050
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:42,180
Dude.

3051
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:43,180
Oh my God.

3052
02:59:43,180 --> 02:59:46,180
The literal best part about Radicon.

3053
02:59:46,180 --> 02:59:49,180
Like the best moment was after our apologies.

3054
02:59:49,180 --> 02:59:54,180
Me and Tom just like sat like back to back alone in the basement silently working on investigators

3055
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:55,180
versus loss.

3056
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:58,180
Just like we didn't like talk to one other.

3057
02:59:58,180 --> 03:00:01,180
We just were there and we both were doing it for like an hour and a half.

3058
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:02,180
I love that.

3059
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:03,180
I love that.

3060
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:08,180
For a while there I used to hang out with my friend John and I would be drawing on the

3061
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:13,180
computer and he would be coding on his computer.

3062
03:00:13,180 --> 03:00:21,180
But I just wanted to like do that for a long time, but he would like stop and like talk

3063
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:25,180
to me and like tell me about what he was doing.

3064
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:28,180
And in one sense I understand why.

3065
03:00:28,180 --> 03:00:32,180
But that kind of wasn't what I was there to do, you know.

3066
03:00:33,180 --> 03:00:42,180
I have always been fascinated by this one panel of a homestuck, of an influential homestuck

3067
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:45,180
fan comic entitled Panty Rain.

3068
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:51,180
But what I cared about was the depiction of the characters in said comic and they were

3069
03:00:51,180 --> 03:00:56,180
just, they were just like, like it was all like the boys basically in a room and they

3070
03:00:56,180 --> 03:01:01,180
were all like, like, like some of them were like playing on the TV, like like a video game

3071
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:02,180
or something.

3072
03:01:02,180 --> 03:01:05,180
And then, and then I think like John was like on the computer and like Dave was just like

3073
03:01:05,180 --> 03:01:07,180
watching like the fucking game.

3074
03:01:07,180 --> 03:01:14,180
And like, I always thought like one day I'll achieve this level of Brodom or like I don't

3075
03:01:14,180 --> 03:01:18,180
have to like talk to my friends because God forbid that I forget.

3076
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:23,180
But like, but I could just like work on things and like they're around and I can look at them

3077
03:01:23,180 --> 03:01:25,180
and appreciate them as the trophies.

3078
03:01:25,180 --> 03:01:26,180
Yeah, yeah, I feel it.

3079
03:01:27,180 --> 03:01:29,180
It's great when you don't have to talk.

3080
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:32,180
Talking overrated.

3081
03:01:34,180 --> 03:01:36,180
That's, that's one of the main things.

3082
03:01:36,180 --> 03:01:37,180
Like, like.

3083
03:01:38,180 --> 03:01:41,180
Because I grew up as a sheltered boy.

3084
03:01:41,180 --> 03:01:46,180
I had always been hardcore on the like, you know, fucking online friends.

3085
03:01:46,180 --> 03:01:48,180
The same as offline friends.

3086
03:01:48,180 --> 03:01:51,180
I still do understand and emphasize that attitude.

3087
03:01:51,180 --> 03:01:55,180
Like I come obviously with maturity to understand their vast differences.

3088
03:01:55,180 --> 03:02:01,180
And one of them is that when you're in it, like, like, like being in a call is way, way,

3089
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:04,180
way, fucking different than talking to someone online.

3090
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:05,180
And like, I know that's like a basic thing.

3091
03:02:05,180 --> 03:02:09,180
But like, you know, most of my conversations with my friends were like over scale.

3092
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:10,180
Yeah.

3093
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:15,180
So like only only like really, you know, in the past like three years or so have I really

3094
03:02:15,180 --> 03:02:17,180
appreciated the difference.

3095
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:22,180
Because like, because like that moment with Tom was great.

3096
03:02:22,180 --> 03:02:28,180
But like, we can't like, I can't like call him and then we are now silent just working together.

3097
03:02:29,180 --> 03:02:30,180
Like that.

3098
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:35,180
Sometimes me and Mage call each other and just like watch anime and mostly in silence.

3099
03:02:36,180 --> 03:02:37,180
Well, yeah.

3100
03:02:37,180 --> 03:02:38,180
That's not weird.

3101
03:02:38,180 --> 03:02:39,180
That's like a collaborative.

3102
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:40,180
Yeah.

3103
03:02:40,180 --> 03:02:46,180
That's like, that's like, like, like, like, like, it would just be me and Tom like just like doing.

3104
03:02:47,180 --> 03:02:48,180
Right.

3105
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:49,180
I'm getting worse at this.

3106
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:51,180
Anyway.

3107
03:02:51,180 --> 03:02:52,180
Sorry.

3108
03:02:53,180 --> 03:02:54,180
No, it's fine.

3109
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:56,180
Just like not saying anything to one another.

3110
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:58,180
It's just not conducive.

3111
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:11,180
Most of the time in my life, I like don't want to be talking, you know, do you feel that way?

3112
03:03:14,180 --> 03:03:16,180
Sometimes, not most of the time.

3113
03:03:16,180 --> 03:03:17,180
Most of the time I want to be talking.

3114
03:03:17,180 --> 03:03:18,180
I feel that way like a lot.

3115
03:03:19,180 --> 03:03:20,180
Yeah.

3116
03:03:21,180 --> 03:03:23,180
Is this a new development or have you always felt this way?

3117
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:28,180
No, it's, it's, I think I've always, I've always been this way.

3118
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:38,180
I mean, maybe not always, but definitely, I remember feeling this way even in like high school or maybe, maybe college was when it started.

3119
03:03:38,180 --> 03:03:39,180
I don't know.

3120
03:03:39,180 --> 03:03:46,180
I don't know if it ever started, but I know like, I remember like thinking about it consciously in like college.

3121
03:03:46,180 --> 03:03:48,180
It's like, I don't want to talk.

3122
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:50,180
I wish I could stop.

3123
03:03:50,180 --> 03:03:57,180
I wish I could just wish I could just have like silence for a long, long time.

3124
03:03:59,180 --> 03:04:09,180
There's definitely a great, it's always the best feeling when you reach that tier of friendship where silence is no longer awkward, no matter the situation.

3125
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:12,180
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't do today.

3126
03:04:12,180 --> 03:04:13,180
Truly.

3127
03:04:13,180 --> 03:04:14,180
Lewis Carroll.

3128
03:04:14,180 --> 03:04:23,180
So you can like call up your bro and you guys can just like talk for a little while and then like start doing something and just kind of like be in the call or you know, hanging out in person.

3129
03:04:23,180 --> 03:04:31,180
And like, and like, and like, while you still have like, I have to talk like a little bit like, you know, it's, it's not like a bad, there's no bad silence.

3130
03:04:31,180 --> 03:04:33,180
There's no awkward, like I should be saying something.

3131
03:04:33,180 --> 03:04:34,180
Yeah.

3132
03:04:34,180 --> 03:04:39,180
That just means you're like not that comfortable when you feel like that.

3133
03:04:40,180 --> 03:04:41,180
Yes.

3134
03:04:41,180 --> 03:04:42,180
Yes.

3135
03:04:44,180 --> 03:04:45,180
Ah.

3136
03:04:47,180 --> 03:04:49,180
What are the controls of this game?

3137
03:04:49,180 --> 03:04:51,180
You just use the mouse.

3138
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:56,180
You just move the hammer with the mouse and that's all you do.

3139
03:05:03,180 --> 03:05:05,180
Fucking dangerous.

3140
03:05:06,180 --> 03:05:18,180
This part sucks because it's like, it's not that hard, but it can be fucked up.

3141
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:25,180
And it comes right before this other part that is like way hard.

3142
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:26,180
Yeah.

3143
03:05:26,180 --> 03:05:27,180
Ugh.

3144
03:05:28,180 --> 03:05:29,180
Ugh.

3145
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:34,180
Maybe, maybe if I like pushed myself on the other underside of this.

3146
03:05:35,180 --> 03:05:36,180
No.

3147
03:05:37,180 --> 03:05:41,180
I feel like I really have not like gotten this part down at all.

3148
03:05:41,180 --> 03:05:44,180
Like every time I try it, I'm just like praying.

3149
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:55,180
Like this is, this is the best I can consistently do getting to this point where like, my hammer is on the thing,

3150
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:59,180
but I'm not like making progress per se.

3151
03:05:59,180 --> 03:06:03,180
It's always so weird because whenever you do that, do it.

3152
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:06,180
It just is like a super quick and super fluid and easy.

3153
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:09,180
No.

3154
03:06:10,180 --> 03:06:11,180
Yeah.

3155
03:06:11,180 --> 03:06:12,180
Yeah, you're right.

3156
03:06:12,180 --> 03:06:18,180
Whenever I do it, it's like, because I keep wanting to like stop and slowly approach it

3157
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:21,180
and like carefully make progress, but that never works.

3158
03:06:22,180 --> 03:06:29,180
Um, it's only when I like go for it, but I like, I don't know how I make it work when I do go for it.

3159
03:06:32,180 --> 03:06:33,180
Blindly do it until it works.

3160
03:06:33,180 --> 03:06:34,180
Yeah.

3161
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:35,180
And then still don't understand.

3162
03:06:35,180 --> 03:06:38,180
Yeah, that's, that's, that's the only way that it ever works.

3163
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:44,180
I hate this game.

3164
03:06:46,180 --> 03:06:47,180
Okay.

3165
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:49,180
Yeah.

3166
03:06:52,180 --> 03:07:03,180
So then with all, with the PCP friendship rekindled and with all of our minds constantly, let's see the fuck out with creative genius left and right nowadays.

3167
03:07:03,180 --> 03:07:04,180
Yes.

3168
03:07:04,180 --> 03:07:13,180
And with us reaching a whole new renaissance in, in, in what we want to do with our lives and reaching creativity and Nirvana.

3169
03:07:13,180 --> 03:07:18,180
Um, let's, let's address how the procrastiners podcast is shit and terrible.

3170
03:07:18,180 --> 03:07:19,180
Yeah.

3171
03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:27,180
Well, naturally, it's, um, yeah, it's like you were, yeah, we used to talk about our work a lot and now we don't, but like, that's what we think about all the time.

3172
03:07:27,180 --> 03:07:29,180
So like, what are we talking about?

3173
03:07:31,180 --> 03:07:33,180
That, that, that's like the smallest issue, dude.

3174
03:07:33,180 --> 03:07:36,180
That's like, that's like fucking fleas on it.

3175
03:07:36,180 --> 03:07:38,180
I think that's a big issue.

3176
03:07:38,180 --> 03:07:40,180
I think that's a big issue.

3177
03:07:41,180 --> 03:07:49,180
I think, I think it can fit comfortably within the, the, the issue of we never know what the fuck we're talking about.

3178
03:07:49,180 --> 03:07:53,180
And it's all just completely fabricated bullshit.

3179
03:07:53,180 --> 03:07:55,180
Um, let's, hold on.

3180
03:07:55,180 --> 03:07:57,180
I'm really afraid that my power might cut.

3181
03:07:57,180 --> 03:07:58,180
I'm suddenly paranoid.

3182
03:07:58,180 --> 03:08:00,180
I'm going to stop recording and then start again.

3183
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:08,180
I don't know if I was imagining it, but I thought I saw the lights flicker for a second and because like, yeah, because I guess the viewers wouldn't know.

3184
03:08:08,180 --> 03:08:17,180
Like before we started recording, my power went out for like 10 minutes this morning and I'm afraid it might happen again and I would lose footage.

3185
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:21,180
I think, okay, ah, it depends on file format.

3186
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:28,180
Like depending on what file format this is being saved in, sometimes a power outage will cause it to lose everything and other times it won't.

3187
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:33,180
Like it's being saved continuously and I don't know which one is true right now.

3188
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:35,180
So I'm scared.

3189
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:36,180
Terrifying.

3190
03:08:36,180 --> 03:08:37,180
Yeah.

3191
03:08:37,180 --> 03:08:40,180
Um, at the very least you can hear my audio.

3192
03:08:40,180 --> 03:08:42,180
So that would be luxurious.

3193
03:08:42,180 --> 03:08:43,180
What, what do you mean?

3194
03:08:43,180 --> 03:08:45,180
Oh, like if this all gets lost?

3195
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:46,180
Mm-hmm.

3196
03:08:46,180 --> 03:08:50,180
Well, but then they won't be able to hear my audio because I'm recording my audio in OBS.

3197
03:08:50,180 --> 03:08:51,180
I know.

3198
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:52,180
Yeah.

3199
03:08:52,180 --> 03:08:54,180
So it'll just be Munchy talking to everyone.

3200
03:08:54,180 --> 03:08:55,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

3201
03:08:55,180 --> 03:09:01,180
It'll just be me talking to all the people who are now currently listening to only Munchy and wondering why I'm so...

3202
03:09:01,180 --> 03:09:03,180
Wondering what this conversation is even about.

3203
03:09:03,180 --> 03:09:04,180
Yeah.

3204
03:09:05,180 --> 03:09:06,180
Okay.

3205
03:09:06,180 --> 03:09:07,180
Okay, here we go.

3206
03:09:07,180 --> 03:09:08,180
Oh, okay.

3207
03:09:08,180 --> 03:09:09,180
Context.

3208
03:09:09,180 --> 03:09:10,180
Fucking...

3209
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:16,180
I'm actually going to put an asterisk on this entire conversation.

3210
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:24,180
Uh, and that actress is, except it's, it has, it except the last episode that we recorded was really great.

3211
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:25,180
What was the last one?

3212
03:09:25,180 --> 03:09:27,180
It gave jobs and, jobs and working.

3213
03:09:27,180 --> 03:09:28,180
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3214
03:09:30,180 --> 03:09:32,180
Uh, besides that.

3215
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:34,180
PCP.

3216
03:09:34,180 --> 03:09:40,180
I've noticed this ever, like, like, like, like, like in, like, the mid-90s.

3217
03:09:40,180 --> 03:09:41,180
Mm-hmm.

3218
03:09:41,180 --> 03:09:50,180
Where I, I, I started realizing all of our comments were from, like, new people and all of them were shit.

3219
03:09:50,180 --> 03:09:59,180
Now, when, when, when, when, you know, when you say that the comments are shit, a lot, a lot of, you know, recent events and drama comes to mind, you know, maybe that's the reason why.

3220
03:09:59,180 --> 03:10:02,180
But I noticed something that I didn't consider.

3221
03:10:02,180 --> 03:10:03,180
Fuck!

3222
03:10:03,180 --> 03:10:07,180
None of the comments were from, like, veteran fans.

3223
03:10:07,180 --> 03:10:11,180
Like, I wasn't seeing, I wasn't seeing, like, my boys.

3224
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:15,180
I wasn't, I wasn't seeing people, like, like, old fans who I knew the name of.

3225
03:10:15,180 --> 03:10:17,180
They had all but disappeared.

3226
03:10:17,180 --> 03:10:21,180
Like, like, I wasn't seeing, you know, the, the usual names, the PCP comments.

3227
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:24,180
And so, uh, I think I've described this before.

3228
03:10:24,180 --> 03:10:28,180
I have, I have a, I guess I have to fucking go to the history since it's highly contextual.

3229
03:10:28,180 --> 03:10:36,180
But back in the old days of the PCP fan chat, when that was a big, huge thing, I was there because I was a PCP fan level.

3230
03:10:36,180 --> 03:10:49,180
Uh, and, uh, I, I, I gathered all the people who I thought were cool and put them into a super unbelievably clicky, uh, like, secret club chat room called the Golden Child Foundry.

3231
03:10:49,180 --> 03:10:50,180
Yeah.

3232
03:10:50,180 --> 03:10:54,180
And, uh, like, like, all the people who there were cool, uh, were cool.

3233
03:10:54,180 --> 03:11:00,180
Name names, there was Steve, there, there was Dan, there was Steel Viper, there was, you know, all those people, all those guys.

3234
03:11:00,180 --> 03:11:02,180
Yeah, all the boys. All the good old boys.

3235
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:05,180
All the boys. All the, all the little baby boys.

3236
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:06,180
They became friends.

3237
03:11:06,180 --> 03:11:18,180
And so now, and now, and so now I'm at this head of a cult, a secret club cult called the Golden Child Foundry with a bunch of old, like, like, it's comprised of, like, veteran PCP fans who are good people and I like them.

3238
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:30,180
So, I confronted them and, uh, basically there was, like, there was, like, a Magna Carta constructed and they basically told me that the PCP was shit for this, this, and this reasons.

3239
03:11:30,180 --> 03:11:35,180
And, uh, all of them made complete sense and I had been thanking them for a while.

3240
03:11:35,180 --> 03:11:41,180
And so, it just slid right in my mind that the PCP was bad.

3241
03:11:41,180 --> 03:11:43,180
Yup, super bad.

3242
03:11:43,180 --> 03:11:44,180
Yeah.

3243
03:11:44,180 --> 03:11:46,180
Um, yeah, I read the Magna Carta.

3244
03:11:46,180 --> 03:11:47,180
Yeah.

3245
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:52,180
And there was a bunch of good stuff in there and then we did not, like, do any of it.

3246
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:53,180
We did?

3247
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:54,180
Okay, okay.

3248
03:11:54,180 --> 03:11:55,180
We did some.

3249
03:11:55,180 --> 03:12:02,180
There have been things that we've done that have definitely helped the issue immensely.

3250
03:12:02,180 --> 03:12:09,180
Uh, I mean, I mean, I don't know the structure of how I want to discuss the topic.

3251
03:12:09,180 --> 03:12:15,180
Uh, since we are on the procrastinator's channel right now.

3252
03:12:15,180 --> 03:12:16,180
Uh, whatever.

3253
03:12:16,180 --> 03:12:17,180
Yeah.

3254
03:12:17,180 --> 03:12:19,180
Uh, we're inside baseball.

3255
03:12:19,180 --> 03:12:21,180
We're inside baseball.

3256
03:12:21,180 --> 03:12:22,180
Real raw shit.

3257
03:12:22,180 --> 03:12:24,180
Uh, I mean, okay, okay, okay.

3258
03:12:24,180 --> 03:12:32,180
I, the main reason I wanted to bring this up is because the right-finger scot killers is the best thing to ever happen to, like, society.

3259
03:12:32,180 --> 03:12:33,180
Uh-huh.

3260
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:35,180
And I wanted to compare and contrast it.

3261
03:12:35,180 --> 03:12:36,180
It's now achieved that status.

3262
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:37,180
Yeah, yeah.

3263
03:12:37,180 --> 03:12:45,180
Uh, and I wanted to compare and contrast it to the PCP in terms of, like, effort and stuff.

3264
03:12:45,180 --> 03:12:46,180
Yeah.

3265
03:12:46,180 --> 03:13:00,180
Uh, but, but, but to do that, I think, I think I had to lay down some groundwork to the people who, like, like, are, are, have not been, like, like, like, rattled with this line of thinking constantly for the past, like, months, like I have.

3266
03:13:00,180 --> 03:13:05,180
And I think you understand, like, a firm grasp of it as well, too.

3267
03:13:05,180 --> 03:13:09,180
So, I, I mean, I guess I'll just jump right into it.

3268
03:13:09,180 --> 03:13:21,180
Uh, I think the PCP has become super stagnant and super, uh, like, like, samey and super boilerplate and super uninteresting and flaccid and, and, and boring.

3269
03:13:21,180 --> 03:13:23,180
Mmm, yeah.

3270
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:25,180
Do you, do you agree?

3271
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:41,180
Well, I see what you mean, but I don't know if it's that the PCP has changed as much as that it's just been going for long enough that, like, the same things have started to feel that way.

3272
03:13:41,180 --> 03:13:42,180
I don't know.

3273
03:13:42,180 --> 03:13:43,180
Okay, okay.

3274
03:13:43,180 --> 03:13:54,180
There are many things that I think have changed, like, have changed for the worse, but I do basically agree with you that it is an issue of time and that we've just been going for so long.

3275
03:13:54,180 --> 03:13:58,180
I think that that's, like, the core, like, hidden issue.

3276
03:13:58,180 --> 03:13:59,180
Yeah.

3277
03:13:59,180 --> 03:14:13,180
That, like, behind all the things that I would like to institute and change, that's, like, the main thing that I think is an undeniable, like, like, like, I don't, like, I mean, how, like, how can I fix that we've been going for a long time?

3278
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:14,180
Yeah.

3279
03:14:14,180 --> 03:14:15,180
There's not, there's not much I can do.

3280
03:14:15,180 --> 03:14:20,180
So, I would prefer to focus on, like, the practical, you know, uh, tangible details.

3281
03:14:20,180 --> 03:14:21,180
Mm-hmm.

3282
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:25,180
Uh, I mean, here, let me just get up a Magna Carta right now.

3283
03:14:25,180 --> 03:14:27,180
In fact, let me do that right now.

3284
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:30,180
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3285
03:14:30,180 --> 03:14:34,180
You're, you are literally always in a pictorial situation.

3286
03:14:34,180 --> 03:14:36,180
This is not, I did not intend for this to happen.

3287
03:14:36,180 --> 03:14:38,180
Do not, ah!

3288
03:14:38,180 --> 03:14:40,180
Ugh.

3289
03:14:40,180 --> 03:14:42,180
Fuck.

3290
03:14:42,180 --> 03:14:44,180
Sorry, I just keep screaming.

3291
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:46,180
I just, I just keep screaming.

3292
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:47,180
It's like radcons.

3293
03:14:47,180 --> 03:14:50,180
Yeah, it's like radcons all over again.

3294
03:14:51,180 --> 03:14:53,180
All right, all right, all right.

3295
03:14:53,180 --> 03:14:55,180
Got it over here.

3296
03:14:55,180 --> 03:14:56,180
Okay.

3297
03:14:56,180 --> 03:15:00,180
So, reasons why the PCP is boring and stagnant.

3298
03:15:00,180 --> 03:15:03,180
Uh, article number one of the Magna Carta.

3299
03:15:03,180 --> 03:15:05,180
Everything is boring and no one cares.

3300
03:15:05,180 --> 03:15:15,180
Uh, this is, uh, this, this just goes in detail about how the topics, uh, like, like, like, I, I think this is Aeroids who said it eloquently.

3301
03:15:15,180 --> 03:15:17,180
Or, sorry.

3302
03:15:17,180 --> 03:15:19,180
I guess I haven't used these.

3303
03:15:19,180 --> 03:15:22,180
People don't want their names be, uh, associated with this.

3304
03:15:22,180 --> 03:15:24,180
Um, but I'm not gonna edit it.

3305
03:15:24,180 --> 03:15:25,180
Hell yeah.

3306
03:15:25,180 --> 03:15:27,180
So sorry.

3307
03:15:27,180 --> 03:15:29,180
Um, but, but, yeah.

3308
03:15:29,180 --> 03:15:30,180
Uh, fuck.

3309
03:15:30,180 --> 03:15:31,180
That's what you get.

3310
03:15:31,180 --> 03:15:32,180
That's what you get with the raw shit.

3311
03:15:32,180 --> 03:15:33,180
Yeah, the raw shit.

3312
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:35,180
Sometimes you taste some sewage.

3313
03:15:35,180 --> 03:15:36,180
Mm-hmm.

3314
03:15:36,180 --> 03:15:43,180
Um, it was like, like before, um, the topics necessitated a podcast were like,

3315
03:15:43,180 --> 03:15:45,180
earn the early days of the PCP.

3316
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:47,180
Like, every episode would be like,

3317
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:49,180
we were talking about this in the chat.

3318
03:15:49,180 --> 03:15:52,180
And, like, we, we were fucking, we're brimming, we're brimming at the seams.

3319
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:53,180
Like, well, we've gotta talk about this.

3320
03:15:53,180 --> 03:15:58,180
This is the shit that we've been brewing on and we've been discussing amongst ourselves for fucking eons.

3321
03:15:58,180 --> 03:16:01,180
And we've gotta get it out there to the fucking masses.

3322
03:16:01,180 --> 03:16:02,180
Mm-hmm.

3323
03:16:02,180 --> 03:16:04,180
You got shit like fucking, how much are rules?

3324
03:16:04,180 --> 03:16:05,180
Legendary.

3325
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:06,180
Fucking legendary.

3326
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:11,180
Like, like, like the very first episode, best game ever, was just Nate was thinking about it a while.

3327
03:16:11,180 --> 03:16:13,180
All into a call to do it.

3328
03:16:13,180 --> 03:16:15,180
Fucking, like, a ton of shit like that.

3329
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:16,180
Yeah.

3330
03:16:16,180 --> 03:16:19,180
Where it's just, you guys were talking in chat and like, we gotta make a podcast about this.

3331
03:16:19,180 --> 03:16:27,180
Now, the podcast necessitates a topic where each week will like, okay, it's, it's taken for granted that we will do a PCP.

3332
03:16:27,180 --> 03:16:29,180
What are we gonna do a PCP on?

3333
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:32,180
And we, it's not like we look back, okay, what are we thinking about through the week?

3334
03:16:32,180 --> 03:16:36,180
It's like, well, we have a preordained list of topics here.

3335
03:16:36,180 --> 03:16:40,180
Let's just randomly pick one based on what we are in the, in the, in the appetite for.

3336
03:16:40,180 --> 03:16:41,180
Yeah.

3337
03:16:41,180 --> 03:16:45,180
Um, it's, it's true.

3338
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:46,180
It's true.

3339
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:50,180
It has now become a fact of life that a PCP is happening.

3340
03:16:50,180 --> 03:16:55,180
And we just have to accommodate that however we can.

3341
03:16:55,180 --> 03:16:57,180
Ah, hmm.

3342
03:16:57,180 --> 03:16:58,180
Yeah.

3343
03:16:58,180 --> 03:16:59,180
Yeah.

3344
03:16:59,180 --> 03:17:05,180
I mean, maybe, maybe we should try to like, you know, use the-

3345
03:17:05,180 --> 03:17:16,180
Use the, use the fact that like we're talking in chat more as like a foundation for picking topics better.

3346
03:17:16,180 --> 03:17:17,180
Like, what are we talking about?

3347
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:19,180
We should podcast about that.

3348
03:17:19,180 --> 03:17:21,180
We actually have been.

3349
03:17:21,180 --> 03:17:25,180
And so this is all like, this is all kind of old hat.

3350
03:17:25,180 --> 03:17:26,180
Well, not old hat.

3351
03:17:26,180 --> 03:17:29,180
I think a lot of these problems are still, are still-

3352
03:17:29,180 --> 03:17:30,180
No, fuck crap!

3353
03:17:30,180 --> 03:17:31,180
Ah!

3354
03:17:33,180 --> 03:17:34,180
Oh, okay.

3355
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:35,180
Excuse me.

3356
03:17:35,180 --> 03:17:36,180
Excuse me.

3357

Excuse me.

3360
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:40,180
Excuse me.

3361
03:17:40,180 --> 03:17:41,180
Excuse me.

3362
03:17:41,180 --> 03:17:42,180
Excuse me.

3363
03:17:42,180 --> 03:17:43,180
Excuse me.

3364
03:17:43,180 --> 03:17:44,180
Excuse me.

3365
03:17:44,180 --> 03:17:45,180
Excuse me.

3366
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:46,180
Excuse me.

3367
03:17:46,180 --> 03:17:47,180
Excuse me.

3368
03:17:47,180 --> 03:17:48,180
Excuse me.

3369
03:17:48,180 --> 03:17:49,180
Excuse me.

3370
03:17:49,180 --> 03:17:50,180
Excuse me.

3371
03:17:50,180 --> 03:17:51,180
Excuse me.

3372
03:17:51,180 --> 03:17:52,180
Excuse me.

3373
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:53,180
Excuse me.

3374
03:17:53,180 --> 03:18:02,180
Excuse me.

3375
03:18:02,180 --> 03:18:06,820
about you know we've had stuff like sex and you know like that I feel strong

3376
03:18:06,820 --> 03:18:12,500
about obviously we had you know we've had recent topics where we care a lot of

3377
03:18:12,500 --> 03:18:16,780
it I'm worried about it I don't think it's it's it's reached the same like you

3378
03:18:16,780 --> 03:18:21,700
know we were talking about this in chat and so we brought up but we have the

3379
03:18:21,700 --> 03:18:26,940
potential to change that now so I think we're on the up and up on that yeah yeah

3380
03:18:26,940 --> 03:18:31,260
keep in mind viewers the reason I'm saying all this is even though I think

3381
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:34,140
we're on the right track I still think that there are problems we can fix and

3382
03:18:34,140 --> 03:18:39,700
also this is where I forget to get the real shit and also I want to talk about

3383
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:42,900
how cool right because capitalism is compared to the PCP that that's why I'm

3384
03:18:42,900 --> 03:18:46,740
trying to get across here so keep that in mind with all these article 2 the

3385
03:18:46,740 --> 03:18:52,940
topics are too broad the fucking topics like like most of these like almost all

3386
03:18:52,940 --> 03:18:59,140
of the problems generate from either the bureaucracy of the PCP and how it's like

3387
03:18:59,140 --> 03:19:07,020
weirdly like democratic and like and like bureaucracy defined and like paperwork

3388
03:19:07,020 --> 03:19:12,940
heavy yeah it is it has become a well-oiled machine yeah and by well

3389
03:19:12,940 --> 03:19:21,100
old machine we mean bogged down and needless paperwork yeah a night a

3390
03:19:21,100 --> 03:19:26,860
nightmare dystopia where nothing is ever when nothing ever changes and nightmare

3391
03:19:26,860 --> 03:19:33,540
you can't wake up from but yes oh yes so it comes from bureaucracy or topics and

3392
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:39,500
topics are far easier to you know change so the topics are too broad and this

3393
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:45,180
this this was actually like this is actually pretty well quashed because the

3394
03:19:45,180 --> 03:19:50,180
this was taken at a point when we were doing shit like hey let me just go to

3395
03:19:50,180 --> 03:19:55,620
the channel reason that I went back and like and like and like looked at all the

3396
03:19:55,620 --> 03:20:01,260
PCP episodes like calculate when things went wrong and I notice like like from

3397
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:08,540
like around like like like the mid like 60s till like like the 90s we were

3398
03:20:08,540 --> 03:20:13,980
talking about like bullshit philosophical nothingness that like didn't

3399
03:20:13,980 --> 03:20:19,340
matter at all mm-hmm and and and so we got we started talking about like

3400
03:20:19,340 --> 03:20:25,380
fucking gay ass shit that was not really relevant to anyone that just that

3401
03:20:25,380 --> 03:20:30,860
just like like that like just start off way too broad and we always floundered to

3402
03:20:30,860 --> 03:20:36,540
figure out how like like like what to say on the topic and it turned out boring

3403
03:20:36,540 --> 03:20:41,380
and stupid like like key example this is monsters way too like a broad and like

3404
03:20:41,380 --> 03:20:44,820
like like what are we gonna say about monsters like what do you mean by monsters

3405
03:20:44,820 --> 03:20:49,420
what is happening right now let's just look at funny images and it was awful

3406
03:20:49,420 --> 03:20:56,500
yeah yeah it was truly a wake-up call yeah monsters was totally a wake-up call

3407
03:20:56,500 --> 03:21:02,940
and in all ways we were like guys this something's gone wrong

3408
03:21:04,940 --> 03:21:12,220
I want to read most of this basically I mean all the news we said it was I felt

3409
03:21:12,220 --> 03:21:17,660
it was stagnant for a while and we're taking steps to do that but here's the

3410
03:21:17,660 --> 03:21:23,380
point here's the point here the right focus cop killers its entire brand and

3411
03:21:23,380 --> 03:21:30,620
like reason why it's good is because again it's fucking genre to find you

3412
03:21:30,620 --> 03:21:33,500
never know what you're gonna get when you fucking click our focus cop killers

3413
03:21:33,500 --> 03:21:36,820
video it can be a it can be a let's play like it will always be like you know

3414
03:21:36,820 --> 03:21:39,980
there's like a game in the background but you never know what kind of topics

3415
03:21:39,980 --> 03:21:43,260
you're gonna get you never know what we're gonna have you never know when

3416
03:21:43,260 --> 03:21:48,060
we're gonna launch in to fucking into which color is the PCP you never know

3417
03:21:48,060 --> 03:21:52,140
when you're gonna get that shit when you say genre you mean genre defying like

3418
03:21:52,140 --> 03:22:00,780
like genre busting like it has no no god ah shit I wish I was dead I just yeah

3419
03:22:00,780 --> 03:22:09,460
like that hate that orange so much time to climb the devil's staircase once

3420
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:18,300
again anyway yes genre busting no no rules no rules and like there's there's

3421
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:22,860
no other let's play that operates in such a fluid and dynamic manner such as

3422
03:22:22,860 --> 03:22:30,380
us there's no there's no one that's so fucking meandering and and broad and

3423
03:22:30,380 --> 03:22:36,980
fucking we are we are literally kill the kill we are no other no other let's play

3424
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:41,180
where if you don't like someone in the comments you can go to our discord and

3425
03:22:41,180 --> 03:22:52,260
literally shoot and kill them it's it's it's legendary and the thing is like

3426
03:22:52,260 --> 03:22:56,140
like all all this creativity and like effort we're putting in to the right

3427
03:22:56,140 --> 03:22:59,860
first cop killers because we're putting in like a crazy amount of effort you you

3428
03:22:59,860 --> 03:23:06,940
more so than me yeah I've been I've been working on on shit but yeah we're

3429
03:23:06,940 --> 03:23:11,140
really like we're putting in we're putting in saying ours to get this shit

3430
03:23:11,140 --> 03:23:16,120
just perfect in in the discord I I've been thinking about fucking you know

3431
03:23:16,120 --> 03:23:20,940
YouTube and you should do twitch we we we've both been like you know brother

3432
03:23:20,940 --> 03:23:24,620
for this has been we've been going over time we've been going over time we've

3433
03:23:24,620 --> 03:23:28,340
been going over time because we genuinely care of the product and and and we're

3434
03:23:28,340 --> 03:23:34,900
constantly we're constantly doing a new creative crazy shit I feel like the PCP

3435
03:23:34,900 --> 03:23:40,900
is not crazy new shit no the point not really like whenever something new

3436
03:23:40,900 --> 03:23:45,700
happens like when Tom made that like D&D attack video I was excited about it and

3437
03:23:45,700 --> 03:23:49,540
I went and I made my response video and that was like a breath of fresh air for

3438
03:23:49,540 --> 03:23:55,460
me at least but that kind of thing I mean it still happens but not as much like

3439
03:23:55,460 --> 03:24:00,580
the PCP has kind of calcified in what in terms of what it is and like what it

3440
03:24:00,580 --> 03:24:08,980
contains which is not good it's that's that's not a good setup for success like

3441
03:24:08,980 --> 03:24:15,100
that's not what it should be about I feel like we've reached a point where like

3442
03:24:15,100 --> 03:24:20,860
the podcast itself is solidified and like pretty like like you know standard

3443
03:24:20,860 --> 03:24:24,500
and like you can pretty much guarantee like what's gonna be on each episode like

3444
03:24:24,500 --> 03:24:28,660
you know to start open the Urban Dictionary we're gonna we're gonna you know

3445
03:24:28,660 --> 03:24:33,500
try and find our footing for a while it's gonna bring up we're utilitarianism

3446
03:24:33,500 --> 03:24:36,540
for no reason and we'll be great and we'll argue about that for like 30

3447
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:44,300
minutes yeah and yeah everyone goes home happy yeah yeah but even though the

3448
03:24:44,300 --> 03:24:50,860
podcast has reached that sort of standard you know appeal like everything

3449
03:24:50,860 --> 03:24:56,860
outside of that is like new and like pretty refreshing like like like like

3450
03:24:56,860 --> 03:25:02,940
Digi even though I'm not totally pleased with what is happening with him he is

3451
03:25:02,940 --> 03:25:09,860
undeniably doing new crazy stuff yeah true and and and and and and and you know

3452
03:25:09,860 --> 03:25:13,860
I'm working on that thing with Hippo which is like a completely like that's

3453
03:25:13,860 --> 03:25:19,700
like gonna be like a new thing like like like that kind of thing has not really

3454
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:25,060
happened in the PCP yet no at least unlike you know well and there's been

3455
03:25:25,060 --> 03:25:31,060
there's been a bit like I mean it's yeah it's not it's not gonna fucking break the

3456
03:25:31,060 --> 03:25:34,740
world with how fucking revolutionary is but it's it's definitely like a like a

3457
03:25:34,740 --> 03:25:41,460
new like a new step to doing the thing yeah like shredded before absolutely

3458
03:25:41,460 --> 03:25:47,180
yeah I'm not hyped up too much maybe you know I'm saying like like there's new

3459
03:25:47,220 --> 03:25:54,060
stuff like and like ten pieces and draw what the fuck dude ten pieces and draw is

3460
03:25:54,060 --> 03:25:59,340
the newest hottest shit and it is a property that I'm so invested in and

3461
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:02,860
that is why it's gonna take forever before it comes out because I will not

3462
03:26:02,860 --> 03:26:09,380
release it until it is as good and as professional as it possibly can be and

3463
03:26:09,380 --> 03:26:15,180
and so we've reached that this point where like the PCP like like like podcast

3464
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:20,620
itself is probably like you know like fine and whatever but like everything

3465
03:26:20,620 --> 03:26:24,460
happened around it is super fucking interesting and here is where I bring

3466
03:26:24,460 --> 03:26:28,580
in my fucking point that will I've actually tricked you the PCP is actually

3467
03:26:28,580 --> 03:26:33,420
perfect because it's it's it's this understandable it's just understandable

3468
03:26:33,420 --> 03:26:40,700
and and like you know what's the word what's like the word no it cannot

3469
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:46,580
recollect when it began the same thing like five times around now where you

3470
03:26:46,580 --> 03:26:51,260
just like like you've got up there you flounder well that time I actually got

3471
03:26:51,260 --> 03:26:56,060
up on the rocks above Emily like I was I did better that time you're right but I

3472
03:26:56,060 --> 03:27:00,900
still fucked it up inexplicably we don't mean you know the first time I went up

3473
03:27:00,900 --> 03:27:04,780
there I took it slow and I it was pretty successful so I think I should do that

3474
03:27:04,780 --> 03:27:11,460
again okay anyway you have a PCP is perfect agreed the PC is perfect

3475
03:27:11,460 --> 03:27:18,540
because it's it's it's a it's because of Koensburg it's it's fucking what I'm

3476
03:27:18,540 --> 03:27:23,500
I'm I'm thinking I'm my brain is correct but my but I don't have the correct

3477
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:28,620
vocabulary it's it's like it's like what did you use to describe the

3478
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:33,900
asher sport and McDonald's as it's it's it's like you understand what it is and

3479
03:27:33,900 --> 03:27:38,980
like it's it's normal it's it's what's the fucking word he used what are you

3480
03:27:38,980 --> 03:27:42,940
fucking say familiar comfortable familiar it's familiar yeah you like you

3481
03:27:42,940 --> 03:27:47,140
understand what the PCP is gonna be and while it might not be you know a fucking

3482
03:27:47,140 --> 03:27:54,820
crazy new experience it still is it as it has always been besides the parts where

3483
03:27:54,820 --> 03:27:59,260
it's been shit and boring yeah it's always been a meeting of creative minds

3484
03:27:59,260 --> 03:28:06,820
and it's always been people you know our art and I feel like the fact the fact

3485
03:28:06,820 --> 03:28:12,220
that we're all women with you I think we're all I should say I feel this way

3486
03:28:12,220 --> 03:28:16,100
so I'm going to project it upon other people because I vaguely know it to be

3487
03:28:16,100 --> 03:28:22,860
true on like some level I I really feel like we're doing fucking God's work and

3488
03:28:22,900 --> 03:28:27,020
we're doing new crazy shit with the fucking right fuckers cop killers yes

3489
03:28:27,020 --> 03:28:33,580
just one example yeah like and and and the PCP is is facilitating that the PCP

3490
03:28:33,580 --> 03:28:39,140
is allowing this to take place it's allowing us to bring like you know our

3491
03:28:39,140 --> 03:28:43,260
minds together in a week on a weekly basis and we're allowing us to stay

3492
03:28:43,260 --> 03:28:47,900
friends and allowing us to use that as a launch pad to bigger and greater things

3493
03:28:47,900 --> 03:28:52,780
well you know well I can be sad that you know sure I don't think the podcast is

3494
03:28:52,820 --> 03:28:57,740
like a super you know great piece of art as as I believe it once was it's

3495
03:28:57,740 --> 03:29:03,140
facilitating bigger and better things and has ever been done before you know to

3496
03:29:03,140 --> 03:29:08,580
me munchie that's what the PCP has always been like the PCP was never like an

3497
03:29:08,580 --> 03:29:14,420
end in and of itself the PCP was a way for us to stay friends and also like a

3498
03:29:14,420 --> 03:29:18,980
platform for people like you know find us through to facilitate the other stuff

3499
03:29:18,980 --> 03:29:30,580
we wanted to do you know I okay I agree but I feel like the PCP has like had okay

3500
03:29:30,580 --> 03:29:39,260
the PCP okay what I'm going to describe the term PCP as the podcast and I'm

3501
03:29:39,260 --> 03:29:43,340
gonna use the term procrastinators as just us okay obviously so I can

3502
03:29:43,340 --> 03:29:49,820
differentiate these things sure I feel like the PCP at one point had like a

3503
03:29:49,820 --> 03:29:55,980
die-hard fan base like like like of like actual like fans of the podcast and

3504
03:29:55,980 --> 03:29:59,420
while the podcast was of course sold on our personalities and friendship

3505
03:29:59,420 --> 03:30:05,060
basically entirely it was like there's no doubt like that the podcast itself had

3506
03:30:05,060 --> 03:30:09,420
like an extremely influential role in getting those people invested in us and

3507
03:30:09,420 --> 03:30:13,980
our relationship with one another yeah but I feel like the actual like fan base

3508
03:30:13,980 --> 03:30:20,220
of the PCP has diminished well like the procrastinators fan base well maybe not

3509
03:30:20,220 --> 03:30:26,100
has like drastically like skyrocket or anything I feel like there's more there's

3510
03:30:26,100 --> 03:30:32,500
more hypocrite fans now and there's more like been saint fans and there are PCP

3511
03:30:32,500 --> 03:30:40,180
fans now at least that's how I feel I agree I don't think yeah I feel like yeah

3512
03:30:40,180 --> 03:30:45,220
you're saying that like enthusiasm for the podcast in and of itself has waned

3513
03:30:45,220 --> 03:30:52,220
mm-hmm but like well you know if that's true then I think that's a worthwhile

3514
03:30:52,220 --> 03:30:59,220
trade-off like I think I think that our stuff that we do our art is the is more

3515
03:30:59,220 --> 03:31:03,000
important than the podcast in and of itself I mean I like the PCP you know

3516
03:31:03,000 --> 03:31:06,420
I've worked really hard on the PCP on like you know doing stuff and making

3517
03:31:06,420 --> 03:31:11,060
stuff for it and like you know I want it to be a success and I want it to be you

3518
03:31:11,060 --> 03:31:14,460
know good and enjoyable and something that people like and they're excited to

3519
03:31:14,460 --> 03:31:23,620
hear but I mean if the PCP had to die or not die but like you know if I guess

3520
03:31:23,620 --> 03:31:29,900
I'm saying is I would like I would I would I would accept a loss to the PCP

3521
03:31:29,900 --> 03:31:37,140
for like a gain to like us as individuals you know because it's about us we

3522
03:31:37,140 --> 03:31:43,100
are I completely agree I know this was kind of scatterbrained to follow but

3523
03:31:43,100 --> 03:31:51,500
just just know that like for like the past couple months my concern talks

3524
03:31:51,500 --> 03:32:07,500
about this but I kind of like well again like like it's been really like you

3525
03:32:07,500 --> 03:32:12,700
know I really hate it and I've been really trying to you know push myself to

3526
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:17,220
like you know find ways and like and like develop methods to like fix it and

3527
03:32:17,220 --> 03:32:21,300
you know make make you know make it great things right make it great again

3528
03:32:21,300 --> 03:32:28,780
yeah but maybe that's not really what I should be doing and I don't think that

3529
03:32:28,780 --> 03:32:33,020
our focus is focusing I think that our focus should not be on the PCP itself

3530
03:32:33,020 --> 03:32:35,940
it's like not that we shouldn't focus on it or think about it or try to make it

3531
03:32:35,940 --> 03:32:43,140
good but it's not the most important thing yeah I that's how I feel now too I

3532
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:50,180
feel I feel a sense of like okay the PCP has I feel like it's gone out of it's

3533
03:32:50,180 --> 03:32:54,660
like it's like okay we're like fucking like episodes like I'm just gonna

3534
03:32:54,660 --> 03:33:02,900
throw out a number like fucking like you know 60 to like 90 we're like pretty

3535
03:33:02,900 --> 03:33:07,180
fucking that was like a drought of like good shit with like a few things that

3536
03:33:07,180 --> 03:33:11,020
were that that punctuate like that my little pony one that was great you know

3537
03:33:11,020 --> 03:33:15,020
there were a few ones that were nice but overall it was kind of a slump in

3538
03:33:15,020 --> 03:33:21,540
quality fucking okay okay okay here I have the perfect one everything from

3539
03:33:21,540 --> 03:33:33,700
fucking the drama podcast to fucking I think it culminated in like the holiday

3540
03:33:33,700 --> 03:33:43,780
special like everything there was like like unbelievably awful and gay sick but

3541
03:33:43,780 --> 03:33:50,500
I feel like we've reached like a fine level and like like the PCP like like

3542
03:33:50,500 --> 03:33:55,180
like as Nate always said it was just an excuse for us to talk more yeah and we

3543
03:33:55,180 --> 03:34:01,660
are talking more now you know do your ad con and and we're making cool ass shit

3544
03:34:01,660 --> 03:34:09,420
so you know what I guess I'm fine the um I mean if we're being chums and if we

3545
03:34:09,420 --> 03:34:12,660
like like each other and are talking to each other and having a good time with

3546
03:34:12,660 --> 03:34:17,740
that I think what will naturally occur as a result is that our conversations on

3547
03:34:17,740 --> 03:34:22,660
the PCP will become more lively and more enjoyable you know what I mean I know

3548
03:34:22,660 --> 03:34:29,980
you mean I think like like it really was it really like like I feel like I was

3549
03:34:29,980 --> 03:34:34,540
being too harsh on the PCP and and more so than I was being harsh I was not I

3550
03:34:34,540 --> 03:34:41,060
was I was thinking about like like the broad the broad problem was like even

3551
03:34:41,060 --> 03:34:45,340
though I knew it and I preached it I didn't like fully like like understand

3552
03:34:45,340 --> 03:34:50,500
how much of a difference it made that we just weren't talking yeah because like

3553
03:34:50,500 --> 03:34:57,420
instantly now it seems like we are just fucking like like we have too many topics

3554
03:34:57,460 --> 03:35:04,780
for the first time in like forever like because like like like they're like last

3555
03:35:04,780 --> 03:35:12,480
me we actually had like we had to decide among three topics that we wanted to do

3556
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:16,860
desperately and we're like okay which ones do we want to do first and we had

3557
03:35:16,860 --> 03:35:21,060
to decide it based on that whereas like like you know before it was like it was

3558
03:35:21,060 --> 03:35:24,500
like someone think it's something to pop someone picked something and whatever

3559
03:35:24,900 --> 03:35:32,260
yeah yeah yeah yeah shit cookin yeah and I'm really happy about it and that's

3560
03:35:32,260 --> 03:35:37,500
why mad because I didn't get to do the topic that I wanted to do whatever we'll

3561
03:35:37,500 --> 03:35:43,340
do it I was I was encouraging that one if I think that was a great one I mean we

3562
03:35:43,340 --> 03:35:49,180
could still do it I guess although although it'd be less topical that was

3563
03:35:49,180 --> 03:35:52,380
like super topical right then so I thought if there was ever a time to do

3564
03:35:52,460 --> 03:36:04,500
it should be then but what fuck Christ anyway that that that labyrinth

3565
03:36:04,500 --> 03:36:10,700
conversation the end point of all that naysay and papoey and you know saying

3566
03:36:10,700 --> 03:36:15,540
the PCP is bad even though it's my job and I like it a lot and I was a fan of

3567
03:36:15,540 --> 03:36:18,900
it and that's the entire reason that I have a livelihood is that I like the

3568
03:36:18,900 --> 03:36:28,300
PCP too much oh that god video games are so bad look at that human in the pot

3569
03:36:28,300 --> 03:36:35,820
it's gay oh the human in the pot is like apparently he's he too is a stock asset

3570
03:36:35,820 --> 03:36:44,300
he's like unity male model number one or something he too is a unity asset I

3571
03:36:44,340 --> 03:36:50,940
I can't that's the name my autobiography he I kind of want to play sexy hiking the

3572
03:36:50,940 --> 03:36:57,220
game that this is like based on it look it's like really like crappy like pixel

3573
03:36:57,220 --> 03:37:05,620
looking yes you know I think wretzu pray wretzu prayed someone who was let's

3574
03:37:05,620 --> 03:37:13,020
play sexy hiking yeah it's um I've never heard of it before I feel like it's

3575
03:37:13,020 --> 03:37:19,180
probably gotten a little more noticed now that this game is out although I'm

3576
03:37:19,180 --> 03:37:22,660
sure people didn't know about it I'm sure I'm sure people knew about it before

3577
03:37:22,660 --> 03:37:30,940
but I don't know it just looks like this game but like a lot like rougher but

3578
03:37:30,940 --> 03:37:36,500
yeah okay I've decided like this ladder works better when I kind of like fling

3579
03:37:36,500 --> 03:37:45,460
myself up it instead of like trying to like slowly fuck my way up okay we've

3580
03:37:45,460 --> 03:37:55,380
already failed then have I oh ah ha who's a failure now mom

3581
03:37:57,380 --> 03:38:06,140
then yeah okay enough enough about the PCP enough about our livelihood enough

3582
03:38:06,180 --> 03:38:10,060
about working enough about creativity it's time for the only shit that actually

3583
03:38:10,060 --> 03:38:15,980
matters fucking Pokemon go Pokemon go dude um I got an Ampharos I went out

Pokemon go players like hard to come by and like it's hard to do raids and like

3590
03:38:50,580 --> 03:38:54,020
you like you can't really get everyone organized in like a convenient way and

3591
03:38:54,020 --> 03:38:59,020
like you only see people you know out and about but on fucking Marie day I

3592
03:38:59,020 --> 03:39:04,060
would like like a density populated like park called Babbo Park um hashtag

3669
03:46:48,500 --> 03:46:52,660
way that God fucking intended the world to be it's the way God intended Pokemon

go to be it's perfect it's perfect Boston was great

3671
03:46:56,140 --> 03:47:03,180
Pokemon go yeah San Diego is pretty gay dude a bin I have been to no less than

3672
03:47:03,180 --> 03:47:10,500
seven Latios raids at hatch and no one's fucking showed up not a single god

3673
03:47:10,500 --> 03:47:17,620
damn person I have never even been to a raid not a single one no dude they're

3674
03:47:17,620 --> 03:47:22,420
really fun they're really fucking fun they're really great they're this

3675
03:47:23,180 --> 03:47:29,020
dude okay raids in Boston solidified the fact that Pokemon go is like the best

3676
03:47:29,020 --> 03:47:34,260
game ever made to me because it was so fucking cool to walk up to a raid to get

3677
03:47:34,260 --> 03:47:39,460
like a fucking grout on and then see all these geeks and gamers hanging out in

3678
03:47:39,460 --> 03:47:42,740
real life and then you walk up and they'd be like hey they'd be like yeah

3679
03:47:42,740 --> 03:47:48,060
dude I mean my second fucking ground on the first one had good IV so I hope this

3680
03:47:48,100 --> 03:47:53,100
windows too and you can talk about like fucking nerd shit in real life and it

3681
03:47:53,100 --> 03:47:56,900
was great and you could be chic in a hipster at your fucking local Starbucks

3682
03:47:56,900 --> 03:48:00,700
and charge up your phone and fucking like mindless to tap on your phone we

3683
03:48:00,700 --> 03:48:04,460
spoke one go has a bad combat system but it's okay so it facilitates social

3684
03:48:04,460 --> 03:48:10,460
interaction and it was Pokemon go had a good combat system it would be so much

3685
03:48:10,460 --> 03:48:15,580
of a better game I would be so much more incentivized to play it I'm actually

3686
03:48:15,580 --> 03:48:19,340
planning well and my plan I mean vaguely have thought about it once or

3687
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:24,420
twice and have the capacity to do so so I might do it one day make like a

3688
03:48:24,420 --> 03:48:30,020
Pokemon go like fucking like review or something you know he's like I care so

3689
03:48:30,020 --> 03:48:33,740
deeply about it like it's it's seriously consumed all of my life do you know

3690
03:48:33,740 --> 03:48:38,060
what I wish more than anything I wish the Pokemon go just worked like regular

3691
03:48:38,060 --> 03:48:45,540
Pokemon I okay okay here's here's what would be like the bombshell like fuck

3692
03:48:45,540 --> 03:48:51,460
you if you ever even look at me in my Pokemon go review is people are always

3693
03:48:51,460 --> 03:48:55,700
like well of course they had the simplified the combat system because

3694
03:48:55,700 --> 03:49:00,780
did they like like like like people are always like you know like obviously like

3695
03:49:00,780 --> 03:49:04,460
you know it's a mobile game of course that is simplified to you know to reach

3696
03:49:04,460 --> 03:49:14,860
you know the casual audience top 50 highest selling games of all time seven

3697
03:49:14,860 --> 03:49:22,060
slots are Pokemon in the top selling games of all time I think normal Pokemon

3698
03:49:22,060 --> 03:49:26,060
has a pretty broad reach you fucking idiots yeah they could have they could

3699
03:49:26,060 --> 03:49:30,060
have done it they could have made combat work like in a regular Pokemon and then

3700
03:49:30,060 --> 03:49:33,900
like you could have had fucking you could have fucking battled your friends

3701
03:49:33,900 --> 03:49:37,740
and in turn-based battles and it would have been like easier like it would have

3702
03:49:37,740 --> 03:49:41,500
been easier and it would have been so much better because it would have felt

3703
03:49:41,500 --> 03:49:46,140
like a Pokemon game I mean I'm not saying like I don't hate Pokemon go I

3704
03:49:46,140 --> 03:49:50,220
don't hate what it is I think it would have been better if they hadn't tried so

3705
03:49:50,220 --> 03:49:55,180
hard to make it its own thing I I like particularly care with the social it

3706
03:49:55,180 --> 03:49:59,340
the social aspect of Pokemon go and how it facilitates me talking to new people

3707
03:49:59,580 --> 03:50:05,260
but I do like like okay okay Ben here's the world it's not the perfect world but I

3708
03:50:05,260 --> 03:50:09,820
think it's the world that is the perfect like feasible world that could like

3709
03:50:09,820 --> 03:50:17,500
realistically like probably maybe happen yeah imagine if like you had like it was

3710
03:50:17,500 --> 03:50:24,300
like Pokemon battle and you had four moves and they just were on like a like a MOBA

3711
03:50:24,380 --> 03:50:31,900
timer so you could still keep the like gimmicky like you know what casual mobile

3712
03:50:31,900 --> 03:50:37,100
phone like you know tap and there are cooldowns and you know it wouldn't be

3713
03:50:37,100 --> 03:50:41,260
like a it wouldn't be like a strict you know turn-based system because they're

3714
03:50:41,260 --> 03:50:44,940
because they're obviously not gonna do that they're too pussy to do that but if

3715
03:50:44,940 --> 03:50:49,740
you just had like a cooldown system and more moves then you would have it would

3716
03:50:49,740 --> 03:50:56,780
dramatically dramatically fix the fucking combat system and also um I seriously have no idea why

3717
03:50:56,780 --> 03:51:05,020
this is not already uh do the fucking physical special split split like already like Jesus Christ

3718
03:51:05,020 --> 03:51:11,180
why would they not do it yeah like they changed all these things and I don't know why I don't

3719
03:51:11,180 --> 03:51:16,780
know why it had to be so different I guess I mean it's like they designed it like we need to have

3720
03:51:16,780 --> 03:51:21,660
players tapping on their screen all the time like we need to have that happening because

3721
03:51:23,500 --> 03:51:34,700
I like again Pokemon is like the most casual game of all fucking time you don't need to make it like

3722
03:51:35,500 --> 03:51:42,140
because all you've done is just remove all tension from fights yeah they are just completely

3723
03:51:42,140 --> 03:51:49,180
determined like before the battle even starts like there is no strategy to be held yeah and it's

3724
03:51:49,180 --> 03:51:57,340
gay yeah it's it's it's pretty good the combat is absolutely horrendous and like like again I'm fine

3725
03:51:57,340 --> 03:52:01,580
with it because it just facilitates social interaction yeah like I still play it truly is

3726
03:52:01,580 --> 03:52:09,900
it truly is like a terrible combat system uh yeah like like just just imagine imagine you tap on a

3727
03:52:09,900 --> 03:52:15,740
gym the battle starts you just have like you know you know where like like like just like below your

3728
03:52:15,740 --> 03:52:21,500
Pokemon or something is like four moves and it's like you know uh oh scratch that has like a two

3729
03:52:21,500 --> 03:52:25,980
say like two millisecond cool down like you can do it just a ton you can tap it like you you do

3730
03:52:25,980 --> 03:52:31,900
normally or like fire but like fire fire blast has like a seven second cool down so you can only do

3731
03:52:31,900 --> 03:52:35,900
like every once in a while so you have to like strategically do I want to do a bunch of scratches

3732
03:52:35,900 --> 03:52:41,660
or do I want to do a fire blast or I also have toxic I can do a stash effect there still are stash

3733
03:52:41,660 --> 03:52:46,860
conditions in Pokemon go by the way there are still not stash conditions a staple of the Pokemon

3734
03:52:46,860 --> 03:52:54,140
series still not there yeah they just like took all this great stuff out to make room for a new

3735
03:52:54,140 --> 03:53:02,300
system that sucks oh boy yeah it's really frustrating and I mean I don't I don't know why

3736
03:53:02,300 --> 03:53:07,500
the insistence on like cooldowns and like screen tapping like I guess if you have to have that then

3737
03:53:07,500 --> 03:53:12,220
yeah your your system works like I said like I said it's not the perfect system but I feel like

3738
03:53:12,220 --> 03:53:18,620
I feel like cooldowns are like a like a like a vast step in the right direction and also like not

3739
03:53:18,620 --> 03:53:24,620
unfeasible yeah well wait isn't like like well I mean they kind of already have cooldowns it's just

3740
03:53:24,700 --> 03:53:32,300
that they have like only two moves and whatever well they're not really cool oh I thought I had

3741
03:53:32,300 --> 03:53:40,300
it's like a charge eater yeah like in the fighting game yeah well which is absolutely retarded

3742
03:53:42,860 --> 03:53:46,060
like why two moves yeah why

3743
03:53:46,860 --> 03:53:59,180
I just why hey um my ampharos has dragon pulse is that good that's the like community day event

3744
03:53:59,180 --> 03:54:04,380
only move like so series community day the pokemon you evolve during that we'll have a special move

3745
03:54:04,380 --> 03:54:10,380
so ampharos has dragon pulse um here's another reason why the pokemon go battle system is bad

3746
03:54:11,020 --> 03:54:19,100
there's literally no reason to not have stab moves and coverage literally does not matter well

3747
03:54:20,300 --> 03:54:28,060
I mean you um you might you know I used to watch uh I used to watch uh trainer tips

3748
03:54:29,020 --> 03:54:34,140
oh I love trainer tips and that guy had like oh my god that guy had like uh

3749
03:54:35,100 --> 03:54:41,660
I mean it's been a while but back in the day he he would like he would get pokemon that had like

3750
03:54:43,020 --> 03:54:47,580
like he would have like a strong grass type but then give it like strong water type moves

3751
03:54:47,580 --> 03:54:52,700
because he would anticipate that like a fire type was oh wait wait but then it's like isn't in pokemon

3752
03:54:52,700 --> 03:55:01,100
go like stab and type advantage are like the same yeah gross gross wait like like something to that

3753
03:55:01,100 --> 03:55:05,580
effect yeah like yeah it's like like like type advantage just like doesn't matter as much

3754
03:55:06,940 --> 03:55:14,460
like it kind of does but not really well it's it's more so that just like because the stats are

3755
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:22,620
like so narrow like there's just attack and defense and hp yeah and because stab is like super powerful

3756
03:55:22,620 --> 03:55:30,060
and because you are like you're basically only going to use your quick move for like most competitive

3757
03:55:30,140 --> 03:55:34,940
play and and and then just like fire off like there's no like you would never like save your

3758
03:55:34,940 --> 03:55:38,540
charge move you're just going to fire off as soon as you have it's like the bulk of it is just going

3759
03:55:38,540 --> 03:55:44,540
to be you tapping yeah and just all these different like like elements compounded upon one another

3760
03:55:44,540 --> 03:55:52,380
there's like no like you're not going to want to like save a coverage charge move for like the off

3761
03:55:52,380 --> 03:55:57,500
chance of like you can countering a pokemon that will like could benefit slightly from you having it

3762
03:55:57,500 --> 03:56:03,180
you're just going to want to be able to do like the maximum about of like raw dps yeah you can

3763
03:56:03,180 --> 03:56:10,060
with your pokemon like like just generally for any like because it's like for like a normal game

3764
03:56:10,060 --> 03:56:15,580
like in the normal pokemon you're going like like your pokemon is going to be one of a team and you're

3765
03:56:15,580 --> 03:56:21,100
going to like you know switch it out strategically and like you know move your pokemon it'll be

3766
03:56:21,100 --> 03:56:27,740
turn based and there will be strategy like pokemon go like you don't really need strategy it's just

3767
03:56:27,740 --> 03:56:33,340
tap a lot it's like the only strategy is in which pokemon you're choosing yeah exactly and like I

3768
03:56:33,340 --> 03:56:38,060
guess you could fuck up timing your charge like you could just like forget to use your charge move

3769
03:56:38,060 --> 03:56:47,420
or something yeah and that's like it that's like the extent that's like the extent of the decision

3770
03:56:47,420 --> 03:57:00,060
making the most fun I've had battling are again with raids we're like I really had to like

3771
03:57:00,620 --> 03:57:05,260
think about what pokemon I'm going to send in because I have to do the max amount of damage to

3772
03:57:05,260 --> 03:57:11,020
this fucking raid pokemon and to get that like to like to get this requires it down I have to send

3773
03:57:11,020 --> 03:57:16,300
in my best fucking jinx and I have to level up my jinx so fucking hard to get that ice move and do

3774
03:57:16,300 --> 03:57:21,660
quad damage to him I have to fucking do the most bad damage and that was the most I thought about

3775
03:57:21,660 --> 03:57:27,820
pokemon go combat was just I need a jinx I need to yeah I need to get my jinx really strong yeah

3776
03:57:28,540 --> 03:57:36,300
yeah and that's that that's that could be better to cool down so you would all be

3777
03:57:36,300 --> 03:57:41,020
Niantic would be happy because they have their weird insistence on having gimmicky mobile bullshit

3778
03:57:41,020 --> 03:57:46,380
and fucking trainers would be happy because there's there's like there's like there's it

3779
03:57:46,380 --> 03:57:50,940
steps towards being like you know traditional combat system and and like you know there is strategy

3780
03:57:52,380 --> 03:58:00,700
yeah I mean I hate it because it's not original pokemon when it totally could have been imagine

3781
03:58:00,700 --> 03:58:10,540
if it was just like playing pokemon in real life fuck it's madman I really don't know why

3782
03:58:10,540 --> 03:58:15,180
you don't know why I'm mad no no no no I don't know why it was normal pokemon

3783
03:58:16,060 --> 03:58:20,460
like the system works and it would totally work in a mobile format like there's nothing

3784
03:58:20,460 --> 03:58:26,700
stopping it from from just being fine except for some kind of like archaic belief that like

3785
03:58:26,700 --> 03:58:35,500
a turn-based combat system is unacceptable okay okay I'm about to go into like like a big topic

3786
03:58:35,500 --> 03:58:40,460
that I'm sure you'll feel the same way about yeah and I just want to preface with this the

3787
03:58:40,460 --> 03:58:49,020
complaint of like why isn't x out yet is usually meant just as like a you know like like a a short

3788
03:58:49,020 --> 03:58:55,900
form for like I'm mad that x isn't out yet yeah but for this for let's say I want to literally know

3789
03:58:56,780 --> 03:59:05,660
why isn't trading and pvp out yet like literally why like what like what is stopping why are they

3790
03:59:05,660 --> 03:59:11,020
not out yet I mean I guess they were doing raids which is like yeah like that's a pretty big thing

3791
03:59:11,020 --> 03:59:16,060
that you I'm sure you were working really hard on for quite a while but what have you been doing

3792
03:59:16,140 --> 03:59:19,820
since then yeah that was that was like a long time ago

3793
03:59:22,460 --> 03:59:29,180
yeah um raids and I mean pvp pvp I could see being challenging like I still think it should

3794
03:59:29,180 --> 03:59:38,700
be doable but pvp I could see being challenging but trading like what like how like that just seems

3795
03:59:38,700 --> 03:59:45,900
like the easiest thing you know like like like like like what could it like like what are the

3796
03:59:45,900 --> 03:59:53,420
challenges just like like is it just coding it like like how normal pokemon has trading normal

3797
03:59:53,420 --> 04:00:01,660
pokemon has trading why don't you have trading it's not like you can't program this because there

3798
04:00:01,660 --> 04:00:10,220
are video games that have it programmed uh I mean sure you have to like do it in a way that's

3799
04:00:10,220 --> 04:00:18,300
consistent with the way the rest of go is coded but like I don't know ultimately it just comes down to

3800
04:00:18,300 --> 04:00:24,780
like a transfer of like a packet of data that represents said pokemon from one phone to another

3801
04:00:24,860 --> 04:00:35,660
right I mean I think so I mean oh well I mean only I mean I guess you could like you could

3802
04:00:35,660 --> 04:00:40,140
potentially maybe they don't want to do it because like a high powered player could like transfer to

3803
04:00:40,140 --> 04:00:45,980
a low powered player and it would like break the progression or something like could it be a balance

3804
04:00:45,980 --> 04:01:01,260
issue like okay imagine your cousin trades you like a 200 cp pokemon you know uh uh before you're

3805
04:01:01,260 --> 04:01:06,540
able to uh you know how the normal games dealt with this the pokemon just won't obey you yeah there's

3806
04:01:06,540 --> 04:01:13,500
already a fix for this there's already a fix for that that's already been accounted for

3807
04:01:13,500 --> 04:01:19,100
in the normal games you're exactly right so it can't it can't be balanced it can't be a balance

3808
04:01:19,100 --> 04:01:24,860
issue the only thing that I've seen suggested and this was like by fans I've not even seen

3809
04:01:24,860 --> 04:01:29,100
niantic comment on this niantic doesn't comment on things or at least they didn't use to maybe

3810
04:01:29,100 --> 04:01:33,580
they're better about it now but especially in the early days of go they were like what I understand

3811
04:01:33,580 --> 04:01:40,860
if they're very slightly better okay well all right um but like the only thing I like like it

3812
04:01:41,020 --> 04:01:46,140
it there have been rumors that like spoovers will have an advantage because they'll be able to like

3813
04:01:46,140 --> 04:01:52,940
you know zip around the map and like trade things like like you know at their leisure wow like that's

3814
04:01:52,940 --> 04:02:01,820
such retarded acid and fucking non-existent argument like there's no like sure they will

3815
04:02:01,820 --> 04:02:07,820
have better pokemon but like they already do spoofers are not like like a huge like unbelievably

3816
04:02:07,820 --> 04:02:16,140
rampant pokemon like a problem they already have better pokemon so like just whatever and like

3817
04:02:16,140 --> 04:02:22,620
why deny this staple of the pokemon series for just on the count like like you are literally

3818
04:02:22,620 --> 04:02:26,540
negotiating and letting terrorists win you are literally letting terrorists win

3819
04:02:28,380 --> 04:02:36,860
that can't be it that can't be the reason again literally why is not literally maybe

3820
04:02:37,420 --> 04:02:42,300
they think that it would like maybe they think that if you could trade for pokemon then like

3821
04:02:42,300 --> 04:02:46,860
it would like just make the game too easy in some way like maybe they think that would disincentivize

3822
04:02:46,860 --> 04:02:53,580
like buying shit or something I don't know maybe they maybe maybe they think that like that would

3823
04:02:53,580 --> 04:02:57,980
be giving players what they want too much to the extent that it would like hurt the game's

3824
04:02:58,700 --> 04:03:03,900
financial performance or something because I'm sure if they wanted us to have trading we would

3825
04:03:04,140 --> 04:03:10,460
make a make a trade pass or you have to buy a pass to trade a pokemon done

3826
04:03:11,020 --> 04:03:13,500
huh pretty good pretty good

3827
04:03:13,500 --> 04:03:27,100
good

3828
04:03:30,620 --> 04:03:32,220
look at this i love pokemon go

3829
04:03:32,860 --> 04:03:40,380
huh i love pokemon go i miss playing it it was way fun playing it again it was great and i love it

3830
04:03:40,380 --> 04:03:44,860
yeah and it's the best game ever made yeah like it true

3831
04:03:48,140 --> 04:03:48,620
i just

3832
04:03:51,260 --> 04:03:55,500
apparently trading is like coming up and like and like they're working on it but like

3833
04:03:56,140 --> 04:04:02,940
it's it it's it's it's a rich investigator status in my mind it's it's rich it's it's

3834
04:04:03,500 --> 04:04:09,900
delays at this point night and take yeah like like like i don't care anymore oh oh i see yeah

3835
04:04:11,020 --> 04:04:16,380
yeah i mean i mean would i even trade like would you trade your pokemon

3836
04:04:17,980 --> 04:04:21,500
i would trade i would trade all the time uh i mean

3837
04:04:23,260 --> 04:04:27,260
what would there be to really trade for like just some shit that you've never got

3838
04:04:27,260 --> 04:04:33,900
and you want in your pokedex region exclusives uh uh things like like like like like i'm in a

3839
04:04:33,900 --> 04:04:42,700
desk biome i could use stuff from like an ice biome oh my god okay well i mean adding trading

3840
04:04:42,700 --> 04:04:50,060
does kind of render region exclusives like almost pointless um you have to meet someone from the

3841
04:04:50,060 --> 04:04:56,300
country and they have to willingly give you one no because like people in that country are going to

3842
04:04:56,380 --> 04:05:01,260
be trading out of the country and those and like they're gonna make they're gonna make their way

3843
04:05:01,260 --> 04:05:12,540
elsewhere like they're gonna disseminate through the go player population uh i mean okay eventually

3844
04:05:13,420 --> 04:05:19,180
like an english person will trade their fucking mr. mime to a guy in america and then that american

3845
04:05:19,180 --> 04:05:23,660
guy will trade that fucking mr. mime to another american guy but like

3846
04:05:26,860 --> 04:05:31,900
like will make them pointless it will that will still be like a pokemon that had to have

3847
04:05:31,900 --> 04:05:40,940
originated in europe yeah like it still like would have had to have spawned naturally yeah like like

3848
04:05:40,940 --> 04:05:46,780
you will have to and like it will be a stop a saw after pokemon so it will still be like wow this

3849
04:05:46,780 --> 04:05:51,420
guy has like a mr. mime cool i want that i will give you a strong pokemon for that because i cannot

3850
04:05:51,500 --> 04:05:58,700
get that normally yeah well i mean i yeah they'll still be cool it will it will heavily devalue

3851
04:05:58,700 --> 04:06:05,020
them but at this point like the fact that they're valuable i mean the only thing that that does is

3852
04:06:05,020 --> 04:06:09,260
make people travel and like it's not like that makes niantic any money is that people are buying

3853
04:06:09,260 --> 04:06:18,380
plane tickets to go to japan to catch a whatever yeah barfetched so yeah no i mean i think that i

3854
04:06:18,380 --> 04:06:23,100
mean i think they should be re i think they should be gettable without going to england

3855
04:06:25,020 --> 04:06:26,540
or whatever what have you

3856
04:06:29,980 --> 04:06:40,220
yeah it's fucked up retarded oh god shit i'm not super mad about pvp not being in

3857
04:06:40,220 --> 04:06:44,860
even though i do think it's bullshit and they're all hacks like it just wouldn't be fun i don't

3858
04:06:44,940 --> 04:06:49,580
think it would be like it just wouldn't be fun no because there wouldn't be any skill required it

3859
04:06:49,580 --> 04:06:55,420
would just be if they had just made it like real pokemon then it would be fun for her there to be

3860
04:06:55,420 --> 04:07:02,780
pvp but they didn't yeah so it's not it's not going to be cool so who even cares this is what i mean

3861
04:07:02,780 --> 04:07:08,540
this is what this is what makes me mad about it it's that by making this this by making this

3862
04:07:08,540 --> 04:07:14,300
unnecessary change they just like they just ruin so many other things they're like i don't even

3863
04:07:14,300 --> 04:07:23,020
want them anymore uh right now pokemon go is just a game about like having pokemon in your phone

3864
04:07:24,940 --> 04:07:29,820
yeah it totally is which is you know not like i don't want that not like i don't want to have

3865
04:07:29,820 --> 04:07:36,780
cool pokemon in my phone i do i admit it but it could have been more could have been so much more

3866
04:07:36,860 --> 04:07:40,380
much

3867
04:07:40,380 --> 04:07:49,820
why okay what well okay actually i i guess i was about to ask what purposes do the team serve

3868
04:07:49,820 --> 04:07:53,500
but they serve the same team they said the same purposes as the fucking

3869
04:07:54,700 --> 04:07:59,100
grouties and the killers yeah that's just a popularity context and and shit talking and

3870
04:07:59,100 --> 04:08:04,380
community ability yeah so i guess that's fine but i don't know i i just feel like there's

3871
04:08:04,380 --> 04:08:10,780
a squandered potential certain answers to pokemon go hey um oh well let me just get about this what

3872
04:08:10,780 --> 04:08:17,900
like why are there small pokemon and big pokemon yeah apparently it makes no difference to the

3873
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:24,940
stats yeah yeah but just some pokemon are really big and others aren't and it's just a thing

3874
04:08:25,020 --> 04:08:34,940
yeah i mean theoretically like uh uh moves like like low kick interact with a pokemon's

3875
04:08:34,940 --> 04:08:40,780
mass but i don't think they do that in pokemon go yeah i don't think so either

3876
04:08:45,660 --> 04:08:47,340
finally finally

3877
04:08:47,420 --> 04:08:54,540
get ready to watch me fail yep you're you're gonna tumble on fucking down again

3878
04:08:56,460 --> 04:09:05,500
yep uh oh i'm drunk oh god i'm so drunk i'm so drunk i'm so so drunk right now

3879
04:09:05,820 --> 04:09:13,580
the fucking upper body strength of this guy is fucking insane

3880
04:09:16,460 --> 04:09:23,740
true come on there we go okay um i have no fucking clue how i'm supposed to get up this thing

3881
04:09:23,740 --> 04:09:27,580
you know what i'm gonna watch a video i'm gonna pull up youtube and see how he did it

3882
04:09:28,140 --> 04:09:33,980
we're not getting underhanded tech feels like that the pcp say what we're not getting this

3883
04:09:33,980 --> 04:09:40,780
out of hand tech feels like that in the pcp no okay okay he he okay he goes slowly up just the way

3884
04:09:40,780 --> 04:09:49,660
i did all right he slowly goes up the next rock okay and then to get to where i am i'm assuming he's

3885
04:09:49,660 --> 04:09:56,620
gonna just yep just kind of hook himself and just slowly okay then he gets himself right up against

3886
04:09:56,620 --> 04:10:04,220
the rock like right where i am oh is he just okay and then he does it again okay he just

3887
04:10:04,220 --> 04:10:18,380
kind of does it again and okay oh my god what oh my god here here goes here goes

3888
04:10:18,380 --> 04:10:26,940
oh no i'm scared here's what he's what he here's what i gotta do

3889
04:10:32,620 --> 04:10:36,700
well oh oh i almost saved it but oh

3890
04:10:36,940 --> 04:10:47,900
okay so what he did was he kind of like grabbed onto the rock pulled himself up

3891
04:10:49,420 --> 04:10:55,260
and then like without coming to rest just kind of lowered himself down on the rock and then

3892
04:10:55,260 --> 04:11:01,980
pogoed himself off it to grab the next ledge up because there is no place to like sit on that

3893
04:11:01,980 --> 04:11:08,380
on that's that rock that i was going for it my hammer just slipped his hammer didn't slip why did

3894
04:11:08,380 --> 04:11:16,060
my hammer slip it's bullshit you don't have the tactical precision that he does you don't have

3895
04:11:16,060 --> 04:11:24,700
the years of advice under your belt you don't have the precision german engineering the only

3896
04:11:24,780 --> 04:11:27,900
thing under my belt is gonna be your ass when i'm beating it

3927
04:15:12,860 --> 04:15:18,700
are i think i'm more than halfway through here like i think there's maybe only like

3928
04:15:19,500 --> 04:15:27,660
two more significant challenges before the end but i'm not really sure because like i've never made

3929
04:15:27,660 --> 04:15:34,300
it i mean i've i've seen someone play it through but only like once there's like there's not this

3930
04:15:34,300 --> 04:15:39,820
is okay i would guess i'm probably like three quarters of the way down you you were so fucking

3931
04:15:39,900 --> 04:15:44,380
brazen just then well i knew that i wasn't going to fall because my hammer was going to catch the

3932
04:15:44,380 --> 04:15:51,820
table okay but it was kind of an accident this is all it this is what the episode's writing on okay

3933
04:15:54,140 --> 04:15:56,700
this is what the game reference collector's brand depends on

3934
04:15:58,780 --> 04:16:00,780
oh

3935
04:16:03,580 --> 04:16:04,780

04:17:44,540 --> 04:17:54,220
don't stay dead never stay dead heaven forbid you stay dead fucking okay cut the rowdies down

3951
04:17:54,220 --> 04:18:00,620
before they can enjoy their slurpees we can we can argue all day about who deserves a slurpee

3952
04:18:00,620 --> 04:18:07,500
to not but we can all agree that no corpse deserves a slurpee let alone do do not okay killers when

3953
04:18:07,500 --> 04:18:11,500
you're bullying the rowdies and like you know kicking them kicking dirt kicking their sand

3954
04:18:11,500 --> 04:18:17,100
castles in their faces and stealing their slurpees do not pour them down the drains because they will

3955
04:18:17,100 --> 04:18:21,580
wind up in the sewers and i do not want the dead i do not want the stay deads enjoying them

3956
04:18:22,540 --> 04:18:28,380
we're at each other's throats but but but even we even even we can come to the sensible conclusion

3957
04:18:28,380 --> 04:18:34,700
that corpses should stay corpses even stay corpses i mean burn in hell and die even we can even we

3958
04:18:34,700 --> 04:18:41,900
can agree morally diametrically opposed as we are even we can agree on stopping mutually beating

3959
04:18:41,900 --> 04:18:48,300
up the juveniles which is what we were doing and moving on to the deads and beating them up instead

3960
04:18:48,860 --> 04:18:54,860
