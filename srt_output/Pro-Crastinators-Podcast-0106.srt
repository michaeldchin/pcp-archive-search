00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,560
Hello everybody, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Hippocrit, the guy, and we've

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,960
got with us a big packed car. We're on a summer vacation. It's all hot and sweaty in

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,520
the car. Clown car. Yeah, there's too many people in here. We're sticking to each other.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,840
It's gross. We got Munchy here. I'm a sequel of 9-11, like a soft reboot. You know how

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,320
like Godzilla solely went from being an antagonist to a protagnist? That's like 9-11 in me.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:47,040
We got Nate. I am the best Jihadist ever. That's the terrorism episode. We got Davoo.

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,680
Munchy, on your comment about how Godzilla went from bad guy to good guy, Rambo is similar.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,080
He starts off as just like a violent maniac antihero in the first movie. Then he becomes

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,760
a hero. Then he becomes sort of a mixture in the fourth movie. Godzilla and Rambo should

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,960
actually do a crossover. They have so much in common. They're both accidental byproducts

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,400
of war. So what you're saying is you're a soft reboot of the Holocaust, Davoo? Sometimes.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:22,560
We have Mage. The heroineys? That's a word. Mage coming out swinging. We have a Tom. Everyone

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,440
has been saying a lot of words in these intros, and I find them to be overly verbose and

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:37,760
bloated. The spirit is lacking. Bad show. And the man of the fewest words, Ben St. A man

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,680
of no words, preferably. There he goes. There he goes. Look, I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,120
He was doing the joke, and you interrupted his silence. Well, I didn't. I was proved

17
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,120
the fool. All right. Everybody today's episode is confusing because some people think it's

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,160
called words, but it's actually language. Language in general. I mean, I can go on for

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,040
ages. I have notes written in language in words about language and words that I will

20
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,080
get to maybe. There's so many people here. I'm doubtful that I'll actually get to Amish

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Go. Just go. Just start. All right. Oh, wait, Urban Dictionary, though. Computer language.

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,720
Wait, I got it. I've got language. Break the structure. Check it out. No. Language. Urban

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,320
Dictionary. A way of humiliation. The leader of this episode. You can't just take over.

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,040
But he didn't want to read it, so I'm just doing it anyway. Urban Dictionary is a dictionary.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Therefore language. It sucks. Listen to this one. Listen to this one. This is a meme, though.

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,600
Okay, language. Wait, it's a meme, everyone. What your fucking horse is. Language. What

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,600
your mother claims movies she doesn't want you to see has too much of C, swear, and you

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,680
know what? You know what? That leads perfectly into my point. Language sucks, and it's bad,

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,160
and it doesn't do the job it's supposed to do. Wait, can we quickly segregate ourselves

30
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:10,720
to pro and anti-language? Can we be sure? I'm pro. I am pro. I am pro. I am pro. Munchie,

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,840
the God King is pro-language. This is the pro-languineders podcast. Wait, okay. Just

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,600
keep your anti-language. Say I. I. What language? If you're anti-language, if you hate it with

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,760
a burning passion, if you want it dead, I, me, me. So those of you keeping score at home,

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,640
that is DeVoo, Nate, and Hippo on the Axis powers, and everyone else is on. No, it's not

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,520
DeVoo. DeVoo, yeah, DeVoo wasn't actually. So is it just Hippo and Nate? I think so.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Cowardly green boys. The cowards fighting on the losing side. Cowardly green. We will

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,800
win. You are the Dark Souls boss to our rolling and stabbering. That is so unique. I never

38
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,920
would have guessed that the minority opinion would be that language isn't good. I would

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,240
have never suspected that. And there's nothing weaker and more pitiful than a Dark Souls

40
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,160
boss. Well, I mean, you know, I use a lot of language, and I feel like this. I feel like

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,440
this. It's like, like you got guys who are on the extreme left. Nate, please communicate

42
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,560
your ideas without using language. It's impossible. No, but I'll tell you why. You can't do it.

43
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,240
You've lost. As soon as you explain anything, you've lost the argument. You're using the

44
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,240
tool that you hate. Incorrect. Incorrect. We can, we, see, I have a solution. We've

45
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,760
forced this on him. Everybody shut the hell up. Let me make my goddamn point. Everything

46
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,600
about, everything about hap, everything happening here is entirely in my favor and probably makes

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,680
as well. He's right. He's right. Language is a terrible tool. Which because it is a translator.

48
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,960
It translates thoughts, feelings and ideas into a package that has to be untranslated

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,240
by the recipient. And the recipient can like misinterpret things. Anything written down.

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,760
You can't, like speech is better than stuff written down, but speech is still not as good

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,040
as just actually experiencing real things. Yeah, well, you know what else? Google and

52
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,080
Apple can't release a patch and change the word rifle to water gun. Well, they could,

53
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,360
but they haven't yet. So there you go. I don't know what that is in playing as your argument.

54
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,280
And I don't know what your argument is. Why words are better than emoji. Okay, but listen,

55
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,360
well, sure, but listen to this though. It's like people in the far left, for example,

56
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,720
like hate, wait, wait, no, no, it's just an analogy. It's like people in the far left,

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,200
for example, hate the Democratic party because they're not left enough. And like that makes

58
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,120
the mad at that. Cause like they're not, they're, they're the ones who quote unquote like represent

59
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,240
their ideas, but they don't do it like well enough for their taste. In that same vein,

60
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,640
I am mad at language for not like I use it a lot. It's, it is a tool I use, but it's

61
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,720
not good enough at doing what I want to do. And that's why Munchy, you should be on board

62
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,480
for this as should you Tom. Cause what I want is whenever I meet someone, I don't want to

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,960
use this bullshit language, shitty analog system we've got right now. I want to literally

64
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,120
pull out my fucking cord, like it goes to the shelves, jack it into your fucking neck

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,800
and have the raw, unfiltered data stream of my real life shit into your body.

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,600
You fucking coward. Don't you want to like what that's language too? That's a digital

67
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
language. You're converting it into a computer language.

68
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
All right.

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Everything in reality as a language, I'm defining you as a language.

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Language is a form of communication and doesn't have to be verbally. It can also be a language.

71
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,560
Is every, is every communication language is my question.

72
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Yes.

73
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,280
Fuck language is just like a hyperbolic clickbait. And what you really want is just more words.

74
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,760
No, no, no. You guys are dead wrong. You're misrepresenting your own points. Okay. Okay.

75
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,280
You know what? You know what? We should have a hundred percent of all calamities.

76
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Listen, hey, everyone, I want to make a prediction. I want to make a prediction. I want to make

77
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
a prediction. Speaking.

78
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,920
I want to predict something right now. I see, okay, I am the greatest mind of our generation.

79
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,960
My mind is so vast that it contains all of your own minds within it. I know exactly where

80
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,800
this conversation is going. And I already have the groundbreaking point that will smash

81
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,440
everything that is about to be said entirely asunder. But I'm going to wait. I'm going

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
to wait on it until later.

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Okay, no. I just want to point out that once you say that in our mental retardation.

84
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Okay. Davoo, Davoo, what were you saying?

85
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,600
You've called me out on that multiple times, dude, and I've done it explicitly to like make

86
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,320
you upset, except that's not actually true. I say that I'm just retarded, but I want to

87
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,280
hide behind like a veil of me doing intentionally so people will think that I'm cool, but I

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
actually just say hi.

89
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,440
Look at these terrible words you're using. I just don't even care about anything. They're

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
all bad.

91
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Representation of points is the reason I don't like what I call language. See, this is the

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,760
whole point. Language, as I think of it, is like text and speech and stuff, not communication

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,560
on the whole. Like communication obviously is a good thing.

94
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,880
What's the word? What's lexicon communication?

95
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,760
What I'm talking about is like speaking and the written word as like more specific forms

96
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,160
of communication. Here's the thing. Language, well, I'm going to call it that. I'm going

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,600
to continue calling it language because calling it words and speech is kind of...

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,480
Yeah. For what words do you mean nothing? We might as well, right? That just helped

99
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
your point.

100
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,360
The fact that you guys defined all communication as language.

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Nate, it's literally called body language.

102
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,400
Exactly. There is an adjective attached to that to differentiate the two from just the

103
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
broader point.

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
It's not even that we are correct and you were all wrong.

105
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,760
Yeah, we've got to be on the same page here.

106
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,240
It's all like a fucking... It's a mess. I've got so many different specific points to go

107
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
into.

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
No, no, okay. It's all about...

109
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:41,320
I'm going to start with one of my points. The specificity of language is a boon. It

110
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:50,400
helps us to do a lot of things, but it is a curse when all of humanity is linked together.

111
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,480
It's weird how it sucks is what I'm saying. It sucks because...

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Yeah, okay.

113
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,000
Right. First of all, I'm not very good at using it.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Look at Twitter, dude.

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Here's an example, though.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,760
I do have notes. I just didn't write them in a way that I could read them.

117
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Oh, no.

118
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Okay.

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
I feel like you're confirmation bias saying...

120
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,160
I didn't write a speech. I wrote, like, here's a point that I can expand on.

121
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,240
The specificity of language is you have words meaning specific things, but it only works

122
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,200
in small communities like tribes, where everybody can decide on a word, and if a word's meaning

123
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,200
is changed, everybody in the tribe can be like, oh, okay, that's different, so deliberate

124
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
on that.

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Can I give an example?

126
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Can I give an example of that?

127
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
That's brilliant.

128
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
And the bigger the tribe gets, the more people that are supposed to, and expected to use

129
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
a word, they have to look to an authority, but there is no authority because the dictionary

130
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,840
is reactionary to the way people use language, and that just results in divides when people

131
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,760
can't decide on the new or the old definition of a word, such as, you know, literally being

132
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,720
used in, like, a figurative sense as written in the dictionary now, because that's how

133
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,520
people have been using it or misusing it. It's just, language creates barriers between

134
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,760
people because we're such a huge conglomeration of human beings, and it should be for small

135
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,600
sections and small communities having their own language.

136
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,880
First world problems, bro.

137
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,880
Pretty so, but listen to this, here's the exact, this is a word that the poor definition

138
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,160
of it is indicative of the problem with language at large, and I, like, I think what you guys,

139
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,720
what your side and our side will commonly clash over this entire podcast is like, but

140
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
isn't it better than nothing?

141
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,320
And the answer is yes. The answer is absolutely yes, but there are still problems, and I think

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
that's what we're going to be talking about.

143
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Okay, here's the word.

144
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,240
The word is racism.

145
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,400
The word is racism, and the problem is that different huge groups, for example, in America,

146
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,840
use that word in completely different ways, but because there are multiple definitions

147
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,920
for that word, it causes huge misunderstandings, see Sky Williams' video on the subject.

148
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Is it multiple definitions of the word?

149
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,720
There's one definition of, no, no, no, there's one definition of the word, and then there's

150
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,560
a whole political subset that has taken that word and changed it to mean something else

151
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
to...

152
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Is that a difference?

153
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Is that any way different from having multiple definitions of a word?

154
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
That's a problem with people and ideology, not with language.

155
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,480
My point, my problem is there's too many people using the same language where we should

156
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
be...

157
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,560
Not that we should be, but the way the language was invented was it makes sense for the small

158
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
tribes.

159
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,840
A word only means what people think it means, and if there's no consensus on what it means,

160
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,320
then it's not useful to use because it causes arguments.

161
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,880
The problem right now is there's a big problem because the internet has created this problem.

162
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,520
Made this problem way bigger than it ever was in history.

163
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,960
I agree with what you're saying, how language has problems with multiple interpretations

164
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,880
and how words change over time, but the specific example Nate's using isn't a natural evolution

165
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
of language.

166
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,640
It's a very conscious choice to twist something to suit an agenda.

167
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,280
Maybe that's true, but that is completely irrelevant to the point that just the reality

168
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,640
is it is simply used these ways.

169
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
And like you...

170
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,040
Okay, like I sound like the SJW side of things right now, but it's just like, I don't actually

171
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,040
care who's right or wrong about what the word originally meant or who's twisting it

172
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
for an agenda.

173
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,840
All I care about is that there is a miscommunication going on and people are talking past each

174
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,560
other, and that is the problem with language.

175
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,820
And that's exactly what Gibb is talking about.

176
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,000
Just for example, you've got SJWs...

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,040
Okay, but let me just finish this real quick, just take a second.

178
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,320
It's just that you've got a camp that just views the world from a situation where racism

179
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,840
means prejudice plus power.

180
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,720
And you've got just this other camp that just believes to their core that it simply means

181
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,480
discrimination based on race and power is irrelevant.

182
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,080
Because these people are so deeply entrenched in believing these things, it doesn't matter

183
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,160
where it came from.

184
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
This is simply where we are right now.

185
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,280
We can absolutely talk about why it's a problem that we got here, but it is the reality that

186
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,000
people just can't agree on what they're talking about.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,120
That is not a problem with language.

188
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,200
That was done on purpose to make it medial.

189
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Language facilitates this issue.

190
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Let me speak.

191
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Let me.

192
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Language is a tool like any other.

193
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,040
Blaming language in itself for the faults of humans is like blaming water for people

194
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,360
who drowned in it.

195
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,400
Just because people can't drown in it doesn't mean the water is supposed to be blamed for

196
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
it.

197
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
No, no, no, wrong.

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,720
Okay, go on Gibb.

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,160
The thing I should make my argument more specific, it's not that language sucks.

200
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,400
I just say that because that's funny and you're like, oh, you're being all hyperbole.

201
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,720
We're all about the memes here.

202
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,920
We're all about the hyperbole.

203
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Where are the memes?

204
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Well, there they are.

205
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
I hate it.

206
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,960
What my point is, is that the way language developed initially was like we were banging

207
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,240
rocks together and people were grunting and we were like, what is this thing that is different

208
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
from this other thing?

209
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
And they came up with words.

210
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,360
I mean, I don't know how it happened, but eventually over time, people invented words

211
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,840
to mean certain things and they were like specific to wherever they lived and whatever

212
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,000
they had.

213
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,440
And that's why languages are like different all over the world.

214
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,200
And when a language spreads to other places, it becomes difficult to police, like keep

215
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,480
the language consistent among all those different places.

216
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,480
Okay, but that's not the languages fault also, like because of the internet.

217
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
No, this is what I was getting to.

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,400
My point is not that language sucks, it's that language over a large amount of people,

219
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
like too large.

220
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,360
It stops being useful for communication, which was its primary purpose in the first

221
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,120
place is to communicate ideas.

222
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,760
If between different groups that are like, there's too many people and so many large

223
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,520
groups of people have different interpretations of certain words, then the point of language

224
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,480
becomes, well, the point of language is lost, like that certain words are not able to be

225
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,520
communicated properly between people.

226
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,720
They have ideas, they have thoughts, and they're using words that other people don't agree

227
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
with.

228
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,000
Like in a magical world where we didn't need them, we could like telepathically transmit

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,680
ideas into people's heads, that would be better.

230
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Not possible.

231
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Give me that USB point, boy.

232
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,960
But that's my argument, that like when there's too many people using the same language, it

233
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,720
will inevitably stop being useful as a tool.

234
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
No.

235
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,880
Are you saying that we've reached that point or just that will theoretically happen in the

236
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
future?

237
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,400
Have we reached that point now?

238
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,040
Is that what you're saying?

239
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,360
We're facing the issues as a result of it for sure.

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,520
Give language time to catch up, the internet was invented just like how many years ago?

241
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Mage, here's why it'll never happen, Mage, this will always be a fundamental problem

242
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
with language.

243
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,280
Okay, to your credit, you do have a point.

244
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,240
Given enough words and given enough time, like the reason people write articles, right,

245
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,360
to flesh out arguments and they write books to explain things, the problem is there is

246
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,360
a fundamental problem with human beings and language, because human beings just read headlines,

247
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,160
we just read titles, we read condensations of points that other people present to us,

248
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,120
and that is because asking someone to read a fully articulated point.

249
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,840
We watch analytical YouTube videos explaining the anime to us instead of watching the damn

250
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
anime.

251
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,800
I mean that is kind of an issue, yeah.

253
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,800
The problem is we're asking too much of the weak flesh of human beings to spend the time

254
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,040
to learn things, and people can get over it, of course they can, but they don't, enough.

255
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,360
And this is a problem that people just don't want to spend the time reading something when

256
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
they can get a shorter version.

257
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,560
But I was supporting my national point about blaming water where it's the people who are

258
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
being dumb.

259
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
So language is bad because people are lazy for some things?

260
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,800
Are you fucking retarded?

261
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,200
That's the dumbest point I've ever heard.

262
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah, what the fuck?

263
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,920
Language is bad because people are lazy.

264
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
That is your point right now.

265
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,360
You guys want to just say that like, oh well humans can always adapt and change, but you're

266
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
not facing the reality.

267
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,720
No, the reality is some people are shit and some people aren't shit and that has nothing

268
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
to do with language.

269
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
Okay, okay, yeah, I understand what you're saying that like it's just human nature that

270
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,480
that's how people are gonna read, but like, but I don't see how that's language, like

271
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,200
that's not language's fault.

272
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,360
Yeah, actually, you know what, no, it is language's fault.

273
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,920
Nate, I agree with your point to the point that it proves your point wrong.

274
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,400
What you get down to the core of this is that people in their eternal laziness try to find

275
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,520
some sort of tool or technique or a secret trick to just make it easier for them or to

276
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,720
take the effort out of it, like reading the headline instead of the article or thinking

277
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,280
it's possible to have some form of word-based lexiconal communication that allows you to

278
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
actually make everyone understand you all the time.

279
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,760
Maybe there's no easy way out, no shortcut home, you just have to learn how different

280
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,800
people use words every step of your way through as you go on through life.

281
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,440
Words are like a martial art technique.

282
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,000
You must master it, experience each fight that comes along the way and improvise and

283
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
be smart.

284
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
There's no, we aren't a bunch of computers all manufactured in the same Chinese sweatshop.

285
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
We're not all the same.

286
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Even if you can communicate dream to dream, dream brains aren't all made the same.

287
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
There's no easy way out.

288
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
You just gotta fucking be smart and put a lot of effort in to communicate all the time.

289
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Yes, yes.

290
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,840
And the fact that that is all true is the problem with language, that is the problem.

291
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,280
So you're saying that language sucks because people spread fake news on Facebook and that

292
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,840
this specific problem with internet headlines, that's the reason why language is flawed.

293
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,680
The problem is that language is an incredibly inefficient medium for which us to acquire

294
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,200
information and people just don't put in the work to do so and it's because language is

295
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
so shit at it.

296
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
The point is...

297
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Those two are intellect.

298
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,560
So what do you want?

299
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I agree.

300
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I agree.

301
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I agree.

302
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
I agree.

303
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
I agree.

304
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:42,200
Well, I agree.

305
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,160
That is true.

306
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,660
Well, I have real experiences in less talking, less reading, less text.

307
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,020
There is a language of visuals, there's a language of visual art.

308
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
How?

309
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,020
Wait, wait.

310
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,460
I said earlier that I'm talking about text and speech, visual art is like I'm not talking

311
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
about language in general.

312
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,620
I have a couple things, I have a couple things.

313
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,900
First of all, I think visual language is a double-edged sword because it can be more

314
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,740
specific in some ways, but can also be way more abstract than language in other ways.

315
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,360
You can draw a picture and it can clearly represent something literally, but if you're

316
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,620
trying to communicate something subtextually with an image, it's way more vague than text.

317
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:30,260
So that's a problem, but Nate, are you trying to say that your argument is that we need

318
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,900
some form of language that instantaneously downloads an entire article's worth of content

319
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,580
into someone's brain along with all the context for every single word choice behind it from

320
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,020
that person's point of view?

321
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Is that what you want?

322
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,100
I am saying, if such a fictional thing existed, then that would be a better option to give

323
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
people all the information for each point.

324
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,140
Then sure, science fiction is definitely better than reality.

325
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,100
I will give you that point.

326
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
But considering that...

327
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
But that is every...

328
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I think that is...

329
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
That language is not perfect, is my point.

330
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Yeah, that is it.

331
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Well, congratulations.

332
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Nothing's perfect.

333
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Yeah.

334
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
This is what a completely useless point.

335
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
So what do you want then?

336
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
You want me to just say, yeah, it's perfect.

337
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I guess I'll just say...

338
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
No!

339
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
It's not perfect!

340
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Who wants language to be perfect?

341
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
Okay, I don't...

342
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
You guys are literally worse than Hitler.

343
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,620
You're oppressing my ideas.

344
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
You don't care about the Jewish people like me.

345
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Fuck you guys.

346
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,620
I don't...

347
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Why do you want to abolish Israel?

348
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Tell me why.

349
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,620
Just tell me why.

350
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,120
I don't particularly disagree with what I think is like the morsel of truth here.

351
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,020
But it's just a gross hyperbole.

352
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,420
And I don't understand why you guys are taking this to like the most instant degree.

353
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,420
Yeah, why does the fact that it's...

354
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,420
I don't understand why the fact that it has problems mean that it's bad.

355
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,620
You guys are literally just mad that I'm articulating the problems with language.

356
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
That is you right now.

357
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,640
No, I'm mad that you're saying that these problems mean that they are a net negative

358
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
and that language is bad.

359
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
If we abolish...

360
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Do you think that things would be better if we abolish language?

361
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Of course not.

362
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
I think that's exactly what I said.

363
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Exactly what I said.

364
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
That it's not actually about language just being an overall negative.

365
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
I said it's a boon.

366
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
I said it's a boon.

367
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Maybe fucking talking about...

368
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
We came out...

369
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
The problem is we came with this from a meme.

370
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
That's the whole problem.

371
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
We've been talking about this...

372
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
We said a meme that language is bad.

373
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
That's not actually true.

374
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
It's a meme.

375
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
You dip.

376
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,100
Visual language is like fucking...

377
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,660
People only taught with the visual language back in the medieval times to teach the Bible,

378
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Jesus.

379
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
And I'm thinking...

380
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
They only talked about visual language?

381
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,660
What do you mean?

382
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Visual communication, right?

383
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,660
They just have fucking stained glass windows to tell the whole Bible stories, right?

384
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Didn't they have the Bible though?

385
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Yeah, but those people couldn't read back in the day.

386
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
They're all uneducated.

387
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
That's why all those mobs had to illuminate all those manuscripts.

388
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Right.

389
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
They had to illuminate all those manuscripts.

390
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm thinking about it.

391
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm fucking thinking about it.

392
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,680
If the Second Amendment had been, instead of any words, had been a guy just with his

393
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,680
family holding a gun and then a police officer taking the gun, but there's a red X over that,

394
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,680
there'd probably be a lot less room for miscommunication, I suppose.

395
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
If you think about...

396
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
I mean, maybe.

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,680
If you go to a fast food store, you see that little yellow sign, it'll say something in

398
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Spanish that means, you know, don't slip.

399
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Like with that image, it could be interpreted as a guy taking away the gun from the officer.

400
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
I mean, that is...

401
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
It could be interpreted different ways.

402
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
That open...

403
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Visual mediums just open up a whole, like, different set of possible issues, you know?

404
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
And we can get into that.

405
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
But I think...

406
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I want to say a point, though, before everyone started yelling.

407
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,700
I think language is a tool, just like any other.

408
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Like I stated, you don't blame the pencil if you can't draw, you don't blame the brush

409
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
if you can't paint, you know?

410
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,720
You can't blame the chisel if you can't sculpt.

411
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,720
So why are you blaming the language if you can't use it as a tool to communicate effectively?

412
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Because this is why, mate.

413
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Because this is why.

414
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Because, like, when I'm signing a check, I do blame the pencil if I use to sign the

415
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
check because it is not doing everything I want it to do, i.e. actually inking.

416
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,720
It's just, like, it is doing a different, not as good job as the tool I would ideally use.

417
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
What do you want a language to do?

418
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,740
A better analogy for that, Nate, is that, you know, language is like a paintbrush.

419
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,740
And, like, you know, a canvas is whatever.

420
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,740
It used to be, you dip your paintbrush, it's a tiny little paintbrush, you dip it in,

421
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,740
and then you can fill in like a square, like a one centimeter square.

422
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Fill that in real quick, real easy, when the square is small.

423
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,740
When the square is, like, 200 feet long and 300 feet tall, and you still have that same

424
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,760
paintbrush, it's the same tool, it's just not as effective as it once was.

425
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
The paintbrush isn't the same, though.

426
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
There's also a multitude of colors.

427
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
You don't blame the paintbrush, you just blame the situation.

428
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
The situation is there are too many people that use the English language for the English language

429
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
to be a really good form of communication between everybody.

430
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I love the English language as a non-native speaker.

431
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,760
I really love it because it's so broad and has so many words to describe the same things.

432
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,780
It's literally, like, it's almost the same to me as drawing because you can shape your words

433
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,780
like your sentences into specific things.

434
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:04,780
I like role-playing with people via text because I can shape sentences to reflect what I want to say

435
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,780
and make, like, it's reading the replies, it's like watching art because I love it,

436
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,780
I love how unique it can be, like, you can use different words.

437
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,780
You got different words for, like, the animal, like, you got pigs and then you got pork

438
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,800
because that's the way, like, English evolved is just be peasants used to use the word pig

439
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
to kill shit.

440
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Don't misunderstand.

441
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Don't misunderstand me.

442
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I love a lot of things about the English language, specifically how, like, looking at a word like yesterday

443
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,800
and then understanding that yester is like a thing that you can apply to other words,

444
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
like yester year and yester week.

445
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Like, seeing how words come into being, puns, like, I love so much of stuff about language.

446
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,820
I love puns and I think, like, is there any other language that has puns, by the way?

447
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
I'm just curious.

448
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,820
Of course.

449
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,820
Japanese has tons of puns.

450
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
What?

451
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,820
Japanese.

452
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
Oh, okay.

453
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Yeah, okay, that's good because I don't think Lithuanians are very good at puns.

454
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
Lithuanians don't have puns?

455
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
That's outrageous.

456
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,820
Well, because I tried to explain to my mother what a pun was because, like, a long story,

457
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,820
but, like, she seemed very confused.

458
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
I was like, wait, don't we have puns?

459
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,840
So, like, if there's any Lithuanians listening right now, if you know any Lithuanian puns,

460
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
please let me know.

461
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Post some Lithuanian puns.

462
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Post some Lithuanian puns in the comments.

463
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
You know, not to be mean or anything, but I feel like I'm watching, like, a kid's cartoon

464
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,840
and, like, the little imp goes back to, like, the evil dark impville and they try to teach

465
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
their family about happiness and smiles.

466
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,840
What is this sharing you're speaking of?

467
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
What is this?

468
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Agreed.

469
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Okay, but listen, listen.

470
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Like, we are currently experiencing what my problem is with language, and it is a large

471
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
issue, and I'm perfectly willing to say that.

472
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
And, like, it ties into Ben's question that he asked before.

473
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
What do you want language to do?

474
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Okay, so that is a great question, and the whole reason for screaming and yelling, I

475
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
think we basically are all on the same page, but, okay, let me approach it.

476
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:05,860
It's like, me and Gib are viewing this conversation from the perspective of how things are not

477
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
perfect with language.

478
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Whereas, I think someone like Maze, just for example, is approaching this as how the

479
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
world would be worse without language.

480
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,880
So, to have language, she sees all the benefits.

481
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,880
So, she's focused on the positives and is like, well, how can you say, you know, language

482
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
is shit?

483
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
It does all these good things.

484
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
That's a perfectly reasonable thing to say.

485
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I think because we're approaching it from different perspectives, that's the issue.

486
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,880
I'm not saying languages, but you're saying fucked language.

487
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry if this comes off as shitty or anything.

488
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
I'm sorry if this pisses you off.

489
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,900
But I'm really waiting for you to get to the point.

490
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
I have many times already.

491
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,900
I do disagree, though, on how you described my view.

492
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,900
No, my view is a language is a tool and it's up to the people how they use it.

493
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,900
If they do a shitty job, that's not the language's fault.

494
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,900
If your point is that language is imperfect, then, you know, gotcha.

495
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Message received.

496
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Yeah.

497
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
I mean, podcast over.

498
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
But listen, listen, though.

499
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Ben's question, what do you want language to do?

500
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Okay, that's what this all hinges on.

501
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I want, like, language is what it is.

502
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
It, like, again, we're talking like spoken and like written language.

503
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Like, that just, it is what it is.

504
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
It can't really change that much.

505
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
You could probably update with, like, Esperanto they're trying to.

506
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
That's fine.

507
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
But there are inherent limitations.

508
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Like, what I want is a better form of communication that, for example-

509
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
So, like, a different language.

510
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,920
It's, you're defining communication as language, which I think is just wrong.

511
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Because there are things that are not language.

512
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Okay, no, no, now you're, now you're hopping because like-

513
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,940
Well, then I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, I'm talking about spoken and written language.

514
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
I don't care about anything else.

515
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,940
But just now, you just contradicted yourself.

516
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Listen.

517
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Have you-

518
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
Tell me how I contradicted myself.

519
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
Yeah.

520
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,940
Okay, well, I don't think we agree.

521
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Okay, you don't seem, okay, I don't get why you don't think that any form of communication is a language.

522
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
I think that it definitely is.

523
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,960
And I think that, yeah, text and speech is imperfect and can be improved upon.

524
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,960
But like, it's, you're not gonna, like, you can only iterate on it and make it better.

525
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,960
You can't replace it with something else that does the same thing.

526
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,960
But I'm not trying to say it does the exact same thing.

527
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Also, listen to the definition of language.

528
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,960
A body of words and the systems for their use common to a people who are of the same community or nation,

529
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
the same geographical area.

530
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Listen, it's words make up language.

531
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,980
If you're not communicating with words, it's not a language.

532
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,980
Okay, well, I'm sure I could find some alternate definitions that do not-

533
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Oh, yes.

534
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Because, yeah, that's not the only kind of language there is.

535
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Okay, there's one down here.

536
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,980
There's another definition that says communication of meaning in any way.

537
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
So now, here's the question.

538
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Yeah.

539
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Are you wrong or am I wrong or are we both sort of right?

540
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
What's, what is it?

541
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's up to you to define it.

542
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Exactly.

543
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah, I guess we're arguing across definitions a little bit.

544
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Exactly.

545
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It is shitty.

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Exactly.

547
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And therefore, a problem with language.

548
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Thank you, everyone.

549
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay, well, I guess I've been blown out of the water.

550
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I guess I've just been completely-

551
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That solves nothing.

552
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That point does not change.

553
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Even we had some magic psychic language where we could instantly say things.

554
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,020
If I disagreed with your fucking definition of language, it doesn't matter if I could

555
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
understand what you meant perfectly.

556
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
I'd still disagree.

557
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
This change is nothing.

558
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,020
This is not a plea to make the world more agreeable.

559
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:38,020
This is just like, you know, sometimes I kind of get mad that people don't agree on words.

560
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
That's all my point.

561
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Well, I mean, my point is more specific to something not quite what Nate is going for,

562
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
I think.

563
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:51,040
But like, you know, the classic thing, pictures worth a thousand words and all that.

564
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Pictures are good.

565
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,040
They convey a lot of meaning and a lot of things that words can't do quite as well.

566
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,040
My favorite expression, don't say.

567
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Well, more than that is that if I were to either explain a story of a baby being born

568
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,040
and then the mother dying or something like a tragic story, oh no, it's sad.

569
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,060
If I were to explain that with words, even if I was really good at speaking, even if

570
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:22,060
I was really good at writing, it wouldn't work quite as much as like being there and

571
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,060
like seeing the tragedy like unfold before you.

572
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,060
It wouldn't hit you as hard.

573
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,060
And I feel like not that you're supposed to go out into the world and see tragedy.

574
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,060
That's not really the good thing that you, in fact, tragedy is bad and please don't actually

575
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
happen.

576
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,060
But if you would tragedy, spare us.

577
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,080
I feel like people spend a lot of their fucking time talking on the Internet.

578
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:53,080
And I think they would be much happier and much more fulfilled in life if they just forget

579
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,080
about speaking for once and do something real in the real world and Pokemon Go.

580
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I agree with your point.

581
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,080
But I don't know why you're like, you're like, you're taking that point and channeling

582
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
it into like language is bad.

583
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Like I agree that people should go and experience the things and not like just like communicate

584
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
through art or words or whatever.

585
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Okay.

586
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
And just fantasize about like the abstraction of it.

587
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,100
But I don't understand why that is focused directly onto language.

588
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Well, I think how Nate has sort of co-opted my feelings on the matter.

589
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
I don't speak for myself.

590
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,100
We just so happen to be like kind of on the same side.

591
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
I'm not like saying language sucks and I don't think we should get rid of language.

592
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I don't think anything should happen to language.

593
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,120
I'm just like, wouldn't it be nice if you just sort of like you sit on you sit out on the beach

594
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,120
and you just sort of look at someone you smile and you can share a moment with each other.

595
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,120
And it's like, you don't need to say, I'm happy that you don't need to draw a picture about it.

596
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
You just sort of like you feel it.

597
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
You feel it more innately and more real.

598
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
There are things that words can't describe and those are very...

599
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Yeah.

600
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Have you guys...

601
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Words that can't describe.

602
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
Have you guys...

603
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I'm completely on you with that.

604
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Have you guys ever heard the phrase, writing about music is like dancing about architecture?

605
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Yeah.

606
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,140
Yeah.

607
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
I just thought that was interesting.

608
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Please continue.

609
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,140
I do agree with Hippo and it doesn't invalidate my opinion whatsoever.

610
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Oh man.

611
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,140
You know what guys?

612
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,140
I think I want to just say that even if words aren't the best communication or far from the worst

613
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
because dancing, like interpretive dancing.

614
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Okay, let's see.

615
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
She spun around.

616
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
She spun around 90 degrees.

617
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Okay.

618
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Oh, now she spun around 180 degrees.

619
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Okay.

620
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Is this Morse?

621
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Oh, she jumped.

622
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Oh man, this totally is like the fucking Renaissance period, right?

623
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh man, here comes some Bohemian shaking your hand around a little bit.

624
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Oh, I totally understand this language.

625
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Definitely.

626
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm not bored.

627
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Definitely.

628
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm glad you brought this up.

629
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I feel like we need to dig into the issue that like the definition, Nate, the definition

630
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,180
that you were using, like you were defining like a linguistic language like English or

631
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,180
French, but like I think it's more and I'd rather talk about language in the more abstract

632
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,180
way, but there's a thing like the language of like cinema, you know, or body language

633
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
or things like that.

634
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Okay, now just the point that is distinct from everything I made points about previously.

635
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,180
I was not talking about anything besides the spoken and written word and I'm happy to talk

636
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,180
about that, but like those points do not apply in the same way.

637
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Okay, well, how are you guys pro or anti language in general, like the language of cinema?

638
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Pro communication, so yeah.

639
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Well, okay, let me just say as a larger point, so we made a huge mistake about having a serious

640
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,200
discussion on this matter by even taking a for or against position.

641
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
It's like this.

642
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,200
My position here is that there are imperfections with the theoretically ideal form of communication

643
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:58,220
I envision in my brain that the spoken and written word have it is not perfect.

644
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,220
In my opinion, these are large issues and they cause big problems.

645
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:08,220
We can then but like, but I want to just identify what those problems are.

646
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,220
That is what it like to say that I'm anti language puts a huge label on like I'm in this team,

647
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,220
you're in that team, and then we just argue that is a huge mistake if you want to have

648
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,240
an actual debate as to like, or not not even debate, just a discussion about what the actual

649
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
points are.

650
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Yeah, labels themselves are badly used words.

651
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,240
No one has brought in the idea that language is perfect besides you.

652
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Like none of us have said that language is perfect in any way.

653
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,240
That's not I am not debating that you think language is perfect.

654
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,240
I'm simply saying language has these problems and I think they're a big deal.

655
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Alright, well, I think we're well past the point.

656
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,260
I don't think anyone disagrees with that idea, but the way you've been phrasing it.

657
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Then why were you arguing with me?

658
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
Because you were expressing it.

659
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
When did I ever say that?

660
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
I very much appreciate that.

661
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,260
I think Nate's got us all got you all in a little trick and little ruse.

662
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Nate has been arguing his point by using language really, really badly to explain his point.

663
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,260
Nate, thus proving the point in an old and rare double reach around.

664
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,280
I'm literally a thousand times smarter than all of you.

665
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
You are ants.

666
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
You are babies.

667
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
You are children.

668
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:29,280
We've been doing this show for over a hundred episodes now.

669
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
And in that time, I've heard you discuss many a topic.

670
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:40,280
And I think this topic more than any has maybe realized with no uncertainty of how miserable it must be to be you sometimes.

671
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:48,300
To be trapped in this endless intellectual masturbation of all these incredibly insane ideas

672
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:54,300
and having to just constantly be thinking about them and unable to just let them go.

673
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Hashtag fucking earned.

674
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
Hashtag fucking earned.

675
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
Yeah, I think about things more than you guys.

676
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
That's true.

677
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
What a miserable existence you must lead.

678
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
Someone's got to do it.

679
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Thank God it's not me.

680
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
And death is the key.

681
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
If you can get away from the central institute right here.

682
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,320
I would like to do one pro-language little point here that I think me and Ben can get into on this.

683
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
This is the reason why language is great.

684
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Give me something to sink my teeth into.

685
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,320
There are big words and there are rare words.

686
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
You have your commoner, pig-slop-speak.

687
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,320
You have your ants and thes and hellos.

688
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,320
But then you bring out shit like keroskero.

689
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Oh, what's another big one?

690
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Is that English?

691
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Or Tentious?

692
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
It's Italian.

693
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

694
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

695
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Yeah, there it is.

696
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
You've got big shit like that.

697
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,320
And I love, I fucking love to break out big words and rare words.

698
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
It's like getting a Pokemon card.

699
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
It's getting like a holographic Pokemon card.

700
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
You're reading an essay, you're listening to something.

701
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,320
He says a big fucking word and you go, wow, that guy's fucking smart.

702
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
And it's great.

703
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Okay, yeah, that does support my point.

704
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
I'll just quickly adjust it.

705
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Rather than language being a paintbrush, rather language is a paint and you're the paintbrush.

706
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
So whatever picture, like, and it's up to you to paint the picture that you want to paint.

707
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
You know?

708
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
And so language is kind of like that.

709
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Each word is a color and you have to, you know, make it all come together.

710
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I mean, in Japan, that's quite literal.

711
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Language is like a bunch of Jenga blocks and your sentences are the tower.

712
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Oh.

713
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
The curves are something.

714
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
And they all come tumbling down.

715
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
And you know what?

716
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Some sort of data link that communicates all context, all the points that you're going to make

717
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,320
that just instantly transferred that information would be a better,

718
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
would be a skyscraper that was invincible and indestructible.

719
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Nate, fight me on this.

720
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
How is that?

721
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
How is the data link or some kind of like digital data transfer between minds?

722
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,320
How is that not just using another language?

723
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,320
How is that not just converting things to computer language?

724
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
I'm still confused.

725
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
If you're arguing arguments, none of us suggested.

726
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,320
You're just arguing your own damn ideas.

727
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,320
But see, but see, you saying, but you saying that language is good in these ways is in fact a completely separate.

728
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
I'm not saying language is just good.

729
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
I never said language is good.

730
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I said language is the tool.

731
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,320
You literally said language is good way before.

732
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Language is good.

733
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
You fucking asshole.

734
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
And I agree.

735
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
And I agree.

736
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
But that's not my point.

737
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Then what the fuck are you talking about?

738
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
That's not perfect.

739
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Nate's point is that it's not perfect.

740
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
I need to say it's a tool.

741
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
You use it.

742
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
If you use it poorly, it happens.

743
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh my God.

744
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
You just don't.

745
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Nate, the problem is that, let me, let's go back.

746
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Hippo, what was the last time you bought Pokemon cards?

747
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,320
I got it a couple months ago and it got a hollow in my first pack.

748
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Why don't you get out of my eardrum?

749
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
It's hurts.

750
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
I lost two cents.

751
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Stop by hating us some more.

752
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
We're just talking past each other's problems.

753
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
I actually have a point to make.

754
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
I just came up with, but it's something I've always opinionated.

755
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Do you really think that I think language has no value, even though I distinctly said that's not the case?

756
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
No.

757
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Nate, the problem is...

758
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
God damn it.

759
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Okay.

760
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
I'm pissed off.

761
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Nate, I'm pissed off this time.

762
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,320
This is why he wants a better alternative for language, because he can't use the one we have.

763
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Let me tell you, Nate, the ambiguity...

764
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I don't understand any of your points against me.

765
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,320
No, it's just funny.

766
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:24,320
The ambiguity and misunderstandability of words is, saves as many lives, prevents as many wars as it causes.

767
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,320
If someone asks, oh, hey, person at the grocery store, how are you today?

768
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Dude, you're literally making that up.

769
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
You have no justification for that.

770
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Can I just...

771
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:40,320
I want to go back to an example that you said, Nate, just not to argue, but just to request clarification.

772
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Okay.

773
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,320
I want to better understand your position for the sake of extending an olive branch.

774
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,320
One of the first examples you cited was talking about the racism definition and how there's multiple definitions,

775
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,320
and that causes confusion and that's a weakness in language.

776
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,320
What I am trying to figure out is because you're saying that we need a superior version of language

777
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:08,320
where we can kind of communicate all subtext and all meaning in addition to the points we're saying.

778
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:17,320
But using that specific example, if somebody who's a super far-left, crazy, regressive, lefty kind of guy

779
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,320
was able to communicate this way and communicated their idea of racism, whatever,

780
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,320
instantly into someone else's brain who had the more traditional definition.

781
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
How would that change anything?

782
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
Because the person...

783
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm so glad you asked.

784
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm so glad you asked.

785
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
I have a point to make about this.

786
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
I will make it later.

787
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Motherfuckers, I'm going to say it.

788
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Give me some time, but I'll really get back to it.

789
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Okay, but Tom, that's a great question.

790
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
I'm really glad you asked.

791
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Okay, here's how.

792
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Because I would argue that because people are using, for example, the different definition of the word racism,

793
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
they're using the same word, but they mean different things.

794
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,320
That means they are not actually debating the ideas of one versus on the same level.

795
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:08,320
So again, somebody who uses the older version of the word saying that, for example, saying minorities can be racist,

796
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,320
and then you've got a big SJW saying, no, minorities can't be racist,

797
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,320
but they're not actually saying the same thing.

798
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,320
They're not actually debating the same idea, and therefore a real communication,

799
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,320
a real examination of those same ideas is not happening.

800
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,320
If they just knew, if both sides knew exactly what the other meant,

801
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,320
and we removed the ambiguity of the word, they could...

802
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,320
The person would say, well, like, oh, okay, like the right-wing person would say, for example, here,

803
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
like, oh, I get it.

804
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,320
You're saying that privilege is real, and I could admit that to some degree,

805
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,320
but I still think it is bad to discriminate based on race across the board.

806
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,320
And if the left-wing person with the new definition is saying, oh, okay, like, it's good that you accept that,

807
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,320
and what we actually disagree on is if it's, like, okay, to discriminate against people who have power,

808
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,320
you know, for example, like, white people who are the majority in America.

809
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,320
If we're having that debate, that is a substantive debate, which I think is just way better.

810
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Do you not think that that's happening in the vast majority of cases when this debate is being had?

811
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Absolutely not.

812
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:17,320
I've read articles and listened to videos of people using the regressive lefty form of racism,

813
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,320
and I understand the position they're coming from, and I still think it's retarded.

814
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,320
But, Tom, would you say, would you say, Tom, that even if, as you say, the majority do that,

815
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:32,320
if there's even a good chunk of people who are making this mistake, wouldn't it be nice if that didn't happen?

816
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I mean, I can't solve other people's issues of stupidity.

817
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Well, I think you guys are talking about different things.

818
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Nate, what you're saying is just that the conversation is a non-starter,

819
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,320
because from the very beginning, when both parties are using the same word, the same signifier,

820
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,320
to mean different things, then no real communication is taking place.

821
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
Exactly.

822
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Like, it would all be fine if we could make two different words for those two different things

823
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,320
than the conversation, like, saying nothing about who's right or who's wrong.

824
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Just the conversation could then proceed in earnest.

825
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
That is exactly right, Ben. Thank you.

826
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,320
The ambiguity of language is invaluable.

827
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,320
It's how our society is made.

828
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,320
It's the fact that we can say a thing, and we could have different ideas of that thing,

829
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,320
but we can still, sometimes, still kind of carry along.

830
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,320
And if we did data link for everything, and you're in the store and someone goes,

831
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,320
hey, how are you today? And the answer is, I would have fucking killed somebody!

832
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,320
You know, that would be kind of hard to go to the grocery store.

833
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Wait, wait, wait, so you're saying it's better to not know that there are murderous people around us?

834
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:44,320
If you had the ability to just suck your brain right into someone's actual thoughts,

835
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,320
you'd be running and scampering up, down, left, right for your life.

836
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
That should be like a video game or something, I don't know.

837
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,320
You don't have to broadcast your thoughts to anybody.

838
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
I mean, even in this theoretical situation.

839
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
Oh, what's that thing in the psychopath's code?

840
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
You're a motherfucking...

841
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
Psychopath.

842
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,320
...utilitarian society, where all of our mouths are sealed shut,

843
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
and we all have USBs in our fucking necks.

844
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,320
A bunch of nosy people will start poking around their USB cords,

845
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
trying to poke you, trying to surprise you.

846
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Like, boop, plugged in, now I get to know exactly what you're thinking.

847
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,320
And it's like, fuck you!

848
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Devote, devote.

849
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
I want hate sex with you.

850
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,320
I'm happy to make hyperbolic statements.

851
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
I like language because language is anarchy. That's nice.

852
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Language is anarchy.

853
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
I don't like anarchy.

854
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,320
I want to talk about datalink.

855
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,320
I want to pick apart the idea.

856
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,320
I want to pick apart the idea that we could somehow circumvent

857
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,320
an imperfect language through the use of some kind of datalink.

858
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,320
We can do that if you want, but I think that's a huge waste of time

859
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,320
because I'm not actually trying to defend this whole podcast.

860
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
I agree.

861
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
This podcast sucks.

862
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Why does everybody think this is a huge waste of time?

863
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,320
This has been a great podcast.

864
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
It's been a great discussion. I've really enjoyed it.

865
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I'm not trying to defend myself.

866
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I just think to attack this hypothetical system,

867
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
I'm not actually trying to defend a hypothetical system.

868
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,320
I'm just promoting one way that we could improve language.

869
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,320
You and people throw out this idea

870
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
that if we could just digitize our thoughts

871
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,320
and communicate them directly to each other,

872
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,320
that we would somehow know more about each other.

873
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,320
But I say that that is just a different version of the same thing

874
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,320
because you're still converting to a shared language, a computer language.

875
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,320
And ultimately, okay, here's what I want to throw out

876
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,320
and I think we could discuss it,

877
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,320
or maybe everyone will think it's a big waste of time, in which case, whatever.

878
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Fuck you.

879
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,320
Are our thoughts, are our innermost thoughts

880
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,320
like a language of their own, or are they language-less?

881
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Yeah, I think so.

882
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
The different brains are different, obviously.

883
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,320
If we were to date up the language as it is now,

884
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
it's a translation tool to get things out of your brain.

885
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
Right.

886
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,320
But do they originate?

887
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,320
In your brain, do they originate as pure thought,

888
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,320
or is pure thought happening in an inner language?

889
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Don't you think people will find a way to manipulate those thoughts anyway

890
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,320
and just not be honest in some way?

891
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
People will do that.

892
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Humans have fucking glands and things that create emotions.

893
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,320
I'm trying to think of the words, I can't think of the words.

894
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Humans feel lust and rage and sadness and all these things,

895
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
and those are caused by chemicals in the brain.

896
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Fill in all those right now.

897
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Well, question.

898
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
Question.

899
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Does an English speaker think in English,

900
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,320
or do they think in an inner language and then translate to English?

901
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
I think what happens is that when you're...

902
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
I mean, that's on the internet.

903
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,320
...before you learn the language.

904
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,320
I think you probably don't have specific words for those things.

905
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,320
I think as we grow older and learn our first language,

906
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,320
that's how we identify things.

907
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
This is something I've thought about sometimes too,

908
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
because I've always thought about learning other languages,

909
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
and people who have learned other languages,

910
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,320
your internal monologue is always going on.

911
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
And like, Mage, maybe this is a question for you

912
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
because you don't speak English.

913
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
Because I don't...

914
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Yes, she does.

915
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
You don't speak English.

916
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
I don't speak English at all.

917
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Yeah.

918
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Oh, shit.

919
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
I have no idea what that meant.

920
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,320
My point is that, like...

921
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,320
If I learned another language,

922
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,320
my brain would probably still be thinking primarily in English,

923
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
and I'd be translating to that other language.

924
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,320
So is your internal monologue still in Lithuanian,

925
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,320
or does English poke in there every now and then?

926
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
Actually, for me personally,

927
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,320
I can't say this is for everyone because it's probably not,

928
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,320
but for me personally, my internal monologue is English.

929
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
And I usually...

930
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Wow.

931
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,320
I default to Lithuanian usually when I start counting things.

932
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Nice.

933
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
That's usually the only time.

934
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Well, the only Lithuanian allowed on this podcast

935
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,320
is Lithuanian puns, so...

936
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
I feel like there's a difference.

937
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
There's a difference in the brain,

938
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
in the mind-brain-thought-brain tank.

939
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,320
Between, like, monologues and thoughts,

940
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,320
I feel like I don't think in words

941
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
until I think about thinking in words,

942
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,320
and then I can't stop thinking in words until I forget.

943
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
And then I'm like,

944
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
oh wait, have I been thinking in words all this time?

945
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
Or have I been thinking in, like,

946
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
just a nebulous sort of feeling,

947
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
like a gut instinct sort of thing?

948
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
The scientific reason for that is because, like,

949
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
you have your neocortex,

950
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,320
which is the newest part of your brain,

951
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
and that's our capacity for languages.

952
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
But then we have the limbic brain,

953
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,320
which is where decision-making and emotion comes from,

954
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
and that has no capacity for language.

955
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,320
So when you're thinking emotionally,

956
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,320
your brain isn't even thinking with words,

957
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
because the part of your brain doing all...

958
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Oh yeah, and we can turn those signals into...

959
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
And we can brainwave,

960
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
blast them with a thing.

961
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
But emotions are sometimes irrational,

962
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
and if you communicate your emotions,

963
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
there's going to be a lot of miscommunication.

964
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Do you ever fucking notice,

965
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
do you ever fucking notice that, like,

966
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
something will happen or someone will even say something,

967
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
and you have a reaction,

968
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
like, maybe a second later,

969
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
do you even, like, realize why you had that reaction?

970
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
Like, you don't need it.

971
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,320
You react the offense before you even actually

972
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,320
understand why you're offended.

973
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,320
I have that sometimes to do,

974
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
but I think it's just because I'm a child.

975
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,320
I don't know what the problem is for everyone else.

976
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Well, hey, let me just throw this out here,

977
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
because I think this is happening,

978
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,320
and I just think there's a little bit of talking about it.

979
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,320
Like, May just point just now, you know,

980
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
it's probably fine, I'm not trying to attack you.

981
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
So, like, give an eye, for example,

982
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,320
say that, like, okay, there's a problem with language,

983
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,320
and it's this, and then, like,

984
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,320
we say, like, okay, here's, like,

985
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,320
what we could consider, like, a better version.

986
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,320
So, for example, you know, this, like, telepathic communication,

987
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
where we can really articulate ourselves

988
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
and communicate, like, everything in a blame blast.

989
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
It's fictional, I get it.

990
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
And then, you guys, in response to that, say,

991
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,320
okay, but that has these additional flaws.

992
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
No, I'm not saying that it's not enough of an improvement.

993
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Or it's not enough of an improvement.

994
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
I'm saying that it doesn't make any sense.

995
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
I don't think it circumvents the problem at all.

996
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
If you're gonna, if the point is there's a problem with language,

997
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,320
I agree, there's inherent problems with spoken language,

998
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
and there's limitations.

999
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,320
Would a brain blast be superior in some ways?

1000
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,320
Sure.

1001
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
Jimmy Neutron's got it down.

1002
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,320
Does it still?

1003
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,320
Brain blast is always superior.

1004
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
Does it still have problems?

1005
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,320
Wait, wait, wait, let Tom finish.

1006
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
It's still, but there are still issues.

1007
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
There are still issues, even with that.

1008
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,320
Because, yeah.

1009
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,320
Man, you've entered the same issue.

1010
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,320
Tom, Tom, I 100%, Tom, I 100% agree.

1011
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,320
Munchy, I think you are objective, okay.

1012
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,320
No, Munch is right.

1013
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
The specific point I made, for example,

1014
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
about including, like, more context.

1015
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,320
Like, for example, the fact that, like, the word racism, again,

1016
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,320
you mean different things.

1017
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
Yeah, but to go back to that example too, though,

1018
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,320
is that even if everybody understood everyone's context,

1019
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
not everybody agrees on the context.

1020
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,320
So you're still not gonna have 100% understanding.

1021
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,320
But Tom, debating the context, my argument,

1022
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
is that is a more productive debate

1023
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
than just using the wrong word.

1024
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Like, that's a step back.

1025
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,320
And I would like to be that step forward,

1026
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,320
where we're actually clashing on the ideas.

1027
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
You can say that, like, that's useless.

1028
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,320
I disagree.

1029
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
I guess my problem is that, like,

1030
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
that's an issue beyond language, right?

1031
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
Because if you really wanted to solve that problem,

1032
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
like, you could write an article,

1033
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
and then you could have little hyperlinks

1034
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
over all your hot-button words

1035
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
and explain exactly what you mean by them,

1036
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,320
and then people would understand what you mean by racism.

1037
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
You just hover over racism,

1038
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
little pop-up thing comes up.

1039
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,320
This is what I mean.

1040
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Prejudice plus power.

1041
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
And then, like, you can know that.

1042
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,320
But what you're doing is you're offering

1043
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,320
exactly what I'm offering,

1044
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
like, a fix to this specific problem.

1045
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Sure.

1046
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
But I don't...

1047
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
It doesn't involve brain tubes.

1048
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
I don't...

1049
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,320
I just don't think that that's...

1050
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,320
That's just a joke.

1051
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
I don't think that's inherently a problem

1052
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,320
with language in and of itself.

1053
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,320
Like, it's a limitation,

1054
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
but, like, it can be addressed.

1055
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
I just think that...

1056
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,320
Oh, it's a limitation,

1057
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,320
but not a problem, is it?

1058
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
Oh, I see.

1059
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,320
I see how it is.

1060
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,320
Yeah.

1061
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,320
Because even if you were able to address this

1062
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
with, like, psychic communication,

1063
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
automatically know everyone's context behind it,

1064
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,320
like, people still aren't going to agree.

1065
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,320
The problem lies within the human mind.

1066
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,320
Is the problem this?

1067
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,320
Is the problem this?

1068
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,320
We're calling it a problem.

1069
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
You called a limitation.

1070
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
Is the problem just that one has a negative label

1071
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
and the other has, like, a neutral?

1072
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,320
No, no, Nate, listen.

1073
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
The problem lies within the humans,

1074
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
not within the language.

1075
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,320
I mean, I disagree for all the reasons

1076
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,320
I've already stated.

1077
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,320
I think that language is inherently limited.

1078
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,320
I don't disagree that language has problems, by the way.

1079
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
Well, that's my point, though.

1080
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
But no, you said language is bad.

1081
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
But I mean, I've walked that back.

1082
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
It is not bad.

1083
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,320
It is way better than having no language.

1084
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,320
And so, like, you win.

1085
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Language is not bad.

1086
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
My point is just that it's not perfect.

1087
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
And maybe I'm wrong.

1088
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,320
I never said that it was perfect.

1089
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,320
There we go.

1090
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Done.

1091
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,320
Humans are flawed creatures, and they, you know,

1092
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,320
it's okay to blame the humans for misusing words.

1093
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,320
But I feel like, like I said earlier,

1094
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,320
the usage, the point of language is to communicate ideas,

1095
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
and it doesn't work on such a large scale

1096
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,320
as it is in today's age of the internet

1097
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,320
and everybody being connected.

1098
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,320
Does anybody have, like, an issue with that statement?

1099
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,320
I think the internet, as a whole,

1100
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,320
proves that language is doing a damn good job.

1101
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,320
I mean, the only, I, the only,

1102
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,320
it's not even a rebuttal to that game.

1103
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
It's just that, like, that is a consequence,

1104
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,320
just sort of of, like, as more people

1105
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
from different backgrounds and areas

1106
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,320
came in contact with each other.

1107
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
That was, you know, that was just going to arise

1108
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,320
as soon as that happened.

1109
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,320
But, like, yeah, it's basically,

1110
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,320
it's a more archaic form of communication.

1111
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,320
Just the fact that we have multiple languages

1112
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
is basically, like, an archaic thing

1113
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,320
that it would sure be nice if we could, like,

1114
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,320
get past that particular issue.

1115
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
You know, I went to the springboard off that,

1116
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
why the fuck haven't we gone, like,

1117
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
Star Wars or Star Trek and have, like,

1118
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
a universal basic everybody listens to?

1119
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
I constantly think about that.

1120
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Like, Esperanto, why isn't Esperanto, like,

1121
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
funded by everybody

1122
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,320
and a requirement for all countries?

1123
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
You know why?

1124
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,320
You know why?

1125
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
It's because people are tribal

1126
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
and they like their history.

1127
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,320
That's why.

1128
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
There's no reason to not just have that

1129
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
in addition to, like, it should be happening.

1130
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Fair point.

1131
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Also, people are lazy.

1132
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
There should be a stripped-down,

1133
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
very basic form of language

1134
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
that everyone learns.

1135
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,320
I'll tell you exactly why I would argue.

1136
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
Like, the reason I wouldn't want to do it

1137
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
is because English looks like it's doing

1138
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
pretty well right now.

1139
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,320
I'm just going to hold out hope

1140
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,320
that English just wins

1141
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
and everybody starts speaking English.

1142
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
Therefore, I have to do as little work as possible.

1143
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,320
I think a lot of people

1144
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,320
probably hold up that hope.

1145
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,320
That doesn't seem very

1146
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
utilitarian.

1147
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
Where are the structural issues

1148
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
in language made?

1149
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Like, is there anything inherent

1150
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
to language that makes it undesirable

1151
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,320
or would just adding more words

1152
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
and more syntax be accomplishing

1153
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
what you want?

1154
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
I think ultimately the problem with language

1155
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
is that it is based on, like,

1156
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
group consensus, as Gibbs said,

1157
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
and just inherently as, like,

1158
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
if we could theoretically impose some,

1159
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
like, like, French, for example,

1160
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
French is a language where there is an organization

1161
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
in France that dictates what

1162
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,320
words mean.

1163
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,320
They have, like, a body that decides this.

1164
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,320
So, in France, technically,

1165
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,320
like, you know, they'll, like, write in stuff

1166
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
of, like, the consensus just changes

1167
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
and they incorporate skiddy,

1168
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,320
scuba de bop.

1169
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,320
That means, like, a skateboard.

1170
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,320
It's just another word for skateboard.

1171
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,320
Cool.

1172
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,320
But, like, in that language,

1173
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,320
you can't just make,

1174
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,320
you cannot, like, change the definition

1175
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,320
of a word.

1176
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
Well, the problem is that's not enforceable.

1177
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
Things will just change no matter what.

1178
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
You can't even have an organizational body

1179
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
impose from top down what words mean,

1180
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
because they're just responding

1181
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
to what people do in the world anyway.

1182
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,320
Well, there you go, Nate.

1183
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
It sounds like the languages reflect the cultures.

1184
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
No one would even think to do that

1185
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,320
for English because it's like,

1186
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,320
okay, is London gonna decide?

1187
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
You think you're gonna have any luck getting America?

1188
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,320
This is all to my point,

1189
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
that these are limitations of language, yeah.

1190
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
But French, I mean,

1191
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
I'm sure there's lots of French

1192
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,320
places around the world,

1193
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,320
but it's mostly France, right?

1194
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Isn't it?

1195
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
Yes.

1196
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,320
So, like, France is a big country.

1197
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,320
Yeah.

1198
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,320
There's a lot of places that speak French,

1199
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,320
like in Africa.

1200
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
There's different French dialects.

1201
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
But what's your point?

1202
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,320
What's your point, though?

1203
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,320
The point is,

1204
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,320
French can do shit like that

1205
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,320
because it's a little bit more centralized.

1206
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,320
English can't, you know,

1207
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,320
other languages reflect their

1208
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,320
geographical realities,

1209
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
so I think those languages are perfectly fine

1210
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,320
for those kinds of people.

1211
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
I...

1212
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
I...

1213
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Okay.

1214
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
The racism problem.

1215
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
Why can't we just say,

1216
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,320
okay, racism...

1217
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,320
People think racism

1218
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,320
means two different things,

1219
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
or maybe even multiple different things.

1220
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,320
All you gotta do is just correct them.

1221
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,320
So, let's...

1222
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
Let's just add an adjective.

1223
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,320
Oh, this is special racism,

1224
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,320
special racism.

1225
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,320
Like, are there...

1226
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,320
No, because people with a...

1227
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Traditional racism.

1228
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,320
People with a political agenda

1229
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,320
don't want to do that

1230
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,320
because they want to manipulate the masses.

1231
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,320
That is true.

1232
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
That is true.

1233
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Like, when you...

1234
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,320
When, like, somebody says,

1235
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,320
that was racist.

1236
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
Or, like, just for example,

1237
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,320
if, like...

1238
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,320
This is just a crazy example,

1239
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
but, like, if a minority, like,

1240
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
kills a white person,

1241
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,320
they say that's not a hate crime

1242
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
because it wasn't motivated by race.

1243
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
Like, even if the person said,

1244
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
like, let's say this person said,

1245
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm killing this white person

1246
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
because they're white,

1247
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
that's why I'm doing it.

1248
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
Like, like, the new definition

1249
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,320
can make a case that that wasn't a racist

1250
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,320
and wasn't a hate crime

1251
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,320
because, in their definition,

1252
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,320
it's...

1253
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,320
You can only be racist

1254
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
if you lack social...

1255
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320
Here's my fucking thing.

1256
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Yeah, if you lack social power.

1257
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Here's my fucking thing.

1258
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
With the confusion of words,

1259
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,320
here's why the confusion of words

1260
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
is natural and good

1261
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
and should be embraced.

1262
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
People...

1263
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
What you're doing, Nate,

1264
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,320
is you're doing the fallacy

1265
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,320
to reframe what I said earlier,

1266
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,320
the fallacy of wanting to have

1267
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,320
permanent simplifications.

1268
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,320
What I want is interesting conversations.

1269
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
How is it...

1270
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
What is the fallacy?

1271
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
There are...

1272
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,320
It's not, I guess, a fallacy...

1273
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,320
It's not like a logical fallacy,

1274
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
but it's a...

1275
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
What would you call it?

1276
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,320
A fool's errand

1277
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,320
to try to find some sort of formula.

1278
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
Okay, sure.

1279
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
And I know it's a fallacy

1280
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
that programmers,

1281
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
especially fallen to all the time,

1282
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
they want to, like,

1283
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,320
come up with some sort of formula

1284
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
that just takes the edge off.

1285
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
And that's what people want

1286
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
with, like, communication.

1287
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
Oh, if we just have this

1288
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,320
perfect formula.

1289
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,320
No, no.

1290
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
I'm finishing this point.

1291
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,320
So, that's the reason

1292
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
why these podcasts

1293
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,320
always derail into these

1294
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,320
technical conversations,

1295
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
because we're trying to, like,

1296
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,320
find the perfect, like, formulation

1297
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
of the exact definition.

1298
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,320
Whereas if we just let

1299
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
the confusion reign

1300
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
and just, like,

1301
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
iron out little kinks

1302
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
as we want,

1303
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,320
then the podcast will be better.

1304
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,320
And if you let conversations

1305
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
and different disagreements,

1306
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
like what racism means,

1307
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,320
means you can always make

1308
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
communicating your definition

1309
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,320
of racism part of the conversation.

1310
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
It gives you something

1311
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,320
to fucking talk about

1312
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
and makes the conversation

1313
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
a little bit less inane.

1314
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,320
It's a waste of time.

1315
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
And if you know exactly

1316
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,320
how to rebut

1317
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
every version of the

1318
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
wrong version of racism,

1319
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
you can already have

1320
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,320
your prescripted rebuttals

1321
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
ready to go,

1322
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
won't even take any effort.

1323
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
That's not true.

1324
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
The thing is to prove,

1325
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,320
in this very podcast,

1326
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
I have seen people

1327
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
bring up things that Nate

1328
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
has gone back on.

1329
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,320
Um,

1330
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,320
like, maybe they,

1331
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
like what?

1332
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,320
They didn't,

1333
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,320
they forgot about it.

1334
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,320
Like, like, like,

1335
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
you saying language sucks.

1336
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Like, we only said that

1337
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,320
right at the very beginning.

1338
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,320
That's the one thing

1339
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,320
I went back on.

1340
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
And, but, like,

1341
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,320
that has, like,

1342
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,320
colored the perceptions

1343
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,320
of everyone.

1344
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,320
And, and they, they,

1345
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,320
they hang,

1346
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,320
they, they hung on to that

1347
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,320
to, to, to bring it up

1348
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
and like,

1349
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,320
well, I'm framing this

1350
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,320
from this perspective

1351
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
that you have now gone back

1352
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,320
on, but I forgot,

1353
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
or like I didn't listen,

1354
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,320
or I wasn't really

1355
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,320
thinking about it.

1356
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,320
It's just Nate is still

1357
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,320
on this whole,

1358
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
Nate, you're still on this

1359
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,320
whole case of like,

1360
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,320
fucking, uh, well,

1361
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,320
you know,

1362
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320
language isn't like perfect,

1363
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,320
but it's not like bad,

1364
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,320
but it's not like perfect.

1365
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,320
Like, I don't care.

1366
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Got him.

1367
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,320
Well, for somebody

1368
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,320
like, oh, oh,

1369
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
got him.

1370
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,320
Oh, I don't see me

1371
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,320
dabbing right now.

1372
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,320
I don't know who's been

1373
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,320
got here.

1374
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,320
The one thing that I,

1375
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,320
I feel like is like,

1376
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,320
it's kind of like

1377
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,320
lawyering.

1378
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,320
It's kind of like the

1379
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,320
law, the justice system

1380
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,320
and laws and lawyers,

1381
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,320
where the,

1382
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,320
the point of,

1383
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,320
like using,

1384
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,320
co-opting a word

1385
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,320
and making it,

1386
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,320
have a different definition

1387
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,320
to, to push a

1388
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
political agenda is,

1389
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,320
um,

1390
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,320
like just like how law

1391
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,320
is written to be

1392
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,320
incredibly confusing

1393
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,320
so that poor people

1394
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,320
can't figure it out

1395
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,320
and they have to pay

1396
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,320
a really expensive guy

1397
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,320
to translate it for them.

1398
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,320
Sure.

1399
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,320
And, um,

1400
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,320
this is,

1401
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,320
this is a really nasty thing

1402
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,320
and I don't like it.

1403
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,320
These are,

1404
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,320
these are trans issues.

1405
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,320
The fact that someone has to

1406
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,320
translate, I get it.

1407
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,320
Oh, well.

1408
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
And it's,

1409
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
and it's,

1410
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,320
it's just sort of like,

1411
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
people don't have,

1412
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,320
like,

1413
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,320
say a word is changed,

1414
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,320
like 50 words are changed

1415
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,320
and somebody just

1416
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,320
wasn't paying attention

1417
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,320
because they don't use

1418
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,320
those words often.

1419
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,320
And then they see,

1420
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,320
they read a thing

1421
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,320
and they're like,

1422
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
they're really confused,

1423
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,320
but they don't have

1424
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,320
like the time

1425
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,320
or like they're too,

1426
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,320
they just don't,

1427
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,320
it doesn't come up enough

1428
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,320
in their life

1429
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,320
to think about

1430
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
all the different things

1431
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,320
that are going on

1432
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,320
and keep track of all of them.

1433
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,320
They probably have to pay

1434
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,320
a guy to,

1435
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,320
to, to give them

1436
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,320
like an update every so often

1437
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,320
like an app on their phone

1438
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,320
to like,

1439
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,320
all right, here's what this

1440
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,320
word means now.

1441
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,320
You got all the books

1442
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,320
that in the,

1443
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,320
in the past,

1444
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,320
now you know why they're

1445
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
so confusing.

1446
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,320
And it's like,

1447
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
it's just,

1448
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,320
it's just,

1449
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,320
I don't like it.

1450
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,320
I don't have an answer.

1451
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,320
I know why we can't do

1452
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
that thing with racism.

1453
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,320
I know why we can't

1454
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,320
like just be like,

1455
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,320
okay, well now there's

1456
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,320
two different racisms.

1457
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,320
It's because that,

1458
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,320
it's because unlike,

1459
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,320
unlike the French,

1460
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
those rat bastards,

1461
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
we don't,

1462
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,320
we don't have like a council

1463
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
that decides what words mean.

1464
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
Words mean whatever we say

1465
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,320
they mean.

1466
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320
Words mean whatever

1467
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,320
we collectively agree

1468
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,320
that they mean.

1469
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,320
And, and that's why,

1470
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,320
there's a disagreement

1471
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,320
unfortunately.

1472
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,320
There is a,

1473
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,320
there is a disagreement,

1474
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,320
but there's no authority

1475
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,320
that can step in

1476
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,320
and say like,

1477
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,320
well, here's what it actually means.

1478
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Yeah.

1479
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,320
That's the biggest problem.

1480
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,320
But, but new words

1481
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
have been made before.

1482
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,320
There have been new words made.

1483
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
So can't we do that?

1484
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,320
Well,

1485
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,320
but they weren't,

1486
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,320
but they weren't like,

1487
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
to be used by everybody

1488
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,320
is really difficult.

1489
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,320
They weren't passed down

1490
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,320
from on high.

1491
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,320
They were like,

1492
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
they, they like generated,

1493
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,320
I mean,

1494
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,320
except maybe in certain cases

1495
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,320
they were generated

1496
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,320
out of the ether.

1497
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
And like,

1498
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
and like a grassroots kind

1499
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
of campaign could like,

1500
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
you know,

1501
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,320
campaign for a new word

1502
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,320
or something.

1503
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
You know,

1504
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
you know,

1505
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
remember there's a book called

1506
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,320
frindle.

1507
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,320
Remember that book,

1508
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320
frindle?

1509
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
I never read it.

1510
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,320
Do you remember that book,

1511
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
the Hobbit?

1512
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,320
Do you remember that book,

1513
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,320
the Bible?

1514
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,320
No,

1515
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,320
no,

1516
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,320
it's an actual point.

1517
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,320
Okay.

1518
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
J.R.R.

1519
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,320
Tolkien created a language

1520
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,320
of Elvish.

1521
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,320
He created a whole language

1522
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,320
of Elvish

1523
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,320
that people can study

1524
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,320
and it's like really funny

1525
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,320
and they can pretend

1526
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,320
to be elves

1527
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,320
and they can speak

1528
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
with Elvish

1529
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,320
and it's all really funny

1530
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
and cool.

1531
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,320
And the reason that language

1532
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,320
will never change

1533
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,320
is because people don't want

1534
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,320
to be non-canon.

1535
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,320
They don't want to be like

1536
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,320
that guy.

1537
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,320
So they will always stay

1538
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,320
to the canon language.

1539
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
So there is an authority.

1540
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,320
So Elvish will never devolve

1541
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,320
into something like,

1542
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,320
there will never be Elvish

1543
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,320
like,

1544
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,320
slang.

1545
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,320
I don't know, slang.

1546
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,320
Yeah.

1547
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,320
I mean,

1548
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,320
you could have your head cannons

1549
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,320
and stuff,

1550
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,320
but no one really want,

1551
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,320
people who are into that

1552
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,320
don't really want to do that.

1553
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,320
And I like that.

1554
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,320
I just enjoy the fact

1555
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
that that can exist

1556
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
and authority

1557
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,320
that people all agree on,

1558
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
like yes,

1559
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
we'll stick to this.

1560
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,320
We talk in Elvish,

1561
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,320
we know exactly what the other

1562
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,320
person is saying all the time.

1563
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,320
In fact,

1564
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,320
everyone should speak in Elvish.

1565
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,320
It's really funny.

1566
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,320
Actually,

1567
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,320
if we start using it,

1568
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
we'll just face the same problems

1569
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,320
we have with English now.

1570
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,320
Yeah, no, no.

1571
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,320
Hippo, hippo, hippo, hippo.

1572
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,320
Secret, secret, secret club,

1573
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,320
like little brother languages

1574
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,320
where you're like,

1575
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,320
instead of saying,

1576
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,320
hello, I'm going to say,

1577
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,320
go, go, go, go.

1578
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
And,

1579
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
you know,

1580
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
secret languages like that

1581
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,320
between two people

1582
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,320
are the tightest form

1583
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,320
of communication.

1584
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,320
I always prefer that

1585
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,320
to like speaking real.

1586
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,320
So the reason why Elvish doesn't change

1587
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
isn't because of like fandoms.

1588
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,320
I think we have experience enough

1589
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,320
with fandoms to know

1590
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,320
they missed the point of the work.

1591
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
It's the fact that no one

1592
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,320
is a like resident of Elfland, right?

1593
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
So like no one fucking is actively,

1594
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,320
like it's not their primary language.

1595
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,320
No one like lives a society of Elvish.

1596
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,320
You only do it in the form of studying.

1597
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,320
There's no people to evolve with.

1598
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
Right.

1599
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,320
So I think the reason

1600
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,320
why Elvish doesn't change

1601
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,320
is for the same reason

1602
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,320
like I guess Greek

1603
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,320
probably doesn't change anymore

1604
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
because no one actually

1605
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,320
like uses it like a real language.

1606
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,320
They just use it

1607
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,320
as a thing they've studied.

1608
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,320
Besides the country of Greece.

1609
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,320
The Greeks do.

1610
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,320
Oh, the Latin world country of Greece.

1611
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
Latin is a dead language.

1612
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,320
Latin.

1613
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,320
There we go.

1614
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,320
Yeah.

1615
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,320
That one.

1616
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,320
That fucking one.

1617
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,320
Yeah.

1618
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,320
Let's all speak Latin.

1619
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,320
That's an issue with language

1620
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,320
that's brought up.

1621
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,320
How, you know,

1622
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,320
the Bibles ran exclusively

1623
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,320
in land in the olden days.

1624
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,320
And so the poor,

1625
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,320
you know,

1626
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,320
the poor baby bitch fuckers

1627
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
couldn't actually read the Bible.

1628
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,320
They didn't know what the fuck

1629
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,320
was going on.

1630
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,320
That's a problem.

1631
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,320
Used to subjugate people.

1632
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,320
I did it.

1633
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
I'm the anti-language person.

1634
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
Okay.

1635
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
I have a statement

1636
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
and I want to see

1637
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
if everyone agrees.

1638
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
Okay.

1639
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,320
We have language.

1640
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,320
It's not perfect.

1641
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,320
False.

1642
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,320
No, no.

1643
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,320
We have language.

1644
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,320
It's not perfect.

1645
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,320
If there were better

1646
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,320
alternatives,

1647
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,320
that would be nice.

1648
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,320
But there aren't any.

1649
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,320
So what we currently have

1650
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,320
is better than nothing.

1651
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,320
Yeah.

1652
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,320
Agree.

1653
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,320
Well, I think Nate

1654
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,320
was like going on this

1655
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
like maybe they could

1656
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,320
like could we work

1657
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
towards like stuff

1658
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,320
like we should start

1659
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,320
working towards a better version.

1660
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,320
Yeah.

1661
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,320
That's part of my statement.

1662
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,320
If there was a better version,

1663
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,320
that would be nice.

1664
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,320
Oh, actually,

1665
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,320
I do know a thing about this.

1666
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
I remember reading like an article.

1667
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
I read the actual article.

1668
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
Well, okay.

1669
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,320
I skimmed it.

1670
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,320
And it was about how like,

1671
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,320
oh man, wouldn't it be cool

1672
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,320
if we instead of like

1673
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,320
all these really messy languages

1674
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,320
with all these inconsistencies,

1675
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,320
you know,

1676
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,320
even if you go to like,

1677
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
you know,

1678
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Japanese or Korean

1679
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
where it's like,

1680
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,320
hey, there's no pronunciation

1681
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,320
bullshit.

1682
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,320
Then it's like, oh, you know,

1683
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,320
Japanese,

1684
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,320
here's all this kanji bullshit,

1685
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,320
right?

1686
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,320
So it's like,

1687
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,320
it's like technical and accurate

1688
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,320
and clean with no bullshit.

1689
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
And someone like did a study

1690
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,320
of this.

1691
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,320
They like had like computers

1692
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
algorithmically like generate

1693
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,320
some languages

1694
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,320
and it had people like practice

1695
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,320
with them.

1696
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,320
The point is what they found

1697
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,320
and I don't know how tested

1698
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,320
this was yet,

1699
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
but humans actually only

1700
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
really get a grip on

1701
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,320
bullshit languages

1702
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,320
because our brains are

1703
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,320
themselves a bullshit

1704
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
mishmash-pishposh

1705
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
of billions of years of evolution.

1706
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,320
So like,

1707
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,320
we don't actually

1708
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,320
ever think as cleanly

1709
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,320
as robots ever will

1710
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,320
because we're just a fucking mess.

1711
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,320
We're a fucking mess

1712
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,320
genetically.

1713
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,320
You know what the future is?

1714
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,320
The future is like Isaac Asimov

1715
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,320
where all the kids

1716
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,320
don't learn English,

1717
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,320
they just learn programming

1718
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,320
language and everyone has

1719
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
a programming job

1720
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,320
because that's the only thing

1721
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,320
humans are useful for.

1722
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,320
Eventually that one

1723
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,320
is being useful.

1724
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,320
They maintain all the robots.

1725
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,320
That's sad.

1726
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,320
A lot of robots be able to do

1727
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
that before too long too.

1728
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
It was really sad when I first

1729
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
read it,

1730
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,320
but I kind of,

1731
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
I think it's kind of cool

1732
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
how that guy that from so long

1733
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,320
ago had that idea.

1734
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,320
Yeah, but I like

1735
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
language because

1736
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,320
I'm specifically English

1737
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,320
because of how silly it can get.

1738
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,320
I like the stupid,

1739
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,320
oh whoa,

1740
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,320
and verb,

1741
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
and doggo,

1742
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,320
and shit like that.

1743
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,320
I love it.

1744
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,320
It's great.

1745
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,320
It'd be sad to see it go.

1746
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,320
Yeah.

1747
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,320
This will be an extremely

1748
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,320
unpopular opinion,

1749
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,320
and I will be,

1750
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,320
I'll,

1751
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,320
no, go for it.

1752
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,320
Language.

1753
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,320
Sorry, I was stretching

1754
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,320
while talking.

1755
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,320
I'll be berated

1756
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,320
both in the comments

1757
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,320
and right now.

1758
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,320
But isn't the sort

1759
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,320
of uncertainty of language

1760
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,320
kind of romantic?

1761
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,320
Isn't it kind of neat to be able

1762
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,320
to write down something

1763
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,320
that's awful,

1764
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,320
how to be interpreted

1765
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,320
in different ways?

1766
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,320
That's like why.

1767
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,320
I think it's good for like

1768
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,320
having a friend

1769
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,320
and chumming out

1770
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,320
and like making a funny joke.

1771
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,320
Yeah.

1772
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,320
But when it comes to politics,

1773
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,320
I feel like people should

1774
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,320
talk in bleeps and bloops.

1775
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,320
It gives rise to like poetry

1776
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,320
and puns

1777
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,320
and,

1778
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,320
you know,

1779
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,320
cute shit like that.

1780
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,320
I like that.

1781
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,320
I'm probably willing

1782
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,320
to accept the artistic

1783
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,320
narrative language.

1784
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,320
Yeah, I mean,

1785
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,320
it's,

1786
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,320
language is both an art

1787
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,320
and a science depending

1788
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
on how it's being used.

1789
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,320
Mm-hmm.

1790
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,320
It's funny though,

1791
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,320
like if we're used to it

1792
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,320
like this,

1793
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,320
like things that are serious

1794
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,320
being used with words

1795
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,320
that can also be used

1796
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,320
to make art.

1797
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,320
But like,

1798
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,320
imagine if like politics

1799
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,320
was done with drawings

1800
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,320
instead of,

1801
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,320
you know.

1802
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,320
Sorry,

1803
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,320
just imagine

1804
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
politicians finger-painting.

1805
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,320
Yes,

1806
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,320
if finger-painting,

1807
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,320
having the deviant art

1808
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,320
being used

1809
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,320
instead of like Donald Trump's

1810
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,320
Twitter,

1811
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,320
it would be like,

1812
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,320
Donald Trump's made another

1813
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,320
mural.

1814
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,320
Trump's made another mural,

1815
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,320
everyone,

1816
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,320
check it out.

1817
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,320
That's why he wants

1818
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,320
to make the wall

1819
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,320
so he can put his

1820
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,320
mural somewhere.

1821
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,320
Politics does

1822
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,320
definitely need to be

1823
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,320
a much more visual medium

1824
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,320
than it is.

1825
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,320
I remember back in like

1826
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,320
2012,

1827
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,320
like,

1828
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,320
Mitt Romney was all like,

1829
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,320
oh man,

1830
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,320
there's been less oil drilling,

1831
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,320
less American energy

1832
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,320
than Obama.

1833
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,320
I was like,

1834
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,320
oh,

1835
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,320
it was actually 45% up

1836
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,320
the previous.

1837
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,320
No,

1838
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,320
it was like 25% down

1839
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,320
the previous year

1840
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,320
of the government grants.

1841
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,320
All right, guys,

1842
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,320
you bitches need to

1843
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,320
have a fucking easel

1844
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,320
and show us some fucking

1845
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,320
charts, please.

1846
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,320
I can't hold all these

1847
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,320
words in my head at once.

1848
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,320
Here's where

1849
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,320
I will spiral into

1850
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,320
absolute madness

1851
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,320
that I deserve to be

1852
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,320
criticized for.

1853
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,320
But it's like,

1854
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,320
beyond language,

1855
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,320
I get frustrated

1856
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,320
with facts.

1857
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,320
Yeah.

1858
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,320
It's in the sense that

1859
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,320
I've had enough of these

1860
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,320
facts.

1861
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
I've had enough of

1862
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,320
these facts.

1863
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,320
But the problem is,

1864
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,320
just like with language.

1865
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,320
Yeah, I know,

1866
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,320
I know exactly what you're

1867
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,320
talking about.

1868
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,320
With this Mitt Romney

1869
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,320
example,

1870
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,320
who knows,

1871
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,320
who's like,

1872
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,320
when Mitt Romney said a fact,

1873
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,320
I'm sure that fact

1874
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,320
was true.

1875
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,320
Then Obama

1876
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,320
raises more facts

1877
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,320
that contextualize,

1878
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,320
but it is entirely possible

1879
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,320
that there are yet facts

1880
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,320
beyond that

1881
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,320
further contextualize.

1882
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Oh,

1883
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,320
that's why I don't

1884
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
research things.

1885
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,320
You know,

1886
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,320
it's just like,

1887
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,320
you know what,

1888
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,320
how,

1889
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,320
what are we expected to do?

1890
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,320
That's why,

1891
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,320
like I want to know

1892
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,320
literally every fact

1893
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,320
to make an opinion.

1894
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,320
You're talking about

1895
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
cherry picking facts,

1896
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,320
where you present

1897
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,320
a fact that sounds good

1898
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,320
without it's a broader

1899
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,320
context to give it more meaning.

1900
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,320
I mean, the problem is,

1901
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,320
the problem is to me,

1902
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,320
like you've got

1903
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,320
guys on like the

1904
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,320
left wing and the right wing.

1905
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,320
And like,

1906
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,320
if you just see a fact

1907
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,320
tweeted by like whatever,

1908
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,320
you know,

1909
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,320
a journalist or whatever

1910
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,320
that's like in your team,

1911
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
you can read that.

1912
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,320
Then the opposition will say,

1913
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,320
well,

1914
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,320
you didn't contextualize it,

1915
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,320
blah, blah, blah.

1916
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,320
But then,

1917
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,320
and then like a person

1918
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,320
by doing this like first

1919
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,320
level fact check

1920
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,320
will feel satisfied,

1921
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,320
but it's entirely possible

1922
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,320
that there's an infinite

1923
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,320
spiral of yet further

1924
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,320
fact checkings

1925
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,320
that need to happen.

1926
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,320
That's because life is complicated.

1927
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,320
And if you want to be informed,

1928
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,320
you have to be the guy

1929
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,320
that's like,

1930
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,320
I guess I'm just gonna

1931
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,320
have to do a deep dive

1932
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,320
on every tweet

1933
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,320
ever tweeted.

1934
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,320
Yeah, that's right.

1935
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,320
Yeah, you really do.

1936
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,320
Like you have to basically

1937
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,320
like check up facts

1938
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,320
as a lifestyle

1939
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
to where you get

1940
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,320
an intuitive sense of it.

1941
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,320
That's the only way to do it.

1942
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,320
That really is.

1943
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,320
And you know guys,

1944
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,320
no one does it.

1945
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,320
This is,

1946
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
I mean,

1947
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,320
it's similar to just

1948
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,320
my personal frustration.

1949
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,320
You know,

1950
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,320
you can feel free to

1951
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,320
disagree as you have,

1952
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,320
but it's just like,

1953
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,320
that's why when someone

1954
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,320
like says a sentence,

1955
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,320
like that,

1956
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,320
I feel like make a tweet.

1957
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,320
Like I feel frustration with this.

1958
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Like I can try to make it

1959
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,320
seem like what I want it to.

1960
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,320
And I know that

1961
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,320
like Twitter is limited

1962
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,320
as opposed to like

1963
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,320
writing a blog post or whatever.

1964
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,320
But it's just like,

1965
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,320
I just want to communicate

1966
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,320
literally every fact

1967
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,320
about this thing

1968
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,320
I'm trying to say.

1969
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,320
And I feel a deep frustration

1970
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
that it's so hard to do that.

1971
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
And you know,

1972
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,320
I know language is

1973
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,320
a ton of great stuff.

1974
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,320
But I just,

1975
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
oh, it kills me.

1976
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
Kiss myself.

1977
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,320
But it's like,

1978
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
oh no, no, you don't understand.

1979
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
Like I was actually

1980
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
at the urinal

1981
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,320
and there were just a couple of drops.

1982
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,320
I was like,

1983
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,320
I'm not a real guy.

1984
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,320
Like technically,

1985
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,320
yes, I did piss myself.

1986
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
And also I was spooked

1987
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
by a clown.

1988
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,320
So it wasn't even my fault.

1989
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,320
Like this is,

1990
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,320
there's yet further context

1991
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,320
beyond this.

1992
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,320
And we can go all day.

1993
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
And I was at a clown rodeo

1994
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,320
as a matter of fact.

1995
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,320
So like,

1996
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,320
maybe I should have been prepared.

1997
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,320
So maybe I'm actually

1998
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
in the wrong here.

1999
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
You know, we can go all day.

2000
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,320
The problem with language

2001
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,320
is like the problem

2002
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,320
with all things,

2003
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
clowns over the abundance of clowns

2004
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,320
makes us all piss ourselves

2005
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,320
and languages ruined forever

2006
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,320
at the site of one jug alone.

2007
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,320
Yeah.

2008
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Well, I'm glad

2009
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,320
we went through with this exercise.

2010
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,320
I guess,

2011
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,320
do we have final points here?

2012
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,320
You want to wrap up here?

2013
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,320
What language do you guys want to learn?

2014
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,320
I want to learn,

2015
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,320
I like English.

2016
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
I want to learn American sign language.

2017
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
I want to learn Arabic.

2018
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,320
I think that would be really funny.

2019
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,320
More like Arabic.

2020
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
Arabic looks really nice.

2021
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,320
I like Arabic.

2022
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,320
I like the way it's all swishy and swishy.

2023
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,320
It looks intimidating to learn.

2024
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,320
Yeah.

2025
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
It probably isn't.

2026
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,320
That's from the early,

2027
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,320
that part of the world

2028
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,320
is where the first languages

2029
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,320
even came out of the ground.

2030
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,320
I want to give...

2031
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,320
I mean,

2032
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
the Arabic numbering system was pretty good,

2033
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,320
so I'd hope their actual language holds up.

2034
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,320
Is that what we use?

2035
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,320
Yes.

2036
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,320
One, two, three, four, five.

2037
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,320
That's right.

2038
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,320
Way to go, guys.

2039
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,320
Didn't they invent the zero over there, too?

2040
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,320
I think it was India, actually.

2041
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,320
I think it was zero.

2042
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,320
Oh, okay.

2043
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,320
Some fucked up freak.

2044
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,320
As I'm sure everyone knows,

2045
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,320
I wish to continue learning Japanese

2046
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,320
specifically for just practical

2047
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,320
and artistic reasons,

2048
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,320
because I think it's cool.

2049
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,320
Yeah, same here, Nate.

2050
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,320
I just want to be able to listen to anime

2051
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,320
while I'm doing the other shit.

2052
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
Same.

2053
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,320
That would be great.

2054
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,320
I also want to learn Esperanto

2055
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,320
for some of the reasons we talked about here.

2056
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,320
Having that universal language,

2057
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,320
I think everyone should learn it.

2058
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,320
Everyone should learn it.

2059
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,320
It'd be great.

2060
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,320
I dab on dubs.

2061
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,320
That's what I have to say to that.

2062
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
Ben, you didn't talk about how cool

2063
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,320
big words are with me.

2064
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,320
Oh, wait.

2065
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,320
I thought you were saying

2066
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,320
that you liked the rare words,

2067
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,320
because I prefer a rare word to a big word.

2068
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,320
Well, okay.

2069
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,320
I agree that rare words are better,

2070
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,320
but big words are also nice.

2071
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,320
I feel like most of the time,

2072
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,320
they're in tandem.

2073
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,320
Like, most of the time,

2074
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,320
the reason words are rare

2075
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,320
is because they're big

2076
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,320
and no one wants to say them.

2077
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,320
Yeah.

2078
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,320
You like flexing your vocabulary

2079
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,320
every now and then, you know?

2080
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,320
Exactly.

2081
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,320
Exactly.

2082
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,320
I love it.

2083
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,320
There's nothing wrong with flexing,

2084
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,320
but I think better than using

2085
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,320
a big word or a rare word.

2086
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,320
The best thing is when you need,

2087
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,320
like, an unusual word

2088
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,320
to express something nuanced,

2089
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,320
and then you fucking have it,

2090
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,320
and you pull it out at just the right second.

2091
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,320
Sure.

2092
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,320
And you express something so nuanced

2093
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
and so subtle

2094
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,320
that everyone is just blown away by it.

2095
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,320
Your vocabulary is fucking awesome right now.

2096
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,320
That is satisfying.

2097
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,320
Vocabulary is great.

2098
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
Back in, like, sixth grade,

2099
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
there was, like, a vocabulary word of the day,

2100
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,320
and, you know, you would teach you shit like

2101
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,320
fey or, you know, whatever the hell,

2102
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,320
basic bitch shit.

2103
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,320
I wish there was just, like,

2104
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,320
was mage toward it.

2105
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,320
Mage, there was an opening.

2106
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,320
You can just jump in.

2107
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,320
Just jump in there, mage.

2108
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,320
Go.

2109
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,320
What is it?

2110
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,320
I said earlier,

2111
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,320
what do you know what a sesbicodalian is?

2112
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,320
No.

2113
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,320
Equestria daily?

2114
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,320
No, sesbicodalian.

2115
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,320
Sesclid.

2116
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,320
I do not.

2117
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,320
Your vocabulary eclipses.

2118
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,320
Is that a flower?

2119
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,320
No.

2120
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,320
Dalian.

2121
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,320
Dalian.

2122
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,320
What is it?

2123
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,320
Well, look it up.

2124
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,320
I don't know how to spell that.

2125
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,320
I don't know how to spell that.

2126
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
Well, anyway, I'm saying that there should be

2127
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,320
vocabulary words of the day for everyone, forever.

2128
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,320
E-S-Q-U-I-P-E-D-A-L-A-N.

2129
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
It means gay.

2130
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,320
No.

2131
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,320
Mages calling us all gay.

2132
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,320
No.

2133
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,320
How rude.

2134
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,320
No.

2135
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,320
I called you weenies at the beginning.

2136
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,320
Sesquidalian.

2137
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,320
Spelled F-A-G-G-O-T.

2138
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,320
Look it up, everybody.

2139
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,320
Oh, no.

2140
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,320
You might enjoy that.

2141
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,320
No.

2142
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,320
Hey, Nick, can you spell A-G-O-T real quick?

2143
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,320
I'm doing an exam.

2144
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,320
I'm doing a spelling test right now,

2145
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,320
and I was wondering if you could try to figure it out.

2146
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,320
I don't want to be bullied.

2147
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,320
I won't do it.

2148
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,320
I won't suffer.

2149
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,320
Vocabulary is good, kids.

2150
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,320
Check it out someday.

2151
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,320
Words are cool.

2152
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,320
Words are cool.

2153
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
Hey, have I talked about this before?

2154
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
I think this is the time.

2155
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
There's a part in the book, The Plague,

2156
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
by Albert Camus,

2157
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,320
where the main character,

2158
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,320
he goes to like hang out with this guy that he knows.

2159
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,320
And the guy kind of,

2160
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,320
they kind of open up and become a little friendly.

2161
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,320
And the guy finally decides to share with him

2162
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,320
this thing that he's been working on,

2163
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,320
that he kind of doesn't usually talk about,

2164
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,320
but he's like, okay, I'll show you.

2165
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,320
I'll show you, because you're my buddy.

2166
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,320
And he brings it out.

2167
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
And what it is,

2168
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,320
is this thing that he's been working on for like years,

2169
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,320
is he has been polishing one sentence

2170
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,320
to be the ultimate sentence,

2171
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,320
like the most beautifully poetic sentence

2172
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
in the French language.

2173
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,320
And it's, um...

2174
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,320
Your mom gay.

2175
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,320
Le Danque means...

2176
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,320
Okay, well, he...

2177
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,320
Like, he revises it a couple of times,

2178
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,320
so I'm not sure if this is the original,

2179
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,320
but it doesn't matter.

2180
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,320
The sentence is, more or less,

2181
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,320
one fine morning in May,

2182
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,320
a slim young horsewoman might have been seen

2183
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,320
riding a glossy sorrel mare

2184
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,320
along the flower-strewn avenues of the Bouda Bouillon.

2185
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,320
Aw, that's pretty good.

2186
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,320
That sounds pretty good.

2187
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,320
I like his sorrel.

2188
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,320
Yeah, I liked it.

2189
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,320
So he did it.

2190
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,320
The sort of horse-boy-fucking-horse?

2191
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,320
What's with the horse-boys?

2192
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
And he says that one day, when it's perfect,

2193
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,320
he'll bring it to the publishing house,

2194
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,320
and he'll show it to them.

2195
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
And everyone on all the publishers

2196
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,320
will stand up and say, gentlemen, hats off.

2197
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,320
Hats off!

2198
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,320
It's like that family guy bit.

2199
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,320
It's like the best joke ever,

2200
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,320
which is, guess what?

2201
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,320
Chicken butt.

2202
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,320
That's it.

2203
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,320
Perfect joke.

2204
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,320
You know, a family guy is basically

2205
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,320
a modern-day Albert Camus, I think.

2206
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,320
Here's Languages Fatal Flaw.

2207
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,320
The word nautical does not mean radical.

2208
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,320
Nautical, by all rights, by its birthright,

2209
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,320
deserves to be a cinnamon for, like,

2210
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,320
sick or con-

2211
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,320
A cinnamon?

2212
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,320
A cinnamon, you say?

2213
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,320
How delectable.

2214
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,320
A cinnamon.

2215
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,320
It deserves to be like, dude,

2216
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,320
that's fucking nautical, bro.

2217
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,320
Yeah, dude, fucking it.

2218
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,320
Shouldn't it be the opposite of radical?

2219
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,320
Like, you can be radical, or you can be nautical?

2220
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
Nautical, yeah.

2221
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,320
No, no, I think...

2222
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,320
I mean, that's good, but I think it should be, like,

2223
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,320
reserved for when we invent underwater skateboarding.

2224
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,320
No, that's coming up real quick.

2225
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,320
Like, not surfboarding, underwater skateboarding.

2226
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
Like, with really heavy wheels.

2227
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,320
Yeah.

2228
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,320
Imagine grinding upon the Great Barrier Reef

2229
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,320
right into a shark.

2230
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
You had that really heavy shoes, too.

2231
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,320
The Great Barrier Reef is, like, gone now, right?

2232
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,320
That's completely dead.

2233
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,820
That's just because of all the grinding of the

2234
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:52,320
so many skateboarding people are doing.

2235
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,320
We need to stop.

2236
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,320
Sick.

2237
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,320
Grinding.

2238
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
Why don't we...

2239
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
I feel like we're Peter and Adher fan.

2240
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,320
What do you think?

2241
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,320
I think I'm ready to move on to the question.

2242
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,320
I think we need to close out...

2243
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,320
I actually...

2244
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,320
We need to close out with teaching everybody a new word, right?

2245
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,320
I just did.

2246
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,320
I'll speak with Dalian.

2247
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
You didn't tell us what it means, though.

2248
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,320
Well, it's just anything.

2249
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,320
It's homework.

2250
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,320
That's cute and all, Mage,

2251
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,720
but let's talk about a really important word

2252
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,320
that Nate taught us before the podcast began.

2253
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,320
It's Alexa.

2254
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,320
Alexaed on everything.

2255
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,320
Oh, yeah!

2256
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,320
Alexaed, yeah.

2257
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,320
Commanding a person like you would command

2258
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,320
an Amazon Alexa.

2259
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,320
Kid 1, mom, stop.

2260
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
And mom did stop talking.

2261
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
Kid 2, wow, mom.

2262
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
He just Alexaed you.

2263
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,320
Truly, language is evolving in a beautiful way.

2264
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,320
That's my point.

2265
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,320
Host about nuclear gaming.

2266
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
Nuclear gaming.

2267
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
You know that?

2268
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:41,320
Also, there was a gif of Ed Sheeran under that definition.

2269
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,320
I don't know why, but it was there.

2270
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,320
And we all have to live with that.

2271
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,320
Well, I feel Alexaed to getting to the goddamn Amazon.

2272
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,320
I was planning.

2273
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
I actually signed up onto this episode

2274
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,320
so I could talk about free speech

2275
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
and where people draw the line

2276
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
between free speech and where you can have a...

2277
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,320
And how it relates to words.

2278
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,320
So, we'll save that for another episode.

2279
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,320
Free speech, guys.

2280
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,320
That'll be a PCP episode at some point.

2281
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,320
That's a good idea.

2282
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,320
I like doing that.

2283
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,320
We should actually write that down.

2284
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,320
Yeah, add it to the list.

2285
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,320
I actually did it while Nate was going off

2286
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,320
his five-hour inane, whether or not words are perfect.

2287
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,320
Thank God something was done today.

2288
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,320
You're just mad, because I'm literally Starfleet.

2289
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,320
Look at me go.

2290
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,320
Okay, go on, go on.

2291
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,320
Guys, Magiskule.

2292
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,320
Yeah, what's that?

2293
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,320
That's the word I'm bringing to the table.

2294
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,320
Magiskarp.

2295
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
Try and figure it out.

2296
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,320
Magiskule.

2297
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,320
What do you think?

2298
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,320
Magiskule.

2299
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,320
It's like minuscule, only a magic version of being minuscule.

2300
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,320
Very close.

2301
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,320
It's the opposite of minuscule.

2302
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,320
Instead of saying capital letters, you could say magiskule.

2303
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:43,320
So, when are we going to get some magiskule reviews on Hippocrate?

2304
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,320
That's fucking sick.

2305
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,320
I should definitely do that now.

2306
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,320
That's a great idea.

2307
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,320
And what is something that's big, other than something that's small, that's magical?

2308
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,320
Rayman2, everyone.

2309
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,320
Rayman2 coming up next video.

2310
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
Magiskule review.

2311
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,320
Well gone, the Magiskule bus.

2312
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
Nobody cares about Rayman2 except for you.

2313
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,320
No!

2314
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,320
It's Rayman2!

2315
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,320
They're cheering!

2316
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,320
They're cheering!

2317
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,320
They're clamoring for Hippo outside of my window.

2318
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,320
There's just a crowdful piece of Mandigrad.

2319
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:17,320
I mean, Rayman2.

2320
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,320
We're done.

2321
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,320
We've had a lot of fun here today, but it's time to get serious.

2322
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,320
Yeah, it's time to close.

2323
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,320
Time to nut up or shut up.

2324
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:31,320
Before we get to questions, me and you, Nate, have followed that we need to settle.

2325
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,320
That's right, everybody.

2326
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:37,320
If you listened to last week's episode, Munchie and I made a sacred pact where we both agreed

2327
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:42,320
that we would be healthy boys in different ways and made some health resolutions.

2328
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
So let's lay our cards on the table.

2329
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,320
Munchie, what was your thing and how to go?

2330
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,320
My resolution was that I would not drink a single carbonated drink

2331
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
because I've been drinking too much energy drinks.

2332
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,320
And I'm happy to announce that I have not drinking a single carbonated drink since that recording

2333
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,320
until now.

2334
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,320
Oh!

2335
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,320
Look at Munchie go!

2336
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,320
What a shame.

2337
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,320
He's doing so well.

2338
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,320
Well, you know what? There's nothing wrong with taking a cheat day, you know?

2339
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,320
Or a cheat meal.

2340
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
Wait, Munchie, how's it taste?

2341
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,320
It feels so fucking good!

2342
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,320
No, he's a lost cause.

2343
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,320
So to check in, congratulations Munchie.

2344
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
You've earned it. You've earned that.

2345
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,320
So my thing was I swore off sugar.

2346
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,320
And it's kind of hard to avoid sugar just forever.

2347
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:34,320
So what I defined that as was I defined it like anything with additional sugar added to it.

2348
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,320
Gee, I don't know if I agree with that definition of sugar.

2349
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:42,320
I think we're going to have to have some psychically connected language here

2350
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,320
to get to consensus on what sugar means.

2351
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,320
Well, I mean, there is no consensus. I make the rules and this is what they wear.

2352
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:53,320
To me, sugar is sexist language and I should say it.

2353
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:58,320
So here's how it went. It went great until Thursday.

2354
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,320
And here's what happened. Here's what happened.

2355
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:06,320
I was at the grocery store. I was buying, you know, nutritious food with no sugar.

2356
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:11,320
And I simply walked by. My mind was absent. My balls were empty.

2357
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,320
And I walk by a free display giving away little donut pieces.

2358
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,320
Oh, no!

2359
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,320
Little cookie pieces. And I just don't even think.

2360
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:25,320
I just say, oh, cool, free. And I take a piece and I eat it.

2361
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,320
That capitalism just overwhelmed everything.

2362
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,320
And then I take a cookie. There was these little cranberry cookies and I just eat that.

2363
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,320
I continue on my way. Don't even think of it.

2364
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,320
And then I realized like a fucking shock from God.

2365
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,320
I realized what I have done.

2366
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,320
I've done this before. It was the worst.

2367
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,320
I almost did this too. It's funny that like you guys did like a diet thing

2368
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,320
or like a good boy thing because I've been doing a good boy thing for the last week as well.

2369
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,320
I've restarted doing intermittent fasting because I enjoy doing it a lot. Yes.

2370
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,320
Aren't you skinny enough, dude?

2371
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,320
No, no. I'm like 220 pounds, dude. It's disgusting.

2372
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,320
220 pounds? Okay.

2373
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,320
You're also like six foot two.

2374
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,320
Yeah, that's true. I forgot.

2375
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
The scale doesn't care how tall you are.

2376
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:15,320
So you just you only eat in an eight hour window and it's fast for 16 hours

2377
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,320
and it's fucking great.

2378
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,320
I did it for a week and I almost did that because I've been going to the coffee shop

2379
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,320
and they had like little free samples.

2380
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,320
Have you been weighing yourself? Have you been weighing yourself?

2381
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,320
Do you have progress?

2382
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,320
My scale is broken, but I feel significantly better and that's enough for me.

2383
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,320
That's good.

2384
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,320
Okay, so intermittent fasting sounds really great, but okay,

2385
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,320
because like I'm never hungry when I wake up in the morning.

2386
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,320
Like I don't want to eat until later in the day.

2387
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,320
Yeah.

2388
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,320
But isn't that like what they say not to do?

2389
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,320
Don't they say to like space your calories out over the day or something?

2390
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:50,320
Well, usually they also suggest to not eat like two or three hours

2391
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,320
before going to bed or something like that.

2392
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,320
That is commonly suggested.

2393
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,320
That's true.

2394
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,320
The science behind quote unquote the science behind this.

2395
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,320
Yeah, that's all bullshit.

2396
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,320
But it's like you have there's like a your when you start,

2397
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,320
you're like metabolic, whatever, like when you start digesting things,

2398
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,320
like it goes for like, I think like the 10 to 12 hours and then it stops

2399
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,320
and anything you eat after that like doesn't get properly metabolized or something.

2400
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,320
So like you're, you're designed, I guess designed not to do that.

2401
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,320
So I'm just eating it at eight hour window to make sure that that doesn't happen.

2402
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,320
I guess I don't know.

2403
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,320
I've had, I guess that makes sense.

2404
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,320
I've done it before.

2405
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,320
I couldn't hunt animals all the time.

2406
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,320
And I lost the fucking time to wait just doing it.

2407
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,320
So I'm doing it again because it worked for me.

2408
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:34,320
That was last week's topic that you guys were like doing good boy thing.

2409
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,320
I wasn't on last week.

2410
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,320
So I was drugs.

2411
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,320
Okay.

2412
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,320
Yeah.

2413
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,320
I guess that would be that would be good topic.

2414
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,320
We had to, we had to detox after that podcast.

2415
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,320
Yeah.

2416
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,320
Yeah.

2417
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,320
That's right.

2418
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,320
That's a good part of the podcast because this week has been very fun for me in terms of

2419
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,320
eating food.

2420
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,320
And today I've been eating nothing but cake.

2421
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,320
So because it's my cake day.

2422
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,320
Yes.

2423
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,320
It is.

2424
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,320
By the way, just continuing going forward.

2425
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,320
I've made a resolution.

2426
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,320
I'm just, I'm giving up additional sugar just forever.

2427
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,320
I'm just, I mean, you know, one day I'll probably go back on that.

2428
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,320
But just for the future, I'm not putting sugar in anything.

2429
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,320
I'm not eating cake.

2430
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,320
I'm not eating anything that has sugar added to it.

2431
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:15,320
I'm like the biggest thing I might do is I might indulge in a glass of fruit.

2432
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Juice.

2433
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,320
I may do that because that's not, that's not like additional sugar.

2434
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,320
It's just the fruit.

2435
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
But I'm going to try to stay away from it.

2436
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,320
Juice is bad for your teeth.

2437
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,320
Fair point.

2438
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,320
As is coffee, which I have been drinking and I want to be away from it.

2439
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,320
But anyway, just brush your teeth an hour after you consume something sugary.

2440
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,320
And by the way, since I'm doing this anyway, I'll check in everybody.

2441
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,320
I'll let you know how the sugar thing's going.

2442
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
If I fail, I'll let you know.

2443
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,320
I'll let you know.

2444
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:43,320
I wouldn't throw my hand in the ring, but honestly my life is just worse not drinking

2445
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,320
carbonated drinks.

2446
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,320
So I'm not going to do it.

2447
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,320
I'm like my hero Thanos.

2448
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:51,320
I'm willing to take personal sacrifices to achieve the greater good.

2449
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,320
As soon as I watch Infinity War, I'm like, this is Nate's OC.

2450
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,320
It's Nate.

2451
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,320
It's not even.

2452
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,320
Yeah.

2453
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:00,320
Like the whole, like having to the movie, I was just like, I was like, Thanos is war.

2454
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
All right.

2455
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,320
That was just my headmate.

2456
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,320
He's my headmate.

2457
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,320
No, no more Infinity War.

2458
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,320
No more.

2459
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,320
Wait, he's right.

2460
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,320
I'm good too.

2461
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,320
I want to say I'm a good boy.

2462
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,320
I started tracking my calories again.

2463
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,320
Yeah.

2464
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,320
Fantastic.

2465
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,320
Fantastic.

2466
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,320
I can make it, but I'm back.

2467
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,320
Great.

2468
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,320
Then what is the fear to crack cocaine?

2469
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,320
Poor.

2470
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,320
Oh yeah?

2471
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,720
Are you working out, Ben?

2472
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,720
Are you lifting?

2473
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:28,820
I did a bit ago start again, and then I stopped again, but I mean to start again, and I feel

2474
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:32,640
like I've still got a little bit of that momentum, but yeah.

2475
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,320
So I did for a second, but I didn't keep up with it.

2476
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:38,560
Why does working out suck so bad?

2477
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,560
It feels good to actually do it.

2478
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,560
Actually, you know what?

2479
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,560
I'll do that today.

2480
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Yeah.

2481
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Fantastic.

2482
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,560
Fantastic.

2483
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,560
Thank you.

2484
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,720
I've been personally, I've been adding running to my lifts, to my exercise feels great, but

2485
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,720
whatever.

2486
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,720
Let's move on.

2487
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
Ben, what, hold on.

2488
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,720
What is the pulling out your beard hair about?

2489
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,760
Like I've never had that before in my life.

2490
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,760
What's why?

2491
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,760
Oh God, do we have to talk about this embarrassing?

2492
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,760
If you don't want to.

2493
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,640
Yeah, I fucking, yeah, I have like a nervous, I have like a nervous tick that I fucking pull

2494
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,640
my hair out.

2495
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,640
I have a worse nervous tick, Ben.

2496
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,640
Yeah, I saw this.

2497
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,640
Don't want to make me feel better.

2498
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:13,760
My nervous tick is I bite the shit out of my lips until they bleed.

2499
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,520
My nervous tick is I scratch my face off.

2500
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:20,160
My nervous tick is that there's a tick who lives on my head who's just very anxious about

2501
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,160
life.

2502
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,160
That explains a lot about life.

2503
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,560
I have a very wild nervous tick, which is that I grind my index finger.

2504
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,560
I do that too, but it's funny.

2505
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,560
Yeah.

2506
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,560
Wait, wait, wait.

2507
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,560
Let Davoo say, let Davoo say something.

2508
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:36,040
I grind my index finger into my thumb on my right hand, and if you do it for only like

2509
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,280
a minute, it creates a little groove.

2510
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:43,560
So even though I was only nervous for a minute, I now have like a bubble wrap popping tick

2511
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,520
to keep grinding into it and making it worse.

2512
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,520
Right?

2513
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,520
Hippo.

2514
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,520
Hippo.

2515
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:56,640
Like the hair does grow back, but like if it gets bad and it does a lot lately, I will

2516
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:00,920
pick like a small patch or even sometimes like a really big patch.

2517
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,640
It has happened before that I have picked off like a large portion of my face has been

2518
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:09,520
like plucked free of beard hair due to my fucking brain problems.

2519
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,040
Take your hands busy, Ben.

2520
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,040
Well, easier said than done.

2521
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,040
Yeah.

2522
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,040
Wrap it, wrap it.

2523
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,040
I know.

2524
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,040
I know.

2525
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,040
But like just get into the habits.

2526
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,360
Your hands can't stand against your face if they're wrapped around your cock.

2527
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,920
It does grow back, but if I do it, if I do it too much of it too fast, it will leave

2528
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,520
like a bear patch.

2529
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,440
And then I'm like, well, I can't fucking walk around like this and then I have to shave

2530
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,440
my beard because.

2531
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,440
Ben, you don't go anywhere.

2532
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,080
What does it matter?

2533
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,640
Well, it just makes me sad all along.

2534
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,720
You should wear a coat for your beard.

2535
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:43,920
Tom, I bite the inside of my mouth all the time and I'm constantly tasting blood based

2536
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,920
on it.

2537
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:45,920
Oh God.

2538
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,920
That would drive me crazy.

2539
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:47,920
That's rough.

2540
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:48,920
I bite my nails.

2541
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:49,920
I bite my nails.

2542
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,920
It's pretty bad.

2543
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,920
Sometimes it gets bad.

2544
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,920
No.

2545
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,920
Shall we get to the question?

2546
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:54,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2547
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,920
Let's.

2548
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,920
Hey.

2549
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:57,920
Don't bite your nails.

2550
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,920
It's very bad for you.

2551
01:28:58,920 --> 01:28:59,920
You couldn't be more right.

2552
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:00,920
You couldn't be more right.

2553
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:01,920
I wish I stopped.

2554
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,960
I was.

2555
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,640
Yeah, but I'm not Michael Jackson of two hands.

2556
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,640
That's it.

2557
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,640
That's my excuse.

2558
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,640
Listen, everybody.

2559
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,200
Hashtag ask PCP Twitter at TP Crastinators.

2560
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,400
Here's some also in the patron discord, $1 pledge to our fucking patron here in there

2561
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,680
and we'll read more questions.

2562
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,520
Here's the pity question and we don't need to spend a lot of time with this because I've

2563
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,880
looking there are like no good questions, but here's the here's the one that's like

2564
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,880
sort of good.

2565
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,120
You're all going to hate me, but I'm a read anyway at chemotherapy just asks if giving

2566
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:34,120
up a year of your life advanced human progress by 50 years.

2567
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,480
How many years are you willing to give up to those advantage you're waiting for?

2568
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,480
And what are they?

2569
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,240
Well, zero unless I thought that like within a window that I could buy with that time,

2570
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,800
we would hit the singularity.

2571
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,800
That's the one.

2572
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,800
That's the thing.

2573
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,800
Yeah.

2574
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,480
My question is, do we advance instantaneously like would I be living in a society 50 years

2575
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:55,080
more advanced by giving up your my life or would it just happen somewhere down the road?

2576
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,960
Because if I don't get to experience it, everyone can get fucked.

2577
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,960
If I can give up a decade and get a robot body instantly, therefore living forever sounds

2578
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,960
like a fair trade.

2579
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:04,960
Yeah.

2580
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,960
I mean, I do that.

2581
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,960
Yeah.

2582
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,560
I guess the question is, do we think we're going to hit the singularity within like, I

2583
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,720
don't know, let's say we all have like 50 years left.

2584
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,760
So like within 2500 years, will we hit the singularity?

2585
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:22,160
I would give up one year if the advancement of humans by 50 years destroys hypothetical

2586
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,160
questions.

2587
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,160
Come on.

2588
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,920
You know, even even if I don't like him so much, even Digi.

2589
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,920
You and Digi are, I have an ethical problem with people that don't like hypothetical questions.

2590
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,920
I don't like hypothetical questions.

2591
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:36,920
These are so cratic exercises.

2592
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:40,720
Disliking of hypothetical questions is just evidence of a small mind.

2593
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:45,600
The thing about this particular one is it's just like, here's some numbers, which number

2594
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,600
like?

2595
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,600
It isn't.

2596
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,600
It makes you fucking think.

2597
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,440
It makes you fucking question your values.

2598
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,440
I'm not thinking.

2599
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:56,320
I do like certain types of hypothetical questions like the ones that like give you really bad

2600
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,440
options and then like makes you mentally suffer for them.

2601
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,440
I hate those.

2602
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,440
Yeah.

2603
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,440
No.

2604
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,840
I like the ones that make you think like this one is fine, but the ones is like, oh,

2605
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,880
would you kill one baby or would you kill like three babies?

2606
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,880
I'd definitely kill three.

2607
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,880
Unless we have the best.

2608
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,880
Here's a hypothesis.

2609
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,880
I like that one.

2610
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,880
That's funny.

2611
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,880
Like what does it mean for it to progress by 50 years?

2612
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,880
This isn't vague at all.

2613
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,880
God damn.

2614
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,920
Yeah, this isn't very vague.

2615
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,920
Here's a hypothetical.

2616
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,040
What if like the Simpsons were like in Undertale though?

2617
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:32,440
Well, Nate, well, Nate does have yellow skin, so perhaps that's not as far fetched

2618
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,440
as you think.

2619
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,440
Oh my God.

2620
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,440
We're in Undertale Homer.

2621
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,440
We got to get out of here.

2622
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:44,800
Back to the original hypothetical question, like if let's say I give up a year, right?

2623
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,360
And like I see the advancement happening like immediately.

2624
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,640
And would I still have the option to give up one more year after I see what's happened

2625
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,280
within those 50 years?

2626
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,480
That is a good question.

2627
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,480
I don't fucking know.

2628
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,600
That actually does make a big difference.

2629
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,720
Yeah, because let's say if I could see what's happening.

2630
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,720
This is the reason.

2631
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,720
This is the reason why I don't like hypothetical questions, at least of this kind.

2632
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:14,040
It's that sometimes the question, like if you're not with the person who made the question,

2633
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:18,520
you can't clarify and then you are just, the discussion is about, I wonder what this question

2634
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,520
actually means.

2635
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,520
Yeah, I mean, sure.

2636
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,440
I think I may have just straight up heard the question wrong.

2637
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,040
What exactly was the question?

2638
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:29,960
It's giving up a year of your life, advanced human progress by 50 years, how many years

2639
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,960
would you give up?

2640
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,960
Yeah, that's too vague.

2641
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,360
I insist that that is way too vague.

2642
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:39,360
You guys, you guys, let's get on to the other questions.

2643
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,360
Other questions.

2644
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,160
This is a significantly less boring than whatever.

2645
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,440
It's fun to think about though.

2646
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,440
I agree.

2647
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,440
I agree.

2648
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,240
So anybody fucking looking at the goddamn question bar?

2649
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,240
I'm looking at it.

2650
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,240
Okay.

2651
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,240
What do you got for us?

2652
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,240
What do you got for us?

2653
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,240
Are we looking at the lounge?

2654
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,240
I'm looking at it.

2655
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,240
I don't fucking have anything.

2656
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,240
Are you joking me?

2657
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,240
It's all shit.

2658
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,240
There's a question.

2659
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Is it made just for you today?

2660
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,240
Or did you just really like cake?

2661
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,240
Both.

2662
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,240
Yeah.

2663
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,240
That's good.

2664
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,240
That's good.

2665
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:14,240
I'll just substitute the word birthday for cake day because it's more fun that way.

2666
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,240
Okay.

2667
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,920
I'm just like looking for questions.

2668
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,040
Someone asked me, Kajaro Bitterthorn said, if you suddenly acquired a shit ton of money,

2669
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,240
what would be the one ridiculously indulgent thing you'd want to do?

2670
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,240
I would want a house.

2671
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,240
I need a place to live.

2672
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Indulgent.

2673
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,240
What the fuck dude?

2674
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Indulgent.

2675
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,800
Be happy with your living cube as dispensed by the state.

2676
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,800
Your 3x3 foot.

2677
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,200
God, I wish I could have a 3x3 living cube given me by the state.

2678
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,200
That's all I need.

2679
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,200
As a millennial.

2680
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,200
I wouldn't even complain.

2681
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,200
Yeah.

2682
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,200
Same.

2683
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,200
As a millennial, you don't get a house, you get avocado toast instead.

2684
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,200
Oh, yeah.

2685
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,200
Much like how...

2686
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,120
You get Burger King foot lettuce and nothing else.

2687
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:56,640
Much like how Gen Z's, me, are post job.

2688
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,640
Millennials are post house.

2689
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,640
They do not.

2690
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,640
They don't have need for housing.

2691
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,640
I don't even want one.

2692
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,640
Okay.

2693
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,640
I would totally live in a cube.

2694
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,640
You know what?

2695
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,640
I don't see any good questions.

2696
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,280
So it's time to bring back the hashtag PCP bullying segment.

2697
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,160
So here we go with Kajaro Bitterthorn asked this terrible question.

2698
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:16,360
If all the members of the PCP had a future diary style battle royale, who would be the

2699
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,120
last one standing and who would...

2700
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,120
What would your wish be?

2701
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,600
I know a person who wouldn't be standing as fucking you because we would all get up on

2702
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,920
you and fucking kill you.

2703
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,920
You piece of shit.

2704
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:25,920
God!

2705
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:26,920
Agreed.

2706
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,760
I'll give it like...

2707
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,080
I don't know who would win, but I know who would lose.

2708
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,760
The future diary was like because the world was ending, they needed a new God.

2709
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,440
So like if none of us did anything, the world would just end and I...

2710
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,560
Let it burn.

2711
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,560
Let it burn.

2712
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,120
Who wants to live in a world with questions like these?

2713
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,680
If Nate Besman found a journal that when he wrote down the name of any person on earth,

2714
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,400
they died instantly, what would he do with it?

2715
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,880
That has to be a joke.

2716
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:54,880
That has to be intentionally bad.

2717
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,160
I've got to write a manga about that concept.

2718
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,880
There's no way that fucking...

2719
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,280
There's no way that that guy who got that fucking book could make nearly as much of

2720
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,160
a clusterfuck as the utilitarianist machinations of Best Guy Ever.

2721
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,160
Yeah.

2722
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,400
You ain't wrong.

2723
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,720
Hey, here's a question that's not inherently shit, kind of.

2724
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:19,440
Night Shift Clint asks, is all porn cuckoo-y?

2725
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:24,520
Now hang on, you aren't pleasuring yourself to something slash someone you want to fuck

2726
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,240
or get fucked by being fucked or getting fucked by something else.

2727
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,240
Yeah.

2728
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,240
What do you think?

2729
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,240
That assumes things about the porn that you want.

2730
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,240
I think yes.

2731
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,240
Oh, well...

2732
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:36,080
No, I mean you're just watching other people fucking and it's not you, so you know.

2733
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,840
There's porn that is not to people.

2734
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,600
Oh, well, I mean that's true.

2735
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,600
That is true.

2736
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,960
Well, still, you're watching something desirable and not participating in it yourself.

2737
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:45,960
True.

2738
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:46,960
But you know what?

2739
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:47,960
It's really...

2740
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,400
If you're a real cuck in real life, which again, there is no act...

2741
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,400
It's fine if you do that.

2742
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,400
Can I jump off this for a second?

2743
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,400
But you enjoy not being involved.

2744
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,400
Do you?

2745
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,520
I would prefer to be involved in porn, physically.

2746
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,640
This is something I thought about.

2747
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:05,000
Do you think that cuckolding became a thing because everyone just watches porn so much

2748
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
now?

2749
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Hmm.

2750
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I've always thought...

2751
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
The rise of cuckolding is a result of people watching porn.

2752
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
This is actually like really surprising to me.

2753
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Lots of thinking emojis right now.

2754
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I can't believe this.

2755
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,760
That someone just casually dropped like an existential like total actual accuracy bomb

2756
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,760
like that.

2757
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,760
But I think I'm going to go with yeah.

2758
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:21,760
Like, because...

2759
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,760
Well, I don't know.

2760
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,720
Because now I'm thinking about it, because I'm not into cucking, but I'm thinking...

2761
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,280
I feel like I can possibly empathize with it a lot better now, because it's like the

2762
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,520
idea is if you are not part of the, you know, you're just watching it, you're just...

2763
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,800
You're not really there.

2764
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,640
You have no accountability, no responsibility, nothing you can do wrong.

2765
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:44,000
You can just project yourself on completely guilt-free, and that's kind of like why porn

2766
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,720
is a lot easier than like actual sex, you know?

2767
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:47,720
You don't have to like worry about anything.

2768
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,720
I feel like...

2769
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:49,720
I'm not cuckolding.

2770
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,720
Just makes me sad.

2771
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,720
Like down to my core, I hate it.

2772
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,720
I mean, sure.

2773
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:55,720
I feel like the appeal would be slightly different.

2774
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:00,560
Like if it was like a live action, and then the girl says, haha, you're not doing it.

2775
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,520
And then the person watching the screen is like, damn.

2776
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,960
Yeah, that's real cuckoldry.

2777
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,960
That's real cuckoldry.

2778
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,120
Even if you're like...

2779
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,120
If it's playing into that aspect.

2780
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:11,280
If it's a picture, then you couldn't possibly be there, because they don't exist.

2781
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,280
Yeah.

2782
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,280
It's slightly different.

2783
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,920
You know, I don't think they're like one and the same.

2784
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,520
There might be a thread of connection, possibly, but I mean, I don't think they're anything.

2785
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,680
You know, I have felt this way.

2786
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:26,440
I have gone down this rabbit hole before and been like, okay, I'm watching this thing that

2787
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,680
I like, but it's not me.

2788
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,120
And I've gotten a little annoyed about it, like, damn it, why am I enjoying this?

2789
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,040
Like this is just, this is what they want from me.

2790
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,040
Like they tricked me.

2791
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,040
Oh, yeah.

2792
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,040
Like the porn.

2793
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,040
Damn it.

2794
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,040
Yeah.

2795
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,040
They've won.

2796
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:47,200
Like they went and did something good, something cool, and I am over here, like what, appreciating

2797
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200
them for that?

2798
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,200
Fuck that.

2799
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,160
I mean, you know, I mean, there's like, for example, you know, like video games are like

2800
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:56,040
achievement simulators that you're not actually like, so like in the same way, you're kind

2801
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,080
of like a cuck to like success of other people in a way, though I guess you are like playing

2802
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,320
the game, but it's a little different, I guess.

2803
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,560
You right now, viewer, are a cuck because you are not debating with the legendary best

2804
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,560
guy ever.

2805
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,960
You are leaving by carestakingly with the other podcast members.

2806
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,320
You are a cuck right now.

2807
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,320
Kill yourself.

2808
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:17,560
All the rest of us are such relatable characters and Nate is just such a, such a, such a hateable

2809
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,560
villain.

2810
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,440
So he's a juggernaut of industry.

2811
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,600
Here's a question by my cool man from the Patreon lounge.

2812
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,840
When is the right age to have children?

2813
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,920
And I also want to open this up to when's the right age to get married because this

2814
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:36,000
is a thing that's, that's kind of a lot with the PCP as we all know.

2815
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Well, okay.

2816
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I think.

2817
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Yeah, go ahead.

2818
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Go ahead.

2819
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Go ahead.

2820
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I think the right age to have children is whenever you're ready.

2821
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,160
But yeah, I think having it too young will, like if you have it in your early twenties

2822
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:55,480
or mid twenties, that's a lot of people did do that, but they, they, I mean, I can't assume

2823
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:59,880
how they feel about it, but I, I don't think they would have, like some people may not

2824
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:00,880
have liked it.

2825
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,960
I guess it depends on what you want out of it and how you would want it in the first

2826
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:05,960
one.

2827
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:06,960
That's a yes to finish education just, just in case.

2828
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:11,400
How it is when you're figuring out all the basic things in your life and you are no longer

2829
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,280
feeling challenged, then do it.

2830
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,240
Don't have kids because your parents want grandkids.

2831
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,240
Oh yeah.

2832
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,240
Fuck people.

2833
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,240
Sure.

2834
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,000
That's definitely, you gotta be financially stable.

2835
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Don't let the wanton of a baby be the thing that makes you have the baby.

2836
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,560
Make it that you've, you've basically, you can go through your life day and be like, wow,

2837
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,440
I didn't like freak out or emotionally melt down over anything and I have enough money

2838
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,440
to be stable.

2839
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,440
Wow.

2840
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,440
It's a little bit boring.

2841
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,520
Wait for when you're a little bit bored, not out of like depression boredom, but like

2842
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,720
out of complacency boredom.

2843
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:41,720
You know.

2844
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:42,720
Then have kids.

2845
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,960
Then you'll actually love your children for like genuinely and not like the sort of passive

2846
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,520
aggressive love that most parents give.

2847
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,840
I'm like, oh man, it sure is great taking care of you and not having a life.

2848
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,720
And like, because the way I sort of see having a child is like your life ends there and like

2849
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,640
now you're solely dedicated to making that child be successful.

2850
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:07,560
There's been a rise of the argument that like immoral, it is literally immoral to have kids

2851
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,760
and like, I understand the argument there.

2852
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,760
It's immoral to have kids.

2853
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,920
It's like bringing someone into the world against, you know, they can't consent to being

2854
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:15,920
bored.

2855
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:16,920
I mean, that's true.

2856
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,440
And there will be some suffering in life.

2857
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:24,240
And so like, I could see why people make that argument, but like, if you're trying to give

2858
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:28,280
your kid the best chance possible, then I personally would argue that that's a pretty

2859
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,280
pessimistic view.

2860
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,280
I feel like there's good to be had.

2861
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,280
I feel like there's sort of pessimistic, but it doesn't make it wrong.

2862
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:33,280
Well, it's pessimistic, but it doesn't make it wrong.

2863
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,280
Having children is immoral.

2864
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,280
No, I'm not saying it's wrong.

2865
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,800
Is kind of strange.

2866
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Well, hang on, Ben.

2867
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,800
Are you arguing?

2868
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,120
What do you think about that argument?

2869
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:46,120
Well, that's, I mean, I don't.

2870
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,120
It's tough.

2871
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,120
I know it's a complicated thing.

2872
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:52,160
Well, I think, I don't think it's immoral.

2873
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:57,600
I don't think it's immoral to create a life, no.

2874
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,240
I get, I could see why someone would think that if someone thinks that life is suffering

2875
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:05,800
and terrible and not worth living, then I could see why you'd be like, well, why would

2876
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,880
I want to force that on someone?

2877
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:08,880
Like, I get it.

2878
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:09,880
I think it's immoral.

2879
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,240
I think if you're not able to properly take care of the child, I think if you're, that's

2880
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,240
definitely true.

2881
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,920
Even if you are able to properly take care of them, that doesn't mean they're going to

2882
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,920
have a good time.

2883
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:19,920
No, it doesn't.

2884
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,320
But at that point, it becomes nebulous.

2885
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,440
But I think it's absolutely wrong to have a child when you're not properly able to take

2886
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,440
care of them.

2887
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,640
This whole issue, I remember hearing this, like, way back, I've heard this on the internet

2888
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,640
forever.

2889
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,640
Like, oh man, a life is suffering.

2890
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,640
Is it right to bring kids?

2891
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:38,880
You know, like, if there was like a reverse limbo where you hang out before you have life,

2892
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,360
like all it would take is some propaganda.

2893
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:44,000
Like Pixar could have like a five minute little short animation before one of their movies,

2894
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
which is this, right?

2895
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,680
It's just like these little identity list souls hanging out in like pre-limbo, right?

2896
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,320
And like they're all like really excited to like get a chance for life and they get, they're

2897
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,320
given warnings.

2898
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,320
It could be painful.

2899
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,320
It could be hard.

2900
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:01,600
But like if you're given the chance, you might be able to like live and experience things,

2901
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,600
right?

2902
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,680
And they'd be all like, everybody would be fucking excited to try it out.

2903
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:10,080
So no, I'm going to say it's immoral to have kids if you're not ready, if you're being ignorant

2904
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,080
about it.

2905
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,080
But that's not actually how things work though.

2906
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,200
I just consider ignorance to be a bad thing in general.

2907
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,200
That's a very underrated sin.

2908
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,640
Well, about the whole, back to the question originally, I do feel very strongly that there

2909
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:29,840
is no right age to have kids or get married or do anything right.

2910
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,760
Well, there is a certain age past which you should probably not be having kids if you're

2911
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,760
a woman due to...

2912
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,760
That is technically true.

2913
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,760
Okay.

2914
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:39,760
Yeah.

2915
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,760
Well, I mean...

2916
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,840
Do you mean like you shouldn't or like you couldn't?

2917
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:48,520
Well, it becomes a lot more complicated the older you get, like there might be birth complications

2918
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,640
in the child you birth might not need.

2919
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,640
That's true.

2920
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,640
That's always a risk.

2921
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,640
Yeah.

2922
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,640
To a certain extent.

2923
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,640
No, no, no.

2924
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:56,640
I'm not saying you shouldn't.

2925
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:01,480
It's just like you might want to start thinking about those things.

2926
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:06,600
Like Maja's saying, like just as it makes sense to establish yourself financially before you

2927
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,720
have kids, it also, in the same vein, like it is a biological fact and the current

2928
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:15,840
world that like the older woman is, you know, like when a woman's like 65, like the likelihood

2929
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,400
of their kid, I think specifically was having Down syndrome.

2930
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,880
The percentage goes up a lot.

2931
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,920
The menopause starts around 40 years old, I think.

2932
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,920
Okay.

2933
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,280
Let's say 40 or whatever it is.

2934
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,240
So it's just that you're like, I'm just saying it's, I'm not saying it's immoral or anything.

2935
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:33,680
It's just like you are not inherently necessarily giving your kid the most optimum chance in

2936
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,680
the world.

2937
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
That's all.

2938
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,680
You know?

2939
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:37,680
Well, we've all got to do the best with what we're given.

2940
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,680
Yeah.

2941
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,680
I agree.

2942
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:40,800
Just saying.

2943
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,800
Yeah.

2944
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:42,800
Yeah.

2945
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,800
It's just something to consider about your own life and stuff.

2946
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,800
It's a fair point.

2947
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:45,800
It's a fair point.

2948
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,800
I definitely agree with you, Ben.

2949
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:52,280
There is no real like right age to do anything, but I think there are certain like ages you

2950
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:58,040
can genuinely like say where someone will be like maturity or like, you know, financially

2951
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,040
or like, you know, well off wise.

2952
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:01,040
Yeah.

2953
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,040
You want to be stable.

2954
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:06,520
I would say like the golden age for both those are probably like 35 for me.

2955
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,520
That's probably a nice like late number.

2956
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,360
Yeah.

2957
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,360
That's pretty late.

2958
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,360
I mean, for, I don't know.

2959
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,360
Maybe not for millennials.

2960
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,360
I mean, maybe not for millennials.

2961
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,360
Literally 35 when they had us.

2962
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,360
I mean, the average age is getting later.

2963
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,360
Yeah.

2964
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,360
I think.

2965
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,360
Yeah.

2966
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,280
Oh, well, actually, I mean, just unfortunately for men, that's perfectly fine.

2967
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,200
For women, it actually does have some ramifications.

2968
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,200
Yeah.

2969
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,700
My parents were both 34 actually.

2970
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,200
I think our parents were in there like mid-30s.

2971
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:31,200
Yeah.

2972
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:32,200
They were right around there.

2973
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,200
They were right around there.

2974
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,200
Yeah.

2975
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,200
My mom was fucking 40, baby.

2976
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:38,200
That's why you got that fetal alcohol syndrome.

2977
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,200
Yeah.

2978
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,880
Give it up for Down syndrome, everybody.

2979
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:48,080
Because as you get older, your blood just turns to alcohol.

2980
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,080
You just ferment.

2981
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,080
Yes.

2982
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:57,080
I'll just say that I agree that like getting married and having kids is basically fine.

2983
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:01,040
You know, biologically speaking, it makes sense to do it fairly early for a woman and

2984
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,080
then financially you want to be stable.

2985
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,640
That's really all I have to say.

2986
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:09,680
But I would also just say that as opposed to age to do it, I personally just think I

2987
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:14,200
would really want to vet the person I'm marrying before I commit my whole fucking life to

2988
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,200
them.

2989
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,200
That's true.

2990
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,200
I'd give them a couple years, frankly.

2991
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,200
That's me.

2992
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,200
Yeah.

2993
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:20,200
That's me.

2994
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,200
Yeah.

2995
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,200
I don't think anyone would disagree.

2996
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,200
A couple years.

2997
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,720
No, I think you should probably jump into these things willy-nilly.

2998
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,720
Yeah.

2999
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,720
Yeah.

3000
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:32,200
In my humble opinion, feel free to disagree.

3001
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,320
All right.

3002
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,320
Well, fuck it.

3003
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,320
Let's move on.

3004
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,400
Oh, there was one other question here that I wanted to reach and this goes beyond just

3005
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,400
the specifics here.

3006
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:47,440
It's just StanOnWheels asks, I'm sure in reference to the Furry podcast, is ActionGiraffe a fursona?

3007
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,240
And this pretends to all animal boys.

3008
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,240
Obviously.

3009
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,240
No, he's not.

3010
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,240
He's a separate entity.

3011
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Obviously.

3012
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,240
Yeah.

3013
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,240
ActionGiraffe is a completely separate entity.

3014
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:59,760
He is a real-life globetrotting superstar who is a headmate of mine occasionally, but

3015
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,480
he just travels rift to rift and, you know, he's got nothing to do with it.

3016
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,400
Oh, he's occasionally, but not exclusively, a headmate.

3017
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,120
Like, yeah, he has his own, he's got the outside.

3018
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:13,240
He's incidentally also your headmate, but that's just kind of a coincidence.

3019
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,720
He owns some time shares in your head.

3020
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,000
He's got Ramona flowers.

3021
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
The Ramona flowers like Skateboards.

3022
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Oh, okay.

3023
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Skateboards in a sick way.

3024
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,520
When he doesn't have any other place to crash you, especially Skateboards.

3025
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,520
Boy, that's right.

3026
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,040
He owns a time share in Nate's head.

3027
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,560
Boy, that's a new twist on the character.

3028
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,360
When are we gonna get new fucking lore?

3029
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:31,360
It's been like years.

3030
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,360
What the fuck?

3031
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,760
Why don't you watch ActionGiraffe is the best shit?

3032
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:38,320
Why don't you watch the currently released as the time of this release, Weagua, that

3033
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,920
is out right now that may or may not have him in a starring role?

3034
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,880
Wait, does it actually, though?

3035
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,880
Literally yes.

3036
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,880
Okay.

3037
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,880
Literally yes.

3038
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,200
I was like, why don't you go watch Weagua?

3039
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:51,200
He may or may not be there, but actually he's not.

3040
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,200
It's a lie.

3041
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,200
But he's not.

3042
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,200
But he's not.

3043
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,200
Yeah, go watch Weagua, everybody.

3044
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,200
ActionGiraffe.

3045
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,200
There he is.

3046
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:00,720
He's making a hiatus from his globe trotting and his movie Action starring with Tom Cruise.

3047
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,720
And his AIDS habits.

3048
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,720
And his AIDS habits.

3049
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,720
No, no, no.

3050
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,720
There's no hiatus from that.

3051
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,720
He's committed to that lifestyle.

3052
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:12,560
But I was just gonna say, everybody, that stupid walrus digit keeps insisting is a real

3053
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,360
character that we all know isn't.

3054
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,760
That's not a fursona.

3055
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:18,120
Is investigator a fursona?

3056
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:19,240
No, obviously not.

3057
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,760
These are real human being non-animal boys.

3058
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,440
They're their own guys.

3059
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,760
Hey, are we done with that question?

3060
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,760
Yeah, I'm not gonna say that.

3061
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,880
I see Kajoro Bitterthorn asks, to all the members who haven't made lectures yet, do

3062
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:36,680
you plan to in the future and what would they be about?

3063
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:37,680
Yes.

3064
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:38,960
Hey, they're all out, everybody.

3065
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:39,960
Just shout out.

3066
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:40,960
They're all out.

3067
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:41,960
All lectures from RadCon three are out.

3068
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:42,960
Mine was the last one from RadCon.

3069
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:43,960
That's right.

3070
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,960
Actually, it was the last one to happen, too, and the last one to release.

3071
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,960
That's right.

3072
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,960
Neat.

3073
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,960
Nifty.

3074
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,960
I'm probably gonna say fashion.

3075
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,960
You're excited?

3076
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,960
It was the last one to be done.

3077
01:47:54,960 --> 01:48:03,960
I feel like I said in a questions of a PCP already that I'm planning on thinking of doing

3078
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,960
a lecture.

3079
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,960
Well, I guess everybody else.

3080
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,960
When's the mage lecture gonna come out?

3081
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:08,960
I don't know.

3082
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,960
I don't know enough about things and stuff to do a lecture on.

3083
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,960
Mage, just do a lecture on Lithuania.

3084
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,960
Water cats.

3085
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,960
What?

3086
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:17,960
Water cat.

3087
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,960
Oh, wait.

3088
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,960
Do the lecture on what are those things where you sell OCs to people that's under their

3089
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,960
things.

3090
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,960
Exactly.

3091
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:27,960
One, to transfer Munchy, I never read the water cat things.

3092
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,960
Oh, it seems right up your alley.

3093
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,960
Reading books of my alley.

3094
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,960
Excuse you.

3095
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,960
Anywho.

3096
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,960
The adaptable thing.

3097
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,960
I'm a very newbie in that area, so I don't really have the authority to lecture anyone

3098
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,960
about it.

3099
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,960
That hasn't stopped any of us.

3100
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:46,960
Yeah.

3101
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,960
Yeah.

3102
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:48,960
I don't...

3103
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,960
Yeah.

3104
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,960
There's really only one thing I could do a lecture on, which is the game over thinker.

3105
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,960
We've been talking about that for a while.

3106
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,960
Davoo, you have to do a lecture on the Bible.

3107
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,960
It has to happen.

3108
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:00,960
I know.

3109
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:01,960
I've been saying that right now.

3110
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:02,960
I want that hot Davoo take.

3111
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:03,960
We've got to do that.

3112
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:04,960
We've got to film that in a church.

3113
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:05,960
No, no, no.

3114
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:06,960
Move the lecture.

3115
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,960
You're supposed to lecture on something that you have an exceptional amount of knowledge

3116
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:09,960
on, not just like above average.

3117
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:10,960
That is true.

3118
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,960
That's the ideal.

3119
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,960
I'll do a lecture on God in the church.

3120
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:14,960
I'll get the priest to do it.

3121
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:20,220
The tough thing about the game over thinker is that I want to just psychoanalyze Movie

3122
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:26,960
Bob for all day, but I think I'll just focus on the plot of the game over thinker series.

3123
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,960
Just somewhere like that will probably be sufficient.

3124
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:34,660
Would you argue that Movie Bob's game over thinker is similar to Sonichu in that there's

3125
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,960
a story of a man behind this.

3126
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:37,960
Yeah.

3127
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,960
It actually apparently just relaunched the game over thinker series.

3128
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,960
He's been trying to keep that ball rolling for a long time.

3129
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:45,960
Yeah.

3130
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,960
I guess I'll talk about that in the lecture.

3131
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,960
I have a little bit of catching up to do, but not that much.

3132
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:58,960
By the way, Davoo, on the last episode for drugs, I was doing the show notes and I searched

3133
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:03,960
up the game over thinker episode like seven or whatever it was because you mentioned

3134
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:04,960
they had bad audio.

3135
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:05,960
Oh my God.

3136
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,960
Yeah.

3137
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,960
The audio was on parallel.

3138
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,960
It was unbelievable.

3139
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:13,960
Yeah.

3140
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,960
I couldn't have fathomed.

3141
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,960
It was behind seven walls.

3142
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,960
It was behind seven walls and it was into a tin cannon and also underwater at the same

3143
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:24,960
time.

3144
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,960
You really can't oversell it.

3145
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,960
Anyone who's getting hyped for how bad the audio is is not getting over hyped.

3146
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:32,960
I'm going to look at that.

3147
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,960
I have a couple good questions by this one guy.

3148
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:36,960
One's bar.

3149
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:37,960
Yes.

3150
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,960
The two that I think are the best are, have you ever had any interesting or noteworthy

3151
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,960
encounters with panhandlers or homeless people?

3152
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,960
What do you think about how your community services deal with homeless people?

3153
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:53,960
San Diego is notorious for being like one of the worst homeless cities in America.

3154
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,960
It's absolutely terrible.

3155
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,960
They just roam the streets constantly and they are just everywhere.

3156
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,960
Absolutely everywhere.

3157
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:03,960
Funny story Jackie told me about the homeless population in Atlanta.

3158
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:08,960
Apparently when the Olympics came to Atlanta a couple years ago, the government of Atlanta

3159
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,960
just paid lots of homeless people to leave.

3160
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,960
They were like, here's some money.

3161
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,960
Get out.

3162
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,960
The Olympics are coming and we don't want you embarrassing us.

3163
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,960
Oh my God.

3164
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:23,960
That's a fix right there.

3165
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:24,960
That's a fix.

3166
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,960
Well, I'll tell you right now.

3167
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,960
Just enough for a taxi ride?

3168
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:28,960
That's a temporary solution.

3169
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:29,960
I'll tell you right now.

3170
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:32,960
Thanos would have implemented a permanent solution to this homeless situation if you

3171
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:33,960
know what I'm saying.

3172
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:38,960
When Hippo said how much money, I was just imagining him thinking, I'll find out where

3173
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,960
the Olympics are going next and I'm going to be homeless there.

3174
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:43,960
Free money.

3175
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,960
What?

3176
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:49,960
What an elaborate scheme.

3177
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,960
I'll be the most homeless person on earth.

3178
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:59,960
This was not exactly a homeless person or a panhandler, but one time I was walking around

3179
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:00,960
New York.

3180
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:07,960
I was in college and I was walking around and a guy, you know, he was like a black guy

3181
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,960
in like an African robe or something.

3182
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,960
He was all like traditionally dressed.

3183
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:18,960
He was one of those guys that's like something about being Jewish, like black people are

3184
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:21,960
like the real Jewish people, you know?

3185
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:23,960
Those guys.

3186
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:30,960
I was with my girlfriend at the time and I was taken completely off guard when he shouted

3187
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:36,960
me out in the crowd and he was like, do you know that you are the devil?

3188
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,960
Oh.

3189
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,960
Because I was white because he was saying that white people are the devil.

3190
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,960
He was like, do you know that you are the devil?

3191
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,960
And I was like, no, sir, I did not.

3192
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,960
Damn.

3193
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:48,960
And I thought I handled it pretty well.

3194
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,960
It's fucking just how true some facts are.

3195
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:00,960
Well, as a future homeless person, I'm sure I'll be able to answer this question in great

3196
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,960
detail in like a year or two.

3197
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,960
Tom's going to be on the other side of this question.

3198
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,960
All my crazy adventures will be great.

3199
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,960
Actually, when I said no, sir, I did not.

3200
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,960
Some guy in the crowd started snickering and I was like, yeah, guys.

3201
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,960
Got him, dude.

3202
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,960
Turn it around.

3203
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,960
The other question from one spar is, do we need to answer this?

3204
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,960
Oh, wait, wait, sorry.

3205
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:17,960
Can I just respond to that?

3206
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:20,960
This is just a short thing, but like this guy was home.

3207
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,960
It wasn't like panhandling, but it was like a homeless guy.

3208
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,960
So when I was in Japan and this experience haunts me to this day, I'm walking back from

3209
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:28,960
the gym.

3210
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,960
You know, it's like, Japan's like wealthy.

3211
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:31,960
I'm just, I'm in Tokyo.

3212
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:35,960
Just everyone's like going about their business, being a real dude in the city.

3213
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:36,960
And I'm just walking back.

3214
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,960
You know, it's the American guy walking through the city.

3215
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,960
And I just, I see a homeless guy sitting on the side of the road and he's got all this

3216
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,960
shit around him and stuff.

3217
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:44,960
He's like, you know, dirty and stuff.

3218
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,960
You know, it's fine.

3219
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:46,960
It's just what he was.

3220
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,960
And I look at him and I'm like, wait, he's playing with something.

3221
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:50,960
What's he holding in his hands there?

3222
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,960
His hands are like down, you know, like by his, by his crotch.

3223
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:53,960
I'm like, what's he holding there?

3224
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:54,960
Wait a minute.

3225
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:55,960
No.

3226
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:56,960
It is.

3227
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,960
Is that his penis?

3228
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:00,960
And it was.

3229
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,960
And it was in fact his penis.

3230
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,960
And you jumped in.

3231
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:04,960
He just, he had his dick out.

3232
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,960
He was playing with it like in public before the eyes of God's and man.

3233
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,960
And he was just doing that.

3234
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,960
And what stood out to me was I was like, what?

3235
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,960
What's going on here?

3236
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:22,960
So I was like shocked, but what truly fascinated me about the situation was how everyone else

3237
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,960
just kept walking.

3238
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,960
Like this was an obvious thing.

3239
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,960
Anyone who looked and see this shit, but nobody stopped to say anything.

3240
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,960
I'm not saying that I'm a hero or anything.

3241
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,960
I'm just saying like it was amazing.

3242
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,960
Who wants to engage with that shit?

3243
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,960
Yeah.

3244
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,960
I just.

3245
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:37,960
Excuse me a homeless guy.

3246
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,960
Put that junk in that trunk.

3247
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:42,960
I mean, I just was like, I fucking did a double take.

3248
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:43,960
I was like, what?

3249
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:44,960
But like people just.

3250
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:45,960
Looked past.

3251
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,960
Maybe he was like doing a performance and he had his hat on the floor.

3252
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,960
He's supposed to throw a little coin in there.

3253
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,960
Yeah.

3254
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:52,960
Nice dick.

3255
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,960
You walk over to him and you're like, hey, sir, put that away.

3256
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,960
And then he takes off his penis revealing that it's actually a hidden camera.

3257
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,960
And he says, you're on national TV.

3258
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:04,960
That'd be great.

3259
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:10,960
A candid camera type of show, but it's exclusively guys jacking off.

3260
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,960
Like just always jacking off.

3261
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:16,960
They're always actually jacking off.

3262
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,960
It's not actually a prank.

3263
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,960
They're just filming it and then making fun of you for noticing.

3264
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,960
Social experiment.

3265
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:24,960
Yeah.

3266
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,960
I don't see how this can go wrong.

3267
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:27,960
Oh dude, right?

3268
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:28,960
Confort, right?

3269
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,960
Munchie, I see this in your future as a performance artist.

3270
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:33,960
I'll be 18.

3271
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,960
It'll be all good.

3272
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:35,960
Finally.

3273
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,960
The last question I think we want to do here, another one by OneSpar.

3274
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:41,960
Do any of you listen to the news either on radio or TV?

3275
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:45,960
And what are your preferred sources for world-slash-local news?

3276
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:46,960
Alex Jones!

3277
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,960
He'll give you the real shit.

3278
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,960
He'll give you the real shit.

3279
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,960
I'm a BBC lad.

3280
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,960
I grew up watching that.

3281
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:57,960
I don't look at it that much, but whenever a dad comes home, he puts it in the mouth.

3282
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,960
I knew someone was going to say it.

3283
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:00,960
I had to go there.

3284
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:01,960
It was so obvious.

3285
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:02,960
I had to.

3286
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:03,960
Wait, what?

3287
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:04,960
Big Black Cox.

3288
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:05,960
You love him.

3289
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:06,960
The BBC.

3290
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:07,960
I mean, unrelated, but yeah.

3291
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:10,960
What an unfortunate abbreviation.

3292
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:13,960
Coincidentally, a fan of both things.

3293
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:14,960
Well, hold on.

3294
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:15,960
You can say all of them.

3295
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,960
It's just another failure of language.

3296
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:18,960
BBC came first.

3297
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:19,960
All of them could be like that.

3298
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,960
But the big black cock came as well.

3299
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,960
Well, the big black cock has been here long before any of us, and it will be.

3300
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:28,960
It's referenced in the Bible.

3301
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:34,960
Literally all of them could be abbreviations like ABC, anal block, clog.

3302
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,960
Did you get anal beat cleavage?

3303
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,960
Did you know that big black cocks are in fact referenced in the Bible?

3304
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:42,960
Is that true?

3305
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,960
Actually, someone, okay, I wanted to answer this question, but I didn't have a good answer

3306
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:47,960
prepared.

3307
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,960
Someone asked a favorite Bible verse, even if you're not a Christian.

3308
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:56,960
Now I know it, because I remember there's a verse in the Bible that specifically, it's

3309
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,960
something about like, we don't fuck with that tribe over there.

3310
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:05,960
We don't let our women go over to that tribe because quote, their flesh is as the flesh

3311
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:06,960
of asses.

3312
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,960
I think they have big donkey tics.

3313
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,960
Are you sure that's what they meant by that?

3314
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:13,960
Well, I was assured that it was.

3315
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:18,960
The person assuring me could have been wrong, but I choose to believe that it's good.

3316
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,960
And God said gizam.

3317
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:23,960
Look at that shit.

3318
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:26,960
I personally listen to a variety of news sources.

3319
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,960
I really try to mix things up, and like, there's no one is unbiased.

3320
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,960
So I just try to mix up and listen to a bunch of different biased people.

3321
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,960
Like the young Turks.

3322
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,960
I'll listen to Kyle Kulinski.

3323
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,960
Kulinski, whatever his name is, secular talk.

3324
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,960
Like a review tech USA, sometimes less of a news guy.

3325
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,960
And then like also like Ben Shapiro.

3326
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,960
Whoa, you took a right turn there.

3327
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:48,960
Well, that's the thing.

3328
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,960
There is no online person who's really in the middle.

3329
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:53,960
Like everyone has their agenda.

3330
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:55,960
So I just try, and Stefan, I'll listen to some things.

3331
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:58,960
I just listen to as much biased shit on either side.

3332
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,960
And then I just form it in my mind and mix it.

3333
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:05,960
I just like hear whatever like comes through the fucking, you know, osmosis.

3334
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:10,960
By the way, my favorite Bible verse, Ezekiel 2320 through 21st.

3335
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,960
There she lusted after her lovers whose genitals were like those of donkeys

3336
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,960
and whose emission was like that of horses.

3337
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,960
Dude, I think that's exactly the one I was talking about.

3338
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:20,960
That's probably the one.

3339
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,960
That's probably the one.

3340
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,960
Damn, emission was like that of horses.

3341
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:26,960
So they like, they know what a horse emission is like.

3342
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,960
So you longed for the lewdness of your youth when in Egypt

3343
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:33,960
your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

3344
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:36,960
Now we're talking.

3345
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,960
Opposite of me, it looks like I'm going to be a Christian.

3346
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:46,960
I'm sick of the porn on the internet. Bible porn only, please.

3347
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:50,960
There's one more question that we, you know, this could be our final thing.

3348
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,960
It's just, it's again, it's for once bar.

3349
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:53,960
And here, this is it.

3350
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:56,960
It's, do you think there is enough PCP fan content?

3351
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,960
Should there be more?

3352
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:58,960
No!

3353
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,960
And what would you like to see or not like to see?

3354
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:01,960
First of all, the answer is no.

3355
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:02,960
Great question.

3356
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,960
And based on this question, I'm actually happy to announce

3357
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,960
we're beginning something here today

3358
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:09,960
that we've been discussing amongst ourselves

3359
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:11,960
and we are starting a contest

3360
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:15,960
to create an opening theme song for the PCP.

3361
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:16,960
Oh, right.

3362
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,960
Remember that, guys?

3363
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,960
Remember that?

3364
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,960
So starting right now.

3365
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,960
Hashtag PCP theme.

3366
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,960
Or I don't know.

3367
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:25,960
Yeah, well, I guess we'll stick with that.

3368
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:27,960
The PC theme.

3369
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:29,960
PCP theme, whatever.

3370
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,960
Or PC theme.

3371
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:31,960
Do the first one.

3372
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:32,960
It's clear.

3373
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,960
Listen, everybody, make music

3374
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,960
or whatever the fuck you want.

3375
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,960
And we will listen to it.

3376
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,960
And we will not necessarily pick one,

3377
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,960
but they will all be reviewed

3378
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,960
and we will do a fucking thing.

3379
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,960
We're looking for some intro song.

3380
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:46,960
We love the one that we have now.

3381
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,960
It's just a little low key, you know,

3382
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,960
which it works better as an outro.

3383
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,960
So we're looking for something to start the show off

3384
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,960
in a hype-ass kind of way.

3385
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,960
So if you're an audio mixer,

3386
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,960
you're a musicsman,

3387
01:59:58,960 --> 01:59:59,960
and you want to submit this,

3388
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,960
go to the Twitter.

3389
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,960
Hashtag PCP theme.

3390
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,960
Submit some fucking audio that we can listen to

3391
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,960
if you want to be fucking entering this thing.

3392
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,960
That's it.

3393
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:10,960
What you should do is get, like,

3394
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:13,960
songs from all of our favorite bands

3395
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:15,960
that we have mentioned at various points

3396
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,960
and just put them layered on top of each other.

3397
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:19,960
It doesn't matter whether the BPMs are correct

3398
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:23,960
and go right up to the mic and say,

3399
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,960
That's a good one.

3400
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,960
I like that one.

3401
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:30,960
But this is real.

3402
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:31,960
This is going to be a big thing.

3403
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:33,960
We've been dancing around trying to figure out

3404
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,960
how to start the shows off for a while,

3405
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,960
and this is our solution.

3406
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,960
This, we throw it back to you guys.

3407
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,960
You'll be forever immortalized

3408
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,960
as a fucking intro song if we pick it.

3409
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:43,960
So that's it.

3410
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:44,960
That's it, everybody.

3411
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,960
There is no prize.

3412
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,960
There is no fucking prize

3413
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:48,960
other than the legend.

3414
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,960
Well, the prize is that your thing

3415
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:51,960
will become the thing

3416
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:53,960
and that we will say well done

3417
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:54,960
and point people in your direction.

3418
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,960
And you'll be credited in the video descriptions.

3419
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:58,960
It's literally exposure.

3420
02:00:58,960 --> 02:00:59,960
Of course.

3421
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:00,960
That's correct.

3422
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,960
So only do it if you're happy to not be paid.

3423
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,960
That's the thing.

3424
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,960
There you go, everybody.

3425
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:06,960
Started right now.

3426
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,960
Hashtag PCP theme.

3427
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:09,960
Get going.

3428
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,960
There you go.

3429
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,960
It feels wrong for me to say,

3430
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,960
Yeah, guys, make more PCP fan-er.

3431
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,960
It feels wrong to be like,

3432
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,960
no, there's not enough fan content.

3433
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,960
But all I know is that I would enjoy

3434
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,960
if there were more little bit of munchies

3435
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,960
running around.

3436
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:26,960
I would like that.

3437
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:27,960
Yeah.

3438
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:29,960
Well, Munchie, you and me both know

3439
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:31,960
that by asking for fan-er, it will happen.

3440
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:33,960
Our retrieval has so much more fan-er

3441
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:34,960
than the PCP.

3442
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,960
But that's because our retrieval is good

3443
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,960
and it is inspiring.

3444
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,960
Oh, you're right.

3445
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:40,960
You know what it is?

3446
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,960
Our retrieval is way more specific

3447
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:44,960
and has a visual style that can be utilized,

3448
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,960
which is like homestuck style and stuff.

3449
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:48,960
So that goes a long way.

3450
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,960
That goes a long way, I'd say.

3451
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,960
My favorite PCP fan content.

3452
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:53,960
You know what I gotta say?

3453
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:55,960
How has it been at this point two weeks

3454
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:56,960
since the furry cast?

3455
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:59,960
And we only had one person draw us all his furries.

3456
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:02,960
No, there was more than one.

3457
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,960
There were two.

3458
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,960
Well, you, Ben, got a few extra arts.

3459
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:07,960
Yeah, like Ben got one.

3460
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:08,960
Yeah, us all as PCP.

3461
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:09,960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3462
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,960
I got a bonus.

3463
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:12,960
That was good.

3464
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,960
Pretty disappointed with all of you.

3465
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,960
You're not gonna lie.

3466
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,960
The best PCP fan stuff was not even by a fan.

3467
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,960
It was by fucking Ben St. here.

3468
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,960
And it was that comic that was just the PCP University

3469
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,960
and it was just like a little comic

3470
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:29,960
based upon a discussion that was in the episode.

3471
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:30,960
That was a mess.

3472
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,960
Yeah, it was the PCP University one.

3473
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,960
I think I did two of those, right?

3474
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,960
I did a second one.

3475
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:36,960
I don't think so.

3476
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,960
I did the one up into the table.

3477
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,960
Yeah, yeah, of like Nate.

3478
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,960
It's like, it's just me.

3479
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:42,960
It's nobody else.

3480
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:43,960
I'm here.

3481
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:44,960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3482
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,960
Yeah, so I've done two of those.

3483
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:47,960
I should do more.

3484
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:50,960
Of course, a shout out to the PCP animated guys

3485
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:51,960
who did those.

3486
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:54,960
Zenhuxnable and the other person who I forget at the moment.

3487
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,960
Shout out to 1, 2, 3.

3488
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:57,960
Wait, no, who was that?

3489
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,960
Our schedule animated, which was unparalleled

3490
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,960
and the best thing that's ever happened to me.

3491
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:02,960
That was the best part.

3492
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:03,960
Yep.

3493
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,960
Best piece of fan content that has ever happened to me ever

3494
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:06,960
was to shout out to 1, 2, 3.

3495
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:07,960
Sure.

3496
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:08,960
Our schedule animated.

3497
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,960
Our retrieval and therefore banned and elicit.

3498
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:12,960
Absolutely perfect.

3499
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,960
Also, thank you to everybody who draws punk.

3500
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:16,960
That's the cool.

3501
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:17,960
I like it when you do that.

3502
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,960
Asha in the AM was the other one.

3503
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:20,960
That's the one.

3504
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,960
That's the one.

3505
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:22,960
Thanks, Asha.

3506
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:23,960
All right, guys.

3507
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:24,960
I think we're done here.

3508
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:25,960
I think we've done all we need to do here.

3509
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:26,960
Okay, please.

3510
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:27,960

3529
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:04,960
I haven't.

3530
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,960
Can I announce something for myself?

3531
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,960
Sure.

3532
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:09,960
This week I shipped all the books.

3533
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:10,960
I shipped all my Kickstarter books.

3534
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:11,960
That's right.

3535
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:12,960
Congratulations.

3536
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:13,960
They're real now.

3537
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,960
People are all like the tweets.

3538
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:16,960
The tweets are already pouring in.

3539
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,960
People are taking pictures of themselves.

3540
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,960
They're stylish books and wearing their pins and shit.

3541
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,960
It's fucking sick.

3542
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:24,960
I can't wait.

3543
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,960
I gave them, they got real nice envelopes.

3544
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,960
Did you remember to use the media mail then?

3545
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,960
I did not because it said that comic books don't meet the criteria.

3546
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:34,960
What?

3547
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:35,960
They're fucking cowards.

3548
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:36,960
Yeah.

3549
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,960
Wow.

3550
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:38,960
You should have just said they were regular books.

3551
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,960
I know, but I was scared of the police.

3552
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,960
Typical cop killers.

3553
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:49,960
I'm putting out a warrant for the rest of anyone who does not do the following.

3554
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:57,960
When you get your pristine Vapors book, flip to Vaporet for an unantiled Magda Vaporet

3555
02:04:57,960 --> 02:04:58,960
by a munchie smiley face.

3556
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:03,960
Turn to the last page and take a selfie with that page in the background.

3557
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:07,960
So take a selfie with that page and send it to me right fucking now.

3558
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:10,960
That's your new homework.

3559
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:11,960
What's your Twitter at?

3560
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:12,960
What's your Twitter at?

3561
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,960
Munchie, W, tiny hats.

3562
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,960
There you go.

3563
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:16,960
There you go everybody.

3564
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,960
You've got all the tools before you now.

3565
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,960
All right, that's it everybody.

3566
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,960
We're done.

3567
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:22,960
Thank you for listening.

3568
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:23,960
A good time as always.
