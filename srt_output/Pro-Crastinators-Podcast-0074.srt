00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Most companies that sell products make money by selling them to consumers.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Pyramid schemes typically make money selling overpriced, difficult to sell products to their own distributors,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,500
who are typically aspiring entrepreneurs, hoping to build a business.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,500
I am the best guy ever, Pharaoh best guy ever, because we're talking about Egypt today, of course,

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,500
and we've got Mr. Mummy Hippocrit.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
What was that entire intro?

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
I don't know, you're a mummy now for this episode.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Okay, hello, it's me.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Yes, Ben Anubis, dead?

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Yes.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Welcome to the Luxor Hotel, where you gotta die and go to hell.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
That rhymed because I'm a genius.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Did you know that in Egypt, pharaohs were all buried with their pets?

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
That's what Tom Oliver is, he's one of these things.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Pyramids weren't made by the Egyptians, they were made by aliens who were worshipped as gods in the past.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Google the Anunnaki, it's all fucking real!

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:22,500
You know, before we get into the actual topic, I just want to relate an anecdote that my Spanish teacher in high school...

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Mr. What's-his-face?

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Mr. Oh God, what was his name?

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
They called him Mr. Subella.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:42,500
He legitimately believed that the Incan ziggurats were made with some kind of advanced lost technology that used sonic waves to levitate stone blocks into place.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Look, I've watched Ancient Aliens, I know exactly how all that shit was made.

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Is it possible?

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Maybe!

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Alright, I have a question about that.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I have a couple of questions.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Why is it that they have the skills of a tier one minecrafter, these aliens?

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Why are they making it more advanced than that?

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
It's gotta be some sonic nonsense.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Yeah, of course.

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
We make up for our lack of technical ability with our creativity.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
That's why, you know, given the correct tools, we can make crazy shit.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
The aliens, they got the technical shit down.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
They're just not very creative, right?

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
They make a big giant 3D triangle and they call it a day.

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
That's true.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
There was a lot of sonic powers back then.

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
There was real sonic mania.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Yeah, there was a real sonic boom back in the day.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Yeah, relevant to our friend Hippocrates here.

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Alright, let's begin, everybody.

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
So, our Egypt theme episode is about pyramid schemes.

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I understand it was the process of worshipping alien skygods.

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Yeah, that's right.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
So, okay, let's check over our buddies over at Urban Dictionary

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
to see what they've got to say on the situation.

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay, here we go.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Pyramid scheme.

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
This is definition number two.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
The best scheme to ever set up once you learn to never underestimate,

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I hate this already, the stupidity of the human majority.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Just make sure you don't get caught though.

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Oh, I regret reading that.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
That was terrible.

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I know, I know, right?

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Okay, let's try another one.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Here's the top definition.

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I should have just gone to this one.

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
A fraudulent business model illegal in most places

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
in which participants are paid to recruit more participants

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
rather than commissions on sales.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Frequently passed off as multi-level marketing

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
by incorporating sales of an unmarketable product or service

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
into the scheme.

66
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
In such cases, participants are usually required

67
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
to maintain a monthly purchase quota to qualify for payments.

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Alright, well, that's really it.

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
That's the one.

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Now, it's like the business version of a zombie plague.

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Multi-level marketing is the softer, gentler form

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
that is supposedly legal.

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
The politically correct term, if you will.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
That's what pyramid schemes call themselves

75
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
to get away with being pyramid schemes.

76
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Right, and Gib, you described it as similar to the zombie outbreak,

77
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
but it'd be like the zombie outbreak

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
if in order to make more zombies,

79
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
you didn't have to just touch them.

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
You had to convince them,

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
like, no, you've got to understand,

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
being a zombie is great.

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
You're really going to adapt to our lifestyle

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
and become part of the family.

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
If you buy this $49.99 protein powder,

86
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
you too can have this amazing zombie complexion.

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Yeah.

88
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Well, I was thinking of it more in the sense

89
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
that eventually there's going to be so many of these people

90
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
in the thing that there's no one left to recruit,

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
and they're like, well, we're going to just starve.

92
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
There's no brain sweet.

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
We're all zombies now.

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Eventually, that's true.

95
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
And they all fall over.

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
That's a fair point.

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
It's interesting that you brought up protein powder

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
because just the other day,

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
I was coming back from the gym,

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
and I happened to stop in, I think, CVS or whatever,

101
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
and I was getting my gigantic five-pound box

102
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
of protein powder in the things.

103
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
And as I was buying it, this dude's like,

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
hey, hold up there, friendo.

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
And this was just like two days ago.

106
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Have I got something for you?

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
And he runs out to his car.

108
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
He's like, don't leave.

109
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
And he runs out to his car.

110
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Wait, wait, wait, was this the guy who worked there

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
or just an intern?

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
No, he was loitering in the lobby.

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I think he was buying something legitimately,

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
but he happened to see an opportunity,

115
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
and he dove on it when he saw me buying protein powder.

116
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He's like, oh, this is actually kind of sad.

117
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
So he comes back with a pamphlet

118
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
and a little packet of some stuff.

119
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
And he's like, here, this is the best protein powder ever.

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
We grow it in Greenland.

121
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
It's new.

122
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
It's fancy.

123
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
He was actually stumbling over it.

124
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
He grew this protein in Greenland.

125
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
What the fuck?

126
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
It might have been Iceland, but what are those?

127
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
And he was like, no, it was Ireland.

128
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
It was Ireland.

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
It must be some soy protein, then,

130
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
around somewhere.

131
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
It definitely was.

132
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
But then he was stumbling over the pitch.

133
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
He had clearly just learned this,

134
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
and hadn't internalized it yet.

135
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
So I don't think this was really a pyramid scheme

136
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
as much as just a sales pitch in general,

137
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
but it was interesting.

138
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
It was a similar sort of situation

139
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
that I just happened to find myself in.

140
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
And it needs to say I threw it all in the trash

141
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
as soon as he was out of my eyesight.

142
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Why did you even wait?

143
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Why did you wait?

144
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
You should have done it right in front of him

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
to send a message.

146
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
But that's the thing.

147
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
In order to deal with these kind of situations,

148
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I make it seem like I'm on board,

149
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
and then immediately throw everything away

150
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
once they're gone,

151
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
so that I don't have to deal with the social ramifications

152
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
of rejecting someone.

153
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
It's much easier for me.

154
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
You're just like, hmm, thanks.

155
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
This is some good information.

156
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Dumps in the trash.

157
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Well, I'll look all this over and get back to you real soon.

158
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Let me pass this off to my secretary.

159
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Dumps into garbage can.

160
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
We'll be back pretty soon.

161
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
And then Oscar the Grouch comes out.

162
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
He said, I like it.

163
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
It's good.

164
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
You said I could go home at five.

165
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I don't want it.

166
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Oscar comes out.

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
He's like, oh, this looks like a real good money-making opportunity.

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Incidentally, I did look at the nutrition facts.

169
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Only 21 grams of protein per serving.

170
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
My other thing has 25 grams of protein per serving.

171
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
So fuck this shit.

172
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
It's probably got, like, essential oils.

173
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
It's got any more expensive.

174
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Essential oils or something, or, like, electrolytes.

175
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Yeah, I'm sure.

176
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Some amino acids.

177
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
It's a superfood.

178
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
That is protein.

179
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah.

180
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
What is our angle on pyramid schemes?

181
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Because I don't think any of us like it.

182
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I know.

183
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I think some of us have experience with it, right?

184
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Yeah, tell stories.

185
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah.

186
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, Jackie suggested this topic to me.

187
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
And I thought it was great because I have personal experience with it.

188
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
As she does too, she's known people that have been involved in it.

189
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
And then I went and I did some research.

190
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
And there was this blog called Not Quite Fairy Tales Blog,

191
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,500
which is a girl's personal account of getting, like, deep, deep

192
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
into the fucking MLM rabbit hole.

193
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
It's a multi-level market.

194
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Oh, multi-level market.

195
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And it's a pretty gripping read, and it's absolutely disgusting

196
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
the way it all goes down.

197
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
And then there's a documentary called Betting On Zero

198
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
that is about this investor called Bill Ackman, who is, um,

199
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
he's going after, have you seen it, Tom?

200
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I watched it.

201
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
It's funny because, like, I watched this, like, three days

202
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
before you brought up this topic.

203
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
So it's just, huh, I'm prepared for this.

204
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Yeah.

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
It's because he basically, he invests tons of money in the idea

206
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
that a company called Herbalife will fail

207
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
because he's convinced that the company is a pyramid scheme.

208
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
So the movie is basically his quest to, like,

209
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
out Herbalife as a pyramid scheme so the business will fail

210
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
and he'll recoup a huge amount of profit on his investments.

211
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Interesting.

212
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Interesting.

213
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Anyway, for me, my personal experience is that I was almost

214
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
recruited by a vector marketing to sell Cutco knives.

215
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
That's what happened to me.

216
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
This is when I was, this is when I was pretty freshly out of college

217
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
living at home and desperate to find a job.

218
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
And they preyed on me because I was weak

219
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
and I didn't know any better.

220
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Yeah, I think I was on Craigslist or something

221
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
and I saw an ad for vector marketing

222
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
and I, you know, responded to the ad and they said,

223
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
I'm coming for an interview.

224
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
So here's what happened.

225
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I went, I drove down, I put on like a suit or some shit

226
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
and I drove down.

227
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I was scared shitless because I really need this.

228
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I really fucking need this.

229
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
So I go into the waiting room, into the lobby in this office building

230
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,500
and I wait for my turn and I go in and I talk to this smug,

231
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
this smug, clean shaven bald guy.

232
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
He's like a youngish guy and he's just smirking.

233
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
He's like, he's real fucking confident in himself.

234
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
He asks me like, he asks me like some bullshit question

235
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
and he gives us all, he gives everyone in the room a presentation

236
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
where like, oh, this knife is so sharp it can cut a penny.

237
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
So you take the knife and you like, oh, you cut a penny into a spiral

238
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
and like, this is what you're supposed to do.

239
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
And the idea is that you go around door to door

240
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
being like, hey, I want to sell you some knives.

241
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
You go into their home and you cut a penny in front of them

242
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
and you're like, oh, it's so sharp it can cut a penny.

243
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
And they're like, okay, but the thing is you got to buy the knives

244
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
from them to then go out and sell them.

245
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
So there's no, they're not hiring you to do anything.

246
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
You're buying product from them

247
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
that you will hopefully then go on to resell.

248
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
So like they profit no matter what just by bringing you on board.

249
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
But I didn't realize this.

250
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
I was so desperate for a job that I was like,

251
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
this is my fucking ticket out of dad yelling at me all the time

252
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
for being an unemployed asshole.

253
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
So I was, and I'll never forget,

254
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
after the interview went down, I was waiting

255
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
and the guy calls me in his office and he's like, Ben.

256
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
So after talking to you for a while

257
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
and reviewing your credentials,

258
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
we have decided that yes, you are qualified to work for Vectormon.

259
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
And I was like really relieved.

260
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I was like, oh, thank you.

261
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
I was like, I'm really grateful.

262
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
It's embarrassing looking back on it

263
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
because now I know what was really going on.

264
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
And so I went home and I was like, mom, dad,

265
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm going to sell knives.

266
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
And looking back, I don't know why mom and...

267
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
That's philosophy, physics, grief.

268
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
We're really paying off now, baby.

269
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
I know, right?

270
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,500
And looking back, I don't know why they didn't be like,

271
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Ben, this is a scam.

272
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Like they should have, I don't know why they didn't just do that.

273
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
But they were like, are you sure about this?

274
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Are you really sure about this?

275
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
And I was like, mom, dad, what do you want to do?

276
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
You're always telling me to get a job.

277
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Here's a fucking job.

278
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
What more do you want from me?

279
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
God.

280
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
But at some point, considering I was like,

281
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I got to pay like $160 for this knife set.

282
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Like I can't fucking spare that.

283
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
And also it doesn't seem right that I need to buy product

284
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
to work for a job.

285
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
So I ended up...

286
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
So like the fact...

287
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Yeah, my lack of money ended up...

288
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
My lack of money got me into that situation,

289
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
but then it also stonewalled me from getting any further into it

290
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
so I couldn't go through with it.

291
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Years later, I was again jobless

292
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
and I responded to another ad for some other company.

293
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
They'd said they'd give me an interview.

294
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
And I went to this office building.

295
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
It was a piece of crap in the middle of nowhere.

296
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
It was underneath a karate dojo.

297
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Sick.

298
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Yeah, but I went inside and I waited around.

299
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
And it turned out that this interview was not even one-on-one.

300
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
It was basically a group presentation.

301
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
And this was not quite the same.

302
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I didn't have to buy in to do this,

303
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
but basically I would just be selling insurance policies on commission,

304
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
which is pretty much the same thing.

305
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
It's no risk to the company.

306
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
They're not hiring you for anything.

307
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
You're just selling their product and they'll give you a cut if you're successful.

308
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
So it's basically another multi-level marketing thing.

309
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
But this time I knew what was up.

310
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
So at the end I was just like, I'm out. I'm out peace.

311
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
And that's my fucking story.

312
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
How about you guys?

313
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Well, Ben, that's cool,

314
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
but I prefer people who succeed at multi-level marketing.

315
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I want to hear a champion who's made the world his bitch.

316
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Someone who really had the hustle.

317
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
The hustle they need to make it work.

318
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Exactly.

319
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
To be honest, I would kind of like to know

320
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
some insider stories from people who have risen up in the ranks

321
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
at least a little bit and become that recruiter guy.

322
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I wonder what that's like.

323
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I seriously recommend the Not Quite Fairy Tales blog.

324
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
It is horrifying.

325
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,500
She manages to sell a little bit just from her own get-up-and-go,

326
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
going around and looking for it.

327
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
She becomes like a complete fucking slave drone to this company.

328
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Her whole Facebook and social media presence becomes dedicated to tweeting about it.

329
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
To tweeting about it and tweeting about products,

330
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,500
posting selfies of herself talking about how grateful she is to have this job

331
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
and how wonderful her life is now that she's got this job,

332
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
even though she's like hundreds of pounds in the hole for the entire time.

333
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
But they're just like, fake it till you make it, girl.

334
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
You've got to tell people how great this is.

335
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
That's so evil.

336
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
It's really evil.

337
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
They're like fake it till you make it.

338
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,500
They say that under the guise, show people how great the product is

339
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
so they'll want to buy it.

340
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
But no, really what they're doing is fake it till you make it.

341
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Tell people how great this job is so they'll be duped into fucking signing on

342
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
and becoming your subordinate.

343
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
And you're duping yourself into not letting the reality of the situation phase you.

344
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Yeah, and of course she eventually finds out

345
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
that this super with it successful together girl that recruited her,

346
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
she was just faking it until she made it too.

347
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
She wasn't making any money either.

348
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Nobody in the chain was making any money.

349
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
They're all in the hole.

350
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
The people that are maintaining their high rankings

351
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
are literally buying the products for themselves

352
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
and keeping their quote unquote business afloat that way.

353
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
It's a nightmare.

354
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Some of the most evil shit out there, man.

355
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
That's not how capitalism is supposed to work.

356
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
It's purely parasitic.

357
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,500
You succeed in an MLM by duping people into falling for the same trick you fell for.

358
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Once you realize that the products won't sell,

359
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
that's the only way to make it work.

360
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,500
So what I want to know is did the girl ever cross that evil bridge

361
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
and become like, I mean, I know that she was advertising it for her.

362
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Did she ever willingly acknowledge it like,

363
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I am now duping people and you know what, I've got to do it

364
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
if I want to dig myself out of here.

365
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Did she ever get into that place?

366
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
No, not quite.

367
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
There was this kind of thing where like she got her like step sister

368
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
to buy some makeup at a kind of a shitty price

369
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
and then she like couldn't refund it even though the girl changed her mind.

370
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
But she wasn't like, no, she didn't like act.

371
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
She did recruit some people, but she didn't like, I don't know.

372
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
She wasn't too, like clearly there are worse people.

373
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Sure, but the funny thing is even in a situation where you're doing this,

374
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
like human beings are crazy adaptive.

375
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You can get yourself in the headspace where you don't think you're doing anything wrong with this stuff.

376
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Wait, no, I changed my mind because she did the fake it till you make a thing

377
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
and she did recruit people.

378
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
So yeah, she absolutely duped people, never mind.

379
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
She was just as bad as any other others.

380
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
What I'm wondering is if like, we could call these people evil and all that,

381
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
but I'm wondering if they're not more helpful to think about it

382
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
that like their perspective has been fucked up

383
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
and we need to see the light, you know?

384
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Because they've been told by people they think it was successful that this is how they did it.

385
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
And so they're just following the blueprint that they've been given.

386
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Same if you go to any job and they're like, this is the way you do it and then you do it.

387
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
You have no proof that that works, you just take them at their word.

388
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
That's true, until you learn as you go.

389
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Until you're just like, wait, they're fucking me over and then you're screwed.

390
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
You think it's a legitimate job and like any talk of like,

391
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
oh, well, my products aren't selling, this stuff is not good.

392
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
It's like, that's all like, you're being negative.

393
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
You need to work on your attitude.

394
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,500
You need to have a positive mindset to succeed in this industry.

395
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,500
But a positive mindset is just like, buy everything we tell you to buy.

396
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
It's all that business talk.

397
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I feel like there's a whole sect of human society that is the businessman.

398
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
And it's so weird and alien that they get in their heads.

399
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,500
The way to succeed is to be this way.

400
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,500
And I think it's really just dumb people following a blueprint, like you're saying.

401
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
They don't know what they're doing, but they know that it makes them money,

402
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,500
so they just keep doing it until they get really rich.

403
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Like smart people generally don't go down that road,

404
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
but when they do, they rise right to the top because they know actually how to do it better.

405
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
There are rich people in these pyramid schemes,

406
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,500
but they're only at like the very, very top that have like just lucked into a situation

407
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
where they have huge networks of people underneath them.

408
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Wouldn't Erbilife have like the president's group wherever the fuck it was?

409
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
You got like this like diamond pin and they were like,

410
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
they did these huge big presentations where like hundreds of people went.

411
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
They're like, they showcase these guys and then it's like, you just have to keep going.

412
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
I have like 15 sports cars now.

413
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Erbilife's the best. Yeah.

414
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
And everybody was like cheering.

415
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
If I can do it, you can do it.

416
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Fucking bullshit.

417
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
What's what's evil about this is that so in like normal capitalism,

418
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
the whole idea is you like generate a product and you give it to people who,

419
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,500
you know, don't have the skills or whatever to make themselves or the time they've just got other specialties.

420
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
And then you do an equitable trade where you both gain.

421
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
And that's where that's where society progresses.

422
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I mean, you know, in this kind of system,

423
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
that's like through that trade,

424
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,500
that's where all the great stuff that we have in America has basically come from through this process.

425
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
But like nothing is being created in this system.

426
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
It's kind of like the banking system only that actually lending money does sort of allow growth in some way.

427
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,500
The business model of these, you know, pyramid schemes that pass themselves off as MLMs

428
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,500
by having a quote unquote product that's for sale is that the product itself is not anything special

429
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
and it's overpriced for what it is.

430
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
It will not sell on its own.

431
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,500
But the structure of the way that you recruit people and then you incentivize these people like you need to sell.

432
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
You need to sell the stuff at any cost if you're going to make your quote unquote business work.

433
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
So that creates the incentive to buy and to sell.

434
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
So like the products are designed to be bought by end users.

435
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
They're designed to be bought by the people you recruit so they can sell.

436
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
So the only people buying the products are the people suckered into it.

437
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Or the quote unquote employees.

438
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,500
They're the ones with the interest in purchasing the products.

439
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Any system of trade like this that isn't about delivering as high a quality product as possible to the people

440
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,500
at a minimum has its priorities skewed and is evil.

441
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
It's disgusting.

442
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Watching in the betting on zero documentary they interview the guy who's in charge of Herbalife

443
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
which is another company like this that sells like health products and stuff.

444
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,500
And he is some like he's like an ex Disney executive.

445
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,500
But he talks about like he talks with such confidence about how like this business is great

446
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
because we're bringing like we're bringing these great products to people.

447
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Like we're providing we're providing a great service like we're bringing important fucking health benefits to the people

448
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,500
and we're you know giving tons of people like an opportunity to make money

449
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
like we're supporting these communities.

450
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Like the the movie is it's part of its centers on this like this Latina community.

451
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
This Latino community that's like a bunch of them have been suckered in.

452
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,500
They've been like tricked into buying these like franchises of Herbalife the only for the products not to sell

453
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
and they they're ruined and they lose tons of money and it causes tons of problems for them.

454
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,500
And they're like protesting this company because like we were duped you know by promises of success

455
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
that we're not representative of your actual company.

456
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
And meanwhile fucking what's his name.

457
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,500
The CEO of Herbalife is like yes you know we love the Latina community.

458
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
You know they're part of our they're part of us.

459
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
We're happy.

460
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
We're happy to give them this opportunity.

461
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
But it's a fucking sham.

462
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,500
The worst part of that is they have they they bring the guy who's who's who's betting on zero.

463
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
The guy they follow they bring him in to have this like meeting with these people bringing the lawsuit against Herbalife.

464
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,500
All the people that got duped and then Herbalife hires a busload of people to counter protest them.

465
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,500
During this meeting there's tons of Latino people out there with signs saying how great Herbalife is.

466
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
And they've all been paid to do it to make it look as if these guys are all full of shit.

467
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
On that subject is Herbalife hiring because I could really use some money.

468
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
I would totally counter protest for money.

469
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I'm not that dedicated to this cause.

470
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,500
You know if you're going to say we're all we're all missing the important question here because we're all morally vacant.

471
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,500
We need to the question we need to ask is how do we make the PCP a pyramid scheme so we can all make tons of money.

472
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Clearly that's the question question here.

473
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I like I like where your head's at.

474
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I like where you're going.

475
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Well I'm actually the head of a pyramid scheme.

476
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
It's called it's called my patreon.

477
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
It's called patreon.com slash Louis Batten.

478
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,500
The way it works is you patron me and you give me money and then you get other people to join in and the patron.

479
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
And then they can replace the money you're giving me.

480
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
So you'll you'll be my patron without having to pay.

481
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
You just need to recruit people to do it for you.

482
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:33,500
And then everybody can go into my patron discord chat and they can say hey I got in here without paying.

483
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
And then everyone will be like like it'll be like fuck it's sick.

484
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:44,500
And then the people down the people they recruited are going to be scrambling to find people to pay for their segment for their portion of what they're you know.

485
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
The word is minimum guys.

486
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
This isn't quite a pyramid scheme.

487
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
It's a pretty far cry from it really.

488
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:00,500
But like I it's funny to me to think about the way patreon sort of works and that it incentivizes creators to like patron each other and then just recirculate money.

489
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Because the whole deal is like does it.

490
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Well yeah like there's there's a big culture of like ooh go out and patron everybody.

491
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Keep forwarding money to your creators.

492
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,500
But the thing is or to the creators that you like as an artist but the thing is every time that you patron anyone.

493
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Patreon takes their 10% or their 5% cut or whatever from the money that's being patron.

494
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:27,500
So if you if you if somebody patrons you a dollar and then you're like great or let's say $10 and then you decide to patron somebody $5 or something.

495
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Like and you're using the money that you're making to do that.

496
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Like you're just giving patreon the money and no more is actually getting to the creators.

497
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
You know you know what I'm saying.

498
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Like if you.

499
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Yeah.

500
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Patreon gets like double and triple dip on that because like it's the same $10 but they've taken their cut twice out of the same $10.

501
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I remember I remember seeing someone's patreon that was like he posted like inspirational quotes and writings and stuff.

502
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,500
But his model was like my model is like you patron me all patron you.

503
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
And in this way like like it boosts both of us.

504
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
But like yeah.

505
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Only the only person getting paid in that situation is patreon itself.

506
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Everyone else the money is just disappearing.

507
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Dupest thing I've ever heard.

508
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,500
I read this and I was like yeah okay this guy looks like he's fucking got it because he's got a pretty high patreon number going.

509
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
But he's giving that all back to the people.

510
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
But he's.

511
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Yeah.

512
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
It's a fucking sham.

513
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,500
That's why I make a point of not patroning people as a person who gets money from patreon.

514
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
I pay for you hippo.

515
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh that thanks.

516
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Because I love you.

517
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
And you deserve it.

518
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I just don't.

519
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Thanks.

520
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Oh no.

521
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
No.

522
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm going to back myself into a corner with all this praise.

523
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I don't know what to do.

524
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Okay.

525
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I'm with you though.

526
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I have never patroned anyone and will never because I would much rather just PayPal the money directly if I was inclined to do so.

527
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
That's true.

528
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Yeah.

529
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
PayPal is a better for that.

530
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Although for me to you it would it would still lose money because of the country difference.

531
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
That's true.

532
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,500
PayPal's recurring payment function is it would be a superior alternative to patreon but nobody wants to do it.

533
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Right.

534
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
And I kind of.

535
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,500
The masses need their centralized platform in order to make up for the fact that they have no brains.

536
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I don't really blame them.

537
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I mean.

538
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I just doesn't.

539
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
I mean it just doesn't have that.

540
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
I don't know.

541
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Like I can't put my finger on it but there's something more friendly about doing it through patreon.

542
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
There totally is because it's made for that.

543
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
There's a cultural zeitgeist.

544
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Yeah.

545
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
There's just a there's just a culture now of doing it.

546
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Objectively speaking the PayPal is better but patreon just is so much more like appealing.

547
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,500
I think what it is is that for PayPal you need to be given a link to and then type in stuff.

548
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,500
For patreon you go there and you have an account and you just press a button.

549
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Really.

550
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Yeah.

551
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Like it's it's it's.

552
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Although that is one of the downsides.

553
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
It's not that much simpler but it's simpler enough that people would do it over.

554
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,500
People would do it over PayPal and not to mention it's like a far more customizable thing.

555
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I'll tell you what PayPal needs to do.

556
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
PayPal needs to get in this game so I can stop giving patreon.

557
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,500
You know like I lose like a 10% cut of everything I made through the combination of like money

558
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,500
being transferred to like the like the like the credit card people who like process the

559
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
payments and stuff and then also patreon takes their 5% cut.

560
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
So like everybody loses 10% off that shit.

561
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
PayPal already has this technology built in for free.

562
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,500
They just need to work on their public image and they will now get all the traffic that patreon gets.

563
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
They just need they need a PR campaign to step their shit up.

564
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Elon Musk.

565
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
I actually know if you still works at PayPal or whatever but they need to get their shit together

566
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,500
and organize this and just make it so that they have a similar platform to what patreon does

567
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
with the like customization and the cute memes you can put and the little descriptions what not

568
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
and your your your campaign or whatever.

569
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
I think that's the end.

570
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I think that's the end.

571
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Patreon needs competition desperately.

572
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Absolutely.

573
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
I would welcome it from a corporate monolith like PayPal.

574
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
I kind of want them to fucking be squished.

575
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,500
It's funny because like they'd be squeezed to improve themselves.

576
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Because like PayPal is like a big company.

577
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
They're so like normal.

578
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Patreon has the edge of being like oh we're all into indie art guys.

579
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
We're in a spice art.

580
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Totally how they did it.

581
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
You come to patreon and everyone's like oh well I guess I will.

582
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,500
It's actually funny because like patreon actually killed the first site to do this because

583
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
patreon wasn't the first site to be said.

584
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Really?

585
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Yeah there was a site made by Hank Green called Subbable.

586
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
That's the one.

587
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
And they were running that for a while but the thing is they never got it out of like beta

588
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,500
or whatever because like only certain people could use it could join Subbable.

589
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Like you had to be chosen for it and they kept that up for like a year or something and patreon

590
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,500
just like fuck that we're gonna do what you did but let it be open for everybody and then

591
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
eventually.

592
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Well you know that's capitalist for you.

593
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
I was sad.

594
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
I was sad about that because I actually liked Subbable's model better.

595
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Yeah Subbable's model was way better.

596
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,500
It was the way that my patreon is set up where I give rewards based on total patronage not

597
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
on like monthly.

598
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,500
So like when you donated money to Subbable it like built up like your bank and then you

599
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,500
could spend the money in like lump sums to get rewards instead of like having like monthly

600
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
things.

601
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
So it was way better.

602
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
It was like a hundred dollars and you pledge five dollars a month.

603
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Once you pledge a hundred dollars total then you could unlock that reward and claim it.

604
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
That's good.

605
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
That's good.

606
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,500
So but they got killed because they didn't develop a site fast enough.

607
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,500
That's the market baby and I assume you guys know about the little bit of controversy that's

608
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
been going on about patreon demonetizing or you know shutting down the accounts.

609
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Now there's a lot of sides to that and we don't need to go into it too much but I was actually

610
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,500
pretty pretty pretty convinced by the arguments that Mr. Patreon man made in the in the video

611
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
that he made.

612
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
He did like an interview with Dave Rubin.

613
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
I did.

614
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,900
I did watch the interview that he did with Dave Rubin and it was it was I felt like I was

615
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,780
concerned by the fact that he just said like a lot of the situations like I don't know what

616
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
I would do.

617
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,780
I'm like dude you wrote the rules.

618
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
You're the guy.

619
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
You're the guy dude.

620
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,340
What who am I supposed to ask these questions to the thing is is though like people were

621
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,020
saying because like it was Lauren Southern who got demonetized and she's like a right

622
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,880
wing political commentator and people were like pissed off like this is a political thing.

623
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,980
But if you look at like the history of patreon like banning they've also banned like you

624
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,420
know anti-fog things and like left-wing stuff too.

625
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,460
So it is like they are sticking to their their their terms of service or whatever it is.

626
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,220
It still is like a bad precedent to say about this.

627
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,340
I have a thought about this.

628
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,420
I've been thinking about for a while and I only recently was able to to articulate it

629
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
clearly.

630
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
So let me tell you let me ask you guys what do you think about this.

631
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,100
So so common these days when someone is like let's just say like when when Sargon of Akkad

632
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,700
for example got kicked off of Twitter as it was recently you know like people good riddance

633
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
fair enough.

634
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
It doesn't matter how you feel about it.

635
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,700
But the point is as he's kicked off the people like his side of the argument says like oh

636
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,780
you know that's not fair.

637
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,460
This is shutting down free speech.

638
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,300
I mean not everybody's making that point and like he would acknowledge like Twitter's

639
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,300
a private company.

640
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
But that's the thing.

641
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,980
The other side would then say you know the leftists who are happy that he's gone.

642
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,780
No Twitter is a private company.

643
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,020
They can do whatever they want dude.

644
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
You just have to deal with it.

645
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
This is you know fuck off.

646
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,740
And so okay so that's a fair argument.

647
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,380
But here's what I'm wondering about that situation.

648
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,980
So as time goes on more and more these companies like Twitter are the ways that we actually

649
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,300
communicate in the real world.

650
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,860
Like this this is becoming like just the public marketplace as opposed to gathering in the

651
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
town square.

652
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,980
A better example for this is like Twitter is bad enough but like Google Google is super

653
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,380
politically motivated at this point.

654
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,300
And like that's been made clear Google essentially is a public utility at this point like you

655
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,820
can't function without using their services.

656
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,380
So like if not like legally from an ethical ethical standpoint they should be apolitical

657
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,700
and not mingle in that at all despite the fact that they're a private company.

658
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,300
Like there's like you know just recently when I watched the interview with Mr. Patron

659
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,020
man there were like he talked about how Patron exists to cultivate a certain culture and

660
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,500
you know he was big jack in his dick about like no we're creators we're the creators

661
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,580
place and like he was like so for example you cannot sponsor like a porn thing on Patron

662
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,100
like that's against our terms of service and I was like hang on I know people right

663
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,740
now who have Patrons that are about porn and are you know like that's what they do.

664
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,380
So where's the I didn't even think that was the case I think he just means like actual

665
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,500
pornography because you can like draw porn I think they're fine with that I'm pretty

666
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:23,540
sure I'm pretty sure I am aware of like like models and they're definitely cam girls and

667
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,220
stuff on Patreon for sure photographers and like you know erotic photography that is definitely

668
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,140
being funded through Patreon at least as far as I am aware I have definitely seen such

669
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,140
some people would argue there's a difference but I think that's bullshit I think like at

670
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:42,420
that point like there's no difference between porn and like like why just like Jessica

671
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,380
Negiri for example has a gigantic Patreon one of the biggest and I only watch her to

672
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,540
jack off that's what I do that's what her content is for so I don't know what other utility

673
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,100
it has so I like that seems like a clear case I don't know at least I just think it's dumb

674
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,820
to ban porn entirely I think I think it's it's as valid as anything else because that

675
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,780
would that's like I am just guessing but that's probably a huge amount of Patreons income is

676
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,500
like various porn things I'm sure I'm sure you know oh yeah like that girl who makes like

677
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,860
that you know this thing so Kimi Chad that's exactly what I'm thinking of yes her every

678
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,300
time I think about her I just want to kill myself she makes like 50 grand a month or

679
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,620
something it's like she makes she makes over six figures a year like easily well there's

680
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,860
a decent amount of paid okay but the point I want to get to about this was like yeah it's

681
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,100
basically this issue of like being it being treated as a public utility like right now

682
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,780
there's this whole thing about net neutrality going on right now and I actually don't know the

683
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,980
status of it right now I don't think anything's changed at the moment but but the point is

684
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,540
that like we're trying to make the internet be treated as like again a public utility like

685
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,500
the phones are so right now AT&T cannot say hey we heard that you were talking about big gay

686
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,380
dicks on the phone so we're shutting down your account because we are a good Christian company

687
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,060
and we don't want that shit on our fucking airwaves well actually you can't you can technically do

688
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:13,220
that I mean that's happening right now because uh is that so uh because in the aftermath of

689
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,300
Charlottesville and stuff like yeah you know the you ever heard the Daily Stormer it's like a

690
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,660
Nazi website they um they were reporting on that and like everyone got pissed off about Nazis

691
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,380
and so the the company that hosted the Daily Stormer pulled the site because they're like

692
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,460
we don't support this on our platform so they pulled the entire site even though they weren't

693
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,460
technically doing anything illegal they took it down and then they went to google to host it there

694
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,180
and google's like fuck you so now the site's gone and so that's yeah that that's a great example

695
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,900
that's exactly the same sort of issue here like that's that is a private hosting company deciding

696
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,700
we don't want to host it but then like for political reasons nobody wants to host it and so there's

697
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:56,500
a denial of service going on like it's censorship by by you know by virtue of what it is if nobody

698
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,300
question though is is this is this unfair or is this fair I don't know how we got here from

699
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,700
fucking pyramid schemes but here we are ladies and gentlemen I was I was just going to say we

700
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:11,460
ventured pretty far afield by now we have but I still want to get back at some point to turning

701
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,460
the pcp into a pyramid scheme it's a very important topic I think we can do it if we put our heads

702
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,820
together okay okay let's let's think about this all right well we just well you know we this

703
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,980
is the product joining the pcp I've got hang on I've got it everybody okay all right the product

704
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:34,100
that we're selling is podcasts on the pcp channel what we do is we outsource people like templates

705
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,260
of like images or maybe like the theme song or whatever we give them assets to make their own

706
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,540
podcast this sounds like react world I was just gonna say exactly that's that's where I'm going

707
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,180
with this and so we this is sort of a licensing deal for us we give them people that they make

708
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,060
their podcasts and then they make money on them but they have to pay us a royalty for the usage of

709
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,860
that shit and uh and then there you go that actually sounds like a great idea and I no longer hate

710
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,660
react world because I see that they were actually geniuses and we need to get in on it we need to

711
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,660
succeed where they failed agreed agreed they were visionaries we need to we need to corner the

712
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:20,420
market on actual literature literal pcp and add that we're starting a multi-level marketing

713
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:28,180
uh corporation um we need people on the streets the pcp is brought to you by pcp guys we've we've

714
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,340
this is embarrassing we've gotten away from our roots we need to get back to gallons of pcp

715
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:38,580
you know and whatnot think about it like this just just find five people to sell drugs for you

716
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,740
and each of them finds five people to sell drugs for them by the time that you go down

717
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,500
two two steps you're you're fucking walter white only you don't die at the end spoilers for breaking

718
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:55,780
back yes spoilers everything works out great for you forever there's no problems um all right well

719
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,100
i'm down where no just where where can we find drugs well we just gotta hit up my voice someone

721
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,780

722
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,180
them for the drugs we can't that that'll fuck it all obviously we're gonna start with we're gonna

723
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,060

804
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,380
biggest repeated phrase in mlm is like it's not a pyramid scheme pyramid schemes are illegal and

810
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,220
related to a pyramid scheme so i was at a football game and there were a bunch of cheerleaders and they

811
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,700
started climbing on each other's shoulders and it was it got more horrible it just they formed

812
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,340
this triangular shape right in front of me oh god i couldn't fucking deal with it yeah i what a

813
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:01,060
fucking scam there was there was a time scheme it wasn't it wasn't those crappy sluts i hate them

814
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,420
to make that pyramid that's for they were they had designs it wasn't a pyramid scheme per se but

815
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,740
there was another time that i got called by a company that wanted me to come and listen to a

816
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,660
pitch for a fucking time share you guys know about time shares a little bit you sort of you buy property

817
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,780
and then rent it to other people is the gist i think the idea is that you're renting a property but

818
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,900
you're renting it collectively with like other people so you're so you're paying rent on this

819
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,980
you're paying rent on this property but you're only paying for it for like you know like one

820
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,460
month out of the year or something like that so like you you make money from this or is it just for

821
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:44,980
your enjoyment no i think you're maybe supposed to i just i don't know i i really like to rent

822
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,300
that house i can't live in it but you know that'll be fun the pitch gotta be a money thing it's got

823
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,500
it's not no that for the person owning that property that sounds amazing because you can

824
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,980
definitely charge more than just regular rent yeah adventure you get it from 12 different people

825
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,460
you're like making twice normal rent on the property you own oh my god people with money

826
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,140
are so privileged i hate them all people with money are so dumb what are they doing the pitch for

827
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,580
time shares is like uh like imagine being able to say i've got a little place in the swiss Alps

828
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,900
because like for one month out of the year so you can go on like holiday for one month and

829
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,780
just lie or whatever just i guess it makes you can just lie you can just lie yeah oh yeah you

830
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:28,020
don't have to buy it to say that nobody said yeah but i got fly to the fucking swiss Alps no

831
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,340
i'm just gonna but i got but i got called by a timeshare company and like they were they gave

832
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,340
me this song and dance about like oh we've got a big opportunity for you and at some point i

833
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,540
realized it was a timeshare it was so i was like i was wise so they were like so will will you be

834
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:47,460
attending and i was like i'm gonna fuck these guys and i was like yeah reserve that chair for

835
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:53,780
you guys make make sure nobody make sure not to extend this invitation to anyone else i'm gonna

836
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,300
be there but i think monster but i think they knew master puppeteer you no i think they could

837
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,500
tell from my tone because the lake because my tone changed and the ladies started being like um so

838
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,340
and i was like yep i'm gonna be there i'm good because i went from i went from skeptical to

839
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,980
like full-on enthusiasm and i think she knew something was off right but i did my but i did

840
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:23,300
my best i i own an entire tectonic plate guys come visit for one for in the middle of the

841
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:30,100
pacific ocean for one sixteenth of a second out of each year i own the continent of australia

842
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:36,980
yes excellent you're the king all right let's uh let's go to our questions everybody let's

843
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:43,700
okay here we go um uh the okay here's here's one that i don't understand why it's here at

844
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:53,060
meaty learner 509 asks on average how many times does this guy ever say sorry okay on average how

845
00:46:53,060 --> 00:47:00,820
many times per day does best guy ever say haha well all right that's pretty pretty much constantly

846
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:07,460
i don't do i say that is that like a um you just said it right now that's true it definitely

847
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:13,540
sounds like the kind of thing you say it's the number of haze is very specific yeah only two you

848
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,460
can't have more than that uh i would give it 20 20 times per day that seems reasonable uh oh is

849
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,380
somebody checking the uh the the patron one for questions oh these are from the twitter obviously

850
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:29,380
i actually see a good one here from our at our at underscore who asks what the fuck constitutes a

851
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,980
good question hey that is an excellent question that we so there you go just be like just ask

852
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,860
this question and uh you're safe yep there you go that's the answer to that one um a good a good

853
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:48,740
question uh is not some meme shit like a good question like actually demands some like discussion

854
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:54,740
to come to an answer uh a good a good question is something that like one or more of us is

855
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:01,460
actually interested in addressing yeah and also uh nothing ever to do with favorites yeah

856
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,860
basically basically a good question is a question that we couldn't answer on twitter itself it has

857
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,420
to be more than 140 characters requiring the answer so we can actually get into it and actually think

858
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:18,500
a little bit as opposed to just being like what's your favorite anime that's yeah that's i got to

859
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:23,780
say that what's your favorite anime is the worst question it is the worst question that you can

860
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,540
possibly ask uh like a lot of people ask questions that are like the meme that currently makes them

861
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:35,060
giggle let's ask about that's like i mean someone tweeted here like death grips is online like i

862
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,460
know that's a meme going on right now and i know death grips are cool and all uh i guess that was

863
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,820
a little bit better because it is kind of like a but what are but what are we supposed to what are

864
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,860
we supposed to say about that exactly that's what makes it a yeah if the punchline is the question

865
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,220
instead of the answer then you fucked up yeah i would say that's fair but then again there was

866
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,140
exceptions to everything so if you just have like a genius idea then shoot it out but you know

867
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:01,540
you'd see it better be a genius or i'm gonna skip fucking it you can take that risk if you want but

868
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:08,100
you you risk public ridicule for everyone to hear so indeed step forward brave so well here here's a

869
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,620
kind of a question by fado on the fado on the patreon lounge uh is there a difference between

870
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:20,820
favorite and best absolutely uh no some people say there isn't but i've always disagreed with that

871
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:26,900
i think that if you wait i i feel like deja vu i feel like i argued this a long time ago vehemently

872
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,820
and was furious about it for weeks i think that's true i think but i don't remember when but my

873
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:37,620
position my position on this is that if you think something if something is your favorite that means

874
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:44,900
that to you it is the best so like to to to be like oh well this thing is my like i like to me

875
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,100
this is the best but like i really it's not the best like the best is this other thing because

876
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,660
other people see it this way like that's bullshit like that's just being fucking dishonest is that

877
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,180
true across all categories yeah i think so i don't think it's a true across categories well dealing

878
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,500
with like uh like um observable facts and figures and stuff like okay which is yeah if you're talking

879
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,660
about if you're talking about like i don't know some medicine or something and maybe like some medicine

880
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,540
in like 90 of cases has no adverse side effects and is great but to you it has adverse side effects

881
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,780
like sure you can be like yeah like well this doesn't work for me like like to me this other

882
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,020
medicine is better but in but okay but if we're talking if we're talking about statistical stuff

883
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,460
we're talking about art but if we're talking about art and opinions i think it's really

884
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,820
disingenuous to be like this one's my favorite but i think this one is better but not for me

885
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:38,020
like whatever i agree with ben on this with with regards to art i feel like there's no

886
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:44,740
like like think of it think of an example where it would not sound weird like who are you to

887
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:50,180
who are you to speak on behalf of the general population no you can only speak for yourself

888
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,660
on these matters you can okay like uh if there's a show that you like because you were a kid and

889
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,500
you really liked it so you have like a personal attachment to it but as you've got older like

890
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:04,340
for me the bible black english dub is horrendous but i love it it's like my favorite thing in the

891
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:10,180
world uh uh it's like it's like the best dub ever to me even though there are dubs like i don't know

892
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,660
bakano or whatever they're like technically wonderful but like i like the bible black dub

893
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,700
because it's so fucked up and retarded like it's clear which of those is better but i like the

894
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,500
bible black one because it's got this you know special thing that i like about it what about

895
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:32,420
that business well i mean it's one thing to recognize that more people like another thing

896
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:38,900
than than your favorite thing but like what's the point of being like okay well well this one's

897
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,020
my favorite but this other one that other people like that one's technically better like what's the

898
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,100
fucking point we have to define the word best we have to define the word best personal preference

899
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,660
those are two different things i think i think instead of saying your favorite yeah yeah those

900
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:57,060
are those are two different things but like why would you use why would you so you you got to

901
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,820
fucking specify okay hang on all right yeah what are you saying i think the way it should be is that

902
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,860
because like a lot of people us included say oh man that's the best thing i've ever seen

903
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,420
we don't actually mean like best we're not thinking of it like that we're just saying i really really

904
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:19,380
like it right it's um so i feel like if you're talking if you're going to say uh this is what's

905
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,660
considered the best you just say this is the consensus masterpiece this is consensus favorite

906
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,500
and but this one's the best this because you're trying to convince people usually

907
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,060
yeah i feel like i feel like best and favorite are interchangeable

908
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,780
i see i think we all understand what the word favorite means it's just like the thing that

909
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,900
you get the most enjoyment out of you like the most if we're just talking about art you know

910
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,820
as one subcategory but i think we need to define the word best i think that's

911
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,580
entirely where the problem lies in this discussion so what do we actually mean when

912
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:54,020
we say best here like the one that the most people like yeah me uh but is the one that

913
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,900
the most people like as in it's like it's got the on average highest score or is it the most

914
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,060
technically provisioned i think the scientists would say this is the most perfectly perfect

915
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,940
thing i think the best would be technical proficiency okay you know like this is the best

916
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,860
art like the most like technically proficient whatever yeah this is my favorite style there's

917
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:18,180
like there's like tears there's like very obvious tears um within which there's like very you know

918
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,260
like there's the stuff that's like really well done but it's uh what's the best it comes a lot

919
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,100
down to personal preference and then this thing whoa you said what's the best comes to personal

920
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,780
preference but isn't best some sort of objective all right i'm saying oh lord okay what i'm saying

921
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:38,340
is what i'm saying is there are say video games there are games that are just broken and don't

922
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:44,020
work and nobody likes them and uh then there are games that are you know really really good

923
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:49,700
but nobody not a single like there's no consensus on what is the best so the word best is kind of

924
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,980
meaningless and it's interchangeable with favorite when you're saying like what's the best of a series

925
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:01,060
of games that are all brilliant like nobody will ever agree so best and favorite will be interchangeable

926
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,100
in that situation but if you're comparing like okay um something that just doesn't work with

927
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:11,780
something that is really good then there is a clear usage of well this is better i guess i guess my

928
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,980
my perspective on it has always been that the best is referring to technical measurable

929
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:23,220
quant like aspects of a work and favorite is just like emotional like how you feel i think

930
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,060
that's something that makes sense i don't i don't think it makes sense to judge

931
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,380
our based on technical proficiency use best as a substitute for favorite but i think that the

932
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:38,580
way it is is like the the the closer you get to the um the the mythical best thing um the less

933
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:44,100
useful the word best becomes because people stop agreeing with each other i think i think using

934
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,780
the word best to describe an opinion is worthless because it doesn't mean anything but if you're

935
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,700
talking about best in terms of a quantifiable aspect it totally makes sense and and how do we

936
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,020
deal with the issue of ironic enjoyment of things like my bible black dub that's like my favorite

937
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,420
like i like that basically ironically it was not intended to be good but it is good and like the

938
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,900
room and shit like that's a whole like best versus favorites when you consider that shit like those

939
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,340
are on the opposite side of the spectrum people people still use the word best when they say oh

940
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,300
it's the best worst thing ever i would say the room is like but but if i like the room is like

941
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:18,420
my favorite movie which it is one of and i then like it totally would not be even close to like

942
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:24,020
the best movie ever made but it is among my favorites i think like how do you get that i think

943
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,420
that even if you're enjoying something ironically if you're getting the most enjoyment out of it out

944
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:33,620
of all the things then yeah it's your it should be your favorite thing so even if it like accidentally

945
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,180
became entertaining it good like the room then like it still it still is what it is and you can

946
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:44,020
judge it by like i really really think that it all just comes down to how much enjoyment do i get

947
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,100
out of this thing and like looking at it from like oh well what's technically the best what's

948
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:53,220
done what's most popular i think those things are like i don't see the point in evaluating a works

949
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:59,220
when somebody when somebody has uh like when somebody has a best and they say it's the best

950
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,060
technically i i don't feel anything from their recommendation because it's not their favorite

951
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:12,100
i i think what what it comes down to is that the the technical best is kind of useless for me

952
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:19,060
because i don't get the sense that like i don't know what they mean i don't know it's it's it's

953
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:26,260
hard to explain i had a point i think i see what you're saying yeah like yeah best if you're if

954
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,100
you're talking about art what's the point of knowing which is the best wouldn't you rather

955
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:35,060
know someone's favorite because like that's the one they actually liked more so you know what

956
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,220
who fucking cares what's the best art i mean i see where that's coming from i just i just don't

957
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,020
think the word makes any sense if it doesn't yeah what tom was saying it means and it's like some

958
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,500
sort of yeah but the thing is people people just use it like that i think i think people

959
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,020
use the word best incorrectly all the time because i don't think the best talks about

960
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:56,580
subjective opinion i mean eventually best is going to mean favorite because of the way people

961
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,580
are continually using it wrong right because basically the moral of the story is everyone's

962
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,500
fucking retarded except for us the moral of the story to me is that language is way too fucking

963
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,180
imprecise and it's incredibly frustrating because the whole point of our argument here

964
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:13,060
is that we don't agree on what the words mean and if we did this is why this is why language

965
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:20,420
has to be replaced with hip thrusts and funny poses that's the only real language whoa funny

966
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:28,740
poses is that a jojo reference dude what the fuck is that it's a meme i don't know i was thinking

967
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:35,540
i don't get it it's people people will get it they'll give you force um oh those are good

968
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,780
those are good guys would you want to pick another question i think that's all right i

969
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:44,420
forgot i think i think we've run this one into the ground ladies and gentlemen that's an example

970
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:50,420
of a good question yeah it was yeah that was insights debate because it's like who couldn't

971
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,860
who couldn't know the truth hey here's a question from at on twitter at lamp pros from g r yeah okay

972
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:05,220
asks uh do you like horror films if yes any expectations for the upcoming movie it i do

973
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:14,020
not really like it sucks so uh yeah no i just wanted to say it sucks oh make a video with

974
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,300
as the title it's not out yet so uh i think it is i will believe it a couple people i follow on

975
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:24,260
twitter saw it and they said it was amazing oh okay okay well it was amazing did they huh they

976
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:29,060
said it was like any the general consensus from what i can tell us that's the best even king adaptation

977
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:36,180
are you i just saw the dark tower dude and that was a 10 out of 10 i didn't actually see it uh

978
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:44,260
i have no i don't care about horror really it scares me i'm not a horror fan at all it's either

979
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:50,340
scary or boring oh okay well dude that's the thing okay so i i hated horror for a million years until

980
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:56,580
i played silent hill two and three and now i have found myself well games are different games are

981
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:03,140
different because uh like i love resident evil one on playstation uh i haven't played any other

982
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,500
versions uh you know i i'm sure it is but like it's it's just like the fact that i can i haven't

983
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,820
played resident evil nothing will happen unless you said better and i'm just arguing that best

984
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:19,220
and better only means technical things you fucking pass it you fool uh like like like

985
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,420
the thing with a game a horror game is uh it's all down to you you have to push forward

986
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:28,660
it's sort of like like like like in a movie when somebody when somebody's about to open a thing

987
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,740
and you and you tense up and you say no don't go in there you are the guy who is not going to go

988
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:37,220
in there but you have to do it to complete it's like the tension is so much higher because you

989
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:42,180
have to do it oh right it is yeah all right right that's why silent hill is so fucking

990
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,420
super works way better in games than it does in movies for sure you know because then it's

991
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,820
it's about you it's happening to you i just watched um it follows the other day which i

992
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,260
thought was it was like more artsy than it was like horrific though it was pretty scary um yeah i

993
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,260
think after i play sound hill like i do have more of a taste for them and i i'm enjoying the more

994
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,500
i i said before that i don't like horror movies but not too long ago i watched one called creep

995
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:11,620
have any of you seen it no no it creep it it's it's it's really great it's really fucking great

996
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:18,420
it's not there's it's not some like ghost some ghost story bullshit um it's not there's there's

997
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,620
jump scares but like they are there for a reason and they make sense in the fiction why there would

998
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:29,300
be a jump scare okay and it's it's it's really unlike any other horror movie i've seen before and

999
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:35,460
it's really fucking good and it's like it's like funny too like like this like the situation is

1000
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:41,700
scary intense but it's also kind of like funny and absurd in a way how old is this film uh not

1001
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,340
less than a decade i think like it's not okay it's not recent but it's not old either at least i

1002
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:52,660
don't think so yeah i i highly recommend uh creep so um yeah but that doesn't say anything about it

1003
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:57,380
i don't care about it i'm not gonna see it oh i right i forgot about it um i i had recently

1004
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:03,060
watched actually the the entire old like adaptation of the of the old uh you know it adaptation or

1005
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:08,500
whatever that had uh tim curry and shit and uh i i quite liked that even though it's been

1006
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:13,300
memed on a lot with the the balloons and the clowns and you know all that crazy shit i quite

1007
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:18,580
like that and uh i was definitely not i mean i'm sure it was in the camp of most people thinking

1008
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:23,780
like i mean i i'm well known to hate uh uh remakes and shit and that's what this is so

1009
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,740
can't say i was really looking forward to it but i am sort of interested to see because i just like

1010
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:33,700
horror movies now and uh i don't know like this guy looks kind of cool and i'm just curious to see

1011
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,700
if it does well and whoever just said that it's been getting good reviews like that's the first

1012
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,660
i've heard of its actual quality so i probably will go see it and uh yeah yeah i'm kind of excited to

1013
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:48,340
see it i just i just hate being afraid because i'm constantly afraid of my own inevitable demise

1014
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:53,620
so i don't need to add to that fear so i i agree generally the feeling of being spooked is not a

1015
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,980
pleasant one that i don't know not at all it's creep didn't spook me well i guess it kind of i

1016
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:04,900
don't know it i i didn't mind the feeling it gave me i like i like the feeling of being spooked

1017
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:10,340
where my retarded reaction can entertain other people like my blood like i used to play resident

1018
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:16,420
evil uh with my brother in the room and you know he would just look at me going ah because he was

1019
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:20,180
for some reason like like better at dealing with it and it was just it was just like the

1020
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,820
dogs burst through the window and every single time i jumped and i screamed and it was hilarious

1021
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:28,500
and i like the fact that that was funny and then it was like a really it was really nice after

1022
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,340
we were like oh phew are you are you picking another question name no no no just i have a

1023
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:38,020
question about this topic and it was just where horror films invented to to to force teenagers

1024
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:43,300
to sex each other is that what they you know you know what i'm saying do you mean to force them

1025
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,780
to sex each other in the films or to force them to sex each other in the theaters in the theater in

1026
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:52,660
the theaters is this a breeding scheme you know to make them spooked and i don't think they were

1027
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:58,500
invented for that but they've been co-opted by teenagers and we need to we need to take them back

1028
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:03,460
because we need to wage war i agree they have which would you not agree i mean i've only watched a

1029
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,380
few horror films is not my thing but would you not agree that the pg-13 rating is the kiss of death

1030
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:14,420
for a horror film um enough to say but it seems that way let me let me look and see what creep was

1031
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:20,580
rated you know i actually i just downloaded um uh what's the one about uh uh god i don't want to

1032
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:25,220
say but the one about the black people that came out recently you know i'm talking about uh get out

1033
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:30,740
the family get out get out i swear guys it's it's just that's the distinguishing characteristic

1034
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:35,700
for the film um but yeah like i downloaded that and i've been wanting to watch it but then i think

1035
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,820
back to my experience when i'm watching um uh when i when i was watching uh uh fuck is that

1036
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:46,020
is it it follows yeah it was it follows and like so that movie was good but then i remember the

1037
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:51,460
moment to moment experience of watching it as i'm like wanting to die because like okay so the the

1038
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,740
scary thing in that movie is like there is a creature it or whatever that just it follows you

1039
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:02,180
but it walks very slowly but the thing is it can take on the appearance of anyone at any time

1040
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,060
so like in a crowd it could be any of the people there uh and you get it by like having sex with

1041
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:12,820
someone who's like it's following currently it doesn't matter but like oh the spooks oh the spooks

1042
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,500
really got to me it was uh oh it was painful like that's like the pain of watching but it's the release

1043
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,980
that comes when you get like you get through it and you're okay and you can reflect on it that

1044
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:28,420
feels that feels good i like that creep creep is rated r although i think it pretty easily could

1045
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:35,940
have been a pg 13 so i had dude what if because you were saying about ratings i just had this idea

1046
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:41,780
what if just like spicy curries and stuff the the spooky things would have a rating system

1047
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:47,860
instead of scoville units or whatever it is it'll be like spookville units and how it is

1048
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,180
will be denominated by little little ghost emojis next to the thing and if it's got five

1049
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:59,860
either change you want to see in the world dude lal i i i would like that it's like it's

1050
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:05,220
oh it's only got two two ghosts on that on the spookville rating that's not scary enough for me

1051
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,260
uh that that's good uh well we're basically out of questions on the twitter we got any
