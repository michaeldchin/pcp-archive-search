00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,920
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,000
guy ever, and today we've got a full box of chocolates, including Hippocrit.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello, I am a parrot with a cowboy hat. That's what I am.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank y'all for coming. Ben Saint is here.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, I also am a parrot with a cowboy hat.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank y'all for coming. Munchy's here.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They finally did. The government wranglers that have made me, the government scientists have put a shock on me, and if I raise my voice above one decimal, they will shock me and kill me. So get ready for quiet Munchy this episode.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank y'all for coming, and Mage is here as well.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you a parrot with a cowboy hat, Munchy?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank all y'all for coming today.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I cannot believe you guys. Oh my God.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, there it is. We stole this hilarious joke from Mage. We got things to say. Let's just jump into it. Who wants to start off? We've got enough business to attend to.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to start with a light topic. Disabled people. I want to go jumpin' right in the deep end.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Disabled people. I'm talking about down syndrome. I'm talking about heavily autistic and physical. They can't move their legs. They can't move their head. They can't move their eyeballs.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Can't move their brains.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can't move their brains. Can't move those cogs in those gears. And that's what I have as a topic, because I guess two weeks ago now, I was at the camp, which I briefly mentioned, and the camp was a goonery, which you can look up.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It was a goonery? Like a place where goons caught?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, no, no, no, no.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's what it sounds like.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's what it sounds like.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It wouldn't sound like a concentration camp.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes. It is spelled with an A at the beginning, which is why it sounds like a goonery, but it's just one word. A goonery.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can look it up. It's a thing. They do it in Australia. They do it in Indonesia. It's a scout camp.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It is a scout camp for disabled people, usually like children and young adults.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A-G-O-O-N-O-R-E-E?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Just Google it. I think that's right.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, yeah, I found it. I don't know Wikipedia.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And we do one in the London area, and I was at it. And the idea is that I am a volunteer at that camp, and I help people in the patrol who are disabled get along and have fun and have fun because it's a thing.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's basically a respite for the parents of the people who like a whole week camp where they get to have fun and do activities and stuff, but obviously they're disabled, they need a lot of volunteer help to come and wrangle them.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can I wrangle them? Can I read the bizarre history of the name?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Down in Wikipedia, in 1949, Netherlands scouts organized an international camp at Lunteren for scouts with disabilities called agoon.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,000
After the Greek language word agon, meaning a gathering or competition, and then the success of those events prompted the establishment of the agoonery, which is a compound of agoon plus jamboree.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's so weird.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's got all those things.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Which a jamboree is already a gathering, so it's like a gathering gathering.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A classically educated, like soccer.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But you know, I mean, I'm sure that jamboree doesn't have a Greek root, so they're mixing their minerals, which is animalogically frowned upon.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I imagine like with the little, how do you call those little string instruments that like...

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Banjo?

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes. It has to have a banjo, and otherwise it's not a jamboree.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There was a campfire song thing where we sang old scouty campfire songs, and I was there playing the guitar because I can do that.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Cool.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But the point is not scouting, because I don't really know anything about scouting.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My experience of scouting is exclusively this, and we don't really do all the rigid like badge things.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have like a scarf and a woggle.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I got my Hitler Youth badge.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We got a scout scarf and a woggle and a logo and a style and a flag, and we have like inspections of the tents.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What's a woggle?

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's the little plastic or leather thing you put around your scout scarf to keep it in place.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I thought a woggle was like what roosters have, right?

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, this is a woggle.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
W-O-G-G-L-E, I think.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Woggle.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Anyway.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was pretty into the ceremony aspect, like the honors and the badges and all the Nazi shit.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That was the way, and that was what I was in it for.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The cultist enterprising, all the cult shit, killing lambs in the forest.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The summoning of spirits, the entities.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We don't do much of all that ceremony stuff, because it's hard to keep some of their attention, because they're like, you gotta dangle things in front of their face.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But that's the topic, disabilities, not scouting.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What do you all think about disabilities?

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, I like them. I'm in favor of them.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
As many as possible, please.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm making more every single day of my life. I'm going out with my bat, and I'm making as many disabled as I can.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I know I've talked about this before. Ben and I, our mom, was actually just retired.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's right.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Permanently.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So she's all done.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Congrats, mom.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, congrats to her.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So she was a special education teacher for like 20, 30 years or something.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's what she studied in college and all that stuff.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And like, the way she described it was like, these are just kids.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Because she worked with middle schoolers mostly in a little bit of like high schoolers and some elementary school stuff.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But mostly like middle school age.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She'd be like, yeah, these are kids. They need a little extra help.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They're trying to just get by day to day. They're just like anybody else with their wants and needs.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They just need extra help to get stuff done.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And so she just tried to describe it in very normalizing terms.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This was never effective on me.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And every time she told me about her students,

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was engulfed with a massive crippling depression at just the injustice of people who were born with disabilities of any kind.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And this is a problem with me that I have known for a long time.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I need to get over that and be like my mom and just accept the fact that some people are differently able.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mom was never judgmental about it, obviously.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But like it's so hard. It was so hard to hear her talk about her kids, her school kids.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And like these are kids who they got no chance. They got no fucking chance, right?

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's the problem, right? It's because my whole worldview is so based on like productivity and what you'll be able to achieve with your life.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And like needless to say, these people are quite limited in much of what they're going to be able to do through no fault of their own.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And so I'm left with no recourse but to conclude that these are subhumans who need to be purged.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, I'm just kidding. That's not exaggeration.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
My angle on this is that I went to that camp and sometimes I don't like it.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But the part that I do like in the end is like the being helpful and the helping them and being like a person that they enjoy being around.

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because I'm good at keeping them entertained and being like a good boy for them.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And you know, for some of them...

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Those good boy points.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Sometimes it's a bit more like...

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thanks, Lord. Love that wisdom.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sometimes it's a bit more hands-on than some others.

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like changing diapers hands-on, that sort of thing.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait, really?

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Christ.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In my patrol this year, there was only one who needed like a toilet assistance.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And usually have to go with two people for health and safety reasons.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I never actually did the wiping, thank fuck for that.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But I did have to put on the rubber gloves and to like help him get showered a couple times.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's like, there's all that stuff.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But...

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm just curious, what was the nature of his disability in this?

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, he was...

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't really know the names of the disabilities, but he could, you know, he was engaged by a lot of things.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He could walk if he wanted to, but he had like weak legs.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And he enjoyed coloring.

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's sort of mentally disabled in that he can't really talk.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And he's...

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He learned like an...

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He made up sign language.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is one of those guys who...

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can't really teach him things and he just sort of knows what he likes and he gets excited when he's excited.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But he won't be able to really tell you except for a few basic things like toilet or food.

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Like, I'm hungry.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Juice, please.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Like, you'll point to things if you want some.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I feel it right now.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I feel the sadness welling up inside me.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can feel it.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But like, it's...

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Like, I feel good being helpful.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And I don't know whether that's a good thing.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because obviously...

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why did that be a bad thing?

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's...

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, it's...

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I mean...

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There is a reason.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's the...

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's the, you know, I'm gaining like happy points from the misfortune of others.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Not like I'm like...

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're happy because you can be abuse of help and you make the life of him easier.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But here's the thing.

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I only do that once a year for one week.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then they go back to their parents and their parents have to deal with them for the rest of their lives.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like these parents.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're being like a helper tourist here.

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm just sort of like dipping my toe in and being like, yeah, it feels great to help people.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But if I had to look after like...

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Leaves immediately afterward.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Like if I had to look after a person like properly, like if I had a son and he had a disability,

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I wouldn't be able to like, you know, bring him out behind the shed and get rid of him.

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I would have to keep him alive because I'm human.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't do that.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't murder people.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, geez.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I'm gonna have to deal with it for the rest of my life.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I don't know whether I'd actually be able to do that.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, think about it.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's like this...

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a moral quandary.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You give those parents a break.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It is.

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I mean, I know that it is a good thing.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But like morally, like I think of myself as like, yes, I like disabled people or like,

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I like helping them and I like the feeling of doing the volunteer work, but like...

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you feel...

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Such a small amount.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you feel overly privileged to not have to do it all the time like these parents do?

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Like you don't...

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, like an actual care worker.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's unbelievable.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I mean, it's not as though you are happy every moment of the day.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Think about how you have helped these kids once during the year.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I assume that you feel the happiest when you are actively doing it.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I feel like what's the harm in that?

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you're actually doing something presently, then you should feel good about it.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, you know...

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you think about it like biologically, it's...

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think it's more like you have accomplished a task and now you're getting rewarded by

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
your body by getting like, you know, the happy hormones or whatever being sent to your head.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's okay, but isn't your clan or group...

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't really mean to say like, my enjoyment is a bad thing.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It just...

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like every so often I feel...

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You feel...

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I feel like I am not like thinking of it correctly.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's normal, but I understand you as well.

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's normal.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Famously, Christopher Hitchens was a big critic of Mother Teresa specifically.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And the reason for this was because he believed that Mother Teresa was actually a bad person

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
who loved going down and dwelling in the shit.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And that she actually went out of her way to kind of create more suffering in the world

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
so that she would be able to go there and feel like a saint who was fixing it or whatever.

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I've read quotes from her that suggest that she thinks that human suffering is a good thing

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in the grand scheme of things.

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have not looked into this in any great extent, but that's the sentiment behind it, which is interesting.

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But Hippo's not going around like me with his baseball bat full of nails cracking these people's skulls down.

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Wait, on the subject of quotes...

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a different kind of sin.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
On the subject of quotes, I learned not too long ago from a channel called Knowing Better.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I know that guy. I subscribed to that guy.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I subscribed to him too, just recently.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh my god, on youtube.com? Wow, I've been there.

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I had heard the quote from Winston Churchill saying something about using gas weapons on native tribes

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and saying that he was in favor of it because it would spread a lively terror.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And it's supposed to pain him as a terrible person.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, that's war for you.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But the full quote, he's saying we should use them on native peoples because they would spread a lively terror

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
which would have psychological effects, which would make physically harming them less necessary

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and would probably prevent more of them from dying, is what that quote is actually saying.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, that's just the fucked up thing about how you can manipulate quotes.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
People misquote that to pain him like he loved hurting native people.

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's like the exact opposite was the point.

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
People hear what they want to hear with that stuff.

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I guess I was inspired by the wrong thing.

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I was inspired by the wrong part of that quote.

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I thought I should kill native people.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, no. He just wanted you to gas them and make them afraid.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This one is already half dead, so I'll just finish him off right now.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll do better next time.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A little gas thing goes a long way, as the saying goes.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Exactly.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't fully understand where...

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Frankly, Hitler would have been the good guy if he just gassed a couple of Jews.

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We would have been like, yeah, this makes sense.

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Just spread a lively terror. He wouldn't have had to do the rest.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't fully understand where the sadness comes from, Hippo.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If it's not from you enjoying it, are you feel guilty that you are not doing more

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and you are getting any pleasure from it whatsoever?

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
In a way, I am because I used to be a bit high and mighty.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I remember Nate saying, oh, yeah, disabilities make me feel sad.

246
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That doesn't make me feel sad because I help them and I know more about it than you.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I wasn't lauding it over him, but it was that sort of like...

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I live in England, it's true.

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We had a whole PCP talk about...

250
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I live in Sin.

251
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, we did.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What do you call it? Something...

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Was it crying?

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, no, no.

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The one where you go around telling people you're so great, but you're not actually...

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Was that when it was like childhood?

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, there was a topic about the concept of doing good things just for the sake of being a positive outlook.

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Having a good reputation.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Philanthropy or something like that?

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know. It's the one that had the second thumbnail of a guy up in the mounds with his arm spread.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, Virtue Signaling.

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Virtue Signaling.

263
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Virtue, that's the one.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That was one that triggered you guys.

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, because I made that thumbnail so I remembered it.

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I was looking at the thumbnails just...

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I was looking at the thumbnails because the other day I made a playlist of every video I've ever been in.

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There were like 450 of them.

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I noticed, Ben, this was actually funny to me. This is a total aside.

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But I noticed that you included all the T-Bap videos in that.

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What I did strategically was I put...

272
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And like Digi's is every video Digi's ever been in.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I put a every video best guy ever has ever been in.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And of course, Keg's standard was in T-Bap.

275
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know who that guy is.

276
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Best guy ever over here.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He started with, you know, video one best guy ever.

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
A hundred fangirls just realized that you are Keg and Phantom.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
A hundred fangirls just realized that just now.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, no!

281
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
A new wave.

282
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Every time you mention it.

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll never do that.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Keep it under wraps, listeners.

285
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, please. Don't let our enemies find out.

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Hippo, I mean, all I can say is that you are helping these people.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You may not be doing it as much as the parents,

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
but like, it doesn't mean you aren't doing it at all.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And I'm sure that this camp is a rigorous thing that is not just like a normal day at, you know, the house.

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Not saying that you're better than the parents,

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
but it's not like you should torture yourself and think that you aren't cool

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
for helping these people even a little bit out of their life.

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I suppose. It's just, I'm wary of like, maybe unnecessarily so.

294
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm wary of like, giving myself points, like life points.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like, yeah, I do that.

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And I've done it for like, I think eight years now in a row, which is pretty cool.

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I mean, it's an objectively good thing to do, to just volunteer your time to help people.

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think I am a bad person for liking that I do it.

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If you went out and poisoned women's babies, like in the womb,

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
so they would have disabilities, such that you can take care of them,

301
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
then we'd be having a different conversation.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But like, I just like to intellectually...

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And once you've been going about it all wrong, your way is inefficient.

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, that's true.

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I just like to intellectually, like, criticize a lot.

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It reminds me of...

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Shit, I was just thinking of somebody...

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Reminds me of this one-piece character, dot, dot, dot.

309
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes. Yes.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't think there's, I'm trying to think of there's a one-piece character who exists.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Was there any one-piece characters who were like, were virtue signalers?

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't think of any. No, it's not that kind of series.

313
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Wait, wait, well, what about Full Body?

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It was kind of...

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't know, like, he was just trying to impress some bitch.

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, surely there were some...

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I mean, what about Crocodile?

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Crocodile, like, pretended was like a hero of the people, right?

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You know, that is a different sort of thing, but he did pretend to be a hero,

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
but was actually attempting to, like...

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He was the criminal trying to overthrow the entire government

322
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and make the king look bad, who was not bad, who was good.

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think he could probably make a strong case that Crocodile was a heavy virtue signaler.

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay, fair enough.

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You knew when you said that, that it would actually turn into a conversation.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hippo.

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Were you a teacher of some sort, or were you just a general, like, counselor?

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Like, what was your position within this camp?

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, okay, well, there's...

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Master of Executions.

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Master at Arms.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Madam Legality at Wrangler.

334
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
In charge of the weaponry.

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes, surgeon.

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a patrol...

337
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's, like, a number of patrols.

338
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's, like, the kitchen, and the staff that do the entertainment.

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Also known as the Ents.

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I am...

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Big tree guys.

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, there's patrol leaders, two of them, and then there's patrol helpers.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And I'm just a patrol helper.

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If I had, like, more scouting experience, or just experience in general,

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I would be picked randomly one year for patrol leader,

346
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and then I would be, like, in charge of the thing.

347
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So you're, like, a brown shirt, hoping to break into the SS.

348
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, I'm not really hoping to break into a patrol leader,

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
because that sounds like, oh, God, I gotta be responsible.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like, all I'd really do is that I keep them entertained as best I can.

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Like, I hang around the places.

352
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, when there's downtime, they're in the patrol tent,

353
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
or they're just walking off wherever they like in the area, in the field.

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And, like, when there's an event, like, there was, like, a zombie day

355
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
where there was, like, a dressing up box, and we had to go get the dressing up stuff.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I, you know, helped them pick things and tried it on,

357
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and they were all happy and stuff.

358
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And it was, you know, nothing big.

359
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Whenever there's food, I go with one of them.

360
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Like, they enjoy helping as well.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They see how fun, like, how cool it is to be a helper,

362
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and they want to help, and it's quite key.

363
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So, you know, I get the food.

364
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You feed them sometimes with a spoon,

365
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
but in mice, in this case, all of the scouts could feed themselves.

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So, I just needed to give them the plates.

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, it was really quite chill this year.

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Some years, it's, like, there's one guy or two guys that are, like, a real handful.

369
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You constantly have to be keeping track of them.

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There was this one kid who, like, sometimes, like, his first year,

371
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
like, would run off-site, and we had to, like...

372
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Shit.

373
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He just ran away, and we had to try and find him.

374
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And from then on, he, like, he wears, like, a high-visis jacket at all times.

375
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And there's, like, photos of him given to all patrol leaders at the beginning of the week,

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
just in case that he runs away again.

377
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's funny.

378
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's high risk.

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I ask, because friend of the show, Kazzie, is actually a similar position.

380
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
She works at a disabled camp during the summer.

381
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
She's an arts and crafts teacher.

382
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, I've heard a little bit about what you're describing from her.

383
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, yeah.

384
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
She was, her and her brother both do that, right?

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We were talking about that on Squirtle Day.

386
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's cool.

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And from what I can tell, it's fucking sick.

389
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's really fun.

390
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

391
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It sounds like a real race.

392
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If any of you would like to, like, come down for one week of the summer

393
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and camp and do that with me, that would be great.

394
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No, because we would get right in.

395
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We'd just check in our mental illnesses.

396
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We'll get in, you know, no problem.

397
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, that's true.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I would, but I spend all of my summers taking care of my grandma, who is disabled.

399
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, I already do that kind of.

400
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Makes sense.

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Makes sense.

402
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What, here, here, maybe.

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, it's like, like, whip out our trading cards.

404
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What does your grandma have?

405
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because my grandma's got a ton of shit.

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Right, she's not mentally disabled.

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
She's just physically.

408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
She's old and infirm.

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's having trouble movement.

410
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So, I have to help her.

411
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
How old is she?

412
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm curious.

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
She turned 88.

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So, that doesn't seem battled, but.

415
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Whoa.

416
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Vriska.

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There she is.

418
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, no.

419
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh, yes.

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
My grandmother has broken both of her hips.

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And each time she's broken them, she has fallen on me.

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's not a joke.

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
She has fallen on to me both times she's broken her hips.

424
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, maybe she should stop breaking her hips,

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and she wouldn't fall on you.

426
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're a cursed child.

427
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

428
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You mean that she broke her hips on you?

429
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes.

430
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That is exactly what I'm trying to say.

431
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
She was doing the peach side B from Smash Brothers.

432
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

433
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That goes to the hip.

434
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't remember the first time.

435
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I can only remember it vaguely.

436
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But the second time, I remember excruciatingly in detail and vividly.

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Because we were at the hospital already to Vris, my grandfather,

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
who had broken his hip as well.

439
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So, he was at the hospital because he had broken his hip.

440
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And so, we were just sitting there, and you know, I'm like a kid.

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm like eight or something.

442
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm like, I don't care about anyone's well-being or safety.

443
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I am really hungry, mom.

444
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Can we go do something to eat?

445
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Mom, mom, mom.

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm hungry, mom, mom.

447
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And she's like.

448
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And so, then we walk outside.

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And we're taking the whole family.

450
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We're going to a nearby pizzeria.

451
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Then we walk in the door, and I'm like, Salvation, finally.

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
My taste buds are vibrating.

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I can taste the pizza party marinara sauce right now.

454
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I take one step, and then my grandmother crashes into me.

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
She's tripped on the carpet.

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
She crashes into me with like a thousand tons.

457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I fall onto the fucking floor.

458
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I just know, above all of the pain, above all of the cream,

459
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I know I'm not going to be able to eat a pizza.

460
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And that's what hurts the worst.

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This is real, Bailey.

462
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This is not a joke.

463
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This is actually true.

464
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This has happened to me.

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, I believe you.

466
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And then she was impossible.

467
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It was even longer until I got to eight.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What a bitch.

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, I know.

470
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We're an asshole.

471
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Seriously.

472
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
My grandmother's 90, and she's holding on by a thread.

473
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh, yeah?

474
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

475
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
She got both of her hips.

476
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
She's holding up for a hero till the morning light.

477
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You know that one comic of Apple Bloom talking to Granny Smith

478
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and I think Granny Smith is like, hey, Apple Bloom's friend,

479
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
can you, where's Apple Bloom?

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And Apple Bloom's like, I'm Apple Bloom.

481
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Granny Smith's like, huh?

482
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That's what's happening in real life for me.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah.

484
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's dementia or whatever it is.

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Grandma mistakes me for my mom sometimes.

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Not like she thinks I'm her mom,

487
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
but like she calls out my mom's name towards me a lot.

488
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh, well, my entire film does that regardless of age.

489
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They confuse you with your mom?

490
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah.

491
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, me with other cousins or something.

492
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, yeah.

493
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I call my uncle's name a lot.

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Is there a crew of people who look like you,

495
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
like in your family?

496
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
They're just so distinct.

497
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You know what?

498
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No.

499
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm kind of the only person that looks like me.

500
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay, I have the neck of my family.

501
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
All my family has this neck.

502
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That short stout head connected to torso neck going on.

503
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, exactly.

504
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah, you're close to not connect to the torso.

505
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
As opposed to not connected.

506
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
These other families with their head not connected to torso.

507
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah.

508
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah.

509
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
My four-chain uncle that I'm always talking about looks exactly like nothing like me.

510
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
He looks aptly nothing like me besides the throat.

511
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He looks like a square, not like an insult,

512
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but he is like a rhombus.

513
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He is a geometric.

514
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

515
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay.

516
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay.

517
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
My grandmother's gonna die soon.

518
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Gotcha.

519
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's the ultimate disability.

520
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We're all future disabled.

521
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
When you die, all your other disabilities go away.

522
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So in a sense, it's kind of the best possible outcome.

523
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We're all just nascent disabled people.

524
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We're nascent handicaps just waiting to be birthed.

525
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We're like pupa awaiting our transformation into butterflies.

526
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's true.

527
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
As J.H.W. Connors would always describe himself,

528
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
he is a future retired United States Marine.

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He should be treated with respect.

530
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Oh, it's true.

531
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's true.

532
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We're all cursed with a disability called being alive for a thing of the day.

533
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I have one other angle on disability, which is sometimes,

534
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know who else does this,

535
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I imagine what would happen if I had a catastrophic accident

536
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and I had like, oh, I lost either control of all of my body,

537
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
most of my body or my mind or something,

538
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and how people would talk to me and react to me

539
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and what they would say and how I would continue to live

540
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and what skills hopefully I would still have

541
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and I imagine futures where I have disabilities.

542
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Having seen a lot of them, it's sort of like,

543
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
does anyone else do that?

544
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I prefer not to.

545
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I sometimes do that because it makes me sad.

546
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Sometimes I wake up and I feel,

547
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
you know, you get that brain fog when you first wake up,

548
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
you don't know what's going on,

549
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and I wonder if, and I might think for a moment

550
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
that I might be disabled, I don't know,

551
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
or I think that maybe I might have had an accident

552
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
that I didn't remember or maybe I'm paralyzed now

553
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
or I'm sick or something.

554
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I feel that mostly when I wake up.

555
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And then I feel grateful and then I realize,

556
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I think I was just a mad, but it takes a while.

557
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It takes a while for that feeling that like I am,

558
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
there is something wrong with me,

559
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
but it goes away after a while and I'm just like,

560
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
oh, thank God, but then I'm afraid

561
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
because I'm like, what if one day in the future

562
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I wake up and have that thought and it's not fake?

563
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's true.

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Very understandable.

565
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I get that physically sometimes,

566
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
mostly with like, if I fall asleep and my arm is numb

567
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and it is asleep and it will not move,

568
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
that freaks me out, but even worse,

569
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
is I have in fact experienced weird sleep paralysis

570
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
a couple of times and that is,

571
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
like you wake up and you, I cannot move

572
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and it's like, well,

573
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I will die now.

574
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I've only gotten that once or twice

575
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and usually when people talk about sleep paralysis,

576
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
they talk about like seeing ghosts and shit.

577
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, I know what the fuck that's about.

578
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Which has never, I mean, I have had,

579
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, there have been moments when like I've looked,

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
like when I'm just about to go to sleep

581
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
or just woken up or something,

582
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I have like looked at something

583
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and thought I'd seen like a terrifying face,

584
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
but it's like, it's only just been like a flash split second thing

585
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
where like, you know, your brain sees something

586
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and recognizes it as a face,

587
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
even though it's not.

588
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I haven't had the sustained,

590
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
like there's a demon sitting on my chest thing.

591
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, I've had sleep paralysis a few times in my life.

592
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I usually keep my eyes closed

593
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
because I am fearing to see something

594
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
that there's not in my room

595
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
because I would be probably be scared

596
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
to go back to my room.

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You know that opening of Bloodborne

598
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
where you're lying on the table

599
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and all the demons start to crawl over you?

600
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No, I do not.

601
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's like that, it's like that.

602
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But like, a funny thing about sleep paralysis

603
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
that I had like, this happened to me twice.

604
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Like I never had sleep paralysis before.

605
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Then it happened once

606
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and then like a few months later,

607
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
it happened like twice in a row.

608
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So it was very weird.

609
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So like what happened was like,

610
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I couldn't move and I was sort of still half asleep

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and I kept having like a repeat to dream

612
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
where I kept dreaming that I kept waking up

613
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and like that I wasn't waking up

614
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and I couldn't wake myself up and I couldn't move.

615
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And I realized that this is, you know,

616
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
this is on repeat.

617
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Now I realized that I'm sort of like half asleep

618
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and I can't wake up.

619
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So what I tried to do was to scream my boyfriend's name

620
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and it came out as a very soft menacing whisper.

621
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So it's like, like it's the middle of the night

622
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and like, so me and my boyfriend are asleep, right?

623
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And like, then he hears suddenly like,

624
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
brighter, brighter.

625
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's like.

626
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, it's like, it's like at the end of Titanic

627
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
when she's like blowing that whistle

628
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and like crying for those guys to come help her

629
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
because she's freezing to death

630
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and the Pacific Ocean or whatever.

631
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
She's like, help, help.

632
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm gonna die.

633
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Fuck you.

634
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah.

635
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't remember.

636
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And he, I freaked him out.

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The next day.

638
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And you haven't seen Titanic

639
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the greatest film of the generation.

640
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I've seen Titanic when I was little.

641
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, I've seen him.

642
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I've seen Titanic.

643
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That guy.

644
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Somebody post fan art of the Titanic guy,

645
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Guy Jinka or whatever.

646
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Wait, wait.

647
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You know that, you know that?

648
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Titanic, Titanic Chan.

649
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know that?

650
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, I was gonna say.

651
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You know that shitty concolle or whatever it is

652
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
where like the battleships in Japan

653
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
like our hot anime girls make a Titanic one.

654
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Make a Titanic girl.

655
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.

656
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I mean, I guess I can imagine.

657
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, yeah, there's like a Japanese mobile game

658
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
slash like anime or something where it's like

659
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Japanese battleships.

660
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's like, it's short for something.

661
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's Japanese battleships anthropomorphized.

662
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Ethan showed me one episode of that

663
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
in hopes that I would think that it's cool.

664
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And I'm putting you on fucking Blast right now publicly.

665
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Ethan, what were you thinking?

666
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm gonna fucking shame you right now.

667
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It was the worst experience of my entire life.

668
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And I can't believe you made me do that.

669
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh yeah, concolle.

670
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Conti collection better known as concolle.

671
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's the one.

672
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Better known as so many dojins.

673
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like so many.

674
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, I mean, yeah.

675
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I mean, it's built for dojins.

676
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And there's that one.

677
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The only time I've ever had sleep paralysis

678
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
is I was like real young.

679
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I was like 10 or so.

680
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And looking back on it, the guy, like, like,

681
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I, you know, it was like I couldn't.

682
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh my God, they got little masks over their head.

683
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah, and the guy, there was like this guy

684
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
standing in my doorway that started to walk over me.

685
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And looking at him back on it,

686
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
he kind of looked like Matthew Matosis.

687
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So I'm gonna just want to assume that it was Matthew Matosis.

688
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Wait, you know what Matthew Matosis looks like?

689
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Isn't he like not showing his face?

690
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No, his avatar.

691
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, oh, like that.

692
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, okay.

693
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, he looked like that, but like a real...

694
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I know he's an Irish fuck who wears Hawaiian shirts.

695
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Some red-haired trash.

696
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah, he wears Hawaiian shirts to work like a...

697
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like a very funny man.

698
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Did you know that Hawaiian shirts are formal wear in Hawaii?

699
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Did you know that?

700
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's, what?

701
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's cool.

702
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That's true.

703
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is it just because it's a hot transition?

704
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
No, because they're like, they're like old school,

705
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
like they are formal fancy clothes

706
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
to like wear a nice Hawaiian shirt.

707
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It must be because...

708
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Like you'd wear it like to a business meeting,

709
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
like the mayor would wear, like on TV,

710
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
like a Hawaiian shirt.

711
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I mean, wearing a suit must have not taken off there

712
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
because of how hot it is.

713
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That's my guess.

714
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's maybe?

715
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Is that actually that hot there?

716
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Nate.

717
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, well, much is, by the way, reporting from Hawaii right now.

718
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, Nate, at your request,

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you have sent me on a PCP scouting mission

720
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
down to Hawaii to survey the land for demolition

721
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
all the mountains and all the towns people shall be eradicated

722
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
at your behest.

723
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So I'm here.

724
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm here currently reporting from Maui.

725
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
From Maui.

726
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
There you go.

727
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, from Maui.

728
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm down in Kihei.

729
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So look, that docks me right now.

730
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Keyblade?

731
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Wait, is that Keyblade or was that Keyblade?

732
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah, he's in Kihei.

733
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Right, okay, okay.

734
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Appreciate that.

735
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Nate, actually, I meant to tweet about this

736
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and I probably still will,

737
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but so I got your letter.

738
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh, you got my package.

739
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I got your package.

740
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh, yeah.

741
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Should I say what it was?

742
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah, tell everybody.

743
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Tell everybody.

744
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So yeah, you sent me this wooden,

745
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
this carved wooden idol of the god of...

746
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It was a tiki, it's a tiki.

747
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
...of the god of money.

748
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The god of money.

749
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And Nate, I swear to god, no lie,

750
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the day that I opened this package,

751
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I got like three new patrons for no discernible reason.

752
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There you fucking go.

753
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The god of money.

754
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The god of money.

755
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Patreon.com.

756
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But it did.

757
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Patreon.com.

758
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
There it is.

759
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah.

760
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Patreon.com.

761
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The fucking tiki god commands you.

762
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm glad you liked it.

763
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I got a tiki idol for my aunt one time,

764
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
just out of the blue sheet.

765
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
She had gone to like Florida,

766
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
not even near Hawaii,

767
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but she just brought in back some tiki statue.

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And what I would,

769
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you can hear this on the PCP actually,

770
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
is when this incident I'm about to describe happened.

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh.

772
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, I'd like to like,

773
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I like to slam him against things.

774
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We just, it just made a great vibrating noise

775
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and I just love to listen to it.

776
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So one day on the PCP,

777
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I was just, you know.

778
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I do that with children skulls.

779
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

780
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, go on.

781
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I was just doing that.

782
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I was just slamming him.

783
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And then he snapped in half

784
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and he like broke.

785
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
His like feet fell off of his body.

786
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And then he fucking disintegrated before me.

787
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And I think that starting like the mid 50s

788
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
or something, PCP,

789
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
if you can find a timestamp anyone,

790
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I will reward you with absolutely nothing.

791
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Is there a distinctive snapping sound

792
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
in the mix?

793
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

794
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There is, okay.

795
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It happens, right?

796
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And I think I also,

797
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I also see something in the effect of like,

798
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
oh no, like something has happened,

799
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
but everyone just like stampede's over me.

800
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Like you don't only hear pain in the background,

801
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
like something has occurred.

802
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So if you can find that, let me know.

803
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Also, Hawaii, just,

804
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
this is the best place on earth.

805
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I understand what you mean.

806
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It is the best place on earth.

807
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There's no debate.

808
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Munch is there right now.

809
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
This is two of us who have now confirmed.

810
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It is the best.

811
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
PCPHQ.

812
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
PCPHA as in Hawaii.

813
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That's what we need.

814
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
This, I said this to you in DM's Nate.

815
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This is like, off the back of Italy,

816
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Italy was great and beautiful and stuff,

817
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
but it's like all foreign countries,

818
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
a huge hassle.

819
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It is such a hassle to get around,

820
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to learn the language,

821
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
to exchange all of your money

822
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and do all of these things you have to do

823
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
in order to exist in a foreign country.

824
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And Hawaii has all of the beautiful architecture

825
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and all of the cool scenery

826
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and the beaches and all that kind of stuff,

827
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
but it is America.

828
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It just is America.

829
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's so convenient.

830
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't like beaches.

831
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Ben, go to Hawaii and tell me that you fat motherfucker.

832
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You just don't want anyone to see your pasty-ass body.

833
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's your problem.

834
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You need to get over it.

835
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, that's true.

836
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I mean, I'm not going to deny any of what you just said,

837
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
but I don't know.

838
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I like looking at beaches

839
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and I like maybe like spending like,

840
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't know, an hour walking there,

841
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
but like just staying there, laying there

842
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and like having and getting a tan

843
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
or going to the water.

844
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay, but Mages, think about it like this.

845
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What if...

846
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, this is how it is to live in Hawaii.

847
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I know because Michelle lived there for many years

848
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and is a Hawaiian.

849
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's like you go to work,

850
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
you go to school or whatever you want to do,

851
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
you go do some work,

852
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and then you take the two-minute walk

853
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
to the most beautiful beach in the world

854
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and you swim there for as long as you fucking feel like.

855
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You watch the most beautiful sunset in the world

856
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
for as little or as long as you want,

857
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and then you go home, you shower,

858
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and you continue the rest of your day.

859
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's just in the middle of the day

860
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
is the best things in the world.

861
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Okay, I'm sorry, what's up?

862
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I can't swim.

863
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Did you splash the shallows, dawg?

864
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's all good.

865
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh my God, it's because you live in ice place.

866
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's the reason.

867
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
There is no water there.

868
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
There's only ice.

869
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Not even in the bath.

870
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I mean, the infrastructure is so fraught

871
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
by the urban warfare going on in the streets.

872
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't understand people who can't swim

873
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
because swimming isn't really anything.

874
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You can just exit in the water.

875
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You think that makes swimming real.

876
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Swimming requires a strong will to live

877
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and age lacks that, so that's why, you know,

878
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
it's understandable.

879
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I mean, trending water is a skill

880
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you can learn in like 10 minutes.

881
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I've been trying, like when I was younger,

882
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
my parents and stuff, like baby tried

883
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
to teach me how to swim, but I don't know why.

884
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I just, I just, I never picked up on it.

885
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm good at like diving.

886
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Maybe it's just your colossal body.

887
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah, you dive, but then what do you do after birth?

888
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You didn't teach me how to come back up.

889
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You just stay at the bottom.

890
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I just sink like a rock.

891
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let me just throw this at you guys real quick.

892
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I looked into this after going to Hawaii.

893
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You can just live in Hawaii for approximately like,

894
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
it's like for three grand, for three grand a month.

895
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If you make three grand a month,

896
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that you can put aside for like rent and stuff.

897
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And other things cost more in Hawaii too.

898
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You've got to import stuff.

899
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But if you basically make three grand a month

900
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that you can spend on housing,

901
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you can live in a great place in Hawaii.

902
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I looked into it and that's what it costs,

903
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
which is that's like three times what like I pay to live out here.

904
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That's significantly more than what I make.

905
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It is more.

906
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Sure, sure.

907
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm just, but there is a number.

908
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And if you can achieve that number,

909
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
you can live in Hawaii and it's a great place.

910
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What if you can only achieve that number outside of Hawaii?

911
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Also, you can live in Hawaii for less than that

912
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
if you are just like willing to live in a shitty,

913
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
very shitty place.

914
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Well, I am.

915
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
All right.

916
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I want to give a shout out to Michelle

917
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
because I've seen at least six of her here.

918
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I've seen at least six of you.

919
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I've seen at least six of you.

920
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Which is a Hawaiian girl taking a selfie?

921
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I've seen at least six.

922
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
We were at Michaels today picking up supplies

923
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
so she could take selfies.

924
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Wait, what do you need to take a selfie, a stick?

925
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
No, I mean like background implements

926
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and sparkles and glitter and things

927
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
that one uses to beautify.

928
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
They got apps for that, dude.

929
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
They got filters for that.

930
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, that's true.

931
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This is a new PCP meme slash vocabulary term.

932
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
A Michelle is a Hawaiian girl taking a selfie.

933
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Taking a selfie.

934
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah, that sounds good.

935
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That sounds good.

936
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Works for me.

937
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Oh, I was also harassed.

938
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Well, I'll get to this later

939
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
because there's actually a far more pressing issue.

940
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
If you guys remember the nature episode

941
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
in which I describe a scenario.

942
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I want to dub nature light or diet nature

943
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
in which it's not like real off-road experience.

944
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You're not in a real forest.

945
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It is a paved, Disneyland-esque romp

946
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
through a human-civilized section of a rainforest.

947
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm here to report that in Hawaii this exists and is real.

948
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Shout out to the I-A-O-I-O, I-O Valley.

949
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It is great.

950
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's just a small little section

951
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and there's paved roads and everyone.

952
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But you go into a real, actual, historically significant

953
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and beautiful rainforest.

954
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I was described as the second wettest place on Earth.

955
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Except for your mom's vagina when I am around.

956
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
There you go.

957
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It was great.

958
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I just had to walk up like paved pavement.

959
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I just walked through some rainforest.

960
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I could touch a rock and it was great.

961
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The Heinz got it figured out.

962
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So the rest of the world?

963
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah, they do.

964
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I was also well in Lahaina, harassed by a dirty, disgusting,

965
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
indie artist.

966
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I walked into like some...

967
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Like a street artist?

968
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Talking to shit?

969
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No, no, no.

970
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
An indoor artist, even worse.

971
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
A proper bed artist.

972
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So he could flex his whores.

973
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So I walked in this art gallery

974
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and then around the corner, I'm entering the door,

975
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
he said, some skinny white Ben St. Fox says,

976
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I've been waiting for you.

977
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I turn around and I say, oh, hello.

978
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And then he's like...

979
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He's something in effect of like,

980
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
hey, have you heard of Sacred Geometry?

981
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And I'm like, yeah, dude, I love it.

982
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh, yeah.

983
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Hell yeah.

984
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Hell yeah, I have.

985
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
He quickly reveals that this is not a joke

986
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and he actually has many Sacred Geometry tattoos

987
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
all over his body.

988
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Word.

989
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah.

990
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And so he's like, do you know what dirty poor is?

991
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Do you know what dirty poor of painting is?

992
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's like cut scene flashback smash cut

993
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
to literally fit like 30 minutes ago.

994
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Kazine telling me about what dirty poor is

995
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and about how it is the most fucking sinful low effort.

996
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You are a hack thing that you can do as an artist.

997
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't know what this is.

998
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I have no idea what this is.

999
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Here's what dirty poor is.

1000
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's you get a cup.

1001
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You need a cup and a canvas and some paint.

1002
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You get a cup and you just pour some paint into a cup

1003
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and you don't mix them together.

1004
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You just pour them so it's just, you know, in the cup

1005
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
it's like a kaleidoscope.

1006
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Yeah.

1007
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Just is some grains and some yellows.

1008
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Then you pour that onto a canvas.

1009
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That's it?

1010
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah, that's it.

1011
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Well, that sounds lame.

1012
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah, it's retarded.

1013
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And so he leads me into this little hut he's got working.

1014
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
This fucking skinny white asshole.

1015
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This twain.

1016
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
When I heard you say dirty poor,

1017
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I thought you were describing my economic situation.

1018
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah.

1019
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But that is true.

1020
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's like a hygiene thing to me.

1021
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So he leaves me in this room and just wall to wall

1022
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
the exact same image, but just the color palettes are different.

1023
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It just all is just what you can imagine.

1024
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's just like a splotch of like water,

1025
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
like a splotch of water that is some different colors.

1026
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And a single fan art of crying sands in the back in the back of the shop.

1027
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I Google dirty poor.

1028
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah, I mean some of this imagery is kind of nice.

1029
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Some of it kind of looks like a, like a geode, you know,

1030
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
like you cut open a rock and it's got all these like crystal layers.

1031
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Sometimes it kind of looks like that a little bit.

1032
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

1033
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I've seen worse, I guess.

1034
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I mean, I'm sure the ones I'm seeing,

1035
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm sure the top results on Google are the best of the best.

1036
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And he's like, oh, what do you think?

1037
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And of course that's the situation you have to be like,

1038
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
oh, you know, it's really good, dude.

1039
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And so I'm like, oh, I like this one a lot and the colors are nice.

1040
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And he's like, oh yeah, normally it's $500,

1041
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
but I can get it to you for only a hundred if you want to buy it right now.

1042
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Why does he think that like, well, okay,

1043
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
you do look like a 45 year old man,

1044
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but you know, still it's, he's just, he's just, he's just cold Colin.

1045
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
He's just a cold approach in people.

1046
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I respect the hustle.

1047
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You gotta get people in there, you gotta do your routine.

1048
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You gotta get, you gotta, what's the word?

1049
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You gotta escalate the interaction up until the sale.

1050
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You gotta throw some nags in there.

1051
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Do you call you a chubster?

1052
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You'd be like, oh, you look like a big guy,

1053
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
but you could afford some of these.

1054
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You gotta bring them to the point,

1055
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
you gotta push the choice, you gotta make them make the choice

1056
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
right there and now.

1057
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And you gotta have established the groundwork that they like this painting.

1058
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Right, right.

1059
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Don't forget the 90s title rule.

1060
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
He's gotta bring the painting 90% of the way to you

1061
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and make you come the 10% of him at the end.

1062
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That's, yeah.

1063
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
One time in my life, I would love to have the courage

1064
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
to just say to someone, no, it looks like shit.

1065
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I would love the opportunity to do that.

1066
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But nobody really asks me.

1067
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Then hit him with a dab.

1068
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Bam.

1069
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That was not all, by the way.

1070
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
He said to me, and I was like,

1071
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
well, I don't know, like I am underage

1072
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
and I don't have that amount of money in cash in my wallet right now.

1073
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And he was like, ah, ah, ah.

1074
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So how about you go back to your mom

1075
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and how about you get some more money from her from, you know,

1076
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
big mom and you come back here tomorrow night.

1077
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
He's just pushing it.

1078
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, yeah, just pushing it.

1079
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Tempting proposition.

1080
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
She just goes siphon off my mom to buy this stupid dirty pour

1082
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
that he said that he makes every single night in 30 minutes.

1083
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
He has claimed that to me.

1084
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah.

1085
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
No, no, you twink.

1086
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I'm not going to come back to your art festival.

1087
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm not going to buy your dirty pour.

1088
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Leave me alone.

1089
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Dirty pour.

1090
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Munchy.

1091
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Totally.

1092
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The first of those two stories you told, I just wanted to say,

1093
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
that is fabulous.

1094
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But when you were talking about the cool rainforest stuff,

1095
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I wasn't on Maui when I was in Hawaii.

1096
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I was on Oahu, the one with Honolulu and stuff.

1097
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The Apple City and shit.

1098
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Were you there too?

1099
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
No, no, no, I said I wish I was there.

1100
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh.

1101
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because there's no ramen over here.

1102
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
There's no ramen over here.

1103
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah, that's the most developed place.

1104
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's the most hippin' and hoppin' and scene.

1105
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But there's a highway.

1106
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I-3.

1107
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
There's like three main highways, I-1, 2, and 3.

1108
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And I-3 goes through the middle of the island,

1109
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and it cuts through these valleys,

1110
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
which is just literally where they film Jurassic Park.

1111
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And so every time we drove through,

1112
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and you'd see these big old,

1113
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Jurassic, big old fucking hills,

1114
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and Michelle's dad would be like,

1115
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
hey, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1116
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'd be like, right.

1117
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm sure he did that like six times by the six times,

1118
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and you're like, okay.

1119
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, actually, he did it the first time.

1120
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I did it subsequently every time after.

1121
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's how it went.

1122
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That's how much he liked it.

1123
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I loved it.

1124
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I loved it.

1125
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It was great.

1126
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It was adorable.

1127
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Everybody had a great time.

1128
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
This dirty pour, it reminds me.

1129
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I hate the meat.

1130
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I hate that.

1131
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It reminded me.

1132
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's really gross.

1133
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It reminded me.

1134
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I Googled dirty pour,

1135
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and I had the displeasure to see

1136
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
both dirty and poor people before me,

1137
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
which was very unfortunate.

1138
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I didn't like that one bit.

1139
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It's P-O-U-R, you know.

1140
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh, I spelled it wrong.

1141
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay.

1142
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

1143
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Now I see.

1144
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yes, that was the source of my confusion.

1145
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Fuck, wait.

1146
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
What was I going to say?

1147
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Something about our...

1148
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, it reminded me of this movie.

1149
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Maybe you've seen it.

1150
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It's like a...

1151
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's called Titanic.

1152
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So documentary.

1153
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's called...

1154
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
No, it's not Titanic.

1155
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
20%.

1156
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's like a movie of a little parkie.

1157
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh, God, it's called Exit Through the Gift Shop.

1158
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Anyone seen Exit Through the Gift Shop?

1159
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's a great one.

1160
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That's by Banksy, I think.

1161
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah, I think it was probably made by Banksy secretly.

1162
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's kind of debated, whether

1163
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
or not about Banksy.

1164
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
how much of Banksy is staged.

1165
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's not specifically about Banksy.

1166
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's about this guy who gets involved

1167
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
with the street art community,

1168
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,760
even though he has no skill or talent, and rises through the ranks, he manages to get

1169
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,760
some good PR through various shady ways, and then he gets Banksy's endorsement, and then

1170
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,840
so, based on that endorsement alone, he throws an art show, and is a huge overnight success,

1171
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,440
and everyone loves his shit, and then like, but the scene that it reminded me of is a

1172
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,400
scene where he's trying to sell all these, like he's promised all this original art

1173
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,200
to people, people who bought it from him, so what he'll do for that is he just lines

1174
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,000
up posters, and will just take cans of spray paint, and just sprays all these posters at

1175
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,280
once to put an individual mark on them to make it personal custom art, right?

1176
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,200
So that's what this dirty poor reminds me, you mix up some shit, you pour it on a canvas,

1177
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,280
you swirl it around a little bit, you throw out the ones that look like crap, and if some

1178
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,640
of them look kind of okay, you keep them, and then you sell them for $500 to some kid

1179
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,000
in your Hawaiian bungalow.

1180
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Quick theory, greetings everyone, soyboy here, here's my theory, Banksy, Shadman, they are

1181
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,520
the same guy, prove me wrong, you can't.

1182
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,200
I never agree with the political stance of yours until now, now I'm in agreement with

1183
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
this ideological theory right now.

1184
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,720
I build my whole moral system on this foundation.

1185
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,440
Have you ever seen Banksy and Shadman in the same place at the same time?

1186
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,880
Here's my hot take, Banksy is good, shut up.

1187
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,080
What are you saying about Shadman?

1188
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,600
Have you not seen the comic that's taking the world by storm of the cute comic that

1189
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:32,120
Shadman just did, where Waluigi finally gets invited to smash, and Daisy's crying, so he

1190
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,920
gives Daisy his invitation.

1191
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,920
It's the real reason Waluigi's not in smash, because he gave it to Daisy.

1192
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:46,520
Also, can I just say, if I give you Ben an invitation to my birthday party and you just

1193
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,240
give it to some dumb cryin' bitch who I didn't invite on purpose, I'm not gonna be thrilled

1194
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,680
when she shows up with your invitation, I'm just saying.

1195
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,560
People are mad that the world would have been better served if Waluigi had gone and not

1196
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,200
given Daisy that invitation.

1197
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
He has done a harm.

1198
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,600
No, see, Waluigi can't be Waluigi if he wins, though.

1199
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
What's that?

1200
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
What was that?

1201
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,680
Like, Waluigi can't be Waluigi if he wins, he has to be the underdog.

1202
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,440
You're saying that Waluigi is defined by his perpetual, like, underdog status and loss

1203
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
continuously.

1204
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Yes.

1205
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,640
That's like people love him.

1206
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,960
People love him because of that one image of him, like the plushie of him in the in-ray.

1207
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:39,960
He is the revenant, IRL, only in video games.

1208
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,640
Like, imagine, I mean, if Waluigi was in Smash, people were like, yeah, but they immediately

1209
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,320
not care because then there's no guy to make memes about anymore.

1210
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,320
He is the meme.

1211
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,480
Like, Ridley was the biggest meme.

1212
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,480
That one's gone.

1213
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,480
We need a new meme.

1214
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,160
Okay, Waluigi, I guess.

1215
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
Yeah.

1216
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,200
I mean, and let's say Waluigi got confirmed immediately, immediately the meme focus would

1217
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,360
shift to, oh, how about Isaac from Golden Sun or, you know, Gino, like, these are the

1218
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,920
big people they're talking about these days or whoever else.

1219
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,800
I'd rather see Gino than Waluigi personally.

1220
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,280
I mean, so would I, but I'd like both of them, you know.

1221
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
I wanted as many as possible.

1222
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
I want as many as possible.

1223
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:24,280
Okay, can I just say, I've been wanting to say, Bandana Waddle D is the worst possible

1224
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,280
to who?

1225
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,280
Why?

1226
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:33,040
No, no, literally, zero, no, Z-E-R-O, not any character.

1227
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
He is a void of character.

1228
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,800
He's got a spear, you idiot.

1229
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,800
Yeah.

1230
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,640
He's a spear fighter from Fire Emblem.

1231
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,240
Anyone who wants, like, the weird thing is, I was looking at the polls, he's actually doing

1232
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,880
quite well in the polls for people wanting him.

1233
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,880
Yeah, those polls.

1234
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,640
He is not, not a character.

1235
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,840
There is nothing.

1236
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
He is.

1237
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
Hold on.

1238
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,280
Is he from that game that we played at Radcom, the, like, four person?

1239
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
No, he's not.

1240
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,280
Well, he does.

1241
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
You can unlock him.

1242
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,600
He's appeared basically every game after that.

1243
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,000
Like, he's the main series character now.

1244
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
What do you mean?

1245
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay.

1246
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,640
His first appearance, as I recall, was there was a Bandana wearing a Waddle D in Meta Knight's

1247
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,640
Revenge.

1248
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
I think that's where it first showed up.

1249
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,760
Well, it appears in, like, Revenge of the King and stuff like that, a lot of mini-games

1250
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,760
in a...

1251
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,760
Isn't he one of Meta Knight's, like, henchmen?

1252
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,760
No, no, no, no, you're thinking of Sam's Waddle D, which is a completely distinct

1253
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
character.

1254
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,560
Sailor Cap Waddle D is not Bandana Waddle D.

1255
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Right.

1256
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Oh, okay, yeah.

1257
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
My mistake.

1258
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
I forgot these totally distinguishable characters from each other.

1259
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,560
Yeah.

1260
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
They're nothing alike.

1261
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
There's no similarity.

1262
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,480
It's, it's like having Toad in, like, nobody cares.

1263
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,480
Let me ask you this.

1264
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Let me ask you this.

1265
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,160
Well, yeah, I mean, I would like, yeah, Toad is kind of similar, only Toad has a thousand

1266
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,360
times more personality and history than, than fucking Bandana Waddle D.

1267
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,440
Why do you think, why are you dissing Bandana Waddle D right now?

1268
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,640
I actively hate the idea that Bandana Waddle D would get in.

1269
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,640
Okay.

1270
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,240
Like, if he gets in, I'll be like, okay, cool, another character.

1271
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,800
But he, he does not deserve it.

1272
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,000
He does not, he has not paid his dues in the video game landscape.

1273
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,720
Yeah, I think, I know what you're saying.

1274
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,440
It's like, there's so many characters that are cool, that are getting the snob, and then,

1275
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,400
like, there's like some, at some point, it feels like you're just sort of, they're sort

1276
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,680
of putting characters in, like, reaching, like, we can put this one in, I guess.

1277
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,040
When there are so many actually good ones that are just not being noticed at all.

1278
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,640
That's a variation of the classic slots arguments, like, so-and-so is taking up a slot that could

1279
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,640
go to someone else.

1280
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,080
And I, there is something to that, absolutely, because they only have so much, so much manpower

1281
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,880
to put in and make new characters.

1282
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,120
But beyond that, I'm making a further point that, like, just imagine for me, for a second

1283
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,200
here, what would Bandana Waddle D's final smash be?

1284
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,960
Like, what magical, like, character-defining epic thing has he done that would be turned

1285
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,120
into a final smash?

1286
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,920
First of all, you're making the mistake that final smashes have anything to do with the

1287
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,240
actual character, because most final smashes are just literally nothing.

1288
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,440
But he has literally nothing to him!

1289
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
What would it be?

1290
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
Tell them what you, what would it be?

1291
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,440
He has a match made in heaven, man.

1292
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,240
He could have King Deity's, like, before final smash, he could have the one where he calls

1293
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,000
a bunch of his brethren, some wildies to come down, he could have that, he could have, you

1294
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
know, so lame.

1295
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So lame.

1296
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:21,440
I don't hate the idea of Bandana Waddle D, but I feel like we've got Kirby, DDD and

1297
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
Meta Knight.

1298
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,400
I feel like Kirby's pretty well represented in the series.

1299
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,760
I don't know if we need another one.

1300
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,760
Fair.

1301
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,760
I generally agree.

1302
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,560
Also, put Galacta Knight in as a skin for Meta Knight.

1303
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Do it now.

1304
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
Galacta Knight is a skin.

1305
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
I can't believe you think that Galacta Knight is a skin.

1306
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
No, as a skin.

1307
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,560
As a skin, god damn it.

1308
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,560
As a skin.

1309
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,560
Okay, okay.

1310
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
No, no, I'm not saying that he shouldn't get it.

1311
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm just saying that he is gay in concept.

1312
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,400
Well, he is pink and gay, but you know, that's fine.

1313
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,520
I saw a video about this, that in, god, what is the one, the one that we played at Radcon

1314
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
that none of us liked?

1315
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,040
Kirby, whatever, the new one, yeah, Star Allies.

1316
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,040
Kirby, Star Allies.

1317
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,160
Okay, there is a secret boss in Star Allies where Galacta Knight shows up.

1318
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
I saw this, yeah.

1319
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,760
Yeah, and then none other than the butterfly that rests on Kirby's face in the intro cut

1320
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,440
scenes to like many, many games, shows up and merges with Galacta Knight and becomes

1321
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,120
Morpho Knight, the ultimate warrior.

1322
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,920
That's uh, yeah, that's accurate.

1323
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,080
I don't know what was being implied by that in any way.

1324
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,160
I actually watched many, I watched many YouTube like lore videos on that character because

1325
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,320
I actually do pay attention to like Kirby lore and I'm kind of interested in it.

1326
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,600
Uh, I, yeah.

1327
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,560
I just happened to catch, I happened to catch this yesterday because I was watching Arlo's

1328
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,680
review of Kirby, Star Allies and the, the, okay.

1329
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,680
Let's talk about Arlo once we're done with this because I want to get into that.

1330
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,680
Please.

1331
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,760
Okay, we can talk about Arlo, but I just want to say that, okay, I thought like Star

1332
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,640
Allies was so boring and terrible and I hated it.

1333
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,680
I hated every second of playing it, but I, but apparently it's really short, which is

1334
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,680
also bad.

1335
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,640
However, I kind of wish we had gotten to the end because I saw the ending and the ending

1336
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,920
is like super epic.

1337
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,200
It's like, the final, the final battle is this, it's awesome.

1338
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,680
Oh, I think I actually beat that game and just forgot.

1339
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,680
Kirby games have fallen into this rut basically from day one, but like every single game after

1340
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,600
a, like return to dreamland and it's like, it has to, Kirby has to go to space, Kirby

1341
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:21,200
has to go to space and fight over designed monster like, like, he always has to do that

1342
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
now.

1343
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
He didn't always have to do that.

1344
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,600
It could just, I mean, Kirby's always fought nightmare fuel at the end, but he doesn't

1345
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,960
have to be this specific brand of nightmare fuel.

1346
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,920
It can be, it can be something different guys.

1347
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,400
I'm actually playing through because despite me being a Kirby fan, I haven't played a couple

1348
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
of the newer ones.

1349
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,160
So I'm just now going through triple deluxe.

1350
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,080
I want to play Robobot and return to dreamland.

1351
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,280
And they aren't, okay, return to dreamland is fun because it's co-op and it's not like

1352
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,400
completely mind numbing like star allies.

1353
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,240
I enjoyed, I enjoyed return to dreamland.

1354
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
It's a good game.

1355
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,640
It's, it's good.

1356
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,520
It's not as good as I remember and also triple deluxe so far seems pretty fucking nothing.

1357
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,960
It seems like, okay, it seems that like it's, I'm glad you're telling me that because I've

1358
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
been wondering.

1359
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,280
Return to dreamland seems like it is literally the same game.

1360
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,720
Well guys, Munchy real quick, I just, I loaded up Kirby because I wanted to see if I'd beat

1361
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,120
in the game, which I'm pretty sure I have.

1362
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,400
I just unlocked just by starting the game.

1363
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,240
I can now summon a dark metanite.

1364
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,240
Dark metanite.

1365
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,160
Yeah, from, from, from the amazing mirror, from the amazing mirror.

1366
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,240
He's from the dark side of the mirror and it's in the shadow.

1367
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,040
Oh, well, okay.

1368
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040
That's cool.

1369
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,040
That's a real character.

1370
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,040
All right.

1371
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,040
I like it.

1372
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,040
Never mind.

1373
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,040
Never mind.

1374
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,720
The amazing mirror is great, but like I don't think it's the best Kirby game.

1375
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,720
It's the best one.

1376
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
Yeah.

1377
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,720
It's the best one.

1378
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,120
The amazing mirror with the four players because that's the way it's meant to be, but I don't

1379
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
know if I can literally do that anymore.

1380
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,760
I don't know if that's like, it was, I mean, if you have two people with a GBA, they can

1381
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,200
connect, you know, Wi-Fi or whatever cable though, we're having a cable for like four

1382
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
people.

1383
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
Oh shit.

1384
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,200
There is.

1385
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
I forgot about the cable.

1386
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
But Star Allies was shit, right?

1387
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,040
Like playing Star Allies was terrible, right?

1388
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,120
I actually, I did go, I beat Star Allies on my own.

1389
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,360
I thought it was okay, not great.

1390
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,360
That's really all I have to say about it.

1391
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,200
I think it would have been better alone.

1392
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
Having four people.

1393
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
It is better alone.

1394
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
It is such a clusterfuck.

1395
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,200
I didn't even know what was happening most of the time, just everything just died before

1396
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,360
I even knew what I was doing.

1397
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,360
That's exactly.

1398
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
There was zero challenge.

1399
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
It was not fun.

1400
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
It's way more fun alone.

1401
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,360
I cannot get over that choo-choo shit.

1402
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Oh yeah.

1403
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
It's not even that it was too easy.

1404
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,960
My problem was not that it was too easy.

1405
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,280
It was that, it was just that, there was, yeah, I had no clue what was going on.

1406
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,880
I didn't need to do anything.

1407
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,880
Yeah.

1408
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,880
Yeah.

1409
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,040
For a multiplayer game, that was kind of the biggest problem with it.

1410
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,120
Like it was all about playing together and by playing together, you don't do anything

1411
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,120
yourself.

1412
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,120
You're just alone for the ride.

1413
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:44,320
I'm becoming increasingly aware of an epidemic of in you, new Kirby.

1414
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:50,200
We are definitely in the era of new Kirby, where Kirby is just this perfectly spherical,

1415
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,400
like no personality happy face as opposed to like being fat like he's supposed to in

1416
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
the old days.

1417
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
Yeah, a little blob.

1418
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
And that transcends to all ways.

1419
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
He used to have some weight to him.

1420
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Yeah, he used to have some weight to him.

1421
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,360
And that transcends to like gameplay, to aesthetic, to like music, to everything, where it's just

1422
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,320
like it's become way too clean and way too new Super Mario Bros.

1423
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
And also D.D.

1424
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,820
looks disgusting in the new games.

1425
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,720
This is, this is unironically why this, this like hasn't made any difference yet.

1426
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:22,200
But I still hope to this day that, that asshole, elitist video game playing 100% completionist

1427
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:28,360
assholes like me and like us are the way that we save companies like Square Enix and Nintendo

1428
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,320
for making increasingly shit products that are just like, like, like these Kirby games

1429
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,120
are the perfect example.

1430
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,400
Amazing Mirror is the best Kirby game.

1431
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,040
It like, it doesn't have all this fucking online connectivity, all this shit.

1432
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,040
But you know what?

1433
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,400
On the other hand, I'm completely wrong because the people, the people who games are made

1434
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,400
for like 99% of people don't beat a game when they buy it.

1435
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,760
They just play it for like two hours and they never play it again because they just felt

1436
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,600
like doing something with some money.

1437
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,040
So the, the actual completionists are such a small minority that they don't even matter.

1438
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,040
You know, the thing about that is that it used to be the case that games, like, like,

1439
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,280
I know there was, there was only so many games and they were all kind of expensive.

1440
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,560
I mean, they're still expensive, but like, I think people have more money to throw at

1441
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
them, I guess.

1442
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:21,400
I mean, there's like steam sales and stuff, but like, games do not, games are more about

1443
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,200
playing it for a bit and not beating it necessarily.

1444
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,440
People get new games all the time and it's not really a big deal because they can't afford

1445
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,440
it.

1446
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,520
But when I was younger, I got so used to having the game and playing the game until I beat

1447
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
it completely.

1448
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,920
And it just, it feels wrong to me, but it's not necessarily wrong in real life.

1449
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:47,320
Achieving mastery in a game is what I play for and the rest is a waste of time.

1450
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,320
Playing the new Kirby game for an hour sucks.

1451
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,320
Don't care.

1452
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,320
I want to master it.

1453
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,320
Can we, can we talk about that?

1454
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,800
Man, I was, I was streaming nuclear thrones with it.

1455
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,800
We will.

1456
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
And I felt so shitty.

1457
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
I was doing so bad at it.

1458
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,800
Oh, I watched that.

1459
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
I watched that.

1460
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
You were fucking up bad, dude.

1461
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,800
Well, that's not there to carry you.

1462
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,800
The only times you've ever done this, we used to play multiplayer and I carry you hardcore.

1463
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,800
That's the only time you've done good.

1464
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,800
No, the last time I played on my own, like, I managed to loop and this time I only, I

1465
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,800
only, well, shut up.

1466
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Okay.

1467
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,480
Well, usually I, looping is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but this time

1468
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,680
it just was not happening until the very end.

1469
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,600
And then I got almost close and it was a big letdown when I died against the throne.

1470
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,600
Oh man.

1471
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,520
Hey, we need to stream more and we all need to fucking raid each other's streams.

1472
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,520
We need to do that more.

1473
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
We should do that more.

1474
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,520
That little raid button.

1475
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,200
But before we leave Kirby, before we leave Kirby, I, much, much like Digibro famously

1476
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,120
has said that the A is the best era for anime and that's how, and that's what he believes.

1477
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,880
I am now coming to the conclusion that the DS was the best era for Nintendo games and

1478
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,200
the DS is home to the best installments of each Nintendo series.

1479
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,360
So Kirby, you got Squeeze Squad, you got, you got, you got, you got, you got Canvas

1480
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,320
Curse, you got, you got a Superstar Ultra, the best.

1481
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Wait, Canvas Curse?

1482
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,320
Yes.

1483
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,320
Canvas Curse is great.

1484
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,920
That, that's the best Kirby spinoff, even better than the sequel, which came later,

1485
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,600
which actually is really terrible and I hate it.

1486
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,600
I never played it.

1487
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,600
I never played it.

1488
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Was very good.

1489
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,640
And, and for Pokemon, Pokemon especially, you got Black, Two, and White Two, which just

1490
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,640
are the best Pokemon games.

1491
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,080
You got Heart, Gold, and, and, and Steel Soul Silver.

1492
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,040
Black, Two, White Two are my favorite Pokemon games.

1493
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,440
No, Heart, Gold, and White Two are best mechanically.

1494
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,960
Heart, Gold, and Soul Silver are my favorite though.

1495
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,960
They're my favorite.

1496
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,800
Heart, Gold, and Soul Silver are, like, it's really close between Heart, Gold, Soul Silver

1497
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,800
and Black and White Two.

1498
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,920
You know, I, real quick, I never played Black and White Two.

1499
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
Why, why are they so good?

1500
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
Why are they so good?

1501
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Because it's, it's, it's all the best Pokemon.

1502
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,280
Because I played some of them and then I was like, well this is just Black and White One,

1503
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
so why would I play this?

1504
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,280
It's so fast.

1505
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,800
It was everything good about Pokemon until, and that was the last one before the switch

1506
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
to 3D.

1507
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,800
Okay.

1508
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,800
All right, fair enough.

1509
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,800
When it suddenly got worse.

1510
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,360
If you want to hear a five hour analysis, talk to Steve about this, but Black and White

1511
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,120
Two is good for the fallen reasons.

1512
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,600
It's so fucking fast, it's lightning fast.

1513
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,400
There's absolutely no bullshit.

1514
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,600
You just pick up and play and go.

1515
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,080
All the sprites are, it's before Gen Six, all of the sprites aren't, like, washed out

1516
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,080
and awful.

1517
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,760
They're all bright and vivid colors and it's, it's the best Pokemon has ever looked to

1518
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,760
this day.

1519
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,760
They move so good.

1520
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,760
It is.

1521
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,240
And, and the gameplay is modern enough to have all the conveniences that you like, you

1523
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,240
know, like, repel.

1524
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,440
You, you can just, would you like to use another repel?

1525
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,440
Yes.

1526
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,000
As all the convenience like that, teams aren't disposable, but also it's not new enough

1527
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,920
to have all of the baby pissy patty bullshit that you don't like.

1528
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,920
Yeah, okay.

1529
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,920
The legendaries in Gen Five were kind of disappointing, I don't like them very much, but I don't

1530
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,160
give a shit about legendaries at any point ever.

1531
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,160
I just ignore them, but whatever.

1532
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,720
All right, all right, right, right, fucking Arlo, YouTuber Arlo.

1533
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,600
I have an opinion, I have a strong opinion about Arlo and, and like game reviewers in

1534
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,960
general, and I will explain it now, there's two types of game reviewers on YouTube.

1535
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:54,360
There's people who try way too hard to be John Tron, aka me, yeah, and to varying levels

1536
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,760
of success.

1537
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,600
And then there are people who are trying way too hard to be Mathematosus, which is like

1538
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:05,600
all of the analysis sect of like, like game reviews, I think of like as reviews and analysis

1539
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,120
as like the same group.

1540
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,120
Yeah.

1541
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,440
So like there's people who like just talk about something.

1542
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,840
I don't think that Arlo is either of those.

1543
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:19,560
No, he's, he's, he's kind of like the most frustrating one I've ever seen.

1544
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,840
Mostly because he looks, he talks like normal, you know, he's just like a decent reviewer.

1545
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:31,280
He's pretty good, you know, you go to him for like a, you know, quite a chill review about

1546
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,120
some things like, yeah, I'm just talking about thing and this is what a game is and I like

1547
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:43,280
games and yeah, yeah, yeah, this is me, Arlo, but he has the best like resource at his disposal

1548
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,320
for being the funniest game reviewer in the world.

1549
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,160
He is a puppeteer and a very good puppeteer and he has a really cool looking puppet and

1550
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,640
he's the most like, it's the most squandered potential of any YouTube channel I've ever

1551
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,800
seen and it makes me sad just to see it.

1552
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,560
He could do a lot more with the character if he, because what he actually does is just

1553
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,360
like he doesn't really do like Jon Tron style comedy and he doesn't really do like deep

1554
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
analysis.

1555
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,440
He really just does like consumer reviews, like he just does like, should you buy this

1556
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
product?

1557
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:24,800
Like how good is this game of things, which is fine and for that, I think it's great that

1558
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
stuff.

1559
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,640
But yeah, you know, now that you mention it, if he did more, God, I mean, I'm such a fucking

1560
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,640
idiot.

1561
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,120
I'm such a fucking Rube for lore, but if he did like more in character stuff and skits

1562
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:41,120
and stuff, he does them like very rarely and they're kind of funny, but he doesn't, yeah,

1563
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,440
if he focused more on that, I'd like it.

1564
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,720
Here's an extension of this point.

1565
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,800
It's that because that is the case, I actually find watching Arlo's content kind of off-putting

1566
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,280
because I'm like, why is there a puppet?

1567
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,960
Like what is the point of this puppet here?

1568
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,080
It's true that there is no point.

1569
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,880
I know the man, the man has a passion for the puppet.

1570
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,080
He has a passion for the puppet and I can respect that.

1571
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,720
But I don't think the other receiving end here.

1572
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:11,040
It's akin to like a person talking about video games in a normal way while wearing full clown

1573
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,040
makeup and a clown costume.

1574
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,240
But also not as funny as that.

1575
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:22,160
It's like, well, it's like, I mean, traditionally, you would use a, you would get some idiot

1576
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,160
on Tumblr, you would pay him a hundred dollars to draw you a couple poses that you would

1577
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,800
swap out and you would use a cartoon avatar.

1578
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,840
And this is that only it doesn't piss me off from overuse and being boring and a cliche.

1579
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,520
I salute his industry.

1580
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,560
I absolutely do for all the effort that he clearly puts into puppeting that guy.

1581
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,560
But okay, here's another thing.

1582
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,640
Okay, this is a, this is a, this is my biggest problem with Arlo across the board.

1583
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,880
He uses a green screen and he has those little dangly hairs at the top of his head and you

1584
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,960
can see the shitty effect of the green screen on those very thin hairs and that always annoys

1585
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,960
me.

1586
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,640
Every single time I'm like, that's where my eyes go.

1587
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:03,200
I'm like, I can see the green screen effect happening on those, like it's, it's bad puppet

1588
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,360
design for using a green screen.

1589
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:11,840
Well, it's actually quite good design because of how very, but with the green screen specifically,

1590
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,600
that's always annoyed me right now.

1591
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,360
Like if it's, if something like you can make hair, like really, like, I think he's just

1592
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,840
doing the green screen kind of badly.

1593
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,840
I agree.

1594
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,840
I agree.

1595
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,520
If he lived up to his green screen game in some way, this would probably fix that problem,

1596
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,520
but it does exist.

1597
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,360
I'm never going to be able to stop seeing it now.

1598
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,360
Right.

1599
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,360
Right.

1600
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,800
So I got a, I got a screenshot on the chat.

1601
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,880
So we got to link this so people can see this.

1602
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,440
I should reiterate or iterate for the first time.

1603
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:46,520
I don't hate Arlo, but he just, he just makes me sad to see, to see such talent for such,

1604
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,720
for a YouTube channel.

1605
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,240
Like make a real TV show with that, please.

1606
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,880
I mean, he probably doesn't have the resources.

1607
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,880
How do you do that?

1608
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,880
Join Sesame Street.

1609
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,880
I don't know.

1610
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,840
Like they'd still do those YouTube or, or what do you call it, the Muppet Show.

1611
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Okay, here we go.

1612
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
Okay.

1613
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,280
For whatever fucking reason, for whatever fucking weird twist of fate has led us into

1614
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,160
this darkest timeline that we all reside in, reviewing video games on YouTube is how you

1615
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,280
get your name out there and you get the ability to, to be known and do things.

1616
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,280
Then that's what he's doing.

1617
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,280
Also, look at the edge.

1618
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,240
Look at the edge of all of Arlo's edge.

1619
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,240
You can see it is tinged green because he is using a green screen that has always annoyed

1620
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,240
me.

1621
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:32,440
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but he should be using a blue screen because of the medium

1622
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
he's chosen.

1623
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,040
I have to give this technical, this a technical criticism.

1624
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:41,480
He needs to either get a better camera, use better software or stop using a green screen.

1625
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,360
Some combination of those said this particular issue stops annoying me.

1626
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,680
That is my personal opinion as a viewer of your content Arlo.

1627
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,680
Please help.

1628
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,680
There you go.

1629
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
Yeah.

1630
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
All right.

1631
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,680
Yep.

1632
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,680
I don't hate him though.

1633
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,680
I've enjoyed his content though.

1634
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,680
Yeah.

1635
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,520
Speaking of Puppet guys on YouTube, how about that guy who uses like that old man, you know

1636
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,400
that old man puppet that the guy uses?

1637
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,560
There are like two people who use that old man puppet.

1638
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
Oh.

1639
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,560
Is that true?

1640
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1641
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,560
Why?

1642
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,360
I think like Digi was saying that he really liked him the other day and I've watched

1643
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,360
him for years.

1644
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,360
God damn it.

1645
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,360
What's it called?

1646
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,840
Uh, Old Man Puppet Game Review.

1647
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:25,240
Um, I, like I've seen it before, uh, well, the point is I've watched a bunch.

1648
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,520
That guy is fine.

1649
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,800
He also uses a puppet and like he, he like is a character of the old man, whatever it

1650
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,800
is.

1651
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,800
I'll put a link because I'll find a sapper if I can.

1652
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,800
Mr. Plankett?

1653
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,800
No, it's not Mr. Plankett.

1654
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
God damn it.

1655
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
Oh.

1656
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,800
Oh.

1657
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,800
Vox's Productions.

1658
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,800
Found it.

1659
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
SmackTalk.

1660
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,800
That's the one.

1661
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,800
That's the one.

1662
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,800
I like that.

1663
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,800
I like that.

1664
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,800
Have you screen shot the puppet?

1665
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,800
I have linked it.

1666
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,800
Oh yeah.

1667
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,800
Yeah.

1668
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,800
That's the puppet I've seen, uh, used in Honey Badger Radio, but that's not a game related

1669
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,800
for watching.

1670
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,760
Nothing more, more dangerous than a Last Jedi review.

1671
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,360
There's nothing I want to click on less than something that's on Star Wars.

1672
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,360
Well, it was just the first one that came up.

1673
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
Uh, do you say he's like Honey Badger related?

1674
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,360
No, no, no.

1675
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,360
Not him.

1676
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,320
Like there is a person on Honey Badger Radio, uh, which is a podcast, um, and he uses the

1677
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,080
same puppet, but they're not the same person.

1678
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,080
It just confused me one time.

1679
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,080
It's probably like a commercially available puppet or something that they both use or

1680
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,080
something.

1681
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:25,260
Like, I would like if, if, you know, it's the Last Jedi review with an old man puppet,

1682
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:31,280
but it's like, it's always like a skit comedy, like clickbait, not actually a review.

1683
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,800
It's just a fucking silly old man doing, I fucking hate Star Wars.

1684
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,800
I'm a puppet.

1685
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,120
Like, I just want it to be a comedy thing because it's a comedy puppet.

1686
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,280
It's so funny and cute and silly.

1687
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:48,440
And it's just like saying like, yes, I think the game design here is very good.

1688
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,920
I mean, this guy give credit because he is playing an old man character and he is not

1689
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,920
I haven't seen this.

1690
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,920
So I don't know.

1691
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,920
Wait, wait.

1692
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,920
Yeah.

1693
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,120
If we're talking about Arlo, um, he does, he does come across as a Muppet reviewing

1694
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,120
video games.

1695
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,480
Like he made, like he doesn't swear and he maintains the, he has the right tone for it.

1696
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,480
So it doesn't feel like it's completely arbitrary that it's, that it's a puppet doing the talking.

1697
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,480
Yeah.

1698
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,720
Um, but it is, it is, I do.

1699
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,720
Yeah.

1700
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,680
It's a, it's a concept that I really like and enjoy and am behind.

1701
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,400
And yeah, I guess it is kind of a missed opportunity that more is, he doesn't do more with it.

1702
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,840
Well, here's his invitation to step up his game, right?

1703
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,400
You know, there's nothing stopping him.

1704
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Arlo.

1705
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
Take it and run to Arlo.

1706
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,240
If you want to be the 10th member, you gotta remove that green screen, dude.

1707
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,240
That reminds me.

1708
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,240
I got to get back to Laserbot.

1709
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,240
Yeah, you do.

1710
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,760
Laserbot messaged me back.

1711
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,400
I think he might be, because he said before that he was interested in being on an episode

1712
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,720
and he got back to me the other day, uh, but I was not logged into my Facebook, so I didn't

1713
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,720
see the notification.

1714
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,720
Okay.

1715
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
I got to see.

1716
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
Facebook lol.

1717
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,720
Yeah.

1718
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
I know.

1719
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,960
Well, that's, I could, that's how I got in contact with him was I branded him on Facebook.

1720
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,480
I mock your form of communication of choice.

1721
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:08,560
I do not use, I do not use Facebook, uh, except in dire circumstances.

1722
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,760
Oh no, no, no guys.

1723
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,400
It was just my wife's son Facebook.

1724
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,400
I swear.

1725
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,400
It wasn't me at all.

1726
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,400
Yeah.

1727
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,400
This is you.

1728
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,400
I hate Facebook as much as anyone else.

1729
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
I swear.

1730
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:25,600
Um, anyway, that's, so yeah, we will, I will let you know how that goes.

1731
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Well, good.

1732
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Yes.

1733
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,600
Let me get back.

1734
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,600
By the way, yeah.

1735
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,600
If anyone forgets.

1736
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,640
I'll let you know if, if Laserbot senpai notices me.

1737
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Please do.

1738
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,640
That's the tales gets trolled guys.

1739
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,640
Yeah.

1740
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,640
Oh yeah.

1741
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,640
Yeah.

1742
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,640
Laserbot is the tales gets trolled guy.

1743
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,640
Um, do we want to do another topic or should we, should we move on to our next topic?

1744
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,640
I have this one little bit.

1745
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,640
I have some more.

1746
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,640
Okay.

1747
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,680
I had this one thing that I couldn't say, uh, cause it turned into a Hawaii talk during

1748
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,840
the disability thing.

1749
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,840
I can't say it.

1750
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,840
Oh no.

1751
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,840
I can't say it.

1752
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:58,400
Uh, the, um, when I was talking about like dreaming of like the possibility of like me

1753
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:04,720
being disabled, it's actually quite a positive thing for me because what I do, serious.

1754
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:10,280
It's like, I, I think of like, like the, like I think of like the perfect disability to

1755
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
get.

1756
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,520
And it's kind of like a, a lazy stupid like thing like, oh, when you're disabled, people

1757
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,780
do things for you.

1758
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:21,240
So if I was disabled in this specific way, but I could still like, you know, uh, like,

1759
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,760
uh, play guitar or something, but I had no speech abilities, then people wouldn't like

1760
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,160
make, wouldn't blame me for not talking.

1761
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,520
They'll be like, oh, we can't talk.

1762
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,520
So that's fine.

1763
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,400
But then you wouldn't be able to be on the podcast though.

1764
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
That's true.

1765
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,400
Yeah.

1766
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:40,240
Like, like the more overtly disabled you are, the more, uh, I can get away.

1767
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,280
I can get away with, uh, that I wouldn't normally just do.

1768
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,280
Okay.

1769
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,280
Okay.

1770
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,280
Gotcha.

1771
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,320
Speaking about that sort of like disabilities, I saw, I saw like, um, this channel just randomly

1772
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:56,840
got recommended like a video, uh, of this, like, um, I think she's British and she is

1773
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,840
deaf.

1774
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:04,200
And but like, she speaks very eloquently and she, in that video, she explained how it's

1775
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,880
kind of tough when people don't believe her that she's deaf because she speaks so well

1776
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:13,320
and she doesn't have that sort of, uh, deaf person's, the way they speak.

1777
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,320
Yeah.

1778
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,360
The, the being deaf is the worst because you can't, if you're blind, you have the sunglasses

1779
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,640
and people like, oh, let me help you.

1780
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:25,240
But like if you're deaf, people say, Hey, I'm, you're not, you're not hear me, motherfucker.

1781
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,880
I'll push you.

1782
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,880
And then you do wrecked.

1783
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,880
Hippo.

1784
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,440
I want to do Chibi Bakas Khan, like our machine will come, but Chibi Bakas Khan, we should

1785
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,440
do that.

1786
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,440
We'll get to London.

1787
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,440
And we'll throw an anime convention.

1788
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,440
Oh yeah.

1789
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,440
Yeah.

1790
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
I'll just call the London.

1791
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,440
Yeah.

1792
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,440
Yeah.

1793
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,440
I'll sort it out.

1794
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,440
We'll take over the city of London and not to be fused with London.

1795
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,160
We'll take over all that and we'll turn into the city of animals.

1796
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,440
I'm so glad that Manchi knows the difference.

1797
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,440
Yeah.

1798
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,280
Well, we've all seen that incredibly popular CGP creative video.

1799
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,800
I don't actually have any real knowledge.

1800
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,320
I've just been, I'm just encouraging when I've seen the YouTube videos.

1801
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:11,960
I just want to go on record saying I only just figured out that CGP Kray, CGP Kray is

1802
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,320
not one of the green brothers, that he is not like those guys.

1803
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,320
Oh my God.

1804
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,320
Whoa.

1805
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,320
And now I understand why you thought he was gay.

1806
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,320
Now I understand.

1807
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:24,680
I just, I thought that was like the main channel of like one of the green brothers or something.

1808
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,680
You're insane.

1809
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,680
I don't know why you don't.

1810
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,360
They have, they have made, they have their own main channels.

1811
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,360
I know.

1812
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,520
I don't, I don't know.

1813
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,680
I just thought they were the same guy or something.

1814
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,180
Well, that's, that's pretty unbelievable.

1815
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:38,900
The good news is now my opinion of the green brothers has tanked in my opinion of this

1816
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,580
new entity that is CGP Kray has surged sky high.

1817
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:49,380
Because neither of, neither of them is like, doesn't he, well, CGP Kray doesn't show his

1818
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,380
face at all.

1819
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,540
So like, no, no, they're all American.

1820
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:58,140
I remember when the green brothers were like harmless and made like some wholesome content

1821
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,500
and now they go into this.

1822
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,500
What do they do now?

1823
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,300
Well, they're just kind of like corporate titans.

1824
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,420
No, no, yeah.

1825
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,420
They haven't done anything wrong.

1826
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,420
They're just shills and hacks.

1827
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:11,420
Well, they're, they're, they, they make antifa vlogs now.

1828
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,060
When you get to a certain level, you know what you say?

1829
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:18,860
When you get to a certain level of like notoriety or power or social influence, which they have

1830
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:20,860
socially okay to hate you for some reason.

1831
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,580
I mean, that's basically true.

1832
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:23,580
That's true.

1833
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:27,860
Back when I actually watched them, which was like forever ago, all they did, the only

1834
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:31,900
content they sort of produced were like these little sort of vlog things.

1835
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:36,740
And like the each, each video, they would start as like, Hey, Hank, today's, this is

1836
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,740
the date.

1837
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,980
And yeah, it was really cute.

1838
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:40,300
I watched.

1839
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,300
It was really cute.

1840
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,300
I fell down that rabbit hole.

1841
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,300
I remember the vlog.

1842
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,420
I bet they, I bet they, I bet they got into that habit when they woke up in the same bed

1843
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,180
looking at each other lovingly, gazing into each other's eyes, say, good morning, Hank.

1844
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,180
Today I blah, blah, blah.

1845
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,180
Good morning.

1846
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,660
I need to see a video from you every day.

1847
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,660
Yeah, exactly.

1848
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,660
I'll miss you forever.

1849
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,460
Gay.

1850
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:00,460
Very gay.

1851
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:04,100
The only, only content of theirs I've actually watched was Crash Course when I was like

1852
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,100
11.

1853
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,340
And I was too stupid to realize that it was literally extra credits to you and not actually

1854
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,340
to you.

1855
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,340
Uh, sure.

1856
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,340
I, I like, I like Crash Course literature.

1857
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,740
Some of it's not bad.

1858
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:18,460
I've seen a couple of those, but, but, but I've just opposed the idea of brothers staying

1859
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,460
in contact.

1860
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,460
It's very gay.

1861
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,460
It's extremely problematic.

1862
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,460
I hate that shit.

1863
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,460
I'm opposed to it.

1864
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,460
I am kind of surprised.

1865
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,860
I'm kind of surprised to feel this, uh, this anti-vlogbrothers sentiment bubbling under

1866
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:34,820
the surface in this conversation because I, I, I, I've never seen a, a, a frog brother.

1867
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,540
I've never seen a single one of those videos.

1868
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:42,060
I don't, don't, don't forget to be awesome gamers, but I don't care for them anymore.

1869
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,300
I have fond memories of Crash Course.

1870
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,740
I remember liking it a lot, but, but, but it wasn't very, you know, I have fond memories

1871
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:52,220
of the, of the Kids WB show Crash Test Dummies, if you recall that.

1872
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,180
But there in lies the quandary.

1873
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:06,140
When you're a little kid, it's hard to pick out to tell, like when people want you to

1874
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,820
believe something that's hard to tell when you're being brainwashed.

1875
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:12,500
So I couldn't, I couldn't tell that I was being brainwashed when, when I watched Crash

1876
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,660
Course, but now, but now when I'm a big boy, I can.

1877
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,660
There's a little bit of that, I guess.

1878
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:17,660
I don't know.

1879
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,860
Well, I mean, they, they're saying things they want you to believe, which are, may or

1880
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,900
may not be 100% true.

1881
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,900
They have their own skew.

1882
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,260
Well, that's just, well, that's just education.

1883
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:29,820
And I'm suspicious of all educators as I am of everyone.

1884
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,780
And like everyone has an agenda in the world, but it's people with power who have the ability

1885
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,780
to, to exercise.

1886
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,780
Uh, not Asian people.

1887
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:40,660
They also, during, during a later one, during a thing that I was like past nine, I went

1888
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:45,740
like after I got off the boat, they, they did an entire series or on the foundation

1889
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:51,460
that, uh, guns, germs and steel was racist because it specifically, um, yeah, yeah.

1890
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:56,100
When, when, when gun germs and steel is the opposite of racist and is proving that racism

1891
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,100
is.

1892
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,100
See, that's the thing.

1893
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,100
What is guns, germs and steel?

1894
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,100
A book.

1895
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,780
Have you ever heard of chug guns, germs and steel?

1896
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,420
It's an extremely famous and influential book.

1897
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,820
Like on, yeah, yeah, book.

1898
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,820
I literally never heard of it.

1899
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,740
It is the most famous book of all time.

1900
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,740
Well, not to me.

1901
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,740
So fuck you.

1902
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,740
Summarize it, Monchi.

1903
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,740
What's it about?

1904
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,740
Just in summary.

1905
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:18,260
It's the, uh, the CGP gravy on the, uh, uh, America pop.

1906
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,260
The spread of disease.

1907
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,260
Yes.

1908
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,260
It is that.

1909
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,260
Yes.

1910
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,260
Okay.

1911
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:26,260
It's talking about, it's talking about how the, the map, uh, matters more than the players.

1912
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,260
I see.

1913
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,260
Oh, right.

1914
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,260
Okay.

1915
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,260
Right.

1916
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,260
Right.

1917
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:32,260
Right.

1918
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,260
I'm with you.

1919
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,260
Well, I mean, let's, I mean, people were pretty racist in the time when America was

1920
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,260
like settled.

1921
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,260
I mean, I'm sure that's true.

1922
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,260
No, no.

1923
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,260
That seems reasonable.

1924
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:42,740
They were talking about how saying that the map matters is racist when that is the

1925
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,740
same.

1926
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,740
That's extremely retarded.

1927
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,740
That's extremely retarded.

1928
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,740
What?

1929
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,740
That's the way to be not racist.

1930
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,740
What the fuck?

1931
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,740
Yeah.

1932
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,740
I mean, any, any of this stuff that's like equipped, like this SJWS kind of like, uh,

1933
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,740
you know, he's never apologized.

1934
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,740
Okay.

1935
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,300
This idea that like every human being is like exactly the same in every way, except for

1936
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,700
like the environment you're born into is pretty ridiculous.

1937
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,220
Like there's cultural differences.

1938
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,220
There are genetic differences.

1939
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,220
No.

1940
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,220
There's all this shit.

1941
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:15,220
So their ability to create things, to have large scale civilizations is dependent upon

1942
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,540
the animals and the geography in which you are looking.

1943
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,540
Which seems reasonable.

1944
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,540
Yeah.

1945
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,540
That seems reasonable.

1946
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,540
Yeah.

1947
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,540
Uh, okay.

1948
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:27,380
To be completely transparent here, it was John Green who was writing for one of the teachers

1949
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:31,900
who delivered this and John Green, the writer has later apologized for this because it

1950
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,900
was factually inaccurate.

1951
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,900
Oh, wait.

1952
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,900
He did apologize for saying.

1953
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,900
Yeah, he did.

1954
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,900
He did.

1955
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,900
So.

1956
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,900
Oh.

1957
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,900
He's not a bad guy.

1958
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,820
Those are the sorts of things I think that have piled up to give them something of a

1959
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,380
negative aura, at least in my sphere.

1960
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,900
I honestly, I know very little about them.

1961
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,900
I know they run VidCon.

1962
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:53,220
And I'm glad that, you know, I'm glad even though I'll make fun of extra credits, I'll

1963
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,220
make fun of them.

1964
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,220
They started VidCon.

1965
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,220
They're being literally retarded.

1966
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:01,300
Um, I'm happy that kids in any way are getting, you know, into history and stuff like that.

1967
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,300
So I'm happy that they have.

1968
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,300
That is a good thing.

1969
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,300
That is a good thing.

1970
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,300
Even like popcorn renditions and stuff.

1971
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,300
I'm happy.

1972
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,300
Popcorn short renditions and stuff.

1973
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,020
Gotta call them out though.

1974
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:19,860
The Green Brothers did not chastise Anita Sarkeesian when she called out Sargon in her audience

1975
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:26,060
for being, what was it, a garbage human, for lambasting a member of her crowd.

1976
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,300
And that's like the last update I remember.

1977
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,380
Calling out the Green Brothers for not actually being green aliens.

1978
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,820
They're shitty gray aliens, way more boring.

1979
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:42,540
I cannot fucking believe how important Anita Sarkeesian is.

1980
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,540
She's a totem.

1981
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,020
She's a totem of feminism is what she is.

1982
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,340
She is a totem.

1983
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:52,420
She's this weird symbol and like how you feel about Anita Sarkeesian determines what tribe

1984
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,420
you belong to.

1985
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:56,940
It's all in reference to Anita Sarkeesian.

1986
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,060
Do you like Anita Sarkeesian or do you hate Anita Sarkeesian?

1987
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,260
Fucking red or blue motherfucker.

1988
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:07,140
What if I like the first half of her name and the second half I'm not so fond of?

1989
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,740
Wait, what if I spit right down in my mouth?

1990
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:13,620
Yeah, that's the only solution.

1991
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:20,020
The boy shall be cut in half and each pundit side will receive the part.

1992
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:25,500
You know that contest we did like a month or two ago, whatever happened with that?

1993
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,500
Shall we get into it, team?

1994
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Yay!

1995
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,500
Is it time?

1996
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,860
Wait, wait, but I have things I want to talk about.

1997
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,860
What the boy speak?

1998
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,300
Yeah, let's let Ben say his thing.

1999
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,300
Well, don't worry.

2000
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,300
Say your piece.

2001
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,220
Well, I had two topics I wanted to bring up.

2002
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:46,100
The first is the keto is going good and I'm 10 pounds down from what I was at my heaviest

2003
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,620
a couple months ago.

2004
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:53,900
And I just, but I'm upset because I don't see enough keto representation in media.

2005
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,900
Speaking of Anita.

2006
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,900
Yeah.

2007
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:02,180
And I'm just wondering, like, when is Marvel going to have a keto superhero?

2008
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,180
Damn it, you're right.

2009
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:11,540
And I'm really hoping that by 2028 we can have it for our first keto president.

2010
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:17,820
Because keto kids growing up today need role models just like anyone else, you know?

2011
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:21,460
The only role model that is worth anything is the president.

2012
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,460
That's true.

2013
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,140
If you're not the president, you can't influence anything.

2014
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:29,340
And Marvel superheroes, not DC, because DC makes bad movies and movies are what's important

2015
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,340
now.

2016
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,340
I agree.

2017
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,340
I have been told this.

2018
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,340
I am a sheep.

2019
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:34,340
Listen to my YouTube reviews.

2020
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:35,340
Keto.

2021
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,340
I'm trying to think.

2022
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,780
Who's a superhero who might be like closet keto?

2023
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,540
You know, like, who is keto, but doesn't make a big stink?

2024
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,540
Popeye.

2025
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:42,540
Deadpool.

2026
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,540
Deadpool.

2027
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,540
Deadpool.

2028
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,540
Deadpool.

2029
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,540
Deadpool.

2030
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,540
No, he's eating spinach.

2031
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:48,540
That's got carbs.

2032
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,540
I don't know what keto is.

2033
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,540
No, spinach is totally keto safe.

2034
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,540
Oh, really?

2035
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:52,540
Okay.

2036
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,540
Yeah.

2037
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,740
It is.

2038
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,740
Luffy is definitely keto.

2039
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,740
That's definitely true.

2040
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,740
Yeah.

2041
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,740
Oh, hell yeah.

2042
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,740
Someone's trying to get my attention.

2043
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,740
Someone's trying to stop me.

2044
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,740
No?

2045
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,740
No.

2046
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,740
Can I imagine it?

2047
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,740
No, it's just funny.

2048
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:07,740
Deadpool.

2049
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,740
And if you're Deadpool, then we might have to have a discussion behind the stage here.

2050
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:11,740
Okay.

2051
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,740
So I guess Luffy is a pretty good keto hero.

2052
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,740
All right.

2053
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,740
That's not bad.

2054
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:18,740
And let us know in the comments if there's any more great keto heroes out there so that

2055
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,740
I can have my kids have role models.

2056
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,740
Finally.

2057
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,940
What's that diet that you eat?

2058
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:24,940
A paleo.

2059
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,940
Luffy is also probably paleo representation.

2060
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,940
Oh, he's definitely paleo.

2061
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,940
Yeah.

2062
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:29,940
Steno.

2063
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,940
Shout out to you.

2064
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,940
Paleo, it's like the caveman diet, literally.

2065
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,940
Oh, yeah.

2066
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:35,940
Paleo is Steno.

2067
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,940
Luffy just kills animals and then roast them over fires and eats them.

2068
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,940
Is this what you're talking about here, keto?

2069
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,940
Keto?

2070
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:47,940
Oh, this is the Shinigami magic used for binding off attack.

2071
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,440
Keto demon magic spells used in the bleach universe by Shinigami.

2072
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,440
Yes.

2073
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,440
Yes.

2074
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,440
Related.

2075
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,440
Related.

2076
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,440
Pretty good.

2077
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,440
The other, okay.

2078
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,440
And the other thing, I want to talk about, okay, I don't want to say whose video it was

2079
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:07,440
because this is not a person that I have any ill will towards or want to shit on in specific.

2080
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,440
Uh-huh.

2081
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,440
But do you remember that video?

2082
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:14,440
It was by a certain Brony analyst and it was the Me Too video calling out a tune critic?

2083
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,440
Yes.

2084
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,440
Yes.

2085
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,440
Yes.

2086
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,440
I mean, I remember the idea in general.

2087
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,440
Okay, okay.

2088
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,440
To give context for this, this was amazing.

2089
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:27,180
To give context, there was this guy tune critic who was kind of a sort of respected member

2090
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,440
of the Brony analysis community.

2091
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,840
Me and Munchy, we talked about him a little bit in The Rowdy Fuckers.

2092
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,120
That was before this news story broke.

2093
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:39,440
He was involved in some shady, some pervy stuff.

2094
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,440
It was a huge bit of pedophile stuff.

2095
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,680
He was being a pedophile, that's, I don't want to talk about the specifics of that because

2096
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,680
I will get the details wrong.

2097
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,680
Right.

2098
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,680
Right.

2099
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,680
I don't know what the exact...

2100
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,680
I think it was that he was grooming somebody, but that's...

2101
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,680
He got in trouble.

2102
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,680
He got in trouble.

2103
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,440
And now everyone hates, everyone denounced him, everyone was like, oh god, we gotta, everyone

2104
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:01,200
made videos being like the truth about tune critic, like, you know, no more tune critic,

2105
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,960
tune critic's out of here, we don't want anything to do with him anymore, fair enough.

2106
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,120
And then not to, a couple, it was a couple months ago, this one guy, he makes a video

2107
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,440
that's like, it's like a, he unironically calls it like a Me Too, like a hashtag Me

2108
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,440
Too video.

2109
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,440
Was this Deadpool?

2110
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,440
Yeah.

2111
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,440
I wasn't going to fucking say it.

2112
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,440
God damn it.

2113
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,440
We'll cut that out.

2114
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,440
We'll cut that out.

2115
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,440
Because it's embarrassing.

2116
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,440
I'm sorry.

2117
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,440
Whatever.

2118
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,040
I mean, I don't actually care that much.

2119
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,440
I mean, you're the bad guy now, not me.

2120
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,440
Well, whoops.

2121
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,440
Okay.

2122
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,440
We will cut that out.

2123
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,440
Right.

2124
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,440
Whatever.

2125
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,440
Yeah.

2126
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,440
Yeah.

2127
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,440
Okay.

2128
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:41,600
So the video was, he introduces it that like, okay, so tune critic abused my girlfriend

2129
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,320
and then he's like, and now I'm going to let her tell the story and she comes on and

2130
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,880
she tells the story about what happened and I'm going to condense it here.

2131
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,360
But what happened with her is that while she was with so-and-so, this person making the

2132
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,360
video.

2133
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,360
And these are from her own words.

2134
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,360
These are her important.

2135
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,360
Yes.

2136
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,360
While she was with him.

2137
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,360
Okay.

2138
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,360
Okay.

2139
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,480
Tune critic hits on her online.

2140
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,320
She goes along with it.

2141
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:13,760
They, they like have, she, I think he like shows him her dick or something online.

2142
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,760
She lets him do it.

2143
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,240
She says, yes.

2144
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,240
Let's her do that.

2145
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,240
Okay.

2146
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:22,840
Feels guilty about it later, tells him to tell the guy whose video this is and he doesn't

2147
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,520
do it and she doesn't do it either until much, much later.

2148
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:31,520
And this apparently is, is the me too that like, oh, my girlfriend was also victimized.

2149
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,520
Oh my God.

2150
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,520
Like, no.

2151
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,720
He, he propositioned her and she accepted.

2152
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,720
You motherfucker.

2153
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,440
Like, I'm sorry.

2154
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:46,000
This conflation of completely consensual, like willing sexual acts with like sexual

2155
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,080
abuse, this, this is what they mean when they say me too going too far.

2156
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,080
Tune, yeah.

2157
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,800
Tune critic might be a pedophile and a rapist and tune critic might be the worst abuser in

2158
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,680
the world, but this is not, that's not what this is.

2159
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,680
Okay.

2160
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,680
No.

2161
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:02,680
Yeah.

2162
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,440
I was just throwing that out as something he might, he could have done any number of

2163
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,440
things.

2164
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,440
Indeed.

2165
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,400
He could be the worst person in the world, but this is not, this is not that.

2166
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,680
And it's like, I don't know.

2167
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:16,200
I think I got upset, I got kind of upset watching this video and then, and I finished it up

2168
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,200
and I was like, okay.

2169
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,920
So clearly the guy released in this video, he's doing what he wants.

2170
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,400
He wants to believe.

2171
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,560
He wants to blame what happened on tune critic being a monster.

2172
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,960
He does not want to hold his girlfriend accountable.

2173
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,560
I mean, because that would be something that he would probably have to deal with.

2174
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:37,120
And I'm sure he wants to put the blame externally to her, everyone was in support of her and

2175
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,200
saying, we're sorry this happened to you, we're so sorry you had to deal with that.

2176
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,840
He's a terrible, yes, everyone, everyone.

2177
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,560
Am I, am I confused here?

2178
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,880
Cause I've heard a little bit of this up to this point, but it's, am I wrong to say

2179
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:55,400
that this girl clearly cheated on her boyfriend and is now using some sort of me to defense

2180
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,320
to say it was not her fault.

2181
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,320
Sounds good.

2182
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,320
What's going on here?

2183
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:05,120
I feel like what it was, is that she cheated like by like, uh, acquiescing to tune critics

2184
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:10,120
like sexual like advances and just like, okay, I'll show you me and you show you, you

2185
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:15,480
like, she was into that, but then she felt guilty, but didn't do anything about it until

2186
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,840
it was okay to shit on tune critic publicly.

2187
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,360
That's how it feels.

2188
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,360
How long ago was this?

2189
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,360
That's curious.

2190
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,360
I don't know the timeline.

2191
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,280
I don't think she was specific enough about the timeline, but how it feels to me is that

2192
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:31,000
she admitted to this after tune critic was a bad guy and it was okay.

2193
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,240
I don't know if that's true, but that'd be damning.

2194
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,240
That'd be quite damning.

2195
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,840
I mean, this already sounds quite damning.

2196
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,920
I mean, what is there even a debate here?

2197
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:42,600
Like, is the argument, is the argument here?

2198
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,360
Other than maybe going behind his friend's back, like going behind his friend's back

2199
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,200
and hitting on his girlfriend, not cool.

2200
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,200
No, not at all.

2201
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:53,240
Other than that, in this situation, he did nothing wrong.

2202
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,240
I don't understand.

2203
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,600
I don't understand what is being implied here, uh, because this person, and that's not me

2204
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:02,480
saying tune critic did nothing wrong in general in this situation.

2205
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,120
I mean, I don't understand this.

2206
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,520
This is very strange.

2207
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,760
He has not done any, like, malicious action, but you're right, it is not cool of him to

2208
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,760
have done this.

2209
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,760
It is not good.

2210
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,760
No, it wasn't cool.

2211
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,240
It's just so fucked up to...

2212
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,680
But it's less cool on her part.

2213
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,360
Like, she was the one who was, you know...

2214
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,040
He did ask her, like, from the sound of it.

2215
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,040
He did ask her first.

2216
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,040
Yeah.

2217
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,040
Yeah.

2218
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,040
He shouldn't have.

2219
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
Yeah, like, this was consensual.

2220
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,040
If she wasn't comfortable, that was her chance.

2221
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,040
By her own words.

2222
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,040
By her own words.

2223
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,040
Say no.

2224
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,160
I'm not saying that there's...

2225
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,000
I don't even want to assign the amount, because I say there's equal or no blame.

2226
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,360
I'm just trying to say that he should not have asked in the first place, and that in

2227
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,040
itself is a bad action that should have been.

2228
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,040
Well, no.

2229
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,040
Sure, yeah.

2230
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,040
And that wasn't cool.

2231
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:49,600
It was a bad thing to do, to go behind your friend's back and proposition their girlfriend,

2232
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,600
obviously.

2233
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,800
It is a totally separate, also bad thing...

2234
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,800
But it's not abuse.

2235
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,800
No, it's not abuse at all.

2236
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,800
Not even a little bit.

2237
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:56,800
It's not abuse.

2238
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,800
Which is what is being claimed in the video.

2239
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,800
And it is a totally separate bad thing.

2240
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,640
Is that she was abused and victimized by them.

2241
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:07,720
Okay, these people are children and they can't be trusted to reliably relay facts or anything.

2242
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:15,800
Look, is the argument here, is this the argument going on here, that TuneCriticY2K had so much

2243
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,880
power in this situation?

2244
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,880
He was such a villain.

2245
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:24,480
TuneCritic fucking Y2K was the most powerful force who has ever sexually propositioned

2246
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,280
her, and she couldn't say no.

2247
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,240
Because what, it threatened her livelihood?

2248
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,240
No.

2249
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,680
Harvey Weinstein would come up to you and either forcibly rape you or be like, look,

2250
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:38,360
you gotta fuck me, or like, you ain't moving up in this world, I control Hollywood, you

2251
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,860
gotta do what I say.

2252
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,760
And like, that's evil and fucked up.

2253
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,560
What could he even possibly hold over her?

2254
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,560
I don't understand.

2255
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:46,560
I don't think so.

2256
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,560
I don't understand.

2257
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,560
Nothing.

2258
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,560
Literally nothing.

2259
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,560
There was no solution at all.

2260
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2261
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,880
You made the decision to cheat on your boyfriend and you felt bad about it, but maybe don't

2262
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,880
do that next time.

2263
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:59,560
If you spend all your fucking time rationalizing how it wasn't your fault that you made this

2264
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,880
choice, what happened to actual feminism?

2265
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,440
Taking responsibility for your own life choices?

2266
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:08,320
Why are you now saying that men are the ones who dictate how you act every second of every

2267
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,320
fucking day?

2268
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,800
Be a goddamn adult, you fucking coward.

2269
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,520
This pisses me off so much.

2270
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,520
God, stop hiding behind a movement that has nothing to do with you.

2271
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,520
I feel, God.

2272
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:23,800
I understood the motivations of the guy making the video and the girl.

2273
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,360
I understood why they would both want to believe this.

2274
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,360
Indeed.

2275
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:33,280
But seeing the comments coming out in full support, it was just that brony hug box bullshit

2276
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,280
mentality.

2277
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,880
There's nothing worse.

2278
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:41,000
This is where the brony hug box turns malignant.

2279
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,240
Yeah, yeah.

2280
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,480
Turns a little scary, honestly.

2281
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,160
The fact that, I don't know, let's say it was a guy who-

2282
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:52,320
That someone can come out with a me too story and then tell it and it's clearly bullshit.

2283
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,320
Yeah.

2284
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,600
Not even someone claiming, oh, I bet you're lying.

2285
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,280
It's not even that I bet you're lying.

2286
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,000
It's that she is clearly wrong.

2287
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,520
She's telling the story and it is not lining up.

2288
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,800
What if this same story was just told about some guy who just had also not been accused

2289
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:14,000
of being a pedophile and then this equally flippant story that has obviously no validity

2290
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,280
to it is just made up about someone who had, yeah, maybe he consensually tried to hook

2291
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,120
up with his friend's girlfriend that is not the same as sexual assault.

2292
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,000
This is not a me too moment.

2293
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Any of this shit.

2294
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:32,640
In this case, I mean, I'm sure that in this, the hashtag me too is just, it makes it like

2295
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,640
so farcical.

2296
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,640
Yeah.

2297
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,640
The whole thing.

2298
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,080
Yeah, farcical is the word.

2299
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,840
I mean, in this case, you know, everyone was really eager.

2300
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,280
Everyone's really eager to shit on Toon.

2301
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,280
That's what it is.

2302
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,600
To dump on Toon to show that they too hate him and what he has done.

2303
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,600
Yeah.

2304
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,440
That they too are on the right side of history.

2305
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,440
This is just an extension.

2306
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,080
Even though it really does nothing to do with them.

2307
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,080
No.

2308
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:56,320
They want to, they want to, they want to perform that, that action.

2309
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:02,400
This is an extension of our fucked up political landscape and how like we just, people are

2310
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:07,200
not being, people are not having integrity with the way they address with the stuff.

2311
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:11,720
Imagine you go into those comments section and you say your story kind of sounds dumb.

2312
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:14,400
You're going to be called like a rape enabler or something.

2313
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,440
You're going to be, you're going to be your rape apologist because you're defending Toon

2314
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,560
critic.

2315
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,560
This is where we're at.

2316
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,560
It's so fucked up.

2317
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:26,120
How do we selectively pick and choose like what we like about what like our political

2318
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:31,160
opponents are saying and then like, and like, like with, like with James Gunn and like his

2319
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:35,240
political shit recently about, he made like some really fucked up jokes in the past or

2320
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,240
whatever.

2321
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,240
That's so terrible.

2322
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,240
It's so scary.

2323
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,240
I mean, I don't give any fucks that he did that.

2324
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,240
And I mean, I don't care.

2325
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,600
I'm, I'm not on either side of this fight, but like the left was just like trying to

2326
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,600
excuse it.

2327
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,800
Like imagine it was like any right wing guy, like you just know they would use this to

2328
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,600
like destroy their career even more vociferously than was done by the opposite side of James

2329
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,600
Gunn.

2330
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,600
We just have to have integrity here.

2331
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,280
And I know like literally no one can because we all have massive biases and everything,

2332
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,200
but it's an ideal to strive for.

2333
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,600
It's a whatever it's a platonic ideal to work towards.

2334
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,960
I don't know if you guys were aware of this, but that whole scandal happened before the

2335
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:16,800
episode that we recorded that was recorded earlier, in which I talk about like, like

2336
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,920
writing for office and about how like, oh, I'm a friend, like, like, like stuff that

2337
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:24,600
I've said, like when I was like a baby or like now will be dug up like three years down

2338
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,600
the line.

2339
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,600
And it was like, oh, that's ridiculous.

2340
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,240
Like what you're saying right now at this very moment.

2341
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,240
Yeah.

2342
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,240
Yeah.

2343
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,080
And then like, and then meanwhile, James Gunn, there he goes.

2344
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,080
I mean, in a different sort of way.

2345
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,840
I mean, Alex Jones is doing the stuff that they don't like right now.

2346
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:43,400
You know, I saw a tweet that was like, okay, oh God, I'm going to forget the details.

2347
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,400
They don't really matter.

2348
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,320
I think it was like the Washington Post or someone hired this woman.

2349
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,640
Oh, yeah, I know this one.

2350
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,640
This agent.

2351
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,640
Sarah Jong or something.

2352
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,640
Yeah.

2353
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,640
Yeah.

2354
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,640
Yeah.

2355
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:55,640
Yeah.

2356
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,840
And she had made tweets like, yeah, like, like, you know, saying really shitty things

2357
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,200
about like white men and men in general and white people and like really being a,

2358
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:07,640
you know, kind of saying some racist shit about white people and like fuck white people.

2359
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:12,800
And she defended herself as saying like, like she was saying all these things in response

2360
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,200
to, you know, in response to abuse from other people that were being racist to her, which

2361
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,360
I'm just might be true that I can believe that.

2362
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:25,240
But yeah, I think, I don't know, like, I understand that like obviously the Washington

2363
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:30,080
Post and Disney are not the same entity and we can't call it hypocrisy for one to fire

2364
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,840
James Gunn while the other hires whatever.

2365
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:36,520
Are you aware of the, the extension of that story about what happened later on based on

2366
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,520
those tweets?

2367
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,520
No.

2368
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,520
Okay.

2369
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,760
Most people, I bet people have heard of this, but, but like a couple people specifically

2370
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,040
Candace Owens, what Candace Owens, who is, she is a conservative, she's a black lady

2371
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:53,440
and she, she was like, she took the exact tweets of Sarah Jong and she replaced white

2372
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:59,960
with like Jew and she got banned on Twitter for like intentionally replacing the exact

2373
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:03,560
words with like anti-Semitic shit.

2374
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:07,920
And by the way, and her tweet included like, it's like, it literally replaced her quotes

2375
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,840
with racist shit against Jews and it said at the bottom like, this is what it looks

2376
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,120
like if you like do this at Sarah Jong or whatever, it like, this is why you shouldn't

2377
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,120
do that.

2378
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:20,920
And for that tweet, like she got banned for like, and they restored it later once the

2379
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:21,920
outcry happened.

2380
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,920
But like, wow.

2381
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:23,920
Wow, guys.

2382
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,920
Yeah.

2383
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:30,920
I mean, like, like, this is the problem, man.

2384
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:31,920
Can they move on?

2385
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:39,760
It's, I mean, you shouldn't say things like that, but you, I don't know, it's not, I feel

2386
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,760
like we should be forgiving.

2387
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,760
Yeah.

2388
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:46,400
Like James Gunn and probably of her to the problem is you just don't think you should

2389
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,400
say anything like that.

2390
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,000
Who wants to be forgiving of their enemies, though?

2391
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,240
You know, nobody does.

2392
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,240
It's a problem.

2393
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:58,120
Like I know she might have said those things out of frustration or anger or, or ingest

2394
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,120
or whatever.

2395
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:07,400
I forgive her, I forgive her, but I forgive everybody else who makes like racist kind

2396
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,400
of stuff.

2397
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,400
I just don't care.

2398
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,400
It's fine.

2399
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,400
Whatever.

2400
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:16,400
I can kind of understand why like a corporation wouldn't want to tie their wagon to yours

2401
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:21,400
if you are, if you've known, known to have said, you know, things that alienated them.

2402
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,400
What's the problem then?

2403
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,640
James Gunn making Gardens of the Galaxy like an incredibly successful movie franchise.

2404
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,640
Absolutely.

2405
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,640
Yeah.

2406
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,640
100%.

2407
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,640
And guys like Digi.

2408
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,840
And like, literally who has read those tweets?

2409
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:32,840
Literally who?

2410
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,840
So like, what do they stand to lose?

2411
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,840
No one.

2412
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,520
They were dug up, they were actually dug up by people on the right wing to like make

2413
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:42,160
him look bad because they wanted to use the, the left's like political execution squad

2414
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,920
against the left itself.

2415
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,400
So that was kind of what went down.

2416
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:46,400
Yeah.

2417
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,400
Yeah.

2418
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,400
And it worked.

2419
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,400
It's fucked up.

2420
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,400
It's bullshit.

2421
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,400
It's really fucked up.

2422
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,400
Yeah.

2423
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,400
Yeah.

2424
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,400
Well, it's fucked up, man.

2425
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,400
I don't know.

2426
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,400
I don't like it.

2427
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,400
Yeah.

2428
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:01,400
I think the main problem with all that is like, I just want to one point is that, Munchie,

2429
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,400
why are you trying to shut me down?

2430
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,400
I was trying to shut you down.

2431
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:07,320
I just want to go out and get to that beach, you know?

2432
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,080
I'm, I'm actually, I'm actually done.

2433
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,080
Okay.

2434
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:17,560
Is that, is that, um, forgiving people doesn't get you any points, but condemning people

2435
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,560
does.

2436
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,560
Oh, it does.

2437
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,560
That's true.

2438
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,560
Yeah.

2439
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:26,680
Like, like these people, like, condemning tune critic for what he did to this poor girl.

2440
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,680
Um, that's, that's condemning him for that.

2441
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:35,600
I mean, it's just no currency condemning someone for what they actually did and is confirmed

2442
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,600
is great.

2443
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:42,000
And like, if anyone in the world has ever called tune critic a rapist, for example, they

2444
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,280
are fucking up bad because that is totally not true.

2445
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:51,800
And the, and the, the conflation and the loose language, I shouldn't have tossed out the

2446
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,800
R.

2447
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,800
I don't even blame you.

2448
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,800
You were doing it.

2449
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,800
Casually.

2450
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,800
I guess so.

2451
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,800
But you know, I guess that, that is part of the larger problem.

2452
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:01,960
I suppose those sorts of things, but you know, I don't know, man, it's all, it's all

2453
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,960
fucked up.

2454
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,960
We're all going to hell.

2455
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:04,960
Yeah.

2456
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,460
And on that note, let's go to the funny fucking.

2457
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:11,140
On that note, let's, let's, let's guys, it's time you've been waiting and we've finally

2458
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,140
done it.

2459
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,140
What's it been like two months?

2460
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,140
Some longer than that.

2461
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,140
I think two months in the making.

2462
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,140
Yeah.

2463
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:17,140
Around there, around there.

2464
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:21,780
It's time to answer the question of what the hashtag PCP theme is going to be in the

2465
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:22,780
future.

2466
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:23,780
What the hashtag hell is up?

2467
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:26,220
Oh, well guys, I've, I've, I've done it.

2468
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:27,380
I've gone over the numbers.

2469
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:28,380
We've listened to them all.

2470
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,380
We reviewed them.

2471
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:31,700
We have all voted and I'll just break it down for you real quick.

2472
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,700
How we did it.

2473
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,940
We each voted for our top three picks.

2474
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:37,220
The top one got three points.

2475
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:42,220
Our second choice, each of us got two points and the third choice got one point.

2476
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,900
Some people only wanted to vote for their number one.

2477
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,700
So the numbers aren't exactly, they're not, you know, up to all the numbers being added.

2478
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,580
But like that was how it worked.

2479
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:53,140
So given that point system, we're going to run through it here.

2480
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,140
And real quick.

2481
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:56,060
We're going to go from top to from bottom to top.

2482
01:40:56,060 --> 01:41:00,660
I think what we do is the top three will do separately, but I just want to shout out

2483
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:05,580
like the guys who didn't get in the top three, but still got voted in the thing and went

2484
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:07,260
and were selections.

2485
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:08,740
So let's see what we got here.

2486
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:13,420
We got Felix Box was, was Munchies number one pick.

2487
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,980
Did not win tragically, but that, that's in the right.

2488
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:18,660
These are, these are like the honorable mentions.

2489
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:22,380
Alex, A-A-A-L-E-X-X.

2490
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:28,100
That one was beloved by DeVoo, specifically that was the vaporwave one was pretty dope.

2491
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,100
The vaporwave cover.

2492
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,100
The vaporwave cover of the PCB theme.

2493
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,100
Yeah.

2494
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,100
That's right.

2495
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,540
Both of these are covers of the song that we have right now and that's why I want, that's

2496
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:35,540
why I like them.

2497
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,660
They're the one that we have now.

2498
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:40,060
That's why I didn't vote for them.

2499
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,380
Because they were, they just were the old song.

2500
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,700
Some of them were good.

2501
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:44,820
I didn't, I didn't want it.

2502
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:47,620
I didn't want just a new version of this old song.

2503
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:48,620
Yeah.

2504
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:49,620
I don't know.

2505
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:50,620
Exactly what I did want.

2506
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:51,620
Fair enough.

2507
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:52,620
Fair enough.

2508
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:55,420
Our tour, our tour got some votes.

2509
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,020
He made a PCB theme as well.

2510
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,780
Accelular was voted by a couple of people.

2511
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,940
Congrats dog.

2512
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:01,940
Which one was Accelular?

2513
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:06,420
Accelular was, let me see real quick, that was, let me see, I don't want to say who

2514
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,420
picks that was.

2515
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,260
I hear, let me link it real quick.

2516
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:13,660
It was a fucking, hang on, getting the stupid link.

2517
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:14,660
Come on.

2518
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:15,660
Okay, here we go.

2519
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:18,380
You say you didn't want to say who, it was the voter for him, but.

2520
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:19,380
Ah, right, right, right.

2521
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,260
Oh, the voter for the PCB dimension.

2522
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,260
That's right, the dimension one.

2523
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:23,260
Yeah, that one.

2524
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,260
Yeah, yeah.

2525
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:27,060
I'm going to refrain right now from saying who voted for what.

2526
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:30,380
You mentioned the other ones.

2527
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,380
The other ones.

2528
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:32,620
Well, he said, oh, like this one.

2529
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,860
No, I did it once and I won't do it again.

2530
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,860
You did it like twice.

2531
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:38,380
I said like, I said that Munchie's top pick was the feelings box.

2532
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:41,980
And then you said like someone, they will, they will like the thing as well.

2533
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:42,980
Okay, well, whatever.

2534
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:43,980
I won't do it again.

2535
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:44,980
All right, whatever.

2536
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:45,980
My bad.

2537
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:46,980
Don't do it.

2538
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:47,980
Fine.

2539
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:48,980
Well, okay, whatever.

2540
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,980
There was that dope ass rap by Akazi.

2541
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,660
Remember that, that rap with all that shit?

2542
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,660
Yes.

2543
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:54,980
One of many.

2544
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:55,980
That was dope.

2545
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,980
That was dope.

2546
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:01,020
That, yeah, that trap beat, that fucking heavy ass death grips rap.

2547
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,020
Yeah.

2548
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:05,100
I really liked that one, but tragically not the winner.

2549
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,220
Wings of Strife got a shout out.

2550
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,220
That was good.

2551
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,220
That one was solid.

2552
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,220
That was enjoying.

2553
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,220
That was a solid one.

2554
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:16,660
And in our last fucking honorable mention was Oblivion with his meme theme.

2555
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,220
Oblivion ball with his meme theme.

2556
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:20,500
Oh, I'm so ready for that to win, god damn it.

2557
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,580
The meme theme was good.

2558
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,140
The meme theme was really good.

2559
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:29,140
But it was, but it was just a, it was essentially a cover of, through the fire in the flame.

2560
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:31,300
It was like a sick cover with like dope shit.

2561
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:32,300
I guess it is fun.

2562
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:36,340
The only thing that could have been better with that entire theme was to pick a few,

2563
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:39,460
a few more choice memes for me, but you know.

2564
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,460
I agree.

2565
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:41,460
I agree.

2566
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:44,780
But I did really like that one a lot.

2567
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,460
That being said, we're actually going to, we're going to play these.

2568
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:49,180
So, so here we go, everybody.

2569
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:50,660
Time to have a listen.

2570
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,660
Wait, what are we playing?

2571
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:53,380
I'm going to play for everybody.

2572
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,020
Our top three picks.

2573
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,140
These are our top three picks.

2574
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:57,900
So are we going from third to first?

2575
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:58,900
Of course.

2576
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,900
Of course.

2577
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,060
You always end with the, with the hypest moment.

2578
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:04,540
So our, our, let me get the actual fucking play thing here.

2579
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,540
Okay.

2580
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:10,020
So our, our number three, top three with a total of six points, which for, for this contest

2581
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:11,020
was pretty good.

2582
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:12,740
Let me, let me, let me get ready to play it.

2583
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:13,740
All right.

2584
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:17,380
This was Oblivion Falls dream theme.

2585
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,380
All right.

2586
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,380
There it is.

2587
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:20,380
There it is.

2588
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,780
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2589
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,780
Yeah.

2590
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,780
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2591
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,780
But I love working.

2592
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:28,780
Sorry, buddy.

2593
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:29,780
You didn't win.

2594
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,780
You worked really hard on this.

2595
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,780
I think we all loved it.

2596
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:32,780
But it was really good.

2597
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:33,780
It was really good.

2598
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:34,780
I love the cover.

2599
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:35,780
I love the vocals, the audio, the background.

2600
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:36,780
And like he got instruments.

2601
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,780
He like worked with artists like sing it and shit.

2602
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,780
Yeah.

2603
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:39,780
Again.

2604
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:40,780
Sick as fuck.

2605
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:41,780
Yeah.

2606
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:42,780
But I did not want just a cover of the old song.

2607
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:43,780
You know what?

2608
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:44,780
You know what?

2609
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,780
Let's make me think, oh man, the PCP theme is so great.

2610
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,780
Let me go listen to the Procrastinator's theme song that we already have.

2611
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:51,780
Let me go listen to that because that's iconic.

2612
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:56,780
I mean, yeah, but you know, I mean, so was slavery, but we got rid of that too.

2613
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,780
You know?

2614
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:58,780
It was truly iconic.

2615
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:01,780
We didn't replace slavery with a different flavor of slavery.

2616
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:02,780
What?

2617
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:03,780
Corporate slavery?

2618
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:04,780
Is that?

2619
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:05,780
Oh.

2620
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,780
I said it.

2621
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:07,780
So that was number three.

2622
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:08,780
Okay.

2623
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:09,780
Okay.

2624
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:10,780
Okay.

2625
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:11,780
Okay.

2626
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:12,780
Okay.

2627
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:13,780
I said it.

2628
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:14,780
All right.

2629
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:15,780
So that was number three.

2630
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:16,780
So oblivion fall.

2631
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:18,780
I don't want you to think that I hope you don't feel slighted.

2632
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,780
You worked really hard.

2633
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:20,780
We appreciate your entries.

2634
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,780
They were great.

2635
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:25,780
But you get, you get the bronze medal here, buddy.

2636
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,780
All right.

2637
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:27,780
Second place.

2638
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,780
Moving on.

2639
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:31,780
This one, this one got 10 points across the board.

2640
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:33,780
This one was quite well liked.

2641
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:38,780
I guess there's nothing else to do, but just to say congratulations on your silver medal.

2642
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:41,780
Arkin with the PCP theme entry.

2643
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:42,780
There it is.

2644
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:43,780
Oh, remember this?

2645
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:44,780
Yeah.

2646
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,780
I really like this one too.

2647
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:47,780
Yeah.

2648
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:48,780
Oh, there you go.

2649
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:49,780
No.

2650
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,780
No.

2651
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:51,780
I wouldn't spoil it today.

2652
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:52,780
That sentencing.

2653
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:53,780
Cooper.

2654
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:54,780
There you go.

2655
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:55,780
Blaming his near moral perception.

2656
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:56,780
This one is really good.

2657
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:59,780
I would have been, I would have been happy to have this one as the theme.

2658
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,780
Me too.

2659
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:01,780
Oh, let's see.

2660
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:02,780
Here it comes.

2661
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:03,780
PCP.

2662
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:04,780
PCP.

2663
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,780
Oh man.

2664
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:06,780
This one's cool.

2665
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:07,780
PCP.

2666
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:08,780
PCP.

2667
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,780
PCP.

2668
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,780
PCP.

2669
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:11,780
This drug is not a play thing.

2670
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,780
It's not a beer.

2671
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:14,780
It's not a marijuana cigarette.

2672
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:20,780
This is something so mind-altering that it will make you accountable or base.

2673
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,780
Man, that's so good.

2674
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:25,780
Oh, it was really, really good.

2675
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:27,780
I love it so much.

2676
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,780
I'm just going to use that when I edit.

2677
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2678
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,780
I can't blame you.

2679
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:32,780
You should use it for stuff.

2680
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:34,780
I mean, we've got the rights to all of them.

2681
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:36,780
They sold off their souls.

2682
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:37,780
We've got them now, baby.

2683
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:39,780
Arkin, congrats on the silver medal.

2684
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:40,780
That was great.

2685
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:41,780
I already know what that next one's going to be.

2686
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:42,780
I already know.

2687
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,780
Well, smarty pants.

2688
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:44,780
Maybe you don't know.

2689
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:48,780
Maybe it's going to be, shut up.

2690
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,780
So anyway, here's guys.

2691
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,780
Here it is.

2692
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,780
The moment we've all been waiting for.

2693
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,780
The number one winner with a total of 17 points.

2694
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:57,780
Jesus Christ.

2695
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:58,780
17.

2696
01:46:58,780 --> 01:46:59,780
This one really took the cake.

2697
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:00,780
This one really surged ahead.

2698
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,780
It was a lot of people's top pick.

2699
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,780
Jesus.

2700
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,780
Sasuke Zero Pro.

2701
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:06,780
Congratulations, buddy.

2702
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:07,780
Yeah.

2703
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,780
The new PCP theme.

2704
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:09,780
Here it is.

2705
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Oh, yeah.

2706
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,780
What is this?

2707
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:14,780
You're supposed to be working right now.

2708
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:15,780
I'm sorry, darling.

2709
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,780
I'm listening to the PCP right now.

2710
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,780
It's so interesting.

2711
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:26,780
Oh, there it is.

2712
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:33,780
Guys, play this for your wife when she comes home from a hard day of work.

2713
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,780
Forgot to pick up the laundry.

2714
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:36,780
Forgot to do the taxes.

2715
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:40,780
Forgot to pleasure you for the last 10 months of your relationship.

2716
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:42,780
But she did remember to listen to the PCP.

2717
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,780
And you know what?

2718
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:44,780
God bless her for that.

2719
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:46,780
And that's why I'm a feminist.

2720
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:49,780
That's good dinner conversation right there, boy.

2721
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:50,780
Damn right it is.

2722
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,780
Sasuke Zero Pro or Sasuke Pro.

2723
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:54,780
Congratulations, buddy.

2724
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,780
Congratulations.

2725
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:57,780
You are the gold medal winner.

2726
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,780
I'm happy.

2727
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,780
Hold on.

2728
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:02,780
Congratulations to the guy.

2729
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:03,780
It's awesome.

2730
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:09,780
But I just realized sort of like, I'm not sure if you mentioned the honorable mentions

2731
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:13,780
of, or I might have missed someone, Eric C. Bass?

2732
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:14,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

2733
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,780
I totally did miss him.

2734
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:17,780
I missed him.

2735
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,780
Eric C. Bass or Bass or whatever.

2736
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:20,780
Yes, you were not able to mention two.

2737
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:21,780
Really sorry I forgot you, buddy.

2738
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,780
We liked your multiple versions.

2739
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:24,780
Can I shout out a couple of the other ones?

2740
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,780
Absolutely.

2741
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,780
Guys, go nuts.

2742
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:27,780
If you want to shout out stuff you like, now's the time.

2743
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:32,780
I want to particularly shout out Zero Alias' Chip Tune.

2744
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:37,780
It had a really great beat that I think would have made a great theme song.

2745
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:42,780
It gives me the chills when it gets that drop.

2746
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:47,780
That one, yeah, I feel like that's one of the ones that I'm sad that we had to pick

2747
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:48,780
one.

2748
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:50,780
And the Garbage Burners' Hypus theme was fucking sick.

2749
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:52,780
I did like that one, yeah.

2750
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:54,780
Yeah, that was another one.

2751
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:58,780
I only voted for ones that had lyrics, right?

2752
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,780
And that was one that had good lyrics.

2753
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:05,780
I really like this one that I feel has gotten unmentioned by all of you guys.

2754
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:07,780
I feel it's this really underground theme.

2755
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:12,780
This name guy, this guy called Endless Jest, and he's made this really nice mellow

2756
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,780
edition of the theme that I really enjoy.

2757
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,780
I'm really sad that didn't get picked.

2758
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:18,780
Well, you know, he's dead now.

2759
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:21,780
That's how it goes.

2760
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,780
I kind of like-

2761
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:23,780
How old and with the new?

2762
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:27,780
I got to say, I like the winner here by Sasuke Pro here.

2763
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,780
I like that it incorporates the old.

2764
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,780
Yeah, I feel like it's like that plus.

2765
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,780
It's not a cover, but it's got-

2766
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:36,780
It's not a marijuana, it's not a cigarette, it's not a beer.

2767
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:38,780
Oh, man, that's good stuff.

2768
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,780
That was a different song.

2769
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,780
Well, yeah, that's Arkin's.

2770
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,780
That's Arkin's.

2771
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,780
The silver Midwest.

2772
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:44,780
Smash up the two of them.

2773
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:47,780
Am I allowed to critique the winner?

2774
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:51,780
If you feel to ruin his good day, absolutely.

2775
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:54,780
Because I didn't like it the whole time, and I-

2776
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:55,780
What?

2777
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:58,780
There was something about the female voice.

2778
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:00,780
No, okay, I like that part.

2779
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,780
It's funny.

2780
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:03,780
Yeah, it sounds weird, but it's funny.

2781
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:07,780
I mean, yeah, he sounds like he's got a shitty non-English voice or something,

2782
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:08,780
and he's trying to do it.

2783
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:10,780
A shitty non-English voice.

2784
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,780
He's got an accent or something.

2785
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:15,780
No, it doesn't sound like an accent.

2786
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:20,780
It just kind of sounds like he's half-assing a female voice.

2787
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:23,780
I'm listening to the BCB right now.

2788
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:24,780
But it's funny.

2789
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:25,780
I like it.

2790
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:26,780
Yeah, I like it.

2791
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:30,780
I mean, kick and scream all you want, but...

2792
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:33,780
I mean, the majority of us voted for this one.

2793
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:35,780
I'm surprised that I didn't vote for it at all.

2794
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,780
No, you didn't.

2795
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:37,780
That's true.

2796
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:41,780
Yeah, because I didn't mean that I voted on it.

2797
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:44,780
I mean, if you guys won, I'll break down the demographics of the winner here.

2798
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:46,780
That was my top pick.

2799
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:47,780
I'll put it out there.

2800
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:49,780
Everyone picked this as their top pick.

2801
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:53,780
Davoo put it as a second choice, and then Gib, Mage, and Munchy just didn't vote for it at all.

2802
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:57,780
So there's a pretty harsh divide here on liking this or not.

2803
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:58,780
My picks were...

2804
01:50:58,780 --> 01:50:59,780
Yeah, that was my top pick.

2805
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:02,780
Arkin was my number two, and then...

2806
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:06,780
Oh, God, it was the Wings of Strike was my number three.

2807
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:07,780
Gib, I don't...

2808
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,780
If you just fucking use the song you want when you edit, I don't care.

2809
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:10,780
It's fine.

2810
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:11,780
That's true.

2811
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:12,780
We can't force you.

2812
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:13,780
Nope.

2813
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:14,780
Can't do it.

2814
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:15,780
I guess we could.

2815
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:18,780
Don't be my calling card using the other one.

2816
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:19,780
Yeah.

2817
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,780
I mean, that sounds fine.

2818
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:21,780
No offense.

2819
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:26,780
I actually do, like, enjoy everything aside from the female voice in that intro.

2820
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:28,780
So I'm not, like, aghast.

2821
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:32,780
I think that we should use the other songs as outros.

2822
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:34,780
I mean, I like that idea personally.

2823
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:35,780
We'll talk about that.

2824
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:37,780
Yeah, we talked about this yesterday.

2825
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:38,780
At the real one.

2826
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:39,780
We're going to literally get rid of it.

2827
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,780
Is that what you're saying?

2828
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:41,780
Why not?

2829
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,780
Who cares?

2830
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,780
But I mean, that's been incorporated into the new winner.

2831
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:45,780
Look, it doesn't matter.

2832
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,780
We'll talk about exactly how we're going to work this out later.

2833
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:48,780
We have a winner, guys.

2834
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:51,780
Let your voice be known, people, because I know that you won't want this.

2835
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:52,780
Let your voice be known.

2836
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:53,780
If you say so, buddy.

2837
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:54,780
I mean, it won't be gone.

2838
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:55,780
It won't be gone.

2839
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:56,780
But, like, whatever.

2840
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:57,780
I-

2841
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:58,780
Guys, it's in the new song.

2842
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:00,780
You guys are pissing off a little bit.

2843
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:01,780
I'll be straight with you.

2844
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:02,780
I'm getting a little annoyed.

2845
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:07,780
Look, we've got over 100 episodes where we use the old theme.

2846
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:08,780
It's not going anywhere.

2847
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,780
We've got it.

2848
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:10,780
It's in the annals of history.

2849
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,780
It's here.

2850
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:13,780
It's even in the goddamn new theme song.

2851
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:14,780
Get excited.

2852
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:15,780
This is good.

2853
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:16,780
I like it.

2854
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:17,780
I'm happy.

2855
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,780
I love it.

2856
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,780
I love it.

2857
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,780
Can't you hear the happiness in my voice?

2858
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,780
I love it.

2859
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,780
We've got all these-

2860
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:23,780
We've got, like, the arcan one and zero alias.

2861
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,780
And we've got all these other ones that, like, we could use as outros.

2862
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:30,780
And they're all great, and they're fan works, and they're made, you know, for the glory of

2863
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:31,780
the PCP.

2864
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,780
And we have thusly been glorified.

2865
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:33,780
Indeed.

2866
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:34,780
And I love it.

2867
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:35,780
Indeed.

2868
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:36,780
Bitch.

2869
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:38,780
By the way, I do love arcans a lot.

2870
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:41,780
Like, the thing is for me, like, arcans was my second choice.

2871
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:42,780
And I'm-

2872
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:45,780
Like, I would have been happy with either one, frankly.

2873
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:46,780
But, uh, yeah.

2874
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:47,780
Whatever.

2875
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:48,780
There's a few I would have been.

2876
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:50,780
Probably like five or six that I would have been happy with.

2877
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:51,780
Yeah, me too.

2878
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:52,780
Me too.

2879
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:53,780
But guys, let me just say.

2880
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,780
Let me just say, this has been a tremendously positive experience.

2881
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:57,780
Doing the PCB theme contest.

2882
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:58,780
It's been awesome.

2883
01:52:58,780 --> 01:52:59,780
Yeah.

2884
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:03,780
I'm so happy that everybody came out and made dope shit and gave us it for free to use

2885
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:04,780
however we want.

2886
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:05,780
Love that.

2887
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:06,780
Just love that fact.

2888
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,780
I love the contest.

2889
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,780
I've been going over a great and RFCK world, and I love them.

2890
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:11,780
Dude, contests are the future.

2891
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,780
Wow.

2892
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:17,780
The contest stat, because people love getting involved, and let's do them the favor and

2893
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:18,780
let them get involved.

2894
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:19,780
Yeah.

2895
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:20,780
Feature film.

2896
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:22,780
Somebody make a feature film of the progress news.

2897
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:24,780
It has to be feature length.

2898
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:25,780
Oh my god.

2899
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:26,780
You know what?

2900
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:27,780
This is-

2901
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,780
It has to be released in theaters.

2902
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:29,780
Yes.

2903
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:31,780
Don't call, don't, don't add us until it's in theaters.

2904
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:33,780
This is, this is a bit of an aside.

2905
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:34,780
This is no longer about the theme.

2906
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:44,780
Guys, www.speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail is now live.

2907
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:48,780
It is active, and you can leave us voicemails at that.

2908
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,780
We'll put a link in the description.

2909
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,780
Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

2910
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:55,780
We'll take your goddamn audio and listen to it.

2911
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:58,780
And we will listen to it on, I mean not all of them, right?

2912
01:53:58,780 --> 01:53:59,780
We'll know.

2913
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,780
We'll weed out the shit ones, and we'll get the good ones.

2914
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:06,780
We'll listen to it on the show, and we will respond to it if you, if we feel like.

2915
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:07,780
Yeah.

2916
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:08,780
Yeah.

2917
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:09,780
That's how it's going to be.

2918
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:12,780
So leave them, and hopefully when you hear this they'll be like a day or two.

2919
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:13,780
I'm sure we'll get a bunch.

2920
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:14,780
Like when this episode goes up.

2921
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:18,780
So probably by like next Sunday when we record, we'll have like a couple to look through.

2922
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,780
Yeah.

2923
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:20,780
Do it guys.

2924
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:21,780
Fucking give us the voicemails.

2925
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,780
You've been asking for it.

2926
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:23,780
We live to serve.

2927
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,780
And here we are giving you what you want.

2928
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:30,780
Now head on over to www.patreon.com slash the procrastinators to show your support.

2929
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:31,780
Yeah.

2930
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:33,780
That's what you need to do, friends.

2931
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:34,780
All right.

2932
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:39,780
Well that being said, I think it's time to remember that I forgot to ask for questions

2933
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:42,780
on Twitter before we started recording.

2934
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,780
Everybody quick, quick, quick.

2935
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:47,780
Somebody go to the goddamn thing, the patron lounge.

2936
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:48,780
It's okay.

2937
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,780
I'm going to get old questions.

2938
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:50,780
Everyone stall for time.

2939
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,780
Stall for time.

2940
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:52,780
Uh-oh.

2941
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:53,780
We don't have a charismatic thing to say.

2942
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,780
We have no charisma at all.

2943
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:58,780
We have no personality.

2944
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:00,780
We're going to get questions real quick.

2945
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:04,780
I got the...let me talk about...I got really drunk last night.

2946
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:05,780
Oh yeah?

2947
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,780
How'd that go?

2948
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:07,780
I went out to a party.

2949
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:08,780
Crack came too.

2950
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:12,780
And I went out and I bought...they were drinking Yingling, which is not keto, because they

2951
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,780
were a bunch of filthy glucose brands.

2952
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:15,780
Oh, God.

2953
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:24,780
So I went and I got Michalab Ultra, just 2.6 grams of carbs per bottle, drank the entire

2954
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:28,780
pack, passed out on the sofa.

2955
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:30,780
And it was, you know, it was fine.

2956
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:31,780
That's good.

2957
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:32,780
Whatever.

2958
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:33,780
That's my story.

2959
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:34,780
Not bad.

2960
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:35,780
And I'm sticking to it.

2961
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:36,780
What was the nature of this party?

2962
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:37,780
Was this a friends party?

2963
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:42,780
It was a bunch...it was a guy...a guy who I knew in college, who was like friends of

2964
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:45,780
a bunch of my other friends from college that I'm still on good terms with.

2965
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:49,780
He was at his place and it was...oh, it was our other friend who we hadn't seen...he

2966
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:50,780
was in town.

2967
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:53,780
So we were just like, why don't we all get together because this other guy who we haven't

2968
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:56,780
seen for years is coming to visit.

2969
01:55:56,780 --> 01:56:00,780
And we did and we played Clankers and, you know, you know how that goes.

2970
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:06,780
I want to give a shout out right now to Mazele Finneken and C. Geddesi, or I've pronounced

2971
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:09,780
that, for being the worst PCP fans of all time.

2972
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,780
Wait, what?

2973
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:11,780
What's going on?

2974
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,780
Who?

2975
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,780
And going out for being late and asking questions.

2976
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:17,780
I want...you now have the official title of the worst PCP fans.

2977
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:19,780
How dare they ask questions.

2978
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:22,780
And they were asked to ask questions.

2979
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:29,780
You're not asking questions, they're just saying, come on guys, come on, several people.

2980
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:34,780
Yeah, oh, several people are typing, but they're all like, oh, why are you so late?

2981
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:35,780
Haha.

2982
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:36,780
Yeah, that is bad.

2983
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:37,780
I hate it.

2984
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,780
I hate it.

2985
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:39,780
He's got to be destroyed.

2986
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:41,780
Oh, here's something that's relevant to earlier discussions.

2987
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:45,780
For those of you planning on having children one day, what are your biggest fears when

2988
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:48,780
thinking about being a parent, that they are disabled?

2989
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:49,780
Being a parent.

2990
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:50,780
Being a parent.

2991
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,780
Being disabled and I have to live with them.

2992
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:57,780
How I'm going to be able to teach them effectively, because there's no way to guarantee the ways

2993
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,780
I have been taught will be effective on the people that I produce.

2994
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:04,780
So there's no way of knowing how I'll be able to affect my child and I'll just have to do

2995
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:06,780
my best and inevitably fail.

2996
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:12,780
I can't stand being around another person to the extent that I would need to if I had

2997
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:15,780
a child, to the extent that I would need to be around them.

2998
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:19,780
I'm still on the fence and wondering how I want to have a child, so I don't know.

2999
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:20,780
It's understandable.

3000
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:26,780
It will also be trying to regulate the internet in a non-obtrusive way and in a fair and balanced

3001
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:30,780
way that my child will be able to understand and appreciate and not just hate before, which

3002
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:31,780
will be impossible.

3003
01:57:31,780 --> 01:57:32,780
Yeah.

3004
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:38,780
I feel like I think I've said this before, but there's only so much you can do when it

3005
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:43,780
comes to the new generation being weird and doesn't make any sense.

3006
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:46,780
All these things I was thinking my whole life, I'm going to teach my kids the ways of the

3007
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:50,780
world, but the world changed by the time I was having kids, so now I don't have any information

3008
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,780
on it.

3009
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:53,780
You'll never understand your kids.

3010
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,780
You'll never understand the things they like.

3011
01:57:55,780 --> 01:58:02,780
All you can do is be generically cool in things that are always good, just being someone that

3012
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:05,780
is playing guitar and cooking.

3013
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:06,780
Yeah.

3014
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:12,780
Or social interaction, being a good party host.

3015
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:15,780
If you're a good party host, you bring people around.

3016
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,780
Yes, be my dad.

3017
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:22,780
By the way, I want to shout out Hippo's dad and Kaz's dad for being the best two dads

3018
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:23,780
I've ever seen.

3019
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:24,780
They're actually quite similar.

3020
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:27,780
They are like reg universe from Steven Universe, and that's why I like them.

3021
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:28,780
Have you seen my dad?

3022
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:29,780
No.

3023
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:30,780
But I know him.

3024
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:31,780
I know him.

3025
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:32,780
I know all day, intrinsically.

3026
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:33,780
I just lower my head.

3027
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:34,780
I put my ear to the ground.

3028
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:39,780
Did you steal my dad as if it was easy?

3029
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:40,780
No.

3030
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:47,780
My biggest fear about having kids is that my dad would always say when I was growing up.

3031
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:56,780
He would always say that I don't really care what you do, but I want you to be successful

3032
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:59,780
and content doing it, whatever it is.

3033
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:04,780
I don't really care what my kids do, but it torments me every day and night that they

3034
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:09,780
will just be lazy and stupid and not be willing to put an effort to achieve whatever their

3035
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:10,780
goals are.

3036
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:15,780
And then they will become whiny bitches about how it's everyone else's fault when, meanwhile,

3037
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:19,780
I'm staying on the side observing them continually fuck up everything by not putting in enough

3038
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:20,780
work.

3039
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:21,780
That is my biggest fear.

3040
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:34,780
I feel like if you show this attitude towards them, I need you to be not lazy.

3041
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:35,780
Don't be lazy.

3042
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:37,780
Then they're just going to do that because that's what they do.

3043
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:41,780
Those are the pitfalls I'm interested in avoiding.

3044
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:46,780
Whatever the mechanics are involved in making sure that my children are not lazy sacks of

3045
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,780
shit, that's what I want to do.

3046
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:52,780
If that includes me never bringing it up, then I will do so.

3047
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:56,780
Whatever that is, I want to do it because I don't want my kids to be fat waste of space.

3048
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:57,780
Here's the thing.

3049
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:01,780
There's a gang you don't want your child to be in.

3050
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:03,780
There's just a generic street gang.

3051
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,780
You're fucked no matter what you do.

3052
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:09,780
You can't say, don't join this gang because your kid will be like, huh?

3053
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:10,780
Yeah, you're just fucked.

3054
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:14,780
And you can't say nothing because then your kid will be like, I like this gang.

3055
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:15,780
I'm going to join it.

3056
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:19,780
So literally, no matter what you do, you just have to be transparent with your kid.

3057
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:23,780
The main thing with children is you just have to explain why you have rules.

3058
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:26,780
Explain why you are limiting them in whatever way.

3059
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:29,780
And try and be open and understanding of their wants and needs.

3060
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:30,780
And it's really hard.

3061
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:32,780
And it's hard when your kid wants to play with knives.

3062
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:35,780
They just got to let them stab himself and he'll learn.

3063
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:38,780
Though, you know, I've watched a lot of anime that has taught me that, like,

3064
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:41,780
just putting rules in place and making broad statements

3065
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:45,780
without explaining the motivation or why I'm saying them always works out well

3066
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:48,780
and does not cause any misunderstandings or problems.

3067
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:50,780
So that's what I'm going to do, probably.

3068
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:51,780
Yeah.

3069
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:52,780
Fucking...

3070
02:00:54,780 --> 02:01:00,780
You also don't want a child to just be obedient because then they have no drive.

3071
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:01,780
Yeah.

3072
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:02,780
They have no personality.

3073
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:04,780
If they just do what you want, like, that's the worst scenario.

3074
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:05,780
Yeah.

3075
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:07,780
Where, like, you're not rebellious enough.

3076
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:09,780
Like, I feel like I was never rebellious enough.

3077
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:11,780
And I'm like, ah, that's why I'm a piece of shit.

3078
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:14,780
That's why I make game reviews on YouTube.

3079
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:19,780
The only reason, the only reason I would want to censor the internet in any way

3080
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:24,780
is not to, like, limit my kid's options so that he's like how I am.

3081
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:25,780
I just want...

3082
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:29,780
I've made mistakes in my past and so I don't want to inflict the pain that I felt onto my child.

3083
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:35,780
And so I want to be able to, like, warp zone, like, one, two, skip that pain of life.

3084
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:37,780
But I think at the end, like, you can't avoid it.

3085
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:41,780
Like, no matter what you do, even if you, like, hide for infinity or anything,

3086
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:45,780
your kid will still turn out to be a sexual degenerate no matter what you do.

3087
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:46,780
So why even try?

3088
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:47,780
No, no.

3089
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,780
Why even try and make him hate you?

3090
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:50,780
Why would you make him hate you if you don't?

3091
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:51,780
Yeah.

3092
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:52,780
Yeah, I'm going to...

3093
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:55,780
Speaking of that, I've got a question here.

3094
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:58,780
Which fandom, by Rusty, which fandom has the best quality porn?

3095
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,780
And I asked this because...

3096
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:02,780
Oh.

3097
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,780
Oh.

3098
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:04,780
But, like...

3099
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:05,780
Is that true?

3100
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:06,780
UCP.

3101
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:12,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3102
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:13,780
Fucking...

3103
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:18,780
I've always been annoyed that the things that I was a fan of when I was a kid

3104
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:23,780
don't have any good porn because they're so old that all the artists didn't exist.

3105
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:27,780
And now if, like, if anything exists, if a game is released,

3106
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:29,780
there is, like, 10 trillion...

3107
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:30,780
Yeah.

3108
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:34,780
...terabytes of porn, like, in seconds by really good artists.

3109
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:35,780
Dude.

3110
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,780
And it makes me sad.

3111
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:37,780
Oh, do you guys remember Queen Chrysalis?

3112
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:39,780
It makes me annoyed that they're just, like...

3113
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:42,780
I have, like, five images of Florina from Fire Emblem.

3114
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:43,780
Yeah, yeah.

3115
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:44,780
And that's all.

3116
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:47,780
And they're, like, pencil drawings scanned in, like, terrible drawings.

3117
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:49,780
But that's all I have.

3118
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:52,780
Do you guys remember Queen Chrysalis and how there was...

3119
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:56,780
There was, like, a porn of her before the episode was over?

3120
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,780
No.

3121
02:02:57,780 --> 02:02:58,780
But I could believe it.

3122
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:59,780
I can believe it.

3123
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,780
I always remember that.

3124
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:01,780
I always remember that.

3125
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:02,780
Before the episode was over.

3126
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,780
That's dope.

3127
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:06,780
I do love that about, like, that's, like, what Twitter is great for.

3128
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,780
What was the question?

3129
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:09,780
I totally forgot.

3130
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:12,780
What fandom has this stupid question?

3131
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,780
Oh, that's right.

3132
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:14,780
I just wanted to say that thing related to it.

3133
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:15,780
Okay, yeah.

3134
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:16,780
Let's just move on.

3135
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:17,780
I don't think anybody cares.

3136
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:19,780
Here's a question from...

3137
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:21,780
This is a pity question from the Twitter.

3138
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:24,780
From atitsyaboy2 asks,

3139
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:28,780
I'm a male on the prowl for some female action.

3140
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:32,780
While my personality is obviously a 10, I still look 14.

3141
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,780
What should I do?

3142
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:39,780
Meet women who also look young for their age, date an actual 14-year-old JK,

3143
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:41,780
or stick to my 2D girls?

3144
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:43,780
Any other suggestions are appreciated.

3145
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:45,780
Wait, what were the three options presented?

3146
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:47,780
Okay, well, most of those were jokes.

3147
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:49,780
He's like, should I date a girl who also looks young?

3148
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:50,780
I don't know.

3149
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,780
That's not a solution.

3150
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:52,780
I don't know what he's talking about.

3151
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:53,780
That's really bizarre.

3152
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:55,780
I don't understand what the problem is.

3153
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:58,780
It's like he's framing this like, guys, there's this societal impetus

3154
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:00,780
to date people who look your age.

3155
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:02,780
This is such a problem for me, but no.

3156
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:04,780
I would assume that he's saying that he's 14

3157
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:07,780
because 14-year-old guys are not particularly attractive.

3158
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:08,780
I would assume that's the issue.

3159
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:10,780
You just gotta do what everyone else does,

3160
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:16,780
which is cast your net around for a girl who is into what you look like.

3161
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:17,780
Indeed.

3162
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:18,780
That's really all there is to say.

3163
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,780
There you go.

3164
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:20,780
That's it.

3165
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:22,780
I want to give hope now to all those freaks out there.

3166
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:23,780
Chat them up.

3167
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:25,780
Because no matter how disgusting or generous you are,

3168
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:29,780
I guarantee you there are a ton of women or gay guys

3169
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:32,780
if you want to turn gay who will be into you,

3170
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:34,780
no matter how gross and disgusting you are.

3171
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:36,780
I know none of you are gay now,

3172
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:40,780
but if you're thinking about it, it's always an option.

3173
02:04:40,780 --> 02:04:42,780
That is too real.

3174
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,780
Yeah.

3175
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:47,780
Because I've only ever gotten attention from gay men.

3176
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:50,780
And it annoys me quite a bit.

3177
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:51,780
It'd be so easy.

3178
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:52,780
Yeah, it's annoying.

3179
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:55,780
It's annoying to get, for a beta male like me,

3180
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:58,780
desperate for the affections of women,

3181
02:04:58,780 --> 02:05:01,780
it's very irritating when a man likes you

3182
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,780
because it's like, well, this isn't what I wanted.

3183
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:05,780
It means I'm attractive, but the wrong kind.

3184
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,780
I'm like, well, what am I going to do now?

3185
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:10,780
Do I have to shave my head off?

3186
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:12,780
Do I have to do that?

3187
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:13,780
Oh, wait.

3188
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:14,780
Here's a meme question.

3189
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:17,780
Not really, but it's at Imperial Denasty asks,

3190
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:20,780
are you guys ever going to make a cover of the PCP theme?

3191
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:23,780
Oh, well, we outsourced that project.

3192
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:24,780
That didn't be Dana.

3193
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,780
All right, just saying.

3194
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:27,780
What else we got?

3195
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:28,780
What else we got?

3196
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,780
Here's a question.

3197
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:33,780
What's one bad purchase decision that still haunts you still?

3198
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:38,780
When I was like 11, I spent all of my $100 I got for my birthday.

3199
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:41,780
I spent it all on webkits, and I got four webkits.

3200
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,780
I'll never forget myself.

3201
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,780
I remember you talking about that.

3202
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:49,780
A terrible purchasing decision that haunts me is one that I made recently

3203
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:52,780
because my Oculus Rift was not working.

3204
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:56,780
And I assumed that it seemed like it was a port issue or a cord issue,

3205
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:59,780
so I got a replacement cord, but that didn't fix the issue either.

3206
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:04,780
So the problem is in the headset or at least in the port on the headset.

3207
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:06,780
So I'm going to try and get the port fixed.

3208
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:08,780
And if that doesn't work, I'll just have to replace the headset,

3209
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:12,780
which is like $300, which I probably won't do.

3210
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:13,780
I'm going to fix the port.

3211
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,780
How do you do that?

3212
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,780
I don't know.

3213
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:16,780
I'll take it to a mechanic and be like,

3214
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:19,780
Guys, the port seems not to work.

3215
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:21,780
Replace it or do something about it.

3216
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:23,780
I'll give you money for this.

3217
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:26,780
So quickly answer the question on my card.

3218
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:29,780
I once bought a microphone and it was expensive as hell,

3219
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:34,780
and it worked terribly, so wasted money there.

3220
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:38,780
I bought a mouse from Amazon for $10.

3221
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,780
Oh, you smashed it.

3222
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:43,780
Within a couple of weeks, yes, with Leopold the Mace,

3223
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:48,780
the flanged Mace that I bought at King Richard's Fair for $90.

3224
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:50,780
Which is a purchase you don't regret.

3225
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:55,780
That was always as expensive as my $100 Vampire Hunter D Leather Hat.

3226
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:56,780
Your Leather Hat.

3227
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:58,780
Your wide room leather hat.

3228
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:00,780
I can't believe my Mace costs less than that.

3229
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:01,780
I know, right?

3230
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:04,780
I could have bought a suit Katana, dude, but...

3231
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:05,780
Well, I don't know about that.

3232
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:06,780
Okay, maybe not.

3233
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:09,780
I could have bought probably a hammer of some kind.

3234
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:11,780
You could have bought a blunt weapon like mine,

3235
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:13,780
which is what the cool kids wheeled.

3236
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:17,780
No, that thing's paid for itself many times over,

3237
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:20,780
in the form of revenge against Amazon.

3238
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:26,780
I tweeted the video of me smashing it, which was awesome.

3239
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:28,780
That was great.

3240
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:30,780
SambaMan64 asks,

3241
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:33,780
what's your go-to interesting fact about yourself?

3242
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:34,780
I'm gay.

3243
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:36,780
Oh, guys.

3244
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:38,780
We got to stay on the same person.

3245
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:40,780
But you just complied about not liking attention from gay guys,

3246
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:44,780
and yet your first thing out of your mouth is I'm gay.

3247
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:47,780
I'm a self-hating gay.

3248
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:48,780
Aren't we all?

3249
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,780
I hate myself in all those places.

3250
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:51,780
He streams to high heaven,

3251
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:52,780
I'm gay, I'm gay,

3252
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:54,780
and then when the gay guys come to him like a scarecrow,

3253
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:55,780
he bats them away.

3254
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:56,780
Like, what's the deal?

3255
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:57,780
Come on.

3256
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,780
Yeah, why the mixed messages, friend?

3257
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:00,780
What?

3258
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:02,780
Yeah.

3259
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:05,780
When you insist like you're gay like us,

3260
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:07,780
you're going to get gay people who want to be gay with you,

3261
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:08,780
if it's true or not.

3262
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:11,780
Oh, that's the secret I now know.

3263
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:15,780
Maybe, yeah, maybe we should stop pretending we're gay.

3264
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:18,780
No, no, that can't be it.

3265
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:20,780
Yeah, yeah.

3266
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:22,780
Go-to interesting fact about myself.

3267
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:23,780
Yeah, yeah.

3268
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:26,780
I mean, what I do for a living is fucking weird and bizarre.

3269
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,780
I was pretty much thinking of that as well.

3270
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,780
For most people, yeah.

3271
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:33,780
When I have a little, I enjoy being at work,

3272
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:36,780
and there are several people who I'm relatively

3273
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:38,780
kind of buddies with at work

3274
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:41,780
who I distinctly have not told them anything.

3275
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,780
And one of them is actually a guy who I'm,

3276
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:44,780
I'd say I'm friends with him,

3277
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:47,780
and we talk about One Piece every week when it comes out,

3278
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:50,780
but I have not told him that I do a podcast about it.

3279
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:51,780
That I do a podcast,

3280
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:53,780
that I have a YouTube channel I talk about.

3281
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:56,780
It's fun for me to just not talk about it,

3282
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:58,780
and so I get to giggle myself.

3283
02:08:58,780 --> 02:09:00,780
Okay, so yeah, I get it.

3284
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:02,780
At that party I was at last night,

3285
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:06,780
the topic of me and my comics and the Kickstarter

3286
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:08,780
and get it, you know, all that came up

3287
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:10,780
and the lectures and YouTube,

3288
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:14,780
and it was so awkward and embarrassing,

3289
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:15,780
and I was like,

3290
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:17,780
it's not that I'm embarrassed of it,

3291
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:20,780
but talking about it was really uncomfortable,

3292
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:23,780
and I just wanted it to be over.

3293
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:28,780
There was no, it doesn't even matter what people,

3294
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:30,780
some people thought it was cool.

3295
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:32,780
Someone said, oh, they were jealous.

3296
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:35,780
Someone made a joke and thought it was funny,

3297
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:37,780
and it's like, it doesn't matter.

3298
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:39,780
It doesn't matter what the reaction is.

3299
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:43,780
I feel weird and uncomfortable talking about it.

3300
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,780
No matter how positive the reaction is.

3301
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:47,780
I've always felt that way.

3302
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,780
I don't know,

3303
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:51,780
Michelle's talked to her coworkers about my online stuff,

3304
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:53,780
and I don't go and see her there,

3305
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:55,780
and they'll see a coworker and they'll be like,

3306
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:57,780
oh, hey dude, the guy who makes the YouTube videos.

3307
02:09:57,780 --> 02:10:01,780
I was always like, oh, blush, how's Kashi Sensei?

3308
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:03,780
You know, that.

3309
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:07,780
It has not reached a point of like, I'm not embarrassed.

3310
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:09,780
I am embarrassed, why am I embarrassed?

3311
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:10,780
I don't know.

3312
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:12,780
Yeah, I don't know why either,

3313
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:15,780
because in my heart, I like it about myself,

3314
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:17,780
and I think that it's cool and I'm glad.

3315
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:19,780
And yet, having it come up at a party,

3316
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:21,780
it's like, oh god, no.

3317
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:23,780
Let's talk about anything else.

3318
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:25,780
I think we just got to rebrand it.

3319
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:27,780
We got to rebrand it as saying, I'm not a YouTuber, I'm a Tuber.

3320
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:28,780
I'm a Tuber.

3321
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:30,780
I'm on the tube.

3322
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:32,780
That's far worse.

3323
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:35,780
No, no, because it goes so far into like,

3324
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:38,780
stupid that it is like something you can laugh about.

3325
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:40,780
Like, yeah, yeah, I'm a Tuber.

3326
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:42,780
I should circle around.

3327
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:44,780
I should circle all the way around

3328
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:47,780
and go so far into being an internet weirdo

3329
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:50,780
that I have to start wearing a tie everywhere that I go

3330
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:52,780
and disguising myself as a normie.

3331
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,780
Yes.

3332
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,780
And like, you know,

3333
02:10:55,780 --> 02:10:57,780
just dressing like a witch.

3334
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:00,780
And just performing the character.

3335
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:02,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3336
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:04,780
Whenever someone comes up to me and asks me where I go,

3337
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,780
I say, I'm a digital influencer.

3338
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:07,780
Oh.

3339
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:09,780
You don't get your eyes with outside people enough.

3340
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:11,780
That title, while accurate,

3341
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:14,780
that title is deeply dystopian to me.

3342
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,780
Yeah, it definitely is.

3343
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:17,780
Digital influencer.

3344
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:19,780
More, more, yeah, that's a little dystopian.

3345
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:21,780
Just the fact that the word content

3346
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:23,780
is something that people bandy about

3347
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:26,780
to just mean like anything that anyone makes

3348
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:28,780
is pretty dystopian.

3349
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:30,780
I mean, I suppose that's true.

3350
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:32,780
I think I might have seen a tweet about this.

3351
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:34,780
But it's like content.

3352
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:36,780
It's just like anything anyone makes

3353
02:11:36,780 --> 02:11:38,780
is just like material.

3354
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:41,780
It's just raw material to be fed through the grinder

3355
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:44,780
of your brain, of the masses.

3356
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:48,780
I absolutely hate the phrase content creator.

3357
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,780
Yeah.

3358
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:51,780
It's the most disgusting way.

3359
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:53,780
It's pretty convenient just because it is so vague.

3360
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:55,780
It is convenient, but it's weird.

3361
02:11:55,780 --> 02:12:01,780
It reduces all art to the same base matter.

3362
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:04,780
Yeah, one of those is that if you're a painter,

3363
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:05,780
you don't say you're a content creator.

3364
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:07,780
You say you're a profession.

3365
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:10,780
Everybody on the internet considers what they do content

3366
02:12:10,780 --> 02:12:12,780
rather than the art that they make

3367
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:14,780
in whatever form it is.

3368
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:16,780
They should just say I'm an artist.

3369
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,780
Don't say you're a digital artist.

3370
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:20,780
Don't say you're an internet artist.

3371
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:22,780
You're an artist. You do a thing.

3372
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:24,780
You just happen to be on the internet.

3373
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:26,780
Here's a quick newsflash.

3374
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:28,780
Ben, did you by any chance just attempt to log into

3375
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:30,780
the t-bap account on Google or anything?

3376
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:32,780
I assume not.

3377
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:34,780
I did, actually.

3378
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:35,780
Oh, you did.

3379
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:36,780
Oh, okay.

3380
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:37,780
Because I was going to say,

3381
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:39,780
someone is attempting to hack our mainframe

3382
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:41,780
Oh, okay. Okay.

3383
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:43,780
Well, never mind that.

3384
02:12:43,780 --> 02:12:47,780
Well, I mean, I'm done.

3385
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:49,780
I've ceased.

3386
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:51,780
Are there any more good questions?

3387
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:52,780
I'm not looking at the...

3388
02:12:52,780 --> 02:12:54,780
Well, I guess I'll open up the Discord.

3389
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:55,780
Fair enough.

3390
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:56,780
I mean, I'm looking.

3391
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:58,780
I'm looking. I don't see much.

3392
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:00,780
What is this?

3393
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:02,780
This is from Dazz Biggles.

3394
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:03,780
One.

3395
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:04,780
Why?

3396
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:05,780
Oh, yes.

3397
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:06,780
Wow.

3398
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:07,780
Band.

3399
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:08,780
Seconds two.

3400
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:10,780
You're in a dangerous woods.

3401
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:11,780
Which is...

3402
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:12,780
Which...

3403
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:13,780
Okay, wait.

3404
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:15,780
You're in a dangerous woods.

3405
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:19,780
Which escaped felon do you partner up with?

3406
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:20,780
A serial killer?

3407
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:21,780
A mass shooter?

3408
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:23,780
Or a tax evader?

3409
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:24,780
Tax evader.

3410
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:25,780
Tax evader.

3411
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,780
He's spry.

3412
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:28,780
He knows how to evade the jungle animals.

3413
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,780
I'm going to go with serial killer

3414
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,780
because I imagine he would be rugged.

3415
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:33,780
That's what I imagine, too.

3416
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:35,780
Mass shooters are like pussy incels.

3417
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:36,780
And probably...

3418
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:38,780
I mean, serial killers, you know,

3419
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:40,780
they have a certain type that they kill

3420
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:42,780
and odds are I'm not his type, right?

3421
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:43,780
Yeah.

3422
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:45,780
They usually kill women or, you know...

3423
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:47,780
Probably women or, you know, something.

3424
02:13:47,780 --> 02:13:49,780
Like, there's something about the people that they kill

3425
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:51,780
that is like, this is the kind of person that I like to kill.

3426
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:53,780
And what are the odds that I fit that...

3427
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:54,780
Oh, no, Ben.

3428
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:55,780
Oh, no.

3429
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:57,780
You've been partnered with the Alternative Lifestyle Killer.

3430
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:58,780
Oh, no.

3431
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:00,780
Oh, no, it's the Keto Killer.

3432
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:01,780
It's the Keto Killer.

3433
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:04,780
I remember reading about him in the newspaper.

3434
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:06,780
Oh, what a coincidence.

3435
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:10,780
Well, if only I had thought that this might have happened.

3436
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:14,780
I would go with the villain, King Dedede.

3437
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:15,780
Oh, yeah, I would, too.

3438
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:16,780
I like that guy.

3439
02:14:16,780 --> 02:14:17,780
He's got that hammer.

3440
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:19,780
No, just escaped convict.

3441
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:22,780
I think his jet-powered hammer would be very useful in this situation.

3442
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:25,780
I think that would really help escape this mood.

3443
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:27,780
Tadpo asks...

3444
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:29,780
Sorry, was anyone else going to answer that one?

3445
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:30,780
No.

3446
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:31,780
It's dead.

3447
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:32,780
It's over.

3448
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:36,780
Tadpo asks a question that I just happened to have an answer for right now.

3449
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:39,780
When have you guys attempted blah, blah, blah, blah.

3450
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:41,780
Cheaper Jerry Rig Solutions.

3451
02:14:41,780 --> 02:14:42,780
Well, okay.

3452
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:45,780
I have a Jerry Rig solution going on right now.

3453
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:49,780
So I had a coffee table and then...

3454
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:52,780
I had a coffee table and no desk, right?

3455
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:54,780
And then someone...

3456
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:56,780
Oh, God, who was it?

3457
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:58,780
It was...

3458
02:14:58,780 --> 02:15:00,780
Okay.

3459
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:03,780
Someone in my Discord, I won't say who it was, bought me a chair.

3460
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:04,780
They bought me a desk chair.

3461
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:05,780
Nice.

3462
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:06,780
It was very...

3463
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:07,780
Oh, wait, it was Ash.

3464
02:15:07,780 --> 02:15:08,780
Yeah, yeah.

3465
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:12,780
Anyway, he bought me a desk chair and I appreciated that a lot.

3466
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:13,780
Thank you.

3467
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:16,780
But now I have this coffee table that was too low.

3468
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:22,780
So I literally just stacked books and just random objects and boxes under each of the four legs.

3469
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:26,780
And the fourth leg is resting on top of a jar of protein powder.

3470
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:28,780
God, that makes me nervous.

3471
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:29,780
I'm already nervous.

3472
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:32,780
I'm shaking and my boots here.

3473
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:43,780
So, yeah, my desk is just kind of on top of stacks of things now, elevated up to more or less desk height.

3474
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:44,780
It shifts around...

3475
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:48,780
Well, the table is actually very stable and I do not see it tipping over.

3476
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:54,780
The one potentially weak link is the jar of the protein powder moves around a little bit.

3477
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:58,780
Sometimes it kind of goes close to the edge where the leg of the table might go over there.

3478
02:15:58,780 --> 02:16:01,780
But the lid just kind of happens to have this ridged left-around edge.

3479
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:02,780
Oh, thank God.

3480
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:03,780
We've done it.

3481
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:04,780
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3482
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:05,780
So, like, it's not...

3483
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:06,780
Full proof.

3484
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:11,780
I would basically have to deliberately kick it out from under.

3485
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:17,780
And also, the final thing is that the weight of the things on the table are mostly at the back.

3486
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:23,780
So if this one were to be kicked out, it would not even tip over because the weight is at the back.

3487
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:30,780
So I would have to kick it out from under it and then apply weight to the front of the table to tip it over, which is not...

3488
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,780
So I feel like it's pretty safe.

3489
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:33,780
Do I want a real desk?

3490
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:34,780
Yes.

3491
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:39,780
But do I think that this one is going to fall over and wreck all my shit?

3492
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:40,780
Probably not.

3493
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:45,780
I don't know about you guys, but my fears are assuaged as hell right now.

3494
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:49,780
Yeah, it's probably going to be fine.

3495
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,780
God, what a nightmare.

3496
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:51,780
I can't see if Ben dies.

3497
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:53,780
If he doesn't die, then it worked out well.

3498
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:58,780
And if he does, well, you know what I mean.

3499
02:16:58,780 --> 02:16:59,780
Well, it wouldn't be me that died.

3500
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:01,780
It would be my sentie.

3501
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:02,780
You could die at any moment, Ben.

3502
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:04,780
Let's not pretend you could.

3503
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:06,780
I've got a Jerry Wrig solution.

3504
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:07,780
I'm tearing.

3505
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:08,780
I'm tearing.

3506
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:09,780
This is kind of...

3507
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:10,780
I mean, it's nothing amazing.

3508
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,780
But, like, forever we Agua, I've filmed.

3509
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:14,780
What I've done is...

3510
02:17:14,780 --> 02:17:16,780
Did I do this for me in MAFA II?

3511
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:17,780
I can't remember.

3512
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:20,780
Like, I do this thing where, like...

3513
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:23,780
You're not supposed to do this, but, like, you know the microphone arm?

3514
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,780
You know, the fucking road one?

3515
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:26,780
What I do is I...

3516
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:28,780
Because that's my mic I record everything with.

3517
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:29,780
I screw it...

3518
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:33,780
I screw, like, the clamp to the arm of a swivel chair.

3519
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:36,780
And I move it out to, like, the center of the floor.

3520
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:39,780
And I kind of just, like, position it so it's not in the shot.

3521
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:43,780
And it kind of is just, like, floating, like, a couple feet below me so it's out of the shot.

3522
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:46,780
But the thing is, that chair swivels extremely easily.

3523
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,780
So, it just, like...

3524
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:54,780
For the lightest gust of wind, if a fucking butterfly beats its wings anywhere in the vicinity,

3525
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:58,780
the chair swivels at mock speed violently out of orbit.

3526
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:03,780
And just results in a whole cavalcade of comedy, if you will.

3527
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:06,780
Nate, do you know that office chairs can explode?

3528
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:07,780
I'm sorry?

3529
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:08,780
What do you mean?

3530
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:11,780
Office chairs can explode because there's pressurized air in there.

3531
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:16,780
Very, very rarely, office chairs can explode and it has killed office workers before.

3532
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:19,780
God, I hope that's me.

3533
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:21,780
Please let it be me next time.

3534
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:23,780
I'll do anything.

3535
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:27,780
It'd be a shame if that were to happen to you, says the creeper.

3536
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:32,780
Yeah, he says, he says, exposing his bare neck to the compressed air chamber.

3537
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:34,780
Please let me continue a little.

3538
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:36,780
Wait, where is there compressed air in an office chair?

3539
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:38,780
It's gotta be, like, the swivel thing, I guess?

3540
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:39,780
I mean, I don't know.

3541
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:41,780
This sounds kind of made up, TBH.

3542
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:42,780
No, no, no, no.

3543
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,780
Sounds like bullshit.

3544
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:45,780
No, no, no, no.

3545
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:49,780
They put nitrogen in there.

3546
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:51,780
If you shake it too much, kaboom.

3547
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:58,780
I want some fan art of Nate dying via explosion caused by an office chair.

3548
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:05,780
I like to imagine that you just sit down on it too hard and then a rocket propels you through your butt,

3549
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:07,780
up your spine, out your head.

3550
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,780
It reminds me of a similar sort of thing.

3551
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:14,780
There is a real thing that, like, sometimes office chairs will break

3552
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:17,780
and they have the center column that swivels.

3553
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:21,780
People have broken the chair, it sat down fast, impaled their own asshole

3554
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:24,780
on the center thing of their chair.

3555
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:25,780
A lot.

3556
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:26,780
A lot.

3557
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:29,780
Yeah, it's truly the worst case scenario.

3558
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:31,780
Let me die instead, just kill me.

3559
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:33,780
I don't want to deal with all that.

3560
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:36,780
It's the beginning of letting me die.

3561
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:39,780
Let this episode die, we're done.

3562
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:43,780
Congratulations again to Sasuke Zero Pro or whatever.

3563
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:46,780
Let me know if you want to be called something else or whatever.

3564
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:48,780
Everybody, he's a big boy.

3565
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:49,780
He did it.

3566
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:52,780
I don't want to be mean.

3567
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:54,780
I do like it.

3568
02:19:54,780 --> 02:19:56,780
I'm sorry for being critical.

3569
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:57,780
That's fine.

3570
02:19:57,780 --> 02:20:00,780
I want to say thank you for everyone who entered though.

3571
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:01,780
It was amazing.

3572
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:02,780
It was an amazing experience.

3573
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:04,780
Absolutely.

3574
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:05,780
It absolutely was.

3575
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:08,780
It was a joy and we got to do more stuff like this.

3576
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:12,780
The next PCP contest coming at you soon, we'll come up with something.

3577
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:15,780
We should start, we should do the race.

3578
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:16,780
We should do a PCP race.

3579
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:18,780
We should do a race, but it's not really a community thing.

3580
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:20,780
I guess that's not the same kind of thing.

3581
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:22,780
We could challenge the viewers to do a race.

3582
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:25,780
We could have a community race and then we could laugh at them.

3583
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:29,780
Oh, like everyone has to upload their own best time.

3584
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:32,780
Yeah, like people did when people were speedrunning sheepovers game.

3585
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:33,780
That was cool.

3586
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:34,780
Oh, dude.

3587
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:35,780
Right.

3588
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:40,780
The biggest annoyance with the PCP race is getting people organized to do it.

3589
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:42,780
If the fans do it, then it's much easier.

3590
02:20:42,780 --> 02:20:43,780
That's true.

3591
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:46,780
And we just commentate like, haha, that guy sucks.

3592
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:47,780
Yeah, that's not as fun.

3593
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:50,780
Remember my breakdown in the Pokemon race?

3594
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:53,780
That was pretty good.

3595
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:56,780
All right, we'll come up with something everybody.

3596
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,780
We'll get back to you.

3597
02:20:57,780 --> 02:20:58,780
Thanks for listening.

3598
02:20:58,780 --> 02:21:01,780
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

3599
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:02,780
$5 tier.

3600
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:03,780
Get the bonus episodes.

3601
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:04,780
Monsters 2.

3602
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:08,780
It's the greatest single form of media ever produced by man.

3603
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:09,780
Listen to it.

3604
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,780
$1 at least.

3605
02:21:10,780 --> 02:21:11,780
And you're in the chat.

3606
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:12,780
You get the questions.

3607
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:13,780
You get all the fun stuff.

3608
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:15,780
And you're hanging out with the cool lads.

3609
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:17,780
So go do all those things.

3610
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:18,780
There's some links.

3611
02:21:18,780 --> 02:21:20,780
Oh, buy the gum road stuff if you want the backers content stuff.

3612
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:22,780
It should be linked below for the...

3613
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:25,780
Oh, man, we're at almost 300 patrons.

3614
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:26,780
Yeah, we are.

3615
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:27,780
We're right about that.

3616
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:28,780
We are at 297.

3617
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:30,780
We are about to break that 300.

3618
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:36,780
The Patreon, the PCB Patreon has been an incredible success over the years.

3619
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:38,780
It's doing absolutely magnificently.

3620
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:39,780
Truly suckers.

3621
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:44,780
It only knew about the Syrian refugees that we were funding to do acts of terrorism with

3622
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:47,780
all the 100% proceeds of the PC on Patreon.

3623
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:49,780
Maybe they wouldn't be so able to give it to them.

3624
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:52,780
Just imagine how it would surge if we revealed that fact.

3625
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:55,780
How much support would flood in if they knew?

3626
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:57,780
Oh, well, I guess they'll never know.

3627
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:58,780
They'll never know.

3628
02:21:58,780 --> 02:21:59,780
They'll never know.

3629
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:00,780
All right, thanks for listening, everybody.

3630
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:01,780
Rest in peace, everyone.

3631
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:03,780
Go rest your ears and eyes and brain.

3632
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,780
Thanks for being here.

3633
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:05,780
Rest in peace.

3634
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:07,780
And we'll see you next week with another one.

3635
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:08,780
Goodbye.

3636
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,780
Goodbye.

3637
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:10,780
Yeah.

3638
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:11,780
Yeah.

3639
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:12,780
Yeah.

3640
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:13,780
Oh.

3641
02:22:13,780 --> 02:22:18,780
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3642
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:23,780
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3643
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:26,780
But I'm not working.

3644
02:22:26,780 --> 02:22:28,780
I'm doing nothing.

3645
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:31,780
My dick, I'm jerking.

3646
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:34,780
Myself, I'm sucking.

3647
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:36,780
I am an asshole.

3648
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:39,780
I am a stupid.

3649
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:42,780
I've got a deadline.

3650
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:44,780
Don't want to do it.

3651
02:22:53,780 --> 02:22:56,780
What the hell is wrong with me?

3652
02:22:56,780 --> 02:23:01,780
I'm supposed to be making money.

3653
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:09,780
I'm supposed to be creating funny things that the people

3654
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:12,780
gladly will pay for.

3655
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,780
Artistic genius.

3656
02:23:14,780 --> 02:23:17,780
That's what they came for.

3657
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:20,780
Instead, I'm tweeting.

3658
02:23:20,780 --> 02:23:27,780
That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling.

3659
02:23:27,780 --> 02:23:30,780
Yeah.

3660
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:33,780
It's quite the burden.

3661
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,780
It's a hard knock life.

3662
02:23:35,780 --> 02:23:37,780
Being a genius.
