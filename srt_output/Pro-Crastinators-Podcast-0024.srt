1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,500
Look at the stars. Look how they shine for you. And everything you do. Yeah, they were all yellow.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I came along. I wrote a song for you. And all the things you do. And it was called yellow.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:36,000
So then I took my turn. Oh, what a thing to have done. And it was all yellow. Your skin.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh yeah, your skin and bones turned into something beautiful. And you know I love you so. You know I love you so.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Digibro. Pro Crastinators. 2016, y'all. Let's do this shit.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Rolled up at Coldplay in 08. Songs were great but the stage play made an impression. I'm guessing the old white folds to the show never give the solicit, but here's my position. I need some invention.

7
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Not iteration, not the basics of emotion, but basic reaction. Some action, suburb of the verse. Suburb of the curses you spit.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Not a clean up, clean cut show, but it's a burp and I dance with the kids. I need some legit.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's that time that you know what they act with the real stuff, the text that this is.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A little bit of it, but shadowing that hell to come. It's a totally complete piece of shit.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So sit back, motherfucker, get lit, cause the podcast is always fucked. You definitely want it quit.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Pro Crastinators podcast. Here back again with all your favorite internet people.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's not yellow!

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh fucking god, you're a host.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right, let's settle it down. I'm your host, the best guy ever, bestie boy.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Fuck you, I ruined the podcast.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Here with all my internet friends, we've got patreon.com.bensaint.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Former internet friends.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, that's right. The DeVoo Collective.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yo.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
21st century digital boy.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
See, the fact is that we can't ever escape each other cause we're all a part of the DeVoo Collective.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's exactly right.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There's no fucking breaking out of this hell.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hip-O-Crit.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It is yellow.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Endless, endless jessicles.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who's ready to argue about Homestuck for an hour, guys.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, feels that way.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And me, the best guy of all.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, today is a couple of times before we've taken suggestions on what the topics been from comments and stuff,

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
but today is a suggestion from a friend of ours, our buddy Nino.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Or, like, Nino90 or something?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nino. You can Google him Nino. We'll put a link to his shit in the bottom.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And, by the way, Quick Plug, he made the coolest song ever, just today we heard it,

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
called Jacoshie on his SoundCloud.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm gonna put a link to that and this shit, too, cause it was so dope, everyone in the world should listen to it.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, everybody go listen to it.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And his topic suggestion was things you just can't get into.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Things you can't get into.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And so, there's no urban dictionary for that shit, we're just gonna have to feel it out ourselves.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, anyone have anything to say on the topic of things you can't get into?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Cause I've just got a bunch of examples, personally.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, I generally think it's annoying when an internet person, like, talks about it and then says it too many times.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And they're like, oh yeah, I can't get into this and I can't get into that.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When I don't get the sense that they're really even trying in the first place.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I feel that something that you just can't get into should be a really special status for a thing.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is that the definition we're gonna use?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
For example, someone's doing a crunchyroll plug and they're like, I tried watching this anime but I just couldn't get into it.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's like, nigga, you don't even care about fucking crunchyroll, you care about anime.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That kind of shit pisses me off.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
People that, I have a friend who I tried to get to play Undertale and he was like, oh, I just can't get into reading things.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I just can't get into reading the text.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was like that, well, yeah.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I agree with DeVoo, but mostly in the context.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't mind if it's like, hey, I'm on this guy's vlogging channel and he listed 10 different shows that people asked him about.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't get into that one, I can't get into that.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But when someone writes a whole review of a movie and they're like, I just couldn't get into it, I'm sorry, guys.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And I'm like, why'd you fucking make a video about it?

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No one cares that you couldn't get into it.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's the least interesting sense.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When they let all these things that they just can't get into be part of their mythos.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
As everyone knows, I'm not the kind of person who can get into this or the person who can get into that.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's so stupid.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I think to some extent, Yahtzee is kind of annoying about that.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He has all these things.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He probably can't get into JRPGs at all, right?

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Proudly wearing their inability to appreciate something on their sleeve is a really obnoxious character trait.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't get into rap or something. I don't listen to any.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not proud of that. I'm kind of ashamed that I don't understand this art form.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Just five minutes ago, before we started the podcast, you were saying, what?

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This rap was done using a beat that wasn't made by the same guy who did the rap. That's terrible.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, no, no, no. I thought it was something else.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He was misinterpreted.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I appreciate that Yahtzee.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't expect everybody to get into everything.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think with something like games, people group them all together.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's all video games, but they're really so different that it's understandable to have ones you can't get into.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm glad that Yahtzee at some point said, I'm not going to cover JRPGs and fighting games anymore.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He cut them out of his life and of his reviews.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's annoying because of his attitude. His attitude is the double-edged sword that makes him who he is.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The approach I'm going to take in this podcast is, for me, anything I can't get into, like Ben said,

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm disappointed in myself. I'm on a constant quest to get into everything.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Stuff that I just can't get into is like a major failing.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
By the way, let's just clarify, not being able to get into something is very different from disliking something that you experience.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Totally different.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They can be the same thing.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It could be the same, but it doesn't have to be.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you watch something and it leaves no impression on you, that's more...

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You seem to have a well-figured outlist and stuff, so why don't you lead the charge here and show us all what we're looking for?

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, I put some thought into this. Mine are a little bit less specific pieces of media or anything I couldn't get into.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There were sort of more things over the years that I've been interested in and just never really found a comfortable place in my life for them.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let me see. I've got three bigger examples here.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Here's my favorite one.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Back in college, me and my buddies...

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What is it?

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's like playing video games with other people.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Unless it's like a fighting game, obviously that is built for that.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But being able to play any kind of game while other people are in the room has always been a big problem for me.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It was particularly an issue when in college, me and my buddies did nothing but sit around and play video games all day.

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When we played Smash Bros. Brawl, it was great. We all had a fantastic time.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But then my buddies would play their favorite RPGs because we all played that kind of shit.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
One of them recommended... I enjoyed being in the area while other people were playing a game. That was great.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Eventually, someone would recommend... I played Tales of Symphonia. That was a game recommended to me at the time.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I played it and my friend, quote-unquote Mike, as he's known, was there.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's just his name.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's just Mike in quotations. That's his name, yeah.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Wait, hang on. I thought he was your quote-unquote friend, Mike.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The term has become interchangeable. He goes by quote.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My quote-unquote friend, quote-unquote Mike.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't really know anything about him.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Everything I know about him is by implication only.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He recommended that I play Tales of Symphonia, and I did.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He, quote-unquote, recommended it.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He, quote-unquote, played this game, and so I, quote-unquote, did.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It was a good game. I liked it a lot, and I beat it.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But the thing was, that game has a Final Fantasy IX kind of multiplayer aspect.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We're in battles.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, god, you played it multiplayer?

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Of course we did, because he wanted to play too.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's how we played Secret of Mana back in the day.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's very different.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Secret of Mana.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And back when we were totally uncritical children, it was fine.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I gotta tell you guys.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
As adults, I'm sure it would be infuriating.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's the thing. Back in the day, me and Ben played all the...

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I would sit right next to Ben, watch him play video games.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We played Secret of Mana together.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It was, I remember those days so fondly. It was fantastic.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But when I got older, playing...

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let me real quickly to clarify the difference between Secret of Mana and Tales of Symphonia.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In Tales of Symphonia, first player does everything,

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and then once you get into one of the random battles,

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
then second player gets control of one of your characters

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
who would ordinarily be controlled by the AI fighting with you.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But the camera still follows player one.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So you're basically a glorified NPC in this game.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Once the battle's over, then player two just sits down as controller

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and fucking player one does everything else.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's not fun, really.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
At the very least, you're going to have such small...

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because it's a fucking JRPG. It's all fucking talking all day,

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then there's a couple cool fights, and then you're out of random battles.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a little sister multiplayer, where it's like,

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
if you're like 15 and you've got a five-year-old sister or brother,

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and they are like, I want to play video games, you're like here.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Secret of Mana is so much better for that,

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
because unless there's pretty few hardcore cutscenes in that game,

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you're always able to just run around and do whatever as player two.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a great game.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But the point is just, when I got older,

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was 17 at the time playing this game with all my friends around.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The thing is, we all wanted to talk, because that's what we always did.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We would sit around, we would talk, and I would get so angry

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
when people would talk over voiced cutscenes,

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and there's a million of those in that fucking game,

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
including little dialogue pop-ups that happened,

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and it infuriating me.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And their presence made the experience horrible for me,

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and my need to hear everything.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They'd be talking to me like, guys, shut up.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm trying to hear the story. I can't hear what they're saying.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Made it horrible for them.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It was terrible for everyone.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
People talking during movies.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I mean, it's a similar issue.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was going to say movies are the same.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Watching movies with people, I just...

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh my God. Watching movies with a fucking woman.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They never shut their goddamn yaps.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then, 20 minutes into the movie,

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know what's happening, because you're fucking shut up.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh my God, why aren't you paying attention, you dumb bitch?

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh my God.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I would actually rather shoot myself in the head with a gun

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
than watch a movie with a woman.

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The time I remember that most strongly was...

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ben might remember this. We were at like a family...

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to say a family reunion.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think at Uncle Andy's house.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And they were playing The Big Lebowski in the basement.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I had always wanted to see The Big Lebowski.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was fairly young at the time, maybe like 18.

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I was excited to see this movie.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And then my fucking cousins and the adults...

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
At this point in my life, I hated alcohol and it terrified me.

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Everyone piled into the basement to hit up the fucking bar.

190
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And they just kept talking.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And they kept talking. And they got louder.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And they got louder. And more people came down.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And they got drunker. And then they were like, hey Nate, what are you doing?

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why are you all by yourself over here, Nate?

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Trying to watch this movie?

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What are you doing, Nate? Why would you be here?

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We're trying to have a party here.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not like you people put on the fucking movie.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I just chose to sit down and watch it.

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're getting away from the topic.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's true.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And even the original thing you're saying

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
sounds a little bit more like a gripe

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
that it does a thing you can't get into.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, no. I don't know.

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let me just clarify it.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
My two-player tells us of Podia.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's definitely the horrible esoteric topic

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that makes no sense in that.

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Alright, we can move on.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
As soon as I finish my point, which is just that

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
we would play other games.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And whenever I wasn't the one

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
who was playing the game, if I just came in

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
to do whatever,

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
it would always be a great time.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
My friend was playing...

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Fuck, what was it? I can't remember.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It doesn't matter. Jesus.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The point is, I've always hated that experience

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and I'd like to be able to do it

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
because I know lots of people have fun doing it.

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Alright, that's my first example,

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but we can move on to somebody else's shit.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hit those.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There's a forest near my house

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and there's this big old tree

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and it's got a thing underneath it

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and I just can't get into it anymore.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I used to be able to...

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But I'm too big now.

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And it makes me really sad.

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Every time!

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I know that feeling.

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I got fat and...

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hit but I'm surprised you can't fit in there, honestly.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, it's a very small...

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You got the big bones. It's his hair.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I do actually have...

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I do actually have a thing.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Now what? I forgot it.

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I forget it.

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Alright, Ben.

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We need more PCPs like you.

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, the points gone?

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, no.

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Right.

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was about the idea that

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
considering what everybody said about

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
getting into something

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and not trying,

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm very much the person who doesn't try.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can get into anything.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's just the actually

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
opening it up and looking at it.

258
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And it set the tree.

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But if somebody really pushes

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
something to be like...

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If something is considered among everybody

262
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
to be really, really good, then I'll look at it

263
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
like Ava or something.

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But sometimes the fact that they're pushing it

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
makes it less appealing.

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's how I feel about Game of Thrones.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't want to get into Game of Thrones

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
because everyone's constantly talking about it.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But it's not that I can't get into it.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry I won't be able to.

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, I'm kind of the same.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm pretty hesitant to pick up a new thing.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's just like...

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Everything sucks.

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So when you pick up a new thing, odds are it's going to suck.

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I never pick up a new thing

277
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
unless it's been recommended to me by

278
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
multiple trusted sources.

279
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't trust any sources.

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I pick up absolutely everything.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If Nate recommends me an anime

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and then independently some other person

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
is like, hey, have you heard about this anime?

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll be like, oh shit, that's twice.

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Maybe there's something to it.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I've never, ever in my life had someone

289
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
whose taste correlated

290
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
with mine enough

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that they could recommend me something

292
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and I would be like, oh yeah,

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that obviously is going to be something I'll like.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well yeah, okay, but you can figure out

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
why they like it and then figure out

296
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
how that relates to what you like.

297
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I guess, but like I said, my method is

298
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
just to literally watch everything.

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I won't be able to trust anyone until I try it.

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Like with Game of Thrones,

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
there's nobody who could tell me

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that it was good

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
in a way that I wanted to watch it.

304
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then finally, the only reason I did

305
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
is because it was like, it was so

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
fucking universal that I was like, I gotta at least

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
let's just fucking, I sat down with Victor

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and I had seen like a few scenes

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
here and there that I thought were kind of cool.

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You know, I'd seen the red wedding on TV

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and I was like, oh alright, that's kind of cool.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So then I watched it,

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
but no one can ever like just talk me

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
into watching something. I have to

315
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
just check out everything.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Except the seasonal anime charts.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Alright, who else has got it?

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I guess, I guess Steven Universe though.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We all kind of talked each other into that one.

320
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I got recommended because all you guys

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
are watching it, so yeah.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Alright, alright, so my first

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
item of things I can't get into

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
is something that I used to be very into.

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And that is Dungeons & Dragons

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and or Tabletop

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
role-playing games in general.

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Now, as a

329
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
youngen, I was very taken

330
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
with my self-image as a

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
quote-unquote nerdy kid

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
as a, you know, as an

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
intellectual, little fucking smart

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
nerd guy. And the image of that

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
on TV portrayed these people

336
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
as playing Dungeons & Dragons.

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I was like, oh I gotta get into Dungeons & Dragons

338
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and I found some stuff, I figured it out.

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I invited all my friends and we all played

340
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Dungeons & Dragons all the time.

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And it was a fine and dandy way to hang out.

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But that's all it really was.

343
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Agreed.

344
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The thing about D&D is

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
like, yeah, ostensibly

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the point of it is to tell

347
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
a story. Like the point of D&D

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
is that a story unfolds.

349
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But like everything about

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the game itself stands in

351
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
the way of good storytelling.

352
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It is all based on fucking...

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I mean, a great Dungeon Master can pull

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
a great story out of even the stupidest

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
scenario. That's fine.

356
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But like, it's all based on random chance.

357
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's all couched in these

358
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
stupid fucking combat mechanics.

359
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Every time I play D&D and there's a fight,

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
every fight takes like hours

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and they're boring because nothing

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
narratively interesting happens during a fight.

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's all just fucking dy-

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And it's like everyone having to wait for everyone else to go. It's the worst.

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I did a pen and paper role play with

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
my friends. We just sort of invented our own

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
rules. We did something really basic.

368
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's the way to go. Make your own rules.

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Whenever we wanted to do something that was fun

370
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
or dialogue focused, I would just

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
simplify the rules. It was basically

372
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
like one of the new Paper Mario games.

373
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We're just like, okay, just one hit

374
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
will kill this enemy, but like five hits

375
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
will kill you. Alright, how about that? No more health points

376
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
today. You know, Ben,

377
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
looking back on it, I think there were exactly

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
two times I had a good time doing RPG stuff.

379
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The first was our like

380
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Homestuck one that you ran. Yes.

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Which was awesome. Spurg. I talk about it

382
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in my interview. Oh, yes.

383
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I was. Yeah, Nate was in that.

384
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was Luke something,

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the guy. I don't remember what I was.

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You were the heir of life. Oh, yeah, it was awesome.

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I brought life.

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Your power set was about animating

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
objects. It was super

390
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
dope. And the other time was

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
do you remember, Ben, back at College

392
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Academy, that guy Kevin

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
the DM. That was like the first time I

394
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
played DM and he fucking killed that

395
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
shit. Me and Nate

396
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
both did the summer program as

397
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
kids where we went to

398
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the point is it was like a thing for smart kids.

399
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And we were in the Mentos Trio

400
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
of the Mentos. Holy shit.

401
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The Mentos Trio is life.

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We gotta go back. We gotta save

403
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
the Mentos Trio for another day. Okay.

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But yeah, they had

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
a class at this thing that was basically just playing

406
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Dungeons and Dragons and the kid who

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the guy, well, not a kid, a guy who ran it

408
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
was this dude Kevin Powers. Yes.

409
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Who had, he was like as tall,

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
extremely white, extremely skinny

411
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
nerd. But he was

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
with the voice of Barry White. He was really into jazz

413
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
music and he had the deepest

414
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
baritone voice I've ever

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
heard in my life. Fuck yeah, Kevin.

416
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And he would

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
he would roll the dice and be like, uh

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I, is there a, I attack the monster

419
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and he'd be like, mmm, the kobold

420
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
reels back from the savage

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
blow of your mighty war hammer.

422
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He was such a badass. Roll for damage.

423
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That was the best

424
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that was the best possible experience

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
of D&D playing that. You guys

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
you know, I've noticed an issue with all

427
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
of your things so far is

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I can't, one thing I can't

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
get into is such and such. Except for that one

430
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
time I totally got into it.

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's kind of going against the spirit of the thing.

432
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You know what, Ben admitted that he used to be into it.

433
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let me, let me bring it, let me bring it

434
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to, let me bring it to why I can't stand

435
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
it now. One, the rules

436
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
are cumbersome and there's too many of

437
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
them. Two,

438
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
playing it with people is a nightmare because

439
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
when you get together everyone has their own idea

440
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
for how to have fun playing it and

441
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
combat takes for fucking ever and

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
everyone else's turn is the most boring

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
thing in the world. Only your own turn is interesting

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and it is a minority of the experience.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You just fucking sit around

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and do nothing and just fucking

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
deal with all this rule-y bullshit and I fucking

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
hate it. I hate it so much.

449
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's not like inherent.

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The inherent format isn't a problem

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
for you. It's just like the, it's

452
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
about the way it's always done. No, it is the format.

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Some people like it. No, no, no.

454
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There are better games

455
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
than D&D that have less crunchy

456
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
rules and are less annoying about it.

457
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I still think they kind of end up being

458
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
annoying because of the social aspect.

459
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
D&D itself

460
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think is a particularly bad game.

461
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I think for me, because

462
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm piggybacking on yours, I also can't

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
get into tabletop games and just like

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you it was a thing that I grew up thinking

465
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
looked cool and like obviously

466
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
it was like what all the big kids did instead

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
of like, you know, like it's

468
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
like a bit better than video games

469
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
because it's real and tactile and you're making

470
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
it up yourself. Hold on, dude.

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I remember specifically in your old Q&A

472
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you said that like you could just play Arkham Horror

473
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for two weeks if the power went out and you'd

474
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
have a great time because you had done that

475
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
before when the power went out one time.

476
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, shit. Yeah, we did do that

477
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and Arkham Horror is not really a role-play

478
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
game so much as like Arkham Horror.

479
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I had no idea what it was. I had no idea

480
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
what it was. I thought maybe it's a prequel

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to one of the Batman games, the board game

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
edition. I don't know. Yeah, that's what it is.

483
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a HP Lovecraft inspired board game

484
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
that's so intricately

485
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
intricate in the way you play it.

486
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, by the way, David, they're both inspired

487
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
by Arkham from Lovecraft.

488
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So, but yeah, like that's

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
sort of a different thing, but like with pen and paper

490
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
which I'm not that into board games either

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
at all, just because

492
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
they take so fucking long to set up and do everything.

493
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Sam, I used to be into board games and now

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I just think... Oh, that's why

495
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that's like the best part in the board game series

496
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
when he has this one board game

497
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
that he's gonna play and like it's like five minutes

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of him explaining how to set it up and

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Motherfucker Mike is like, okay, when you're

500
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
gonna be finished setting it up and he's like,

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
well, you see, you also have to get these stats

502
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
in the right way and you gotta do this and you gotta do that.

503
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And it's like this huge montage of saying everything

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
up and then at the end he's like, alright,

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm all ready to go and Mike is bored and leaves.

506
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Like, I'm gonna go now and I just like, oh man,

507
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
that's totally agreed

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and relate to that, man. That's also

509
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
the Dungeons and Dragons experience because

510
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
every player's turn

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
lasts too fucking long

512
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and nobody else is

513
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
like, unless you guys are like really

514
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
tightly packed as a group

515
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
into whatever event you're doing,

516
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
if everyone's doing something even slightly different

517
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
it's not relevant to anyone else.

518
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So the second one guy gets his turn, everyone

519
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
else gets on their phones and starts fucking

520
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
texting other people and just wants to be anywhere

521
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
else because they don't care about what's going on in your fucking

522
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
story, especially if you're fighting something.

523
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, nobody cares and then like in order

524
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
to make the story at all interesting or to

525
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
accommodate anybody's creativity,

526
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
then our DM would just like, you know,

527
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
basically say fuck most of the rules.

528
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Like he would just be like, alright, well whatever.

529
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then eventually it got to a point

530
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
where we're like, well the story's not going anywhere

531
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
because it was just all of us

532
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
we're not fucking story

533
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
writers, we have no sense of narrative

534
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
progression, we're just digging around.

535
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There's too many conflicting ideas going on.

536
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
My brother is great with that. We were in the final battle

537
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
of one of our game

538
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and like the boss was about

539
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
to like unleash their ultimate attack

540
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and I don't want any of the characters to

541
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
die, so like the final attack

542
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
is like heading towards my brother's character

543
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and he's like, okay what do you do? And he's like

544
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I slice it with my sword

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and he rolls a two

546
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and that's like a failure. I hit it

547
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
with the...

548
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He got a two so he did it twice.

549
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I hit it with the butt of my sword, he rolled a one.

550
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I hit it with my left butt cheek, he rolled a one.

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I tried to like fart in its general direction

552
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and it rolled a two. He just kept getting further

553
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and further into like abstract ways of

554
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
attacking until finally he rolled a four

555
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and it succeeded.

556
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And he's great.

557
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That does not sound like any kind

558
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
of Dungeons and Dragons I have.

559
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's basically who my brother is like.

560
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Because like I was physically moving

561
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the attack towards his character so he kept

562
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
running out of time and had to come up with it

563
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
like in the span of a few seconds and it was glorious.

564
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And so that's how...

565
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I think I'm just

566
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
a lot less interested in the creativity

567
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
of my friends than I am in the creativity

568
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
of anyone who is trained

569
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
as an artist.

570
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Related point,

571
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
my interest in

572
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Dungeons and Dragons and board games pretty much

573
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
completely died

574
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
exactly at the moment that I became

575
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
interested in drawing and making my own

576
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
shit.

577
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's such a waste of time compared to that.

578
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Sure is.

579
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's a creative endeavor only you don't get anything

580
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
out of it.

581
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You're doing it with a bunch of people who aren't

582
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
creatives and have no stake

583
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
in becoming creative people because

584
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
they're not trying to do that

585
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
as a passion in your career.

586
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You can see that by the way.

587
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
On your first session of D&D every time

588
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
it's everyone making their character.

589
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Nobody knows how to fucking make their character.

590
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It was like an entire fucking game.

591
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So I guess what I would do in the future

592
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
is just you roll a six-sided die

593
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and six means super successful.

594
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Five means very successful.

595
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And then one means a huge failure.

596
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So you just decide what you're going to try to do

597
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and you roll for the success level.

598
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let's see, there's a problem

599
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
even with that because the fact that your actions

600
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
are controlled by a random chance

601
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
means that the narrative that you want to

602
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
happen is not guaranteed to.

603
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Going into trying to have a narrative

604
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
is not the way to go man.

605
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, I mean

606
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
part of the idea of it is that

607
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
an interesting story is crafted.

608
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Part of the idea is that an interesting

609
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
story can emerge through random chance.

610
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That's absolutely right.

611
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The story that me and my friends did

612
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
was interesting to us because...

613
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But it won't because people aren't able to handle it.

614
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Because what happened was one of my friends...

615
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Do you want to take that risk

616
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
hundreds of hours, I don't know, dozens of hours

617
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
on a campaign that might be shit?

618
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I think it's pretty much inevitably going to be interesting

619
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
with the right people because what happened was

620
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
my friend kept...

621
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We had all the characters lined up on a grid

622
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and stuff and one of my friends

623
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
kept happening to

624
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
move in just the right spaces

625
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
to constantly be in a circumstance

626
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
where she would probably trip

627
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
in the universe and so it became

628
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a completely accidental running gag

629
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
that her character gets knocked over

630
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or trips or falls.

631
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It was totally organic and at one point

632
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
another character trips

633
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
into one of the NPCs and just the way

634
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the dialogue ended up happening

635
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
he became one of the main characters

636
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and I ended up having to play a character

637
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
coming. It was so cool.

638
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then there was one side character

639
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
exhibiting very suspicious behavior

640
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
just because I couldn't come up with

641
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
what the secrets were.

642
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The point is I had to come up with a whole

643
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
secret special twist

644
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
on the go as I was going

645
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and it turned out to be an incredible twist

646
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that I wouldn't be able to explain here.

647
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But yeah, a lot of really interesting...

648
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I came up with a whole lore about...

649
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Is this the D&D cost or what?

650
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, I know.

651
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I remember wanting to do it

652
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
with all the cool things that he did

653
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
with his friends doing D&D.

654
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The thing is...

655
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The point is Ben can't get into it, right?

656
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That's all we're saying.

657
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Fun things can happen and like

658
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
it can be really interesting and entertaining

659
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and also a good way to hang out with friends

660
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and all that stuff is cool.

661
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I just think that it's way more pain than pleasure

662
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and that the amount of bullshit you have to deal with

663
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
to get those benefits

664
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
are not worth it.

665
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Alright, and the case has been made

666
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and it has been contested and that's fine.

667
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Let's move on to the next one.

668
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Jesse, you got something you can't get into here?

669
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah.

670
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
There's a...

671
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
There's this webcomic.

672
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This...

673
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's pretty popular.

674
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's like kind of a webcomic

675
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but I guess it's also kind of like a shitty video game.

676
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't know.

677
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The art style is really gay.

678
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The characters...

679
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What's it called? Something about homos.

680
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Something about homos and suck.

681
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Ah, my god.

682
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Is it...

683
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is it Homestar Runner?

684
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Is that what you're talking about?

685
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I like Homestar Runner personally.

686
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ringback Homestar.

687
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Here's the thing with Jesse is that

688
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
if something is introduced to him in a contentious way

689
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that he'll never be able to like...

690
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
God damn it!

691
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't even fucking start because

692
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
you're not going to goad me into a fight.

693
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay?

694
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Because I thought about this long and hard.

695
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay?

696
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
No one here is going to say some stupid shit

697
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
or infer some far out bullshit

698
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
about me that's going

699
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to fucking get my blood pressure up.

700
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not going to have it. I'm not going to allow it

701
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
because I have constructed

702
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the perfect

703
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
argument proof

704
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
example of why I can't

705
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
get into Homestuck.

706
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We're all going to sit down.

707
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We're going to sit in a circle.

708
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We're going to have a calm, familial discussion.

709
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We're going to have a Thanksgiving turkey.

710
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I can do that if you can.

711
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We're going to sip hot tea.

712
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
We're going to fucking play some oriental music

713
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
on like some strings.

714
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We're just going to go to a fucking Chinese restaurant

715
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and we're going to turn on some yellow lights

716
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to light everything.

717
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't know what those are.

718
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't think that yellow lights

719
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
are actually a thing that exists.

720
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
They do it in a Chinese restaurant.

721
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
All the lights they put up are yellow lights.

722
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm making a racial joke.

723
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay, go on.

724
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And what a joke it was.

725
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Okay.

726
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Homestuck.

727
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's fucking gay.

728
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There it is!

729
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
There it is!

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It was all worth it.

731
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It was all worth it.

732
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't even

733
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
disagree that it's gay.

734
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's pretty gay.

735
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It is both ways.

736
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's homosexual

737
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and it's gay as well.

738
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I figured out the mental block

739
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
for real.

740
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
If something is

741
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
really long

742
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
but grabs me immediately

743
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I can give it a chance.

744
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
If something doesn't

745
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
grab me immediately

746
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
but it's short and manageable

747
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I can give it a chance.

748
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Homestuck is both really long

749
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and doesn't immediately grab me.

750
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So that's just the two factors

751
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
right at once.

752
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I know there's

753
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
some people say that it's

754
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
boring at the beginning and it only gets interesting

755
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
later when the trolls

756
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
or the time travel shit comes in.

757
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm not saying that's what you think Jesse.

758
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't think that's you.

759
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
A lot of people do say that.

760
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
For one totally disagree

761
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I think Homestuck is

762
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
maybe not on the first page

763
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
but definitely within the first act.

764
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's really interesting.

765
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I was also one of the people who

766
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
heard that

767
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Victor read it before I did

768
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and I just saw him reading it

769
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and I'd never fucking heard of it at all.

770
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So I saw him reading it

771
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and

772
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
he was in Act 3

773
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and he didn't really start enjoying it

774
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
until late into Act 3

775
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and he was like I don't know

776
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it doesn't really get good for a long time

777
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and I was like I'll just read 5 pages

778
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and if I'm not into it I'm not going to read it

779
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
because it's fucking long.

780
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I read page 1 and I was like

781
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
this is the funniest thing I've ever read in my life

782
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm going to read all of this.

783
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's funny right off the bat.

784
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I don't know what people don't.

785
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's got its own sense of humor

786
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
that you have to adjust to a little bit.

787
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's funny but there's also a lot of these

788
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
long dialogue

789
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
that you have to scale.

790
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah but that's where the jokes are.

791
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The way I got into Homestuck

792
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
is that I saw...

793
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Jess is the only one of us who

794
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
reads books.

795
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
He's way more than all of us.

796
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's true.

797
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What were you saying?

798
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
He was saying that.

799
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I got into Homestuck because of

800
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff.

801
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Me too!

802
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I saw that and I thought

803
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
the guy who made this was hilarious.

804
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I got to read the main thing.

805
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Dude, encourage me.

806
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Shut up Nate!

807
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Remember before the podcast started

808
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
when Nate was like I'm going to really try

809
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
not to cut anybody off.

810
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I make tactical insertions

811
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
where I think people are going to stop.

812
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The way that the rest of us do it

813
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is someone starts talking

814
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and we just wait for them to finish their point.

815
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I can't afford to take that risk.

816
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Sorry, go on Gib.

817
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I forgot now.

818
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You were saying you got into it through

819
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Hella Jeff and Bro.

820
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I didn't find

821
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
the very first act to be that as funny

822
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but I kind of got it.

823
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I feel like I would have

824
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
stuck through it anyway but

825
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't know.

826
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Me and my buddies

827
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
in college

828
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
we didn't even know Homestuck existed

829
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
but we read

830
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
all of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff

831
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
thought it was the best thing ever

832
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and had no idea about Homestuck.

833
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I think until Ben showed me that Homestuck existed

834
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and was a thing

835
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and frankly I yearned for those days

836
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
before I knew.

837
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I had seen Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff

838
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I didn't really know.

839
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I got into Sweet Bro through Homestuck

840
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
but the existence of Sweet Bro

841
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and Hella Jeff is one of the best things

842
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
about Homestuck.

843
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
In the universe

844
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
there is this fucking

845
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
comic that exists

846
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that one of the characters makes

847
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and most of the

848
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
best memes in Homestuck

849
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
are not external memes

850
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
but are memes that were generated by the author

851
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
within this in-universe continuity

852
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff.

853
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Reading the end recently

854
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
when Caliborn gets ripped

855
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
it was fantastic.

856
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We've got Tom joining us.

857
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Tom are you recording?

858
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I am recording.

859
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So

860
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
should we see Test right now?

861
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't want to go too much into Homestuck

862
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
on account of

863
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
we I think will have a Homestuck

864
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
podcast at some point

865
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
once everyone finishes the story.

866
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
In all honesty

867
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm so fucking tired of fighting

868
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
with you shitwits

869
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
so fucking I was fighting with these

870
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
dumb motherfuckers for like an hour

871
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
because they okay

872
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you know what let's just get into this

873
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sick of holding it inside

874
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
We should get into this now because Jesse

875
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
isn't invited to the real Homestuck podcast

876
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
so this is the time to air his grievances

877
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
No this isn't about that he's about to talk about

878
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
lights about yellow

879
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh fuck nevermind okay

880
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
These fucking guys they all fucking ganged up on me

881
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
it was like the people versus endless Jess

882
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It wasn't ganging up on you

883
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No no

884
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No oh you were being aggressively wrong

885
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
every single one of you stupid idiots

886
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
objectively aggressively wrong

887
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
saying that my fucking video

888
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
looked yellow it does not look

889
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
yellow and you know what Jesse

890
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm gonna post those fucking pictures

891
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
in the chat

892
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I hope you do

893
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You post those videos

894
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and don't even say anything

895
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
don't say who did what and just say which one looks better

896
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I dare you

897
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Wait is the question which one looks better

898
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
or is it yellow

899
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Okay well that too

900
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Well nobody's

901
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
contesting which one looks better

902
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I mean Nate might be because he has a personal opinion

903
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There you go

904
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I have also my own illustration that I put together

905
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
where I compare the individual

906
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
like pieces of Jesse's face

907
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
in almost all of his videos

908
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
like where it's got the um

909
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
the lighting that he has in almost all of his videos

910
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
versus

911
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
did we explain what the issue was

912
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Jesse's videos he has a certain style of

913
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
lighting that all of us identify has

914
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
yellow lighting

915
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
but Jesse disagrees that it's yellow

916
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
lighting

917
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
even though I officially

918
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm done

919
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I thought we were gonna try to make these enraged Jesse less

920
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's just called incandescent lighting

921
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I have an illustration of a visual

922
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
a graph that compares

923
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
like the actual colors

924
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
of his face and his beard

925
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
in that one scene

926
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
in one of his horseshoe reviews where he goes outside

927
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and it's a totally different

928
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
less yellow color

929
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I would even say that

930
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Jesse's argument that

931
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the color is normal

932
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
is also true

933
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
it is normal to live

934
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
in an incandescently

935
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
lit room because

936
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
most people have those type of light bulbs

937
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
it's just that the type of light that that is

938
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
is called yellow light

939
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't disagree necessarily

940
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
that the lighting in that one

941
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
shot that I used of you being outside

942
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
is worse that might be true

943
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
you know because you just grabbed

944
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
the camera and talked out

945
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I thought the outside shot looked way better

946
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
the outside shot looks like shit you're objectively

947
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
longer

948
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
the real issue is that

949
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
these people do not know what

950
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
yellow looks like they don't they literally

951
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
do not know what the color is

952
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
you don't fucking DeVoo proved that it's yellow

953
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
DeVoo proved himself wrong

954
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
these guys

955
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
they made images to try and

956
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
show me how wrong I was

957
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and the images proved them wrong

958
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and they can't accept it

959
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
in the video of you being outside

960
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
your face looks like pinkish grey

961
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
in the video of you being outside

962
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Jesse what the

963
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that's not an argument you're just making

964
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
retarded noises

965
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
in the basement

966
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
your face looks like pitch yellow

967
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
what's up everybody did you bro here

968
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
feeling uh

969
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
existential having a smoke

970
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
drunk after the end of that

971
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
podcast thinking about

972
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
my philosophical take on the color yellow

973
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
you know this shirt is obviously

974
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
yellow the light

975
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
being cast on me is actually from a fluorescent

976
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
light from inside of the

977
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
from inside of the

978
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
garage here

979
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I feel like my face

980
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
tone is pretty close to my shirt tone

981
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and yet this is definitely blue

982
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
light but you can tell that's blue the sky

983
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
is definitely blue and I

984
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
look over here see now that looks white

985
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the you can tell that the white

986
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
the light is white or blue

987
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
rather which is what white light

988
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
is considered yet when it's

989
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
shining on me

990
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I don't really look

991
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't really look white I look more

992
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
yellowy but I look over

993
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
here and behind me

994
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I can see

995
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
what are clearly

996
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
more clearly off camera

997
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
than on yellow lights

998
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
in the distance you can't even see me now probably

999
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
because it's quite dark out

1000
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
but I'm thinking about the street lights right

1001
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and how

1002
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
like I would always think of a street light

1003
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
as yellow

1004
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but what is yellow

1005
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
as a concept like

1006
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I think we'd all agree this

1007
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
the light on my cigarette is yellow

1008
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but does yellow

1009
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
mean a color that an object

1010
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
is

1011
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
or can lighting be

1012
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
yellow

1013
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
we can agree that

1014
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
a monitor represents things in colors

1015
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
a camera captures

1016
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
things in colors but does light

1017
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
actually

1018
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
emit

1019
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
colors

1020
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
a different thing

1021
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
is the sky blue

1022
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
is my shirt

1023
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
my shirt is definitely yellow

1024
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
but if I have a yellow light on me

1025
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
am I

1026
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
yellow

1027
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
what does yellow mean

1028
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know what yellow means anymore

1029
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I have lost track

1030
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
of the meaning of yellow

1031
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I

1032
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I guess yellow

1033
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
like most things means what we want it to mean

1034
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about

1035
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
character with yellow skin

1036
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
like that's what your face looks like

1037
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
do you people at home

1038
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
do you hear how these morons are ganging up on me

1039
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
they're so fucking insecure about how wrong they are

1040
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
they just can't accept it

1041
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
do you think people are supposed to look like

1042
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I want to clarify

1043
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
simpsons characters are not what real humans look like

1044
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
we're not actually yellow in real life

1045
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
you're saying my video looks like a simpsons character

1046
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
you're that fucking stupid

1047
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
you have to understand where I'm coming from

1048
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
at least

1049
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
three years of watching your videos

1050
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and in most of them being yellow

1051
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I think some of them are lit by other means

1052
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
but most of your videos have been

1053
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
yellow for all this time

1054
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and you know like

1055
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
here's how dumb these people are

1056
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
digi goes

1057
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
look jesse I'll show you a picture from one of my videos

1058
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
that also looks yellow

1059
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
he shows me a picture

1060
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
it also doesn't look yellow at all

1061
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
so it's yellow lighting

1062
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
it's what it's called

1063
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I don't care what it's called if it's wrong digi

1064
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
it's objectively not yellow

1065
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
by the way we've been having this argument for three fucking years

1066
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
just so everyone knows

1067
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
this is not the first time the yellowness

1068
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
of jesse's videos has come into question

1069
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't know if you've been around for the last one

1070
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
but this is like an ongoing battle

1071
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
for all time longer than the homestuck

1072
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
first of all you're mischaracterizing

1073
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
this is not about the yellowness of my videos

1074
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
plural because not all my videos

1075
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
are professionally lighted and professionally made

1076
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
most of my videos are like vlogs

1077
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't care about the lighting

1078
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
any time that I put effort into the lighting

1079
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it looks beautiful it looks perfect

1080
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I think great if you don't disagree

1081
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
with those two statements

1082
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I disagree

1083
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I don't think any jesse video has beautiful visuals

1084
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
or lighting

1085
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that may be the true

1086
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but let's not even get into it

1087
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
we can't get into jesse's yellow

1088
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
lighting or at least ben can't

1089
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
in fact we shouldn't even be on this topic

1090
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
at all because it has nothing to do with the

1091
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
topic of the podcast so let's just

1092
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
move on alright no it does because

1093
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I can't get into the insane frame of

1094
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
mind that you people are in

1095
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
that you see yellow where there was no fucking yellow

1096
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I can't get into it

1097
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
to format where you could talk about literally anything

1098
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
to clarify what I just said

1099
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I only mean that I don't think that

1100
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
you know like good like high quality

1101
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
visuals are one of the things people come

1102
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
to a jesse video like that's not something I would

1103
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
say that like the jesse channel

1104
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
no matter what you say jesse is not going to listen

1105
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
it's not going to matter I'm not talking to jesse

1106
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
oh my god and let's talk about that okay

1107
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
because they can't handle that he's wrong so he could

1108
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
sound this high horse about oh jesse just never listens

1109
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
to criticism he can't handle he can't

1110
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
handle my hardcore criticism

1111
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
my construction I'm just saying that you get

1112
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
angry when people criticize your shit

1113
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
no no no I get angry when people criticize

1114
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
it wrong I get angry with wrong

1115
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
criticism because your criticism is objectively

1116
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
not true I don't care if gibbons

1117
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
playing guitar you can play your guitar

1118
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
you can sing your little gay boy songs all you want

1119
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
it's not going to stop me it's not going

1120
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
to quell this fire it's not going to

1121
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
put the fire out gibbons you can play all night

1122
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't care

1123
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it's not yellow it's not

1124
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
it's not yellow

1125
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
what's something you can't get into

1126
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't even understand

1127
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
what are you protecting enough

1128
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
oh this is my hill to die on

1129
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
what are you people saying

1130
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it's not yellow

1131
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
it is not

1132
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
this isn't even like this has nothing to do

1133
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
this is not me going like oh my videos

1134
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
are great don't critique my videos

1135
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
this has nothing to do with whether I think it looks good

1136
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
or not

1137
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
this is not black

1138
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
it's not yellow they just

1139
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
are yellow

1140
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
we feel the same way

1141
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
towards you about this issue like how can you

1142
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
not see it

1143
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
you guys are seeing that isn't there

1144
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
you don't know what yellow is

1145
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I can show you a picture of the color yellow

1146
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and you look at it and go yep that's yellow

1147
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and then I show you my video

1148
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
perfect the fact that it is not

1149
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
like hashtag

1150
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
FF0069

1151
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
good job

1152
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
it's not the issue

1153
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
is that actually the yellow

1154
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
is it

1155
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
do you think it looks good

1156
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
you said it like this

1157
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I wanted to make a shirt called

1158
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
it's pitch white and the text is

1159
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm hashtag

1160
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
fucking white

1161
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
because that's the code

1162
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I get it

1163
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
what's the bottom line is that I made a video

1164
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that looked fucking natural

1165
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and beautiful and Nate's like

1166
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
oh I'll show you how yellow it is

1167
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and he like color corrected and makes an image

1168
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
this looks so much worse

1169
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
ok so this room

1170
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
looks one way right

1171
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and this room looks another way

1172
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
cause this room

1173
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
is lit

1174
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
with fluorescent light

1175
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
no this one is incandescent light

1176
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
and this one is fluorescent light

1177
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
incandescent light

1178
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
is referred to as

1179
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
yellow or warm light

1180
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
whereas

1181
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
fluorescent light is referred to as

1182
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
blue or white

1183
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
light

1184
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
so

1185
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
this this room

1186
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
it looks normal

1187
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
this is what a normal room looks like

1188
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and

1189
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
you could say

1190
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
that it's technically not

1191
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
like nothing in the room is yellow

1192
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
the room is not yellow and even the light

1193
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
isn't

1194
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
technically yellow it's just that

1195
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
it has more yellow values

1196
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
like the values

1197
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
in what is being presented through the monitor

1198
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm like look at my hand right now

1199
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
like

1200
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
yeah it is skin colored

1201
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
my hand is skin colored

1202
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
but it does look

1203
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
different

1204
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
in this light

1205
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
it is still skin colored

1206
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
but the lighting looks different

1207
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and the way that that lighting

1208
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
is represented

1209
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
by a computer monitor

1210
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
is to use more

1211
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
yellow values

1212
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
whereas in here it's more white values

1213
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
this is more white

1214
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
this is more yellow values

1215
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
this is more white values or blue

1216
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
blue values rather is what I mean to say

1217
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
yellow light

1218
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
both are normal

1219
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
both I would describe

1220
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
as normal light

1221
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
a lot of people think this kind of light

1222
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
looks cleaner

1223
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and I do think this kind of light

1224
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
is very appropriate for the videos of someone

1225
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
like MKBHD where he's talking about technology

1226
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
because it's a very pristine

1227
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
look to it you can see more

1228
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
detail in

1229
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
in white light it's easier

1230
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
to pick out every individual

1231
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
you know

1232
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
in yellow light

1233
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
it's more of this homie

1234
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
nostalgic feel

1235
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
when you think yellow light

1236
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
you think I am in a house

1237
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and I think that if the

1238
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
concept of your video

1239
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
is that I am in

1240
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
a house

1241
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
then yellow light is appropriate

1242
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
because whenever I see white light

1243
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
like I said it makes sense in an MKBHD video

1244
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
because he's talking about technology

1245
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
but I always feel like it doesn't look like a real place

1246
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
it doesn't look like his room

1247
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
it doesn't look like a place where a person lives

1248
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
because no one lives in this

1249
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I would not be able to live in a room

1250
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that looked like this

1251
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
so to me having a room be

1252
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
oh god my food's done

1253
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
you know what I'm saying

1254
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it doesn't matter if it looks worse

1255
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the point is it looks less yellow

1256
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
which it does

1257
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
my videos does not look yellow in the first place

1258
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
so no it does not look less yellow

1259
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
it just looks like a different color

1260
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
because it's yellow

1261
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
it's gotta be one color

1262
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
which other color is it

1263
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I can't fucking believe

1264
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
that you guys are all seeing yellow

1265
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
there's no I'm fucking

1266
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
my wig is blown off

1267
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
which color is it if it isn't yellow

1268
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm losing my fucking mind here

1269
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
it's not a color

1270
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
you know what I just realized that I still have my flux on

1271
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
so maybe that's why

1272
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm seeing all this yellow

1273
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I just have to turn off flux

1274
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
what's the thing that you can't get into

1275
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
um

1276
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I have a couple things

1277
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
one of them I said is I can't get into going to concerts

1278
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
oh

1279
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
okay that's a good one

1280
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I agree with you but I'm still fucking pissed off

1281
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I feel the same Tom

1282
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
could you give us any anecdotes

1283
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I mean I haven't even really gone

1284
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
to like any like big concerts

1285
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
but even just like small ones that I've gone with like friends

1286
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and shit

1287
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I enjoy listening to music

1288
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
just and like kind of getting lost

1289
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
in it and I feel like when I'm at a concert

1290
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
there's like a bunch of fucking people that I hate

1291
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
because I hate people

1292
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
they're all around me and like people are like

1293
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
fucking just like crowded together

1294
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
and I mean it's fucking good

1295
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
because like you're like fucking far away from a stage

1296
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
and I don't know

1297
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the appeal of like oh it's the band

1298
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
playing the music live I'm like I don't give a shit about the band

1299
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I give a shit about the music

1300
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
so I

1301
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm the last concert I went to

1302
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
was last year's BronyCon

1303
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I think that's the last time

1304
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and I mean that was cool and all

1305
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
because it was a thing

1306
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
but like now when I think about going to a concert

1307
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I think I would have to physically travel there

1308
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
which is annoying I would have to buy a ticket

1309
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
which is really annoying

1310
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and it would take

1311
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
like my whole day or like my whole evening

1312
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
which is like I just can't bear

1313
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I can't bear the bottom

1314
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
let's call it what it is

1315
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
what you're getting out of that

1316
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
is these famous people

1317
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and you're going to you know socialize

1318
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and that's fine that's what you want to do

1319
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
but that's what you're paying for really

1320
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and to hear songs that you may or may not like

1321
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
when I go to concerts

1322
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
it's usually because like my parents have taken me

1323
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
or friends have taken me so I didn't have to pay

1324
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
so in that way I'm just experiencing

1325
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
it's the experience of like being in a huge

1326
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
it's being in a huge stadium

1327
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
the appeal that I find

1328
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
is not necessarily that the music

1329
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
is there because I can listen to it whenever

1330
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
it's that it's just

1331
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
being in a stadium is really cool

1332
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
because it's all echoing really loud

1333
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and it is heard afterwards

1334
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
the best concert I ever went to was

1335
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
on my birthday

1336
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
my buddy

1337
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Rich came up from New Jersey

1338
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
is this relevant to the topic of not being able

1339
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
to get into concerts at all

1340
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
it is because I got into this girl

1341
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
who I finger banged on the dance floor

1342
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
you told the story already actually

1343
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
did I?

1344
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I was able to get into it

1345
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Jesse why aren't you able to get into concerts

1346
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I want to hear everybody before I chime in

1347
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Jesse you still there

1348
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
he killed himself he did

1349
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
man that was a great joke that I could have made

1350
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
oh there's this this girl

1351
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
you know I'm just walking around

1352
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and there's so many things that are yellow

1353
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and none of them look like my video

1354
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I was waiting for it

1355
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
no yellow thing

1356
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
looks like my video

1357
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
do you understand color?

1358
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
it's not yellow it's a yellow tint sir

1359
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
it's not even a tint

1360
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
let's just categorically redefine

1361
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
what yellow is so we can say the video

1362
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
that's what you guys have been doing this whole time

1363
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Jesse if your lighting is yellow

1364
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
there wouldn't everything in your room

1365
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
be yellow by necessity

1366
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
that's it that's it he can't see

1367
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
yellow because he's been saturated

1368
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
what the fuck

1369
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I told you there's so much thing

1370
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
it's yellow lighting

1371
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
there's a problem

1372
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
in thinking about light in the way I'm describing

1373
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
it's mostly philosophical

1374
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
do we want to say

1375
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
that light can be yellow

1376
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
or do we want to say that this is what yellow is

1377
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I think if you were in defense

1378
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
of yellow as a color

1379
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
if you wanted to be a purist about what yellow is

1380
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
then we shouldn't refer to yellow light

1381
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
we should refer to incandescent

1382
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
or fluorescent light

1383
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
each of which does have its own meaning

1384
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and looks different however

1385
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
not necessarily

1386
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
a color

1387
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't know man

1388
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
is it an insult to say that somebody's

1389
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
video looks yellow

1390
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
what world do we live in

1391
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
what universe am I in

1392
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
where the fuck am I

1393
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that we can even talk about this

1394
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
why is this happening

1395
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
why is this the world

1396
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
does he notice the difference

1397
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or he would think it looks better when he has flux on

1398
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
or I don't know

1399
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
shut up I am not the crazy one here

1400
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
you stupid motherfuckers

1401
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I am sick of being vilified

1402
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and treated like I'm the guy who's crazy here

1403
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I am not the one who's crazy

1404
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
you are all crazy

1405
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
when everyone else

1406
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
everyone else in the world

1407
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
is crazy

1408
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Jesse it's all

1409
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
yes I am the only sane man

1410
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
in a mad mad mad mad world

1411
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
as we've clearly established multiple times

1412
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
you have the history of this podcast

1413
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Jesse would you like to weigh in

1414
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
to why you can't get into live shows

1415
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
concerts

1416
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
we have to make a yellow video

1417
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
so that you can all see what a yellow video actually looks like

1418
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
if that was gonna happen

1419
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
who's got a thing a digi

1420
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I was gonna go in the opposite direction

1421
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I love concerts

1422
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I go to them all the time

1423
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
for me it's

1424
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I guess because I grew up with them

1425
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
my parents are big like metal heads and stuff

1426
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
so I went to lots of metal shows in my teens

1427
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
and it was always just about fucking destroying myself

1428
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and going ape shit

1429
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
you know it's like

1430
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
cause it's the loudest

1431
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that you could possibly listen to this music

1432
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
and there's a bunch of other people

1433
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
who are all into it too

1434
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and you're all just like

1435
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
it's like an additional layer of

1436
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
loud is better

1437
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
isn't that like worse at a certain point

1438
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
well yeah I mean

1439
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I think I definitely

1440
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I've been to a lot of shows

1441
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and there's definitely a huge gradient

1442
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
of how much I enjoyed them

1443
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
a lot of the time sound mixing is fucking terrible at shows

1444
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
especially if you go to like a big

1445
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
like a stadium type thing

1446
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
usually there's

1447
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
just not the best mixing of the audio

1448
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and wherever you're standing or sitting

1449
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
you know

1450
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and the worst thing that can happen

1451
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
is when you have a crowd who doesn't get the music

1452
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
like going to

1453
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
cause I know

1454
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Tom you're a big opeth fan

1455
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I've been to two opeth shows

1456
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and those guys

1457
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
they perform perfectly

1458
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
they sound exactly as good

1459
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
live as they do on the album

1460
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
they have perfect sound

1461
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and they'll play shows

1462
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
but like the people who go to them

1463
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
they have a crowd

1464
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
and those people

1465
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
are fucking wasted cause they're at a show

1466
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
and so they'll be playing

1467
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
like the heavy part of a song

1468
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
for those who don't know opeth transitions

1469
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
like frequently between heavy and calm parts in their songs

1470
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
so they'll be playing a heavy part

1471
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and everyone's like yeah and they're all going crazy

1472
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
and mashing and shit

1473
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
but then they'll be like two minutes of soft

1474
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
finger picked guitar

1475
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
cause the average opeth songs like 10 to 15 minutes

1476
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
so like transition back and forth

1477
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
just kind of like doesn't really know what to do

1478
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
cause they're all drunk and ready to fucking throw down

1479
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
in a metal show and a lot of them are people who aren't necessarily

1480
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
opeth fans just people who are dragged

1481
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
by their friends and so

1482
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
there'll always be a bunch of people talking

1483
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
or people on their fucking like phones

1484
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
and shit and it's like it's miserable

1485
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
like it's such a good

1486
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
performance that the band is putting on

1487
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
but the crowd is so terrible at opeth shows

1488
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
that it's like almost not worth it

1489
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
you get a bunch of inflatable beds

1490
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and inflatable couches and just like

1491
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
give everyone a bunch of weed

1492
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
in the middle of each song

1493
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
it seems like it really is important

1494
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
that reminds me of my next thing

1495
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I can't get into

1496
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
but the best shows I've been to

1497
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
was it Lady Gaga

1498
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Lady Gaga was a fucking awesome show

1499
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and the best shows are the ones where the people

1500
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
get it

1501
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and like everyone in the crowd seems to

1502
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
like Lady Gaga the crowd is almost all gay people

1503
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and like almost all of them

1504
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
cause I was down in the pit

1505
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
it's all gay people who go to Lady Gaga

1506
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
yeah

1507
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
well no other than me and Victor were the only

1508
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
straight guys there

1509
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
we did not expect

1510
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
that it was like I didn't know

1511
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
what kind of crowd Lady Gaga pulls

1512
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
so when I was there I was just like oh my god

1513
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
it's all gay people and we're in the

1514
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
the pit and everything and it slowly dawned on me

1515
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and then I looked down to myself and said

1516
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
it's all gay people

1517
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
well it slowly dawned on me

1518
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
that everyone there

1519
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Lady Gaga really meant something to them

1520
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
there's a part where

1521
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
she had people throw

1522
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
cause I guess she had some kind of fan club

1523
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and like a bunch of people took stuffed

1524
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
animals and threw them on

1525
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
stage at one point like I guess it was

1526
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
something they knew was supposed to happen at this part in the show

1527
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and she like lays down on a couch and they throw

1528
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
all these stuffed animals and they have letters attached

1529
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
to them and she's like reading out these

1530
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
letters from her fans about

1531
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
the deep emotional connection how they

1532
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
saved her from fucking

1533
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
she saved them from suicide and all this shit

1534
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and she's like reading these letters and stuff

1535
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and I was like whoa this is like such a big deal

1536
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
to the people at this show

1537
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
but the best one I've ever been to cause I'm not

1538
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
the biggest Lady Gaga fan it was a really

1539
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
cool show but there's this band

1540
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Boris we talked about this in the

1541
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
sleep podcast the band Boris with their

1542
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
album flood they were doing

1543
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
a tour where they were just playing flood

1544
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
so like cause they have a lot of different

1545
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
sounds they play stuff in all these different styles

1546
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
but like it was touring for

1547
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
that album which is a 15 year old

1548
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
album and they were like we're doing a flood tour

1549
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
so everyone who was there

1550
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
knew exactly what they were in for it was

1551
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
like a small dive bar in DC

1552
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
everyone was a huge Boris

1553
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
fan and we just fucking stood there

1554
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and like zoned out

1555
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
to this like epic fucking

1556
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
post rock song and I was

1557
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
like just sitting there like with my eyes close

1558
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and I felt like literally like the ocean was

1559
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
washing over me imagine

1560
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
imagine if somehow it was in a

1561
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
crowd where no one got it no one knew the song

1562
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
it would be the worst performance ever

1563
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
in terms of audience retention

1564
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
why has it been ten minutes of

1565
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
doom-boodly-dum-boom

1566
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
oh no they didn't do that part

1567
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
what's the point in that's the part

1568
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
where you're supposed to fall asleep

1569
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
to challenge yourself

1570
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
there's like a lot of

1571
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
they played a bunch of other songs

1572
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
that weren't just flood

1573
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
hold on here

1574
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
for like two years I've known about

1575
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
this concert you went to

1576
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
you did a vlog about it when you first did it

1577
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and this whole time you said

1578
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Boris performs flood

1579
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and they just played flood

1580
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and now all of a sudden

1581
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
more than two years afterwards you're saying

1582
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
oh they didn't just play flood they didn't play all of flood

1583
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
well my life is a lie

1584
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
they cut off the first like ten minutes

1585
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and the last like

1586
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
five to ten minutes of flood

1587
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
so it's only about 45 minutes long

1588
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
right so they cut off a lot of

1589
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
the end in the beginning and so it was like

1590
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
a 40 minute version of flood

1591
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and then they had played like five or six

1592
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
of their dronier songs before that

1593
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
okay that's cool but

1594
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Ben's got a thing to say right Ben

1595
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
oh yes

1596
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
D'Vu mentioned smoking weed

1597
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
giving the crowd a bunch of weed and smoking weed

1598
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
is something that I just cannot get into

1599
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
hey you know by the way I was

1600
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
asked did you ask me about what I thought about

1601
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
concerts and then Jesse interrupted and I

1602
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
never got back to what you think of concerts

1603
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and what sucks is that I had a really funny

1604
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
line about how I've never been to a concert

1605
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
because I live in a culturalist void

1606
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
of humanity and it was going to be funny

1607
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
but you've never been to like a country

1608
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
christian no no just everyone around

1609
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
is uncultured fucks

1610
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and it's ridiculous oh man yeah so

1611
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
it's really weird I've performed a concert

1612
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
in a church believe me D'Vu I know

1613
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
what it's like to be surrounded by uncultured

1614
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
fucks

1615
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000

1616
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000

1619
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
get into the meme at least

1620
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I hate the meme I've smoked it

1621
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I've smoked it a handful of times

1622
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you've smoked a handful of it

1623
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
the sensation I've gotten from

1624
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
a handful of times

1625
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and the sensation I've gotten from it has

1626
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
been better or worse like sometimes I've

1627
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
gotten weird and anxious and tingly and

1628
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
felt really bad other times it's been

1629
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
like relaxed and I've gotten in a very meditative

1630
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
state and it's been okay fine

1631
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
fair enough but like

1632
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
God when the people around me

1633
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
smoke it these days

1634
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
these days I just have no patience for like

1635
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
altered states of mind I want to be

1636
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
focused all the time

1637
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
any time I'm honestly any time

1638
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I'm not sitting on my computer either

1639
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
working on drawing or

1640
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
like trying to get myself to work on

1641
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
drawing I'm in physical pain

1642
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
because I should be doing I should not be doing

1643
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
anything else nothing else is of any value

1644
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
so when when someone is like

1645
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
hey I'm gonna smoke weed

1646
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
then they smoke weed and I try to be cool

1647
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
about it but I'm just like I'm looking

1648
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
at them like you sad motherfucker

1649
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
this is what you want to spend your time doing

1650
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
this is how you want your life

1651
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
this is how you want this evening to go for you

1652
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and someone offers it to me I'm like haha

1653
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
no thanks but in my mind I'm like

1654
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
you mother for how do you know what Ben I

1655
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
you're trying to say fucking I know

1656
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
exactly how you feel because

1657
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
every fucking party at some point someone

1658
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
pulls out the doobie

1659
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
and they all start and

1660
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
just like you said I'm like

1661
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I'm like no thanks I don't want any

1662
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
like I'm polite about it

1663
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
but in my head I'm going I want

1664
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
all of you to fucking die

1665
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
how why don't you just hand me a gun

1666
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and say hey would you like to shoot yourself

1667
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
with it I mean we know

1668
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
what happens we know it goes down

1669
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I mean I mean I'm not saying it's

1670
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
gonna kill you or anything I'm just saying that

1671
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
like it's not a good thing to do

1672
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
you know I mean I don't

1673
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I mean you gain pretty much nothing

1674
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I mean maybe stress relief I guess

1675
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
you know I guess it's just

1676
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
it's just a fucking juvenile thing for people

1677
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
who have no fucking creativity

1678
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
or no fucking ability

1679
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
to entertain themselves and have an

1680
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
actual conversation here's the line

1681
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
thank you Jesse it's juvenile is fun

1682
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
well think about this think about it this way

1683
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
you know one of the best defenses people have for weeds

1684
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
is that it helps soothe the pain

1685
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
you have a terrible disease well what's your disease

1686
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
well that's the second disease that you have

1687
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
my disease is being

1688
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
a man in the 21st century

1689
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I mean I mean

1690
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
in this matri whatever

1691
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I don't want to go too hard

1692
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
against it because like

1693
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I could make the same argument against any

1694
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
recreational activity oh why are you

1695
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
watching that movie that doesn't accomplish anything

1696
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
you know that's stupid that's juvenile

1697
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
like I get it you know if you enjoy

1698
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
it fair enough but for me it's like

1699
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Jesse do you think you're going to have a good time

1700
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
speaking and once you do it like

1701
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
you're trapped in it like once you're high you're trapped

1702
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
you have to be high for a while I hate that

1703
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
yeah that's the scariest part by the way did I

1704
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
ever tell you guys about the time I was physically

1705
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
trapped like I got really high with

1706
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
a couple people I barely knew and had one of them

1707
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
had given me a ride that was

1708
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
fallen to a bear trap

1709
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
were you suing it for me did they stuff you

1710
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
in the trunk of their car and drive you to a cliff

1711
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
well okay really quick so me and

1712
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
some friends I had met when I was working at Best Buy

1713
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
a couple years ago I met this guy Aaron

1714
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
he was okay we were hanging out one time and like

1715
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
when I go over to his house to hang out the first time

1716
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
he's like we're going to go drive to my

1717
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
other friend's house he's like the coolest

1718
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000

01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
the way out to his house which was like fucking

01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
half an hour away and so now I'm trapped

1725
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000

01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000

went to meet turned out he was he hyped

1749
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
him up like this god among men and he

1750
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
was a complete disgusting piece of shit

1751
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
who this guy was obviously blind to like

1752
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
a certain person I know can't see a

1753
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
certain color this guy can't see how

1754
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
shitty he is in real life you know sort of

1755
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
like that like it what did this guy say

1756
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
was cool about him well okay they had a

1757
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
YouTube channel and I hadn't seen any

1758
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
other content but at this point having a

1759
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
YouTube channel was really impressive to

1760
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
me and like I don't know he was just a

1761
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
cool guy and he kept telling me how amazing

1762
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
this guy was with a creative genius he was

1763
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
and you know things of this nature but

1764
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
anyway I meet him he's like I walk into

1765
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
his room he's this fat fucking stoner

1766
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
wearing no pants just like smoking from

1767
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
a fucking he had like a vape bag sort of

1768
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
thing and was just like he's just like

1769
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
what's up guys and like his walls were

1770
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
plastered with like heavy metal posters

1771
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
that were just like covered in shit this

1772
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
room was disgusting and the point is

1773
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
there was nothing like what I'd been led

1774
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
to expect and the point is we sit down

1775
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
there's nothing to do so we all just get

1776
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
high and I and once I get high I

1777
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
immediately realize I go into panic mode

1778
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that oh my god I'm trapped here there's no

1779
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
fucking escape what am I going to do so

1780
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
eventually I just they started showing me

1781
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
their videos was a fucking nightmare I

1782
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
just eventually call I text everyone I

1783
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
know in my phone but what were the videos

1784
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
like um were they yellow remember I've

1785
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
looked where they to know why are you

1786
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
making him give more detail in the

1787
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
story I don't know that was an

1788
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
interesting point he described to me one

1789
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
time and like they were really embarrassed

1790
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
we had to watch these videos they were so

1791
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
yellow I couldn't take it all right

1792
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
the videos were in fact like because of

1793
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
the context where I've been hyped up

1794
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
that they've done all this awesome shit

1795
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and they were such amazing creative

1796
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
individuals when they showed me the

1797
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
videos it was a fucking nightmare it was

1798
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
like and I was super high by this point

1799
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and I did like when I was I don't I what

1800
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I did was I looked around I looked at

1801
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
these people who had nothing going on

1802
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
their lives this is what they do with

1803
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
their life and I think to myself this

1804
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
is how I'm spending my life right now

1805
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
hanging out with these people and I'm

1806
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
trapped here I feel with everybody yeah

1807
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
it's on this fucking planet right so the

1808
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
point is I panic especially on this

1809
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
podcast I texted literally everyone in

1810
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
my phone like please call me immediately

1811
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
that's what I texted to everyone in all

1812
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
caps yeah like I start getting calls

1813
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
from all my contacts on my phone because

1814
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
my plan was I'll have someone call me

1815
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
pretend there's an emergency and then

1816
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
like force him to take me home

1817
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
immediately as to get out here without

1818
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
you know like saying anything weird so

1819
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
like I keep getting calls and like I'm

1820
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
pretending I'm on the phone with my mom

1821
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
right now while I get another call

1822
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
because I wasn't actually on the phone

1823
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
because I just hung up on people because

1824
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I didn't actually want to talk to any of

1825
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
them I was high as fuck dude I was high as

1826
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
fuck it was a total cluster fuck and so

1827
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
like I'm like guys I have to go my

1828
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
sister like needs a ride to the airport

1829
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I have to leave now something like that

1830
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and the guys like oh dude we're we're

1831
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
pretty fucked up though like we should

1832
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
probably chill out for a little while

1833
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I was like okay I can survive and yeah

1834
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I survived for the half an hour we went

1835
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
home got the fuck out of there it was the

1836
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
worst experience in my life the point is

1837
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
the weed made me super terrified super

1838
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
paranoid was horrible don't do it yeah

1839
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
man don't do it it has given me very

1840
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
anxiety yeah that the anxiety is the word

1841
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
it sometimes makes me feel really bad

1842
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I don't do it give go okay I have a

1843
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
really good give boo

1844
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
tangentially related to weed is alcohol

1845
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and that is a thing that I can't get into

1846
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
sure because yeah everything I said

1847
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
we just now also applies to out yeah

1848
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
there's specifically getting wasted I've

1849
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
been wasted like three times the first

1850
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
time I was sick the second time it was

1851
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
pretty cool but the third time I was so

1852
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
sick so hungover that I I swore I would

1853
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
never drink again I have drinking again

1854
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
none of you guys have never gotten that

1855
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
drink I've had my ups and downs with booze

1856
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
but these days I've sort of settled into

1857
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
a comfortable sort of I'll drink rarely

1858
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
just to I don't know because I have a

1859
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
silo every so often yeah and maybe a

1860
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
glass of wine but I don't want to get

1861
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
cups deep into my box wine right now

1862
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
since we started the podcast I've met

1863
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
three cups of wine I've like tried but

1864
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I just I don't like having my senses

1865
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
dulled because I yeah yeah just

1866
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
because I'm just I'm naturally anxious

1867
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
so when I like oh my god everything

1868
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
spinning oh yeah and then I'm just like

1869
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
what the fuck like well I kind of like

1870
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
being buzzed I'm just like it's hard to

1871
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
get into drinking when there's not a

1872
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
reason to it it feels good to be a

1873
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
little bit buzz and to be a little bit

1874
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
drunk like it is like relaxing and it

1875
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
kind of can be fun but yeah before I get

1876
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
there the thought of getting there makes

1877
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
me anxious and I'm like I don't want to

1878
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I don't want to dull my senses I don't

1879
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
think I'd ever get into alcohol as much as

1880
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
digi well yeah I mean it's really like

1881
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
like a it's like a practice thing for

1882
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
comfort like I mean if you know how much

1883
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
alcohol you can handle you can pretty

1884
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
easily make sure you don't get to the

1885
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
point where you're gonna fucking lose

1886
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
your faculties and throw up yeah I know

1887
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
exactly how many cups of wine I can have

1888
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
before like I know how many it'll take

1889
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
before it's a I feel like I can't drive

1890
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
and then I know how many more it'll take

1891
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
before I feel like I can do anything in

1892
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
the world and that's where I need to stop

1893
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and if I go any further that it gets into

1894
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
the I'm gonna feel this all fucking night

1895
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
and I'm not gonna be able to do anything

1896
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
so at Baronecon that last night where

1897
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
we were all drinking for the show I

1898
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
didn't really drink that much because I

1899
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
didn't want to get sick you know in another

1900
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
country smart but at the at the same time

1901
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I felt bad because I wasn't as crazy as

1902
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
everyone else I was just sort of normal

1903
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I think I was like another thing you know

1904
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
from everybody I was having had one drink

1905
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
that night so we were wasted I remember

1906
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
getting I really hate every part of like

1907
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
the getting drunk process mm-hmm like I

1908
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
hate the taste I hate putting it inside

1909
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
me I hate fucking getting there I hate

1910
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
being drunk I hate feeling the beginning

1911
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
hungover I don't usually get hungover but

1912
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I hate it when it happens enough to make

1913
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
up for all the times I don't but like the

1914
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
only time that I actually drink a lot is

1915
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
when I specifically want to turn into a

1916
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
monster mm-hmm it's it's like it's like

1917
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
the Mr. Hyde it's your doctor I was just

1918
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
gonna say Dr. Jerry Mr. Hyde like I got

1919
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
to let this monster out somehow or else

1920
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
it's gonna eat me up from the inside

1921
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
something has to happen tonight you know

1922
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
my least favorite part of the whole

1923
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
process is definitely the morning after

1924
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
because oftentimes specifically when I

1925
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
was in Japan me and my buddy Garoff would

1926
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
go to the red light district and just

1927
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
fucking party all night and get super

1928
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
wasted beforehand and just be fucking

1929
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
monsters and then the next day it would

1930
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
just completely destroy my next day

1931
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
because of how much I drank and how

1932
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
irresponsibly we did it and I didn't

1933
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
know anything about how to do it right at

1934
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
the time you know well hangovers are a

1935
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
well-documented phenomenon I know you know

1936
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
it's funny to mitigate it though as did

1937
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
you can tell you funny because the last

1938
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
time that I got drunk

1939
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I got I drank an entire bottle of rum

1940
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I recorded a whole album that will never

1941
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
see the light of day because it needs to

1942
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
be destroyed it must never be seen or

1943
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
heard by anyone I thought it was good

1944
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
though you said it was good it's good

1945
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
no it's but the world's not ready for

1946
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
this kind of good yeah yeah exactly the

1947
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
world isn't ready for it I have it can

1948
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
you just give it to me and I'll just like

1949
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
keep it around you can listen to it but

1950
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I'm not ready for the world to hear it

1951
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
yeah okay but I just I feel like I want

1952
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
it for myself because I hyped myself

1953
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
after the podcast over it yeah the

1954
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
name the album yellow the world's not

1955
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
ready oh shit the world's not ready

1956
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
yeah the album art is actually yellow

1957
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:33,000
it's sure because you know it's funny

1958
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
that uh you know you want to dwell on that

1959
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
even though the conversation is over and

1960
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I've won the debate I guess you just

1961
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
so insecure about how thoroughly I've

1962
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
trounced you in this objective fucking

1963
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
debate you can't handle the fact that I

1964
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
am objectively smarter than everyone in

1965
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
this chat combined that's so you're

1966
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
bringing it up again out of thin air for

1967
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
no reason you just want to keep harping

1968
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
on it because you can't take it you can't

1969
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
handle people are fucking colorblind

1970
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that you see colors that are not there

1971
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
you see yellow but you know I was going

1972
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
to tell a funny story about the color

1973
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
yellow I'm not going to tell it now I'm

1974
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
just going to let it go we lost out on the yellow story

1975
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
that'd be in the case because you want to

1976
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
talk about made-up yellow stories I mean

1977
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
his yellow story is probably not going to

1978
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
be very good anyway so oh shit yeah it

1979
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
was I got a I got I haven't done one of

1980
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
these things right right yeah I've been

1981
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
letting you guys the point is I was

1982
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
puking up stomach acid and it was yellow

1983
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
oh holy shit that does sound like a great

1984
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
story um is did you the last one that

1985
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
hasn't I think yes we've gone through

1986
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
some of you twice I haven't done any

1987
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
is that true I have a third one oh David

1988
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
you haven't done one hey I have plenty I

1989
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
got a whole list baby I've got a list too

1990
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
yeah I think this is one that probably

1991
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
was obvious because I'm sure I've

1992
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
mentioned it before and do you will

1993
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
definitely know I've talked about this

1994
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
but country music and also I'm going in

1995
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
classical music both of them I see I

1996
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
have heard well yeah well the thing

1997
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
about country music and I talked about

1998
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
this on an old podcast that like this

1999
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
for me to enjoy something that's like

2000
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
country ish like country influenced like

2001
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
it becomes enjoyable to me at exactly

2002
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
the moment it stops being country like

2003
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
there's a lot of artists who are like

2004
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
folk who are like country folk who I

2005
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
like or like maybe you know have some

2006
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
country aspects but as soon as it's like

2007
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
country I can't take the voices I can't

2008
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
take the southern accents like the and

2009
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
the the mixing where it's usually like

2010
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
very prominent vocals with these thick

2011
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
southern accents going like honka-tonk

2012
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
won't it don't fair you know like

2013
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
because I mean I was my mom like

2014
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
despises country music to an extent

2015
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
that if she hears it for 10 seconds she'll

2016
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
like flip shit and so like I grew up with

2017
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
it like very ingrained in my mind that

2018
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
country was the devil like never listen

2019
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
to it it's the worst thing in the world

2020
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
you know so like I have like this knee

2021
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
jerk reaction to like a country accent

2022
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
that's immediately like nope you know I

2023
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
have that yeah for like just because

2024
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
it's a terrible voice like the way that

2025
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
they not the country accent but the

2026
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
country music voice that y'all doing on

2027
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
the same on the fall on the planet

2028
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
well I mean I get I get that for people

2029
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
who come up in a place where people talk

2030
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
like that I guarantee you I would be

2031
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
annoyed by it if I had a country accent

2032
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
more than I do I would hate it I grew up

2033
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
in Yankee country in Massachusetts and

2034
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
there's a little bit of and I wasn't

2035
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
really supposed to much of this at all

2036
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
growing up but over the years I found a

2037
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
couple of things that I'm into like like

2038
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
like mr. Conway twitty I see the

2039
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
sparkling little diamond in your hand

2040
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
now he's great he's great you know this

2041
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
when you guys watch Pokemon does Pikachu

2042
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
just blend into the background for you

2043
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
since everything you know you look up at

2044
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
the sky do you see blue is there any

2045
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
other colors up there I want to finish

2046
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
this fucking country point of this you

2047
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
know there's certain songs like everybody

2048
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
loves Johnny Cash right he's like the

2049
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
he's like the hips like if you're a

2050
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
music hipster guy everyone says no

2051
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
country but Johnny Cash yeah yeah he's

2052
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
a country guy who's very acceptable to

2053
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
like you know there's been a the needle

2054
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
drops on a classic album review of one

2055
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
of his things he's a you know he's popular

2056
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
in the circuits of people who like music

2057
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
people who ordinarily wouldn't like

2058
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
country at all yeah and I've heard some

2059
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Johnny Cash songs I thought were kind of

2060
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
okay I think he has a cool voice I like

2061
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
his cover of Hurt by Nine Inch Nails

2062
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
but like I can't get into even Johnny

2063
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Cash like I can't listen to a whole album

2064
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
of his stuff because it's just like it's

2065
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
just too country you know it's not that

2066
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
country anyway like he's more even he

2067
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
is more like blues folk rock pop fusion

2068
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
like I mean that's what country there's

2069
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
a large infusion of retardation and

2070
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
very incestuous country yeah I've heard

2071
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
some outlaw country where sometimes the

2072
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
music's not that bad but I just can't

2073
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
deal with the voice I've heard my ex

2074
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
girlfriend was a huge country music

2075
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
person like she grew up with it and all

2076
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
she listened to was country and country

2077
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
rock and shit and and well not only but

2078
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
well did you the thingy terrible taste

2079
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
in music but she played me this this

2080
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
this album those like the soundtrack to

2081
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
this show Nashville which is like a show

2082
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
about musicians and like I actually

2083
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
thought a lot of the songs on that

2084
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
soundtrack were pretty okay but they were

2085
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
all like folk country like they weren't

2086
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
really country songs and the ones that

2087
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
were country songs were terrible and it's

2088
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
like this is this is really what I feel

2089
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
is like the heart of what I wish this

2090
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
podcast were and it isn't quite it's

2091
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
because Ben will say something like I

2092
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
can't get into this except when I can and

2093
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
even like hippo is like I can't get into

2094
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
drinking except that one time where I did

2095
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
like it you see the point you made it

2096
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
back in that very old podcast was that

2097
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
as soon as a country song becomes good

2098
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
to you it's also become something beyond

2099
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
just country the definition of country

2100
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
like what makes country its own thing

2101
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
that makes it unique from everything

2102
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
else is something that you do not like

2103
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
like it like it is something that is

2104
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
inherently shitty to you and for me that

2105
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
is the ultimate in of an example of

2106
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
something you just can't get into right

2107
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
yeah I mean there's I don't want no

2108
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
hand out living I don't want a part

2109
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
anything they're giving I'm proud

2110
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
even I got a song even trying to do a

2111
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
country voice like immediately makes me

2112
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
feel like the song must be bad you know

2113
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
and I said a few things and I'll admit it

2114
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
if you want to get ahead you got a hump

2115
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and get it I'm a white boy looking for

2116
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
a place to do my thing

2117
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I won't say that I've never heard a

2118
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
country song that I liked at all but

2119
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I've never heard one that I was like

2120
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
returning to regularly you know it's

2121
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
it's a hard genre and then also I really

2122
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I really resonate with I'm a white boy

2123
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
by Merle Haggard

2124
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I also want to throw in classical because

2125
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I can't get into that either and like

2126
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
classical at least I can appreciate the

2127
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
compositions and be like yeah that's

2128
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
that I mean I understand the emotions

2129
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
that that's supposed to evoke but I don't

2130
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
like the sound of classical instruments

2131
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
it's soundtrack music so of course you

2132
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
know it's like it's not necessarily

2133
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
something you can get into as much and

2134
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
we're not talking like a song that plays

2135
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
in a movie we're talking the background

2136
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
music that's going on during a scene and

2137
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
it's like you'll have a scene of a guy

2138
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
not classical classical like Mozart wasn't

2139
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
a backing track you're thinking of

2140
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
orchestral it's different than yeah

2141
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
no is it most classical music like set to

2142
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
certain plays no I'm pretty sure about

2143
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
that they wrote them to be stories in and

2144
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
of themselves yeah Beethoven and Mozart

2145
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and fucking what's this fuck are none of

2146
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
them are well you know I don't think

2147
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
anybody actually listens to classical

2148
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
music everyone just says they do

2149
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
wait a second how many of you know I know

2150
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
some of the dais like half that movie is

2151
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
like people playing classical music and

2152
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
there's a play going on to it and he's

2153
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
posing it for the play what's going on if

2154
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I've been lied to I'm a dais is the

2155
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
greatest musical I mean movie of all

2156
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
time some things yeah well a lot of it is

2157
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
like that like whether or not it's

2158
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
not about whether or not it's soundtrack

2159
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
music I just don't like the sound of the

2160
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
instruments I don't like classical

2161
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
instruments I don't like orchestral

2162
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
music at all that's right I know

2163
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
orchestral music that's way too broad a

2164
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
category all of the people I know who are

2165
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
into that kind of stuff are like only

2166
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
into that stuff like it's all people who

2167
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
like play classical instruments and are

2168
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
only into those that kind of me know I

2169
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
don't like any orchestral music with that

2170
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
is very few exceptions I don't believe

2171
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
a couple of anime soundtracks I think are

2172
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
pretty yellow is the best classical sound

2173
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
but it's a rock and roll sort of guy

2174
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
thing what yellow electric like

2175
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
electric light or orchestra oh yeah

2176
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
okay but they're like a electronic

2177
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
they're got like no that they're

2178
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
electronic slash classical right but as

2179
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
soon as you put electronic elements in

2180
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
there it's no longer just or well you

2181
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
said you didn't like the sound of the

2182
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
instruments well I mean I don't like them

2183
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
like I love the violin I think the

2184
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
violin sounds great in the background

2185
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
of a rock or pop song like I don't want

2186
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
to just listen to a violin unless it's

2187
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
like a like one exception being like the

2188
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
opening song on Agilosh do you like

2189
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
you're lying April did you go well

2190
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
first of all I dropped that show after

2191
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
one episode there you go garbage

2192
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
you didn't get to the music okay just

2193
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
checking yeah um no I I mean I watched

2194
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
all of or most of no dime a cantabile

2195
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
and like I appreciate the musical

2196
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
performances they're well directed and

2197
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
they're good they are good pieces of

2198
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
music I would never listen to them of my

2199
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
own accord like I've tried countless

2200
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
times to put on like you know everyone

2201
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
loves Moonlight Sonata right that's

2202
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
everybody's intro to classical song and

2203
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I put it on I feel nothing you know it's

2204
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
okay I'm like I don't think yeah

2205
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
whatever all right fine I accept that

2206
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
you don't like it fair enough I just

2207
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
want to say that the idea that like a

2208
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
lot of the things we're saying like we

2209
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
we can't get into them except that one

2210
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
time I think that's mainly because like

2211
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
we're all basically quite open-minded

2212
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and that we can enjoy we can get into a

2213
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
lot of things in a small way yeah I

2214
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
object to your objection to do that makes

2215
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
perfect sense it wasn't an objection it

2216
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
was just like an observation that we're

2217
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
all talking about things that we like

2218
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
once but most of the time not I mean like

2219
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I don't come I don't hate everything

2220
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
about Dungeons and Dragons like there

2221
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
are parts of it that I think are fun and

2222
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
cool it's just that I think on the whole

2223
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
the experience of it is generally well

2224
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
as long as we're clarifying previous

2225
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
things we've said and as long as we're

2226
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
airing our grievances I want to go back

2227
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
to the yellow thing for justice just a

2228
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
minute I'd rather you go back to the

2229
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
hope stuff because now what are we

2230
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
going to do

2231
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
you muting me doesn't have anything to

2232
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
do how do you how does you muting Jesse

2233
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
doesn't really help

2234
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
go on Jesse

2235
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I still hear Jesse

2236
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
someone for yourself I didn't know that's how that worked

2237
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
yeah you dumbass you fucking

2238
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
idiot

2239
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

2240
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
no don't finish your point I want to hear what

2241
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
makes you think that you have authority over

2242
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
who mutes Jesse anyway first of all

2243
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
that you think that you can do that is stupid

2244
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and that you think the perfectly rational reason

2245
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
for thinking that alright there's two reasons

2246
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
first of all when I muted you for a second

2247
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
ago there was a mute symbol next to you

2248
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
that's identical to what it looks like

2249
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
if someone mutes themself second of all

2250
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I gave everyone

2251
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I gave everyone here like absolute moderator

2252
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
admin powers and I'm the one who owns

2253
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
the chat oh I never accepted

2254
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
them okay stop trying to

2255
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
we're talking about yellow here let me defend myself

2256
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
you ripped on me for not knowing

2257
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
why I can delete anyone's

2258
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
comments we can all delete one another's sentences

2259
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
just fucking sit down

2260
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
shut up Jesse I'm going to tell you

2261
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I can delete anyone's messages

2262
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and anyone can so I thought it seemed

2263
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
very likely that I can use someone else

2264
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
okay Davoo you make that

2265
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Davoo we weren't bashing on you for

2266
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Jesse was

2267
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Jesse was

2268
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
it's the fact that you thought

2269
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
that you were allowed to do that

2270
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
the light blue is quite uniform

2271
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
it's orange

2272
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
it's not quite yellow

2273
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
it is kind of yellow

2274
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
okay I just wanted to clarify

2275
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
for everybody because I said before

2276
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
that the issue was not

2277
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
whether or not my video looks

2278
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
good the issue is that whether or not it looks

2279
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
yellow see there's actually two issues

2280
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
there they're both separately on their own

2281
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
they're both very valid issues that I

2282
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
that I take grievance with

2283
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
first of all it doesn't look yellow it's not yellow at all

2284
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
but I didn't mean to imply

2285
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
that the other issue is not important

2286
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
the video absolutely looks beautiful

2287
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
that fucking Christmas video

2288
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
it looks gorgeous it looks beautiful

2289
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I don't know what the hell you think

2290
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
there is no Jesse video I would describe

2291
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
as gorgeous I don't know what you think

2292
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
gorgeous is then I don't know what you think

2293
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
gorgeous is then because my videos

2294
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
you know I'm the best fucking director

2295
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm the best at fucking framing a scene

2296
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
setting up a shot hey if you want to see something

2297
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
gorgeous why don't you head on over to

2298
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000

2299
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000

and try to start a whole new thing

2304
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
my camera quality is great

2305
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000

2306
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
okay so I was

2307
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
right about the yellow it's not yellow I was right about

2308
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
how beautiful my videos look they are beautiful

2309
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I was right about the camera quality

2310
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
my camera is great so you guys are just fucking wrong

2311
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
about everything and every time I catch you

2312
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
in the act of being wrong you jump ship

2313
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
to something else

2314
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
just to clarify what you're doing right now

2315
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
is you're just grabbing other arguments and attaching

2316
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
them to your main one as to give it more

2317
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
validity no no these are all separate arguments

2318
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
that I'm right each one by themselves

2319
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
alright well Jesse you're right about everything

2320
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
DeVue what the fuck

2321
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
no no no no see see see that's another

2322
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that's another sick tactic that you people use

2323
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
okay you try to brush me off

2324
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
there's no way out there's no way out of this conversation

2325
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
what answer would you like

2326
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Jesse I would like you all to do

2327
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
what answer could you possibly want

2328
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
sorry, I catch this

2329
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,360
there's no exit

2330
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,440
there's no exit

2331
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:27,840
Rollin, rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollink saja

2332
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,240
DeVue what the fuck

2333
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:36,740
raisins I've never been able to 이렇게

2334
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,740
Okay, look, here it is. Here's the thing about raisins, right?

2335
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,740
I think the taste of raisins...

2336
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,740
I think the taste of raisins is all right.

2337
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,740
Do you like grapes? Do you like grapes?

2338
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,740
This just shut up, Nate.

2339
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,740
First of all, Nate, I know what you said about grapes.

2340
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,740
I can also like...

2341
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,740
I know what you said about grapes.

2342
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,740
I also like orange juice,

2343
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,740
but I don't like rotten orange juice

2344
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:58,740
that's been out in the sun for five days.

2345
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,740
So here's the thing about raisins, right?

2346
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,740
The taste is so-so.

2347
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,740
I suppose orange juice is yellow, too, right?

2348
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,740
Sometimes.

2349
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,740
Is that why it's called fucking yellow juice?

2350
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,740
I'm...

2351
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,740
I'm starting to get on board with this banning Jesse idea.

2352
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,740
Like, raisins are like...

2353
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,740
Good! I hope you ban me!

2354
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,740
I hope you all ban me! This is my hill to die on!

2355
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,740
Go on, DeVoe.

2356
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,740
Keep power through. I'll never let this go.

2357
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,740
All right.

2358
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,740
I kicked him out of the call, so...

2359
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,740
Oh, you... you don't like...

2360
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,740
He said he's never gonna give up,

2361
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,740
and we have to finish the podcast.

2362
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,740
Uh...

2363
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,740
I care more about his hilarious argument

2364
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,740
than I do about your taste of raisins.

2365
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,740
That was a little bit... much.

2366
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,740
Is he not even in this chat anymore?

2367
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,740
Oh, man. You really stepped over the fucking line.

2368
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,740
What did you do?

2369
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,740
I thought I was just gonna kick him out of the call.

2370
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,740
I didn't kick him out of the group.

2371
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,740
You clearly don't know anything about the rules

2372
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,740
in the fucking thing.

2373
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,740
I'm not the one who derailed this podcast five times.

2374
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,740
You are the one who completely...

2375
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,740
Dude?

2376
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,740
No, I'm honestly glad that he's gone,

2377
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:06,740
but I still wouldn't kick him.

2378
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,740
I have to figure out how to get him back in here now.

2379
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,740
Oh, my God.

2380
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:12,740
This is not good.

2381
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,740
Uh, fuck.

2382
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,740
These fucking raisins are tearing us apart!

2383
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,740
Like, okay, we're gonna need to get

2384
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,740
constantly shouting,

2385
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,740
where the fuck is the end right now?

2386
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,740
Stop talking about this.

2387
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,740
I take action to solve that problem,

2388
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
and everyone thinks it's weird.

2389
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,740
Our friendship is shriveling under the hot yellow sun.

2390
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,740
Yeah, well, here's...

2391
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,740
Does anyone have an invite link for this shit?

2392
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:38,740
I got it. I got the link. I'm trying to find...

2393
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,740
Yeah, I have...

2394
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,740
You should still be friends with him,

2395
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,740
or if you go to, like, the top direct messages.

2396
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,740
But now all we're gonna be talking about

2397
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,740
is how I kicked him out.

2398
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,740
And again, I thought I was just kicking him out of the call.

2399
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,740
We can cut it, dude. We can cut it. It's not a big deal.

2400
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,740
No, we can't. It's funny.

2401
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,740
This is pretty funny, honestly.

2402
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,740
I want him to be able to listen to this.

2403
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,740
Oh, man.

2404
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,740
Jesse, if you're listening to this, I'm sorry, dude.

2405
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,740
As soon as he enters the call,

2406
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,740
all he's gonna talk about is me kicking him.

2407
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,740
Here's my...

2408
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,740
I think that Jesse was going way too hard

2409
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,740
on this yellow thing, but I also think

2410
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:14,740
that this is like...

2411
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,740
Yeah, I wouldn't... I mean, I don't know.

2412
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,740
I'm a centrist.

2413
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,740
Sure, fine.

2414
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,740
You realize...

2415
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,740
Jesse, I didn't realize I was gonna kick you out of the chat.

2416
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,740
Right? You realize the mistake

2417
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
that you just made.

2418
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,740
You have just made this fire

2419
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,740
so much worse

2420
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,740
than you ever could have imagined.

2421
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,740
When you beat Jesse to low on HP,

2422
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,740
he only comes back stronger.

2423
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,740
Yeah, it's like final fantasy 8.

2424
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,740
You realize...

2425
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:46,740
that it is now my mission to derail

2426
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,740
every podcast with the subject

2427
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,740
until the end of time.

2428
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,740
All you had to do, DeVoo, was just move Jesse

2429
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,740
to the other voice channel.

2430
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,740
It would have had the same effect.

2431
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,740
You guys just aren't happy

2432
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,740
with any actual executive action

2433
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,740
taking to fix this problem.

2434
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,740
Because this crusade is over...

2435
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,740
Because this is all a funny act thing.

2436
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,740
It's hilarious that we're

2437
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,740
derailing the podcast and arguing about yellow.

2438
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,740
It's the funniest thing in the world.

2439
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,740
Now, if we don't...

2440
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,740
Where do you draw the line here?

2441
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,740
I was getting pretty tired, honestly.

2442
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,740
Kicking him was hilarious,

2443
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,740
but it's also hilarious because it was incompetent.

2444
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:24,740
It's not yet begun to become tired, Ben.

2445
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,740
It's not yet begun

2446
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,740
to become tired.

2447
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,740
You people are going to

2448
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,740
beg me for mercy by the time

2449
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:34,740
this is done.

2450
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,740
I will keep this going for months.

2451
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,740
I'll keep this going for years

2452
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,740
if I have to. By the time I'm through

2453
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,740
with you, you will

2454
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,740
beg. You will weep.

2455
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,740
You will...

2456
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,740
You will...

2457
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,740
You will beg me to accept

2458
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,740
that it's not yellow.

2459
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,740
Do you understand?

2460
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,740
You will be like Theon Greyjoy.

2461
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:58,740
Please cut my finger off.

2462
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:00,740
Please cut it off, Ramsay.

2463
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,740
Like Theon fucking Greyjoy.

2464
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,740
Just cut it off.

2465
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,740
I'm mostly...

2466
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,740
At this point, I'm also mostly laughing

2467
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,740
at the thought that DeVu

2468
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,740
was so

2469
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,740
campaigning to make Jesse be quiet.

2470
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,740
It kicked him out so that he could talk about

2471
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,740
racism.

2472
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,740
It's not true.

2473
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,740
You guys were constantly telling him

2474
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,740
to shut up.

2475
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,740
You just created your own monster, DeVu.

2476
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,740
You just created a nightmare.

2477
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,740
Turn into a mural on the Sistine Chapel.

2478
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,740
This event, you know, should be immortalized.

2479
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,740
I was going to do it regardless of who needed to talk at the moment.

2480
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,740
It was like the fourth time we derailed it.

2481
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,740
It wasn't because of me at all.

2482
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,740
Do you know what it feels like

2483
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,740
to be betrayed, to be abandoned

2484
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,740
by your friends, to be kicked out to the curb?

2485
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,740
To DeVu.

2486
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,740
To DeVu.

2487
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:50,740
Do you know

2488
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,740
the rage

2489
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,740
that you were exhuming a man?

2490
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,740
Oh no!

2491
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,740
You're finally free.

2492
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:00,740
You know what it's like to leave the Bork, don't you?

2493
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:02,740
That's a death sentence right there.

2494
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,740
Yeah, no, Jesse finally had sweet escape

2495
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,740
and as soon as I gave him a

2496
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,740
leash back in, he immediately jumped on it.

2497
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:12,740
He was like,

2498
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,740
put me back in for another round.

2499
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,740
For what it's worth,

2500
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,740
I kind of want to hear why DeVu can't get into me too.

2501
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,740
Me too. Me too?

2502
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,740
We have this ten minute delay between me actually explaining it.

2503
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:24,740
The texture is gross.

2504
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,740
It feels like I'm eating a bug. That's it!

2505
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,740
That's all I had to say.

2506
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,740
I like raisins,

2507
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:34,740
they're sweet, and that's it.

2508
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,740
I don't like them in muffins, they're annoying.

2509
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,740
They taste like candy.

2510
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,740
I don't like candy, I just like

2511
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,740
the majority of candy my entire life.

2512
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,740
I guess I should have said that.

2513
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,740
Why didn't you bring that up?

2514
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,740
You know what I was thinking,

2515
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:50,740
this whole podcast, I know that

2516
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,740
all the things I can't get into

2517
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,740
for real, I'm not even going to be able to think about them

2518
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,740
because I just haven't even

2519
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,740
thought about them in so long.

2520
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,740
But yeah, candy, as a kid,

2521
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,740
and I like slightly more candy

2522
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,740
as an adult than as a kid.

2523
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,740
Just almost all of them.

2524
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:08,740
I can only think of some candy I can tolerate

2525
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,740
with a laughing taffy.

2526
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:12,740
Do you like sweet food in general?

2527
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,740
Yeah, totally, just candy is disgusting.

2528
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:16,740
I have friends who just don't like sweet food,

2529
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,740
so I was just wondering.

2530
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,740
What do you mean when you say candy?

2531
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,740
Candy is very specific.

2532
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,740
Like anything you'd buy at a candy store.

2533
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,740
Because we call them sweets in general.

2534
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,740
Candy is a specific thing.

2535
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:30,740
Like a Reese's or a chocolate bar,

2536
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:32,740
or like a...

2537
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,740
Well here, to go into like

2538
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,740
anything sweet,

2539
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,740
I can kind of like.

2540
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,740
The fact that it is candy is the biggest detriment

2541
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,740
against liking it, you see.

2542
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,740
For example, one candy bar I do kind of like

2543
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,740
is Take Five. I don't even know if that's still in production.

2544
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,740
It's called Take Five.

2545
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,740
It's got stuff in it that I like.

2546
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,740
But the fact that it's this tiny

2547
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,740
really processed

2548
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,740
with tons of preservatives thing

2549
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,740
makes it vastly inferior

2550
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,740
to just getting some pretzels and chocolate

2551
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:02,740
and peanut butter and layering that

2552
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,740
and putting that in an oven. That would be vastly preferable.

2553
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,740
The opposite. I like everything

2554
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,740
more when it's processed.

2555
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,740
I've come to realize, I can't home make any snacks

2556
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,740
that don't taste good.

2557
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:14,740
To make it, you should experiment with the cooking.

2558
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,740
It's the best. Feels great, tastes great.

2559
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:18,740
You're trying to recreate candy bars

2560
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,740
at home. It never works.

2561
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,740
That's true.

2562
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,740
How would you recreate a chocolate bar?

2563
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,740
Chocolate melts in general.

2564
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,740
And then you unmelt it.

2565
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,740
Hershey's chocolate.

2566
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,740
Hershey's chocolate just tastes like it came out of a can.

2567
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,740
Hershey's chocolate is pretty gross.

2568
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,740
I've heard of Hershey's just

2569
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,740
in like

2570
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,740
Hershey's

2571
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,740
chocolate kisses are just like disgusting

2572
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,740
for some reason.

2573
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:46,740
M&M's

2574
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:48,740
are hell on earth.

2575
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:50,740
I just can't stand M&M's or the grossest thing

2576
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,740
because they also feel like I'm eating a bug

2577
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,740
because they got that shell that feels like

2578
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:56,740
the exterior of a bug.

2579
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,740
I love M&M's.

2580
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,740
That's all this conversation is doing for me right now.

2581
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,740
Well see

2582
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:04,740
here's the depressing part for me.

2583
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,740
I grew up loving candy

2584
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,740
especially Reese's

2585
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:10,740
and as I grew older

2586
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,740
taste wise I could

2587
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,740
eat more candies.

2588
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,740
The stuff I didn't like when I was a kid

2589
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,740
like almonds or stuff like that, I don't care.

2590
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:20,740
Any candy, it tastes good.

2591
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:22,740
But I take one

2592
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,740
fucking bite of candy

2593
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:26,740
and not only do all of my teeth hurt

2594
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,740
but I can't drink anything afterwards

2595
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:30,740
and my mouth tastes like sugar

2596
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,740
and it just ruins my whole fucking throat.

2597
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,740
As soon as I take a bite of candy

2598
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:36,740
I want to die immediately.

2599
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,740
You should get some work done on those teeth dude.

2600
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,740
Every once in a while

2601
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,740
I'll go to the supermarket

2602
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,740
and buy an entire box of

2603
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,740
gushes and then open a pack

2604
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:48,740
and just scoop the entire pack

2605
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,740
and scoop the whole pack of gushes into my mouth.

2606
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,740
And then do the same thing

2607
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,740
and then do the same thing with every other pack

2608
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,740
in the box.

2609
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:58,740
Pack a box of gushes in my mouth

2610
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:00,740
and just let the gooey juice

2611
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:02,740
just squeeze so much.

2612
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,740
Did you guys ever turn

2613
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,740
fruit by the foot into just a jawbreaker?

2614
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,740
Hell yeah!

2615
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:10,740
Dude, I would squeeze it into a thing.

2616
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,740
Any of those fruit by the foot or like the

2617
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,740
fruit roll-ups I would just mash them into a ball

2618
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:16,740
and take little junk bites out of it.

2619
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,740
I eat them and that's tasty

2620
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,740
but I just feels wrong

2621
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,740
after I ate it.

2622
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,740
Well they are wrong, I love it.

2623
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,740
As a kid as well.

2624
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,740
Why did I eat that?

2625
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,740
That wasn't like a satisfying experience

2626
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,740
overall.

2627
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,740
For me it's not about satisfaction

2628
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,740
it's about physical pain.

2629
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,740
All of my teeth will scream at me.

2630
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,740
I have a filling in every tooth in my mouth

2631
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,740
and they don't take kindly to that shit.

2632
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:44,740
It's sad.

2633
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,740
It's really sad because

2634
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,740
as an adult I can afford as much candy as I want.

2635
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,740
I can go to the store and just buy all of them

2636
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,740
if I wanted to and it will mean nothing to me.

2637
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,740
I kind of get the same thing.

2638
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,740
For some reason lately

2639
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:58,740
chocolate has been making my teeth.

2640
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,740
I think I probably just have a cavity.

2641
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,740
There is a way to get

2642
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,740
chocolate that I enjoy

2643
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,740
which is bags of chocolate chips

2644
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:08,740
and you just do something with that.

2645
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:10,740
That's just a Hershey kiss but smaller!

2646
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:12,740
The thing though, the thing about that

2647
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,740
is that that's

2648
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,740
literally not true at all.

2649
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,740
It's a completely different taste.

2650
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,740
When I think of chocolate

2651
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,740
the taste of chocolate chips is exactly what

2652
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,740
even if it's Hershey's

2653
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,740
chocolate chips is not as milky.

2654
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,740
It's a totally different taste.

2655
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,740
It's way better of course.

2656
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,740
I don't know how this works

2657
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,740
but if you put chocolate chips into cookies

2658
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:36,740
and then you bake the cookies so the chocolate chips are melted

2659
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:38,740
but then they get unmelted because the cookies

2660
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,740
cool off

2661
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:42,740
the chocolate tastes a million times better

2662
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:44,740
now that it's been infused with the cookie.

2663
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,740
I do like sweet things and bakery and stuff

2664
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,740
but anything that comes out of a wrapper

2665
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:50,740
is just inherently gross.

2666
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,740
That's interesting.

2667
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,740
Now you can get into that.

2668
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,740
If that's wrapped it up

2669
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,740
I wait

2670
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,740
I have one more thing

2671
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,740
I don't know if I should bring it up.

2672
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:04,740
I was planning to wrap the whole podcast.

2673
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,740
I just want to move on to the next one.

2674
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,740
I have like one other thing.

2675
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:10,740
I have a book for like three hours

2676
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,740
I have so many topics left over

2677
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:14,740
since I was

2678
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,740
since I was on ceremony

2679
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,740
Let me do mine.

2680
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,740
Let me do mine.

2681
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,740
I really hope that this is not off base

2682
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:24,740
for the tone of the podcast

2683
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,740
but the thing that I cannot get into

2684
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,740
is the gender non-binary.

2685
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,740
Okay.

2686
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:32,740
And when I say that

2687
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,740
it probably sounds like I'm antsy.

2688
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,740
You can't get into it because you

2689
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:38,740
tried on the dress

2690
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:40,740
and it just wasn't working for you.

2691
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:42,740
When I say that I can't get into that

2692
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,740
it probably sounds like I'm transphobic

2693
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,740
or something. I'm not.

2694
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,740
I respect people's right

2695
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:50,740
to be treated the way they want

2696
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:52,740
and to express themselves the way they want

2697
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,740
and I wouldn't tell anyone that they can't do

2698
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:56,740
I'm transphobic. I hate trans people.

2699
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:58,740
I hate them all.

2700
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:00,740
But there is this idea

2701
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:02,740
that some people have

2702
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:04,740
in like that community

2703
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:06,740
and like when they try to express what it is

2704
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,740
about being like non-cis or trans

2705
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,740
they'll say like

2706
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,740
I am a woman on the inside

2707
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,740
like spiritually I am a woman

2708
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,740
like I am biologically

2709
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:18,740
a man but I feel like a woman

2710
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:20,740
and I don't know what that means

2711
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,740
and I don't think they know

2712
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:24,740
either because I don't think

2713
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:26,740
there is any specific feeling

2714
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:28,740
like being a man or being a woman

2715
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,740
I think that is

2716
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,740
what they probably mean is that I want

2717
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,740
to look and act this way

2718
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:36,740
and I think that's fair but when they kind of put this

2719
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:38,740
weird sort of almost mystical twist on it

2720
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:40,740
like it's what it is inside me

2721
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,740
I have to be like that doesn't mean

2722
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,740
well hang on Ben let me ask one

2723
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,740
I really think that the whole issue

2724
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,740
honestly comes down to

2725
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:50,740
definitions and words

2726
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,740
I really think in my heart of heart

2727
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:54,740
that it is at its core a semantical issue

2728
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:56,740
of how you define the word gender

2729
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,740
possible

2730
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,740
and therefore because it is a semantic issue

2731
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,740
I find the whole thing kind of boring

2732
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:04,740
and pointless

2733
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,740
hang on I've got a really important thing to ask about that

2734
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,740
because I have heard something that might

2735
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,740
be an issue with that now I'm pretty much with you

2736
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,740
on all that but I have heard when I've been

2737
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,740
you know reading about this stuff

2738
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,740
I have heard that there is an argument

2739
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,740
that there is a real biological difference

2740
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,740
between the male and female brain

2741
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:22,740
and some people contend that they have

2742
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,740
the wrong brain for what

2743
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:26,740
their you know like their body is

2744
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,740
now I have not really looked into it but I've heard

2745
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:30,740
that it's legit a little bit maybe

2746
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:32,740
I think that that claim

2747
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:34,740
I mean I don't know the studies

2748
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,740
I haven't read the studies but I think that on an

2749
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,740
individual basis that claim

2750
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,740
I have the wrong brain is impossible

2751
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,740
to back up

2752
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:44,740
what I think is that even if it were the case

2753
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,740
even is even your brain

2754
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,740
the definition like imagine if someone had

2755
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:50,740
imagine if a white guy had like

2756
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,740
the kind of nose that

2757
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:54,740
black people tend to have a little bit more often

2758
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,740
would you say I have a black nose or would you just say

2759
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:58,740
that

2760
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,740
necessarily the black nose

2761
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:02,740
you would have to research what if there was a difference between

2762
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:04,740
necessarily the female brain

2763
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:06,740
if one male person can have the same patterns

2764
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,740
as that female brain

2765
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,740
then is it necessarily the female brain

2766
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,740
you know that's what it is

2767
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:14,740
what it is

2768
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:16,740
what it is

2769
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:18,740
what it is

2770
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,740
what it is about the brain

2771
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,740
thing is that it's

2772
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,740
the average so the male average

2773
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:26,740
brain acts in a certain way

2774
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,740
okay I'm with you on that

2775
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,740
there's actually three genders

2776
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:32,740
Pinky Elmira and the brain

2777
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:34,740
okay

2778
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,740
okay hold on

2779
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,740
I've got one thing to say about this first

2780
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,740
the last thing you said was an important thing

2781
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,740
what's this one now

2782
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:44,740
get it all out at once

2783
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:46,740
okay because Ben said that such a thing is

2784
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:48,740
unquantifiable but because it is

2785
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:50,740
unquantifiable I say it is impossible to back up

2786
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:52,740
on an individual if that's the case

2787
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:54,740
then don't we kind of have to take their word for it

2788
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,740
when they say that

2789
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:58,740
I didn't say we shouldn't

2790
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:00,740
no look okay

2791
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,740
but let me say my thing I think you would do

2792
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,740
because I'm

2793
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,740
part way with you on this but for me

2794
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:08,740
I am not into

2795
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:10,740
labels at all

2796
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:12,740
I think the problem is

2797
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:14,740
I think the problem is people making a big deal

2798
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:16,740
out of being male or female

2799
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,740
or any gender just be you

2800
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:20,740
you guys know about gloom gender

2801
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:22,740
just be whatever you are

2802
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:24,740
and it doesn't need a name

2803
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,740
it doesn't need a title you don't have to make it

2804
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,740
a thing just be you

2805
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:30,740
and if you want to act

2806
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:32,740
a way that does not

2807
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,740
match up with what your genitals are

2808
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:36,740
then just act that way

2809
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,740
there is a strange

2810
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,740
dichotomy in the thinking

2811
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:42,740
of trans allies

2812
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:44,740
and the lgdb community

2813
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,740
which I cannot wrap my head around

2814
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:48,740
and the duality is that on the one hand

2815
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:50,740
they say that gender

2816
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,740
is merely performative

2817
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:54,740
they define gender to be merely performative

2818
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:56,740
and a social construct fair enough

2819
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,740
on the other hand they then

2820
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,740
you know they have

2821
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:02,740
you know they want to they choose one

2822
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,740
or the other like I am this

2823
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,740
I identify as this but if it is a social construct

2824
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:08,740
and a performative thing

2825
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,740
why must you then

2826
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:12,740
why must you then slot into one

2827
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:14,740
that is an excellent point Ben I have yet to hear a defense of that

2828
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,740
my whole thing

2829
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:18,740
with definitions and names and boundaries

2830
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,740
of where the words begin and end is

2831
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:22,740
what's the most useful

2832
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,740
because like I understand

2833
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,740
it doesn't matter what's useful or not

2834
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:28,740
people will come up with whatever they want

2835
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,740
when you think about stuff like

2836
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:32,740
gay, straight, bi or asexual

2837
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:34,740
I feel like

2838
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,740
which sexuality you have

2839
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:38,740
you can sort of at least round it up

2840
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:40,740
it's a better example to make my point

2841
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:42,740
that you can round it up

2842
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,740
or round it down into one of those four

2843
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,740
and those terms are useful

2844
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:48,740
if say you are at a party

2845
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:50,740
or a bar or whatever and someone wants to know

2846
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:52,740
whether or not they can hit on you or something like that

2847
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:54,740
fuck that

2848
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,740
just tell them individually

2849
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:58,740
I am or am not attracted to you

2850
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,740
it doesn't have to be I'm bi

2851
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:02,740
or I'm gay or I'm straight

2852
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,740
I don't like you get the fuck away from me

2853
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:06,740
that could be more useful but

2854
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,740
there are plenty of other

2855
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:10,740
circumstances where you need

2856
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:12,740
words to shorten down

2857
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:14,740
what you are, like digi is the

2858
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,740
otaku ganzo journalist

2859
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,740
those are three labels right there

2860
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,740
Jesse is the old school fool

2861
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:22,740
those are different terms

2862
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,740
I came up with a new name for you

2863
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,740
you are the home school fool

2864
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:28,740
with that home school cool

2865
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:30,740
Tom what were you trying to say

2866
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,740
actually what Nate just said is great

2867
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,740
because people say home school

2868
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:36,740
but there is such a huge grade

2869
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,740
and good old Ben he is that home stuck fuck

2870
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,740
with that home stuck suck

2871
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:44,740
I will gladly

2872
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:46,740
I will gladly take off

2873
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,740
what Nate brought up with home schooling

2874
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:50,740
because there are so many different kinds

2875
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:52,740
it really doesn't necessarily say anything

2876
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:54,740
about how that person was raised

2877
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:56,740
but here is the thing

2878
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:58,740
the term home school does mean

2879
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,740
that you were taught by your parents

2880
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:02,740
probably at home as a term

2881
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,740
and there is no concrete definition to it

2882
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:06,740
but that term is useful

2883
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:08,740
I can't just begin

2884
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,740
but who cares about the fact that you were home school

2885
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:12,740
other than you just feeling like

2886
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,740
well for example when we need to talk

2887
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:16,740
about it like in the last podcast

2888
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,740
and what if I began

2889
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:20,740
my talking about it

2890
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:22,740
my commentary by saying

2891
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,740
by like trying to like in three paragraphs

2892
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:26,740
describe exactly what my situation was

2893
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:28,740
that would have been perfect

2894
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,740
hold on did he not at all

2895
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,740
because this is how I used to communicate

2896
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,740
I would like try to explain all the details

2897
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:36,740
before like explaining what the overall

2898
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,740
reality was

2899
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,740
you don't have to do it before or you can do it later

2900
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:42,740
no I did it that way and you complain

2901
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:44,740
that whenever I begin talking about something

2902
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,740
you don't know what I'm talking about until I'm

2903
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,740
toward the end of my point so I'm like oh

2904
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:50,740
this is what we need words for

2905
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,740
I don't think home school counts as a label

2906
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,740
I don't think that's the same thing as what I'm describing

2907
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,740
you say home school people think of certain things

2908
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:58,740
but they'll probably be inaccurate

2909
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:00,740
but it does mean

2910
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:02,740
like you weren't schooled in a building

2911
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:04,740
you were probably schooled by your parents

2912
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:06,740
it means certain things

2913
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:08,740
necessarily even though everyone is on some sort of weird

2914
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:10,740
gradient

2915
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,740
I began my commentary on the last podcast

2916
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,740
I was home schooled that lets people get

2917
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,740
some context into what I'm talking about

2918
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:18,740
and then I can elaborate later but not everyone

2919
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:20,740
can know exactly what you mean

2920
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,740
let Tom say his thing

2921
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:24,740
I think the reason though

2922
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,740
that people get hung up

2923
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,740
on the label with

2924
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,740
trends and all that kind of stuff is because

2925
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:32,740
it's not it's because they want to feel

2926
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:34,740
part of a community

2927
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:36,740
because

2928
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,740
that whole kind of like there's this huge kind of

2929
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:40,740
collectivist ideology

2930
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,740
deep in the root of social justice

2931
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:44,740
whatever you want to identify that as

2932
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,740
it's very much a collectivist ideology

2933
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,740
so they don't really

2934
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,740
did you you're making a great point I agree with you

2935
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:52,740
because I'm an individualist but they're not individualist

2936
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,740
like they classify themselves

2937
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:56,740
isn't individualist a label

2938
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:58,740
and that's one of the problems I have

2939
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,740
I think with the whole

2940
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:02,740
kind of like trans movement

2941
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:04,740
I guess is that because what they do

2942
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:06,740
is they'll say like I want to be a woman

2943
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:08,740
or I want to be a man but then they make

2944
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:10,740
a big deal about the trans label so now we

2945
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:12,740
have male female trans male and trans

2946
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,740
now we have four things instead of trying to

2947
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,740
just transition from one to the other

2948
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,740
so you that

2949
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,740
plus for identity is making it more

2950
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:22,740
more complicated instead of just simplifying

2951
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,740
it because by putting so much emphasis

2952
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:26,740
on that

2953
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,740
that's true the social

2954
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,740
the social and community aspect must

2955
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:32,740
complicate the issue

2956
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:34,740
this also comes down to because I

2957
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,740
made this exact same argument on an episode of Digi Bros

2958
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,740
before the one I was making earlier

2959
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,740
and you know some of the responses were saying

2960
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:42,740
well you know

2961
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:44,740
in the name of getting people to

2962
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:46,740
understand what the fuck

2963
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,740
this thing is having labels

2964
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:50,740
is helpful and I get that

2965
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,740
it's just that

2966
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:54,740
DeVu has accused me of this before

2967
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,740
that I always seem to go right for the biggest

2968
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,740
possible picture as opposed to

2969
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:00,740
what is individually relevant right now

2970
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,740
because in my mind I'm wanting

2971
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:04,740
everyone to not care about labels

2972
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:06,740
anymore forever

2973
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:08,740
just all people all over the world

2974
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,740
and I was going to say like if you never

2975
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:12,740
if you're one of these people who's you know

2976
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:14,740
got their own fractured you know gender identity

2977
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:16,740
or whatever like you're like do we just need

2978
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,740
to make labels for everybody because there's always

2979
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:20,740
going to be somebody who doesn't fit isn't

2980
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:22,740
it better to just shoot for we all kind of just

2981
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:24,740
you know we live in our own shit

2982
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,740
that's the real solution

2983
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:28,740
was themselves and everyone else

2984
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:30,740
didn't question it and just accepted it

2985
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:32,740
but obviously

2986
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,740
we're not in that world and it's

2987
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:36,740
it's going to take a while and like you know

2988
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,740
a lot of people won't get what you're doing

2989
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:40,740
if you're like acting one gender

2990
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,740
that is not the one that you seem to be

2991
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:44,740
you know people won't get that so I get

2992
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:46,740
I get why the labels exist I'm just saying that

2993
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:48,740
as an idealist

2994
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:50,740
who wants to live in a world where everyone's

2995
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,740
just a fucking weirdo that's my dream of the

2996
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,740
perfect reality is that everyone

2997
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:56,740
is totally fucking weird

2998
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:58,740
that's my perfect world

2999
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,740
is that every person I see

3000
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:02,740
and I'm like what the fuck is that guy

3001
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:04,740
that's awesome

3002
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,740
what is that

3003
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,740
guy is not a gendered term

3004
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:10,740
yeah guy is just a name for the coolest guy

3005
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,740
I'm a dude, he's a dude, she's a dude

3006
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:14,740
we're all dudes yeah

3007
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,740
the same applies for guy

3008
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:18,740
but you can't even do this example

3009
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:20,740
without saying he and she

3010
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:22,740
like you can't even like make any progress

3011
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:24,740
they're just entrenched in our language

3012
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,740
whatever did this podcast become

3013
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:28,740
I like the better one you were arguing about

3014
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:30,740
yellow

3015
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,740
I sure didn't

3016
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:34,740
and I just want to close out my point by saying

3017
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:36,740
that again it's not about

3018
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,740
what anyone does or chooses to do

3019
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,740
I think everyone should be free to do whatever they want

3020
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:42,740
it's only some of the reasoning

3021
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:44,740
behind it that when

3022
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:46,740
explained I think when someone says

3023
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:48,740
I am actually a woman

3024
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:50,740
or I'm a woman on the inside

3025
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,740
I don't think that necessarily means anything

3026
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:54,740
I think that there's a thing

3027
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,740
I close out I guess

3028
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,740
I've always kind of thought

3029
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:00,740
it's kind of insolvable with this kind of mentality

3030
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:02,740
maybe just no one's explained it to me good enough

3031
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:04,740
is that you have people saying

3032
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:06,740
I'm a woman on the inside because

3033
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:08,740
there's differences between men and women

3034
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,740
and I'm a woman trapped in a man's body

3035
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:12,740
but those same people also say

3036
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:14,740
all the time

3037
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:16,740
it's arbitrary

3038
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,740
it's socially defined

3039
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,740
gender norms are bullshit

3040
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,740
so if there's differences

3041
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:24,740
then you're either saying

3042
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:26,740
I just kind of made that point

3043
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:28,740
I think while you were standing up

3044
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,740
he did

3045
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:32,740
I can totally get

3046
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:34,740
relating to and identifying more strongly

3047
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,740
with a traditionally feminine

3048
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,740
societal role

3049
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:40,740
that makes sense to me

3050
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,740
being a woman on the inside

3051
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,740
feeling like a woman on the inside

3052
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:46,740
does not make sense to me

3053
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:48,740
I think you have a very funny definition of the phrase

3054
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:50,740
things I can't get into

3055
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,740
just to close out people

3056
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:54,740
everybody go watch

3057
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:56,740
are we closing out or do we not have more

3058
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,740
do you guys want to do more

3059
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:00,740
I didn't get to say anything in this podcast

3060
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:02,740
we will do more but let me just say

3061
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,740
because I wanted to just say digi

3062
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,740
I have a beautiful vision of what you were saying

3063
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,740
would look like and what is Imaishi's current show

3064
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:10,740
that's going on with the alien girl

3065
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:12,740
Luluko

3066
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,740
Space Patrol Luluko is the perfect ideal of this

3067
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:16,740
I gotta talk

3068
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,740
Matthew Matosis into cutting this

3069
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:20,740
one ten minute chunk out of his four hour live stream

3070
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,740
at E3 where he was just on this

3071
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:24,740
like epic rant about

3072
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:26,740
how space should be fucking chaos

3073
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,740
he was like

3074
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,740
everytime I play a game about space

3075
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:32,740
I can't do his accent

3076
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:34,740
everytime he plays a game about space

3077
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,740
it's always just like normal

3078
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,740
it's always human stuff

3079
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:40,740
it's always humans fighting humans

3080
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:42,740
if I go out into space everything should be fucking crazy

3081
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:44,740
I just want to walk up to somebody and be like

3082
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,740
oh my god what the fuck is that

3083
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:48,740
and he just went on this long rant about it

3084
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:50,740
that was awesome

3085
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:52,740
it was the best thing I ever heard

3086
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,740
Jesse you were agreeing with him

3087
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:56,740
oh ok I get it I'm with you

3088
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:58,740
Matthew Matosis

3089
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:00,740
tell me your sins boy

3090
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,740
oh father

3091
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,740
father Matosis

3092
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:06,740
your sins

3093
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:08,740
he's definitely

3094
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,740
I can't get into Matthew Matosis guys

3095
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:12,740
Jesse what's the thing you can't get into

3096
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,740
that's not true I can

3097
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:16,740
old comics

3098
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:18,740
comics

3099
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:20,740
yeah like silver age

3100
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,740
bronze age

3101
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,740
shut up

3102
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:26,740
yeah

3103
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,740
iron age

3104
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,740
shut the fuck up god damn it

3105
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:34,740
he's getting steamed now folks

3106
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:36,740
I'm gonna

3107
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:38,740
I'm gonna ban you

3108
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,740
I'm just gonna talk to myself

3109
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,740
that's the ideal scenario

3110
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:44,740
I'm really interested in this though

3111
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:46,740
because I've always been curious about whether

3112
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,740
comic fans like old comics

3113
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:50,740
I figured Jesse would be into the golden age

3114
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:52,740
because of what got

3115
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:54,740
ok

3116
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:56,740
shut the fuck up

3117
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:58,740
alright Jesse go on

3118
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,740
I don't know what you were getting at with that

3119
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,740
so in the 1980s

3120
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:04,740
Frank Miller

3121
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:06,740
Alan Moore

3122
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,740
and Grant Morrison all got together

3123
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,740
and said what if comics were good

3124
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:12,740
and they made

3125
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,740
and they wrote Arkham Asylum

3126
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:16,740
they wrote The Killing Joke and Watchmen

3127
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:18,740
they wrote Daredevil and Wolverine

3128
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,740
and all those great comics

3129
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,740
and suddenly comics were good forever for all time

3130
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,740
it was the greatest medium

3131
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:26,740
in the history of art

3132
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:28,740
but before that

3133
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:30,740
every comic was trash

3134
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:32,740
all of them from the golden age

3135
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:34,740
silver age and bronze age

3136
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:36,740
I tried to

3137
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:38,740
anything pre 1980s and even some comics

3138
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:40,740
from the 1980s

3139
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:42,740
I tried to read them

3140
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,740
I'm like I want to read these old stories

3141
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,740
and I just fucking

3142
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,740
I see the art

3143
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,740
and I see the giant retarded word balloons

3144
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:52,740
and it's just like

3145
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:54,740
Jesse are you telling me that Stan Lee

3146
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:56,740
is not the greatest creative genius who ever lived

3147
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:58,740
I don't think Stan Lee actually

3148
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:00,740
created anything

3149
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,740
I think he's kind of a con man

3150
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:04,740
kind of

3151
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:06,740
except that one time he cosplayed his liquid ocelot

3152
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:08,740
that was pretty dope

3153
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:10,740
he's great it's not his fault

3154
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:12,740
it's just

3155
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,740
his time was an era

3156
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,740
bereft of talent

3157
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:18,740
the paradigm was

3158
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:20,740
to make bad comics

3159
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:22,740
I've always wondered about

3160
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:24,740
it's all about the generational evolution

3161
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:26,740
where the kids grow up on something that sucks

3162
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:28,740
but they can appreciate

3163
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:30,740
what is the potential about it

3164
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:32,740
and they spend all their time wanting to make it better

3165
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:34,740
and they become adults and they take it to the next level

3166
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:36,740
that's what happened with film

3167
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,740
I'm gonna piggyback on Jesse's thing

3168
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:40,740
and say I can't get into old

3169
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,740
anything

3170
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,740
as soon as it's passed a certain threshold of age

3171
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:46,740
it's just

3172
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:48,740
I think that what Jesse just described

3173
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:50,740
with the comic creators getting together

3174
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,740
and saying what if comics were good

3175
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:54,740
I think that has happened in every

3176
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,740
medium where

3177
01:54:56,740 --> 01:54:58,740
with movies like the oldest movies I really

3178
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,740
can get into are like the 70s

3179
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:02,740
which is when the movie brat

3180
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:04,740
generation came around

3181
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:06,740
when Kane did you

3182
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:08,740
I don't think they actually

3183
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:10,740
had a meeting and said that

3184
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,740
I made that story up

3185
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,740
I don't think the movie brats did either

3186
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,740
but my point is that

3187
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,740
there was a period in the 70s

3188
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:20,740
where a bunch of people who were like these

3189
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:22,740
big time film buffs

3190
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:24,740
who were big fans of film

3191
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:26,740
who were educated in film specifically

3192
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:28,740
as opposed to

3193
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,740
this was just what Nino was talking about

3194
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:32,740
in his fucking Miyazaki video

3195
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:34,740
in the 70s and the 60s

3196
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:36,740
anime creators

3197
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,740
were all people who were like

3198
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:40,740
doctors and stuff

3199
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,740
people who had come from other fields

3200
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:44,740
referencing a Nino video

3201
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:46,740
it's a new world we're in now

3202
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:48,740
Nino was talking about how

3203
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:50,740
these creators

3204
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,740
of the older anime were not

3205
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:54,740
like anime fans

3206
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,740
they were influenced by other works of art

3207
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:58,740
but then when

3208
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:00,740
you got Gainax coming into the fold

3209
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:02,740
and stuff like that

3210
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,740
they were inspired specifically by anime

3211
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:06,740
not exclusively

3212
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,740
Anno has made a huge point

3213
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,740
about how the fact that he thinks everyone is just influenced

3214
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,740
by anime these days and it's a problem

3215
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:14,740
but

3216
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,740
I think that those are the people who

3217
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,740
Miyazaki or does Anno say that too

3218
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:20,740
Anno says it too

3219
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:22,740
but I think that

3220
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,740
there's certain periods where people who are

3221
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,740
into a medium

3222
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:28,740
and who clearly care deeply about it

3223
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:30,740
can sort of recognize what's good about it

3224
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:32,740
like better than

3225
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:34,740
perhaps the people who actually made the stuff

3226
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:36,740
right? because everyone's just kind of

3227
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,740
like if you're making something

3228
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:40,740
new that's never existed before

3229
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:42,740
then it's more about

3230
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,740
how to make it cost effective

3231
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:46,740
how to make it something that is

3232
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,740
capable of being done

3233
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:50,740
like how do we even make

3234
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,740
an anime happen

3235
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:54,740
and then the people who come later

3236
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:56,740
look at all those anime and they go like

3237
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:58,740
this this and this were the best episodes of

3238
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,740
Astro Boy so what if we copied those

3239
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:02,740
elements and made a show like that

3240
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:04,740
as opposed to throwing

3241
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:06,740
100 episodes worth of ideas

3242
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,740
at a wall only some of which will stick

3243
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:10,740
and so I think that every

3244
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,740
medium

3245
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:14,740
inherently gets better over time because people can

3246
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:16,740
look at the old stuff and say

3247
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:18,740
they can cut out the stuff that didn't work

3248
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:20,740
and they can put in new stuff that does work

3249
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:22,740
here's my counter

3250
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:24,740
wait you don't say that about video games

3251
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,740
here's my

3252
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:28,740
I would say that about video games

3253
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:30,740
video games from the fucking 70s were garbage

3254
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:32,740
you want to fucking play Pong?

3255
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:34,740
I totally disagree with that

3256
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:36,740
Digi because in my humble opinion

3257
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,740
anything that is old

3258
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:40,740
or recycled or reincorporated

3259
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:42,740
is automatically a lesser version

3260
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,740
of the original

3261
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,740
well I completely disagree

3262
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:48,740
I like Quentin Tarantino more than any of the directorcy copies

3263
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:50,740
the fact that

3264
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:52,740
new movies might take something

3265
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:54,740
an old movie did and do it

3266
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:56,740
quote unquote better

3267
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:58,740
but the fact that they're not the first one to do it

3268
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:00,740
makes it less valuable

3269
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:02,740
I totally and completely disagree

3270
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:04,740
I think being the first one actually makes

3271
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:06,740
is a sad weakness

3272
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:08,740
like you were the first one

3273
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:10,740
you're a fool bro

3274
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:12,740
those people deserve all the respect

3275
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:14,740
in the world

3276
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:16,740
they just have by the sad fact of being

3277
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:18,740
first have made the worst product

3278
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:20,740
this is getting like way beyond

3279
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:22,740
what I originally was talking about

3280
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:24,740
I just think that specifically

3281
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:26,740
with old comics

3282
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:28,740
you're right we were talking about comics

3283
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:30,740
I totally co-opted

3284
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:32,740
Jesse's problem

3285
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:34,740
I look at old comics

3286
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:36,740
and the artwork looks derpy

3287
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,740
it all looks like this weird

3288
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:40,740
homogenized 60s style

3289
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:42,740
I think everyone knows what I'm talking about when I talk about old comic book art

3290
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,740
and the stories

3291
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:46,740
are always so wordy

3292
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:48,740
the characters are describing everything they're doing

3293
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:50,740
and they're just a pain in the ass to read

3294
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:52,740
they're just not well written

3295
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:54,740
or well conceived even

3296
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:56,740
and not even just

3297
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,740
like that the stories themselves are bad

3298
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,740
most of them are pretty far out

3299
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:02,740
and weird and wacky

3300
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,740
but not necessarily bad it's just

3301
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:06,740
like they didn't have anything

3302
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:08,740
they didn't know what good was yet

3303
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:10,740
it's like

3304
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:12,740
well they were for kids back then

3305
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:14,740
yeah like nowadays

3306
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,740
like those three guys that I said

3307
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:18,740
Frank Miller and Alan Moore and Grant Morrison

3308
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:20,740
every comic ever

3309
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:22,740
nowadays is influenced so heavily

3310
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,740
by the books they wrote in the 80s

3311
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,740
that they kind of

3312
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,740
made comics something completely different

3313
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:30,740
than they originally were so it's almost like

3314
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,740
a whole different thing that I'm talking about

3315
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:34,740
when I'm talking about old comics

3316
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:36,740
and I feel the same way

3317
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:38,740
about like TV anime

3318
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:40,740
with Ava were like

3319
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:42,740
and all the anime that was good

3320
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:44,740
in like the 80s was either like

3321
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:46,740
the world masterpiece theater show

3322
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,740
which meant it was based on an old novel

3323
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:50,740
or it was like directed by

3324
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,740
these very few certain directors

3325
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:54,740
who were doing like good stuff

3326
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:56,740
but none of it was anything close to what

3327
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:58,740
Ava did and like Ava created

3328
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:00,740
the idea of original TV anime

3329
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:02,740
and the directing

3330
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:04,740
was so much better

3331
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:06,740
in my opinion I mean there's plenty of people

3332
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:08,740
who will actually kill me

3333
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:10,740
for saying that

3334
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,740
Anno is better than Osamu Dazaki

3335
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:14,740
or something but like I watch those old shows

3336
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:16,740
and what I see is an 80s anime

3337
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,740
and when I watch Evangelion

3338
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:20,740
I do not see 1995

3339
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:22,740
I see

3340
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:24,740
like the best anime I've ever seen

3341
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:26,740
you know

3342
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:28,740
yeah but I mean okay

3343
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,740
we've made new anime since Ava so it's obviously

3344
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:32,740
not the best anymore you know

3345
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,740
there you go

3346
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:36,740
in that one specific instance it might have been done

3347
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:38,740
like way better but in general

3348
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:40,740
it's not better just because it was done again

3349
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:42,740
I just think that I think

3350
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,740
when you take something

3351
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:46,740
when you take something old

3352
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:48,740
and you subtract all the shitty parts

3353
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:50,740
and just tighten up the good parts

3354
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:52,740
and then enhance it

3355
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,740
with your own extra creative edge

3356
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:56,740
it's a better product

3357
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:58,740
it depends on what like that's so vague

3358
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:00,740
it's totally vague it's all about the artistic

3359
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:02,740
it's the individual artistic product

3360
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:04,740
you can judge it by whether or not it's better or not

3361
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:06,740
if they didn't enhance it then it's not going to be a better product

3362
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:08,740
it depends on what these so called shitty parts

3363
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:10,740
if something is good

3364
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:12,740
then I like it

3365
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:14,740
if something is good then I like it

3366
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:16,740
what the fuck

3367
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:18,740
it doesn't matter how old it is

3368
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:20,740
I like old things

3369
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:22,740
I like new things I like

3370
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:24,740
Ben what if there's a movie

3371
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:26,740
where like the whole

3372
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:28,740
thing is amazing

3373
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,740
but there's this one part where they left in

3374
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:32,740
like this like just

3375
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:34,740
lame ass ten minute

3376
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:36,740
like two characters taking

3377
02:01:36,740 --> 02:01:38,740
a poop or something like except not

3378
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:40,740
that hilarious

3379
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:42,740
something dumb

3380
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:44,740
that happens in the middle of the movie

3381
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:46,740
and then someone later

3382
02:01:46,740 --> 02:01:48,740
like if in Citizen Kane they just two characters

3383
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,740
started doing battle shits in the middle of it

3384
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:52,740
for like yeah

3385
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:54,740
I'm trying to think of an example that wouldn't

3386
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,740
make the movie better

3387
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:58,740
let's put it this way

3388
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:00,740
what if you took Citizen Kane and made

3389
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:02,740
the same concept but now it has battle

3390
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:04,740
shits in it it's a better movie

3391
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:06,740
fucking Kane

3392
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,740
Kane and his wife

3393
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:10,740
are sitting across the long table in the

3394
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,740
Xanadu fucking farting at each other

3395
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:14,740
you can't just add

3396
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:16,740
bullshit to an old thing and then it's like

3397
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:18,740
apparently a better artistic piece

3398
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:20,740
God fucking damn it

3399
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,740
I want you to prove yourself here

3400
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:24,740
because I want you to like list off

3401
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:26,740
all your favorite stuff at some point

3402
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:28,740
figure out if it's clearly all new stuff

3403
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:30,740
I will list off my favorite

3404
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,740
things at some point when we do

3405
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:34,740
the people versus Ben St

3406
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:36,740
like isn't like

3407
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:38,740
isn't Homestuck like your favorite thing of all time

3408
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:40,740
that's super new and it's super built on the

3409
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:42,740
backs of like every other art medium

3410
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:44,740
ever created if video games

3411
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:46,740
hadn't existed you couldn't have that

3412
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:48,740
everything's built on the back of something

3413
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:50,740
but everything that's great about Homestuck

3414
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:52,740
is the way that it fucking innovated

3415
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:54,740
and did things that no one had ever done before

3416
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:56,740
do you think that the video game

3417
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:58,740
parts of Homestuck are inherently

3418
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:00,740
not as good as Pong

3419
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,740
because they weren't the first video game

3420
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:04,740
is that what you're saying

3421
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:06,740
okay look let me

3422
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:08,740
counter that if there had never been

3423
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:10,740
a video game ever if video games

3424
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,740
did not exist and then you were

3425
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:14,740
reading Homestuck and you hit

3426
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:16,740
that next button and suddenly you were having

3427
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:18,740
an interactive experience

3428
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:20,740
let's discuss the reality

3429
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:22,740
let's discuss the reality we live in

3430
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:24,740
Ben

3431
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:26,740
let's discuss the actual reality we live in

3432
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:28,740
where things are constantly getting iterated

3433
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:30,740
making a fucking thought experiment

3434
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:32,740
digi

3435
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:34,740
like of course that would be the case

3436
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:36,740
but that's not the case

3437
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:38,740
so

3438
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:40,740
Ben you need to understand the difference between

3439
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:42,740
the point is that newness is valuable and precious

3440
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,740
you're talking about stuff that is

3441
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:46,740
impressive like the amount of

3442
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:48,740
wow that is so much more

3443
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:50,740
new it's not the same as being

3444
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:52,740
better

3445
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:54,740
I think newness

3446
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:56,740
there is definitely inherent

3447
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:58,740
like an inherent goodness

3448
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:00,740
to newness

3449
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:02,740
but I don't think that that

3450
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:04,740
goodness exceeds the goodness of

3451
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:06,740
being better

3452
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:08,740
but you're judging better by

3453
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:10,740
doing it again with other shit

3454
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:12,740
like there has to be

3455
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:14,740
which is what everything is

3456
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:16,740
everything after the original

3457
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:18,740
is just doing the same thing

3458
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:20,740
but better

3459
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:22,740
I like things that are

3460
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:24,740
good

3461
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:26,740
much better

3462
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,740
a vastly superior thought experiment

3463
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:30,740
imagine Pong came out today

3464
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:32,740
you'd be like oh

3465
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:34,740
I can't get into Pong honestly

3466
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:36,740
I just can't

3467
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:38,740
it beeps and it boops

3468
02:04:38,740 --> 02:04:40,740
Pong is just

3469
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:42,740
tennis

3470
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:44,740
that proves my point too

3471
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:46,740
because if it came out today

3472
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:48,740
it wouldn't be good but back when it was new

3473
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:50,740
because it was the first fucking video game

3474
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:52,740
it was good

3475
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,740
and now it sucks

3476
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:56,740
do you want to play Pong?

3477
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:58,740
is Pong your favorite video game?

3478
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:00,740
no no one gives a fuck about Pong

3479
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:02,740
it's not good anymore

3480
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:04,740
I give a fuck about Pong

3481
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:06,740
on the PS1 version

3482
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:08,740
the remake

3483
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:10,740
it had value

3484
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:12,740
and was impressive

3485
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:14,740
and people wanted it

3486
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:16,740
it was

3487
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:18,740
it was

3488
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:20,740
it's not even was

3489
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:22,740
as we know

3490
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:24,740
and it continues to be noteworthy

3491
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:26,740
no no no worthy yes

3492
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:28,740
it is very noteworthy

3493
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:30,740
it deserves

3494
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:32,740
all the respect in the world

3495
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:34,740
doesn't make it the best video game

3496
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:36,740
this all came out of my topic somehow

3497
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:38,740
I'm so sorry

3498
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:40,740
here is why Ben is wrong

3499
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:42,740
than anyone even gives him credit for

3500
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:44,740
as we know from that PlayStation 3 commercial

3501
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:46,740
our grandmothers

3502
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:48,740
played by having

3503
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:50,740
a hoop with a stick

3504
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:52,740
and kicking that around

3505
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:54,740
grandmothers played by getting raped

3506
02:05:56,740 --> 02:05:58,740
they got raped in the back of a Cadillac

3507
02:05:58,740 --> 02:06:00,740
after prom

3508
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:02,740
people were bored as shit

3509
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:04,740
all the time

3510
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:06,740
people had very little stimulus

3511
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:08,740
to go on compared to what we have now

3512
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:10,740
and now those people are old

3513
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:12,740
and they just sit in their houses

3514
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:14,740
doing nothing

3515
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:16,740
forever when we are old

3516
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,740
it's not going to be like that

3517
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:20,740
when we are in our 80s

3518
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,740
we're just going to be marathoning shows and videos

3519
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,740
and playing video games all the time

3520
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:26,740
I like to think I'll still be drawing right up until I'm in the ground

3521
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:28,740
but you'll also be doing this other shit

3522
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:30,740
we are into so much more stuff

3523
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:32,740
like in 1997

3524
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:34,740
a kid playing Final Fantasy 7

3525
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:36,740
is enjoying himself

3526
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:38,740
way more

3527
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:40,740
on average probably

3528
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,740
than most of the biggest, most fanatic

3529
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:44,740
fans of pawn

3530
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:46,740
we are having more fun

3531
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:48,740
relative

3532
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:50,740
but there's also a time

3533
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:52,740
relativity here

3534
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,740
life is objectively better

3535
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:56,740
today than it was in the 1800s

3536
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:58,740
but happiness is not up

3537
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:00,740
because of your happiness

3538
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:02,740
overall is compared to everything else around you

3539
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:04,740
the medical technology we have today

3540
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:06,740
gives you

3541
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,740
you should read

3542
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:10,740
there's a fantastic chapter of One Piece

3543
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:12,740
during the Marine Corps

3544
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:14,740
I thought you were going to recommend a self-help book

3545
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:16,740
if that's pretty much what it is

3546
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:18,740
in which

3547
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:20,740
this is my favorite podcast

3548
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,740
we've ever done by the way

3549
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:24,740
in which

3550
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:26,740
Don Quixote, Do Flamingo

3551
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:28,740
does this grand young speech

3552
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:30,740
what does Don Quixote have to do with this

3553
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:32,740
Jesse, I'm talking about One Piece

3554
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:34,740
in which this guy who's a really powerful pirate

3555
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:36,740
makes up grand speech during this war

3556
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:38,740
in which the fate of the world is at stake

3557
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,740
about

3558
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:42,740
when you're poor

3559
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:44,740
like little things

3560
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,740
become much more valuable to you

3561
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:48,740
and if you're rich and entitled

3562
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:50,740
then losing even the small thing

3563
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:52,740
is a proportionally much bigger deal

3564
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:54,740
and that our happiness

3565
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:56,740
is contextual on our experiences in life

3566
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:58,740
well thank god One Piece exists

3567
02:07:58,740 --> 02:08:00,740
to give us that philosophical truth

3568
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:02,740
imagine if Nate were

3569
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,740
a marriage counselor

3570
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:06,740
we just keep fighting all the time

3571
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:08,740
what should we do

3572
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:10,740
well I've seen chapter 375

3573
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,740
of One Piece

3574
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:14,740
one piece taught me how to be a real human being

3575
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:16,740
I'm imagining

3576
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:18,740
Nate in a church

3577
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:20,740
he's in a big church and there's stained glass windows

3578
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:22,740
and they've all got the crew members

3579
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:24,740
of the going

3580
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:26,740
Mary on them and he pulls out

3581
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:28,740
he's like today we'll be reading from

3582
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:30,740
chapter 537

3583
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:32,740
One Piece is my bible dude

3584
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:34,740
page 15, panel 7

3585
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:36,740
and Frankie said

3586
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,740
SUPER

3587
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,740
SUPER

3588
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:42,740
we sing that shit

3589
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:44,740
we have all the medical advances we have today

3590
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:46,740
where our bodies on average get to feel

3591
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:48,740
a whole lot less pain

3592
02:08:48,740 --> 02:08:50,740
and misery than we did before

3593
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,740
but your happiness overall might be

3594
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:54,740
the same as it was in the 1800s

3595
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:56,740
but here's the thing

3596
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:58,740
the amount of pain you have in your body

3597
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:00,740
is a different variable to evaluate your standard of living

3598
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:02,740
and your happiness is a totally separate variable

3599
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:04,740
so like a kid from the 70s

3600
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:06,740
could go out and have the same amount of

3601
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:08,740
time of fun playing

3602
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:10,740
Pong as a kid from the 90s

3603
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:12,740
would go out and play Pong like it's the same

3604
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:14,740
amount of fun it's just that the kid

3605
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:16,740
in the 70s has so

3606
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,740
few alternatives to go to

3607
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:20,740
beyond Pong whereas a kid from today

3608
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:22,740
playing Pong could enjoy it just as much

3609
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:24,740
but we'll choose to do it

3610
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:26,740
less because there's better alternatives

3611
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:28,740
so they'll walk away

3612
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:30,740
from playing Pong going it wasn't

3613
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:32,740
really worth it because I could just play

3614
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,740
Final Fantasy 7 and have a much better time

3615
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:36,740
whereas from the 70s kid he'd be like

3616
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:38,740
oh it was a great time there's nothing better to do

3617
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:40,740
so that is why

3618
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:42,740
even at the time it wasn't worth it

3619
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,740
you just didn't have the ability to feel

3620
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:46,740
how much better it is now

3621
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:48,740
putting aside the whole issue of like whether or not

3622
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:50,740
you know like audio-visual

3623
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:52,740
stimulus is necessarily better than like real life stuff

3624
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:54,740
I agree I agree

3625
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:56,740
alright who else has a

3626
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:58,740
thing to think into

3627
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:00,740
I've got one that's an extension

3628
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:02,740
of one that you of yours

3629
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:04,740
Digi what was that

3630
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:06,740
Country Song

3631
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:08,740
and this is it's just

3632
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:10,740
music all music

3633
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:12,740
music in general I can't get into it

3634
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:14,740
and I'll tell you why

3635
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:16,740
I'm kinda with you

3636
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:18,740
it's not that I don't like music

3637
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,740
because when I listen to music often times I enjoy

3638
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:22,740
it immensely and you've recommended a lot of stuff

3639
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,740
that I really liked

3640
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:26,740
I always thought you were a lot more into music

3641
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:28,740
I know Ben isn't into like

3642
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:30,740
anything he's mentioned

3643
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:32,740
Ben's less so than me

3644
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:34,740
yeah see that's the thing

3645
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:36,740
I like music when I get to it

3646
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:38,740
the problem is I don't have a place in my life

3647
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:40,740
for music

3648
02:10:40,740 --> 02:10:42,740
and that's really what I'm talking about

3649
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:44,740
there's no point in my life

3650
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:46,740
when I have a place where I can just put on music

3651
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:48,740
like you Jesse, I mean you Digi

3652
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:50,740
you just listen to music like all the time

3653
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:52,740
is what you've always said

3654
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:54,740
it's just always playing in the background

3655
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:56,740
I like when I'm editing

3656
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:58,740
I don't want to be listening to music

3657
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:00,740
because I need to hear the audio stuff

3658
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:02,740
I have to edit in silence

3659
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:04,740
you know there's a

3660
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:06,740
you just open up your music player

3661
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:08,740
you start playing an album

3662
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:10,740
with no vocals

3663
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:12,740
and you turn the volume down on the music player

3664
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:14,740
to like 20%

3665
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:16,740
that's not gonna be good enough

3666
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:18,740
it's gotta be quieter than the music of your video

3667
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:20,740
and it will not interrupt anything

3668
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:22,740
I promise you

3669
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:24,740
I don't want to just put music on the background

3670
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:26,740
I actually am enjoying listening to it

3671
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:28,740
see well that there's your problem

3672
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:30,740
because I have recently found a place

3673
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:32,740
for music in my life

3674
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:34,740
which is I put on some like

3675
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:36,740
soothing vapor wave

3676
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:38,740
chill wave, simpsons wave

3677
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:40,740
vapor wave is like a seal wave

3678
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:42,740
and you put and I put it on

3679
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:44,740
and it has to be of a particularly low tempo

3680
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:46,740
sort

3681
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:48,740
and I put it on and it's just atmospheric

3682
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:50,740
and I leave it on and if the music is

3683
02:11:50,740 --> 02:11:52,740
non-distracting enough then I can just sit

3684
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:54,740
and like either write

3685
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:56,740
or sketch or ink

3686
02:11:56,740 --> 02:11:58,740
or tone or whatever

3687
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:00,740
while I have it on

3688
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:02,740
just because yours doesn't involve audio at all

3689
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:04,740
but my work does so you know it's

3690
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:06,740
I don't think it interrupts

3691
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,740
my work involves audio too

3692
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:10,740
you're gonna tell me what interrupts my work

3693
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:12,740
you're gonna tell me how I should be editing

3694
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:14,740
I'm just saying you haven't tried it

3695
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:16,740
I haven't tried it with like super chill music

3696
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:18,740
I mean I think if you're just syncing up like

3697
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:20,740
the key is to use

3698
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:22,740
to go and find the music to play

3699
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:24,740
I have to download it, I have to put it on loop

3700
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:26,740
I have to see if I like it

3701
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:28,740
just listen to everything on YouTube

3702
02:12:28,740 --> 02:12:30,740
everything's on there

3703
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:32,740
what I do is like

3704
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:34,740
all the music I listen to is contextual

3705
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,740
it's like if I feel

3706
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:38,740
I always say that I love my beautiful

3707
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:40,740
dark twisted fantasy but I can only listen to it

3708
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:42,740
if I'm drunk and depressed

3709
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:44,740
that's the situation where that album is perfect

3710
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:46,740
if I'm editing videos

3711
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:48,740
it's like one of a few

3712
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,740
instrumental calming

3713
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:52,740
electronic albums

3714
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:54,740
or if I'm trying to

3715
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:56,740
get myself hyped for editing it's on a monoguchi

3716
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:58,740
if it's like

3717
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:00,740
if I'm in a mood where I just want to thrash stuff

3718
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:02,740
I put on some metal

3719
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:04,740
if I'm in a mood where I just want to chill I put on some chill music

3720
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:06,740
you know what this is

3721
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:08,740
I don't view or use music that way

3722
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:10,740
I like view an album as like an art piece

3723
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:12,740
I need to sit there for an hour and study

3724
02:13:12,740 --> 02:13:14,740
and appreciate it

3725
02:13:14,740 --> 02:13:16,740
it is like the first time you listen to it

3726
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:18,740
the first 25 times you listen to it

3727
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,740
but I listen to albums hundreds of times

3728
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:22,740
I don't got the space to listen to it for the first time

3729
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:24,740
you know I'm not trying to like

3730
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:26,740
tell anyone I'm just telling you what my life is

3731
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:28,740
and like why

3732
02:13:28,740 --> 02:13:30,740
let me break in with a brief anecdote

3733
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:32,740
the other day I was finishing up my high work submission

3734
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:34,740
and I was

3735
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:36,740
inking in some sketches of the characters

3736
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:38,740
from my new comic

3737
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:40,740
and I was thinking about

3738
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:42,740
what the story is

3739
02:13:42,740 --> 02:13:44,740
what the main themes of the story are

3740
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:46,740
and I realized

3741
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:48,740
as I was drawing this I hadn't even realized it before

3742
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:50,740
I realized that what the series is actually about

3743
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:52,740
in my mind

3744
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:54,740
is the quest to be happy

3745
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:56,740
and how to be happy

3746
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:58,740
and I was inking in

3747
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:00,740
that character, that really cool looking character

3748
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:02,740
that I didn't show anyone else but I posted in the thing

3749
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:04,740
and on my playlist

3750
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:06,740
Pharrell's happy came on

3751
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:08,740
and I was so struck

3752
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:10,740
by like drawing that character

3753
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:12,740
while listening to that song

3754
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:14,740
I felt like

3755
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:16,740
not like I was emotional

3756
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:18,740
like I was crying, I was just so like

3757
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:20,740
amped up, I was so like in the moment

3758
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:22,740
it's so hard for me to imagine

3759
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:24,740
this feels so right

3760
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:26,740
it's so hard for me to imagine you who's like the biggest hipster I know

3761
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:28,740
getting all emotional over like

3762
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:30,740
the biggest song of the last five years

3763
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:32,740
I'm sorry

3764
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:34,740
no

3765
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:36,740
here's a terrible thing about me Digi

3766
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:38,740
I hate popular media

3767
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:40,740
and when things are popular

3768
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:42,740
it makes me hate them and yet I really

3769
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:44,740
I often find myself

3770
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:46,740
really really responsive to like

3771
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:48,740
huge hits and things that are massively popular

3772
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:50,740
like I fucking love

3773
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:52,740
I think it's an amazing song

3774
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,740
and I can't, I wish I didn't

3775
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:56,740
I wish I hated that

3776
02:14:56,740 --> 02:14:58,740
it was a feel good hit of the summer

3777
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:00,740
and I was just sitting there

3778
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:02,740
just like twitching

3779
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:04,740
it's all

3780
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:06,740
coming together, it all feels

3781
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:08,740
like it's all in place

3782
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:10,740
Nate I will say, I will agree with you

3783
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:12,740
that like if I was editing or

3784
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:14,740
if I was even writing a script

3785
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:16,740
I would by no means listen to music

3786
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:18,740
that I haven't heard before

3787
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:20,740
that is not the right, unless it was

3788
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:22,740
unless it was like

3789
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:24,740
if you're hearing it for the first time

3790
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:26,740
you can very easily go on YouTube

3791
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:28,740
and type like

3792
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:30,740
chill wave mix

3793
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:32,740
and it'll just be like a two hour mix

3794
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:34,740
of like a bunch of shitty electronic music

3795
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:36,740
that's really generic

3796
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:38,740
is like perfect

3797
02:15:38,740 --> 02:15:40,740
listen to any trance mix

3798
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:42,740
they all sound exactly the same

3799
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:44,740
let's go to YouTube and search for funk

3800
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:46,740
and just jam the fuck out for a while

3801
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:48,740
I've been listening to some great chill wave mixes

3802
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:50,740
that are by some guy named

3803
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:52,740
I think Epicuros

3804
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:54,740
and they start off with a scene

3805
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:56,740
from Blade Runner where he gives the

3806
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:58,740
the what's it test to Rachel

3807
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:00,740
and uh

3808
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:02,740
I don't know

3809
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:04,740
that's how I feel about all vaporwave

3810
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:06,740
other than like Blank Banshee

3811
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:08,740
which I legitimately love

3812
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:10,740
most vaporwave to me is extremely

3813
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:12,740
disposable and not memorable

3814
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:14,740
and not interesting

3815
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:16,740
there are some

3816
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:18,740
upbeat energetic

3817
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:20,740
vaporwave songs that actually get me kind of pumped

3818
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:22,740
I've heard the, cause there was that

3819
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:24,740
sailor wave, that hour long mix

3820
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:26,740
that Nate had posted

3821
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:28,740
and the whole thing is like

3822
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:30,740
one hour long funk song

3823
02:16:30,740 --> 02:16:32,740
it's like the same song over and over again

3824
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:34,740
and you can get the point within

3825
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,740
20 seconds and that's the

3826
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:38,740
entire thing and I just put it on

3827
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:40,740
for an hour and I didn't pay any attention to it

3828
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,740
I was doing work and doing other shit but like

3829
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:44,740
it fit well you know

3830
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:46,740
it's not something I would ever listen to

3831
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:48,740
as like a let's sit down and listen to

3832
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:50,740
sailor wave for an hour

3833
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,740
whereas I would do that for like

3834
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:54,740
like a Kendrick Lamar album

3835
02:16:54,740 --> 02:16:56,740
like that's not music you can have on in the background

3836
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:58,740
you really have to sit and listen to

3837
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:00,740
to Pimpa Butterfly if you want to get

3838
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:02,740
that album you know

3839
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:04,740
I have two vaporwave mixes that I

3840
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:06,740
listen to a lot one is called Neo Batavia

3841
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:08,740
and the other is called

3842
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:10,740
Squad Goals

3843
02:17:10,740 --> 02:17:12,740
and they both, they both

3844
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,740
have like a couple of songs on there that are like

3845
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:16,740
Squad Goals is the one I was talking about actually

3846
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:18,740
not Sailor Wave

3847
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:20,740
Oh yeah, the one that plays

3848
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,740
when like the looping gif of the

3849
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:24,740
Doraemon characters walking

3850
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:26,740
Squad Goals is the mix with like the

3851
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:28,740
tons of anime shit in it right

3852
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:30,740
it's like a heavy

3853
02:17:30,740 --> 02:17:32,740
the video is like a heavily processed

3854
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,740
thing of like an old anime

3855
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:36,740
it looks all the videos

3856
02:17:36,740 --> 02:17:38,740
it's really cool because I know all those shows

3857
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:40,740
and for me like my favorite thing about

3858
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:42,740
vaporwave is all these 80s

3859
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:44,740
anime that no one's heard of suddenly

3860
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:46,740
like surfacing in media and I'm like

3861
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:48,740
oh my god people are making videos about fucking

3862
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:50,740
Cobra and shit like this is the best

3863
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:52,740
there's a there's a YouTube channel called

3864
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:54,740
Artsy Music and there is a

3865
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:56,740
like ARTZie

3866
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,740
and there's one

3867
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:00,740
there's a song by Lord Son and the name

3868
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:02,740
is in Japanese but like

3869
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:04,740
it's this looping gif of I forget

3870
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:06,740
her name the character from Gun Buster

3871
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:08,740
Oh yeah that's Noriko

3872
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:10,740
Yeah Noriko from Gun Buster

3873
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:12,740
I know the video you're talking about

3874
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:14,740
Dude, yeah that bit of animation where like

3875
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:16,740
she's well it's not just

3876
02:18:16,740 --> 02:18:18,740
the tip bounce like she stands up and like

3877
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:20,740
she like she has her mouth open

3878
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:22,740
and then she closes her mouth and blinks twice

3879
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:24,740
and as she's doing it she closes her fists

3880
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:26,740
and like twists her arms inwards into

3881
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:28,740
like a triumphant pose I have

3882
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:30,740
watched that loop and I

3883
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:32,740
watched that animation like like for

3884
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:34,740
10 minutes straight and I would just like

3885
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:36,740
try to blink at different moments in it

3886
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:38,740
to like pick out the different frames

3887
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:40,740
and like until I had like

3888
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:42,740
developed like a feel for every

3889
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:44,740
individual frame in that like several

3890
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:46,740
second animation you know what you gotta do now

3891
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,740
you have to watch because that that

3892
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:50,740
specific cut is

3893
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:52,740
in daikon 4 and it's in otaku

3894
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:54,740
no video like it's a cut that they kept

3895
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:56,740
reusing in uh in gynax so

3896
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:58,740
like because it was a

3897
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:00,740
act according to your definition band

3898
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:02,740
that makes Gun Buster worse

3899
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:04,740
well it's all the same guy it's all

3900
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:06,740
Toshio Kata wrote all of those

3901
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:08,740
Recycled idea

3902
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:10,740
No it makes the other things that it was

3903
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:12,740
recycled into worse

3904
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:14,740
Well it was originally

3905
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:16,740
It was first daikon 4

3906
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,740
and then Gun Buster and then

3907
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:20,740
otaku no video

3908
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:22,740
well it's still a beautiful animation

3909
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:24,740
regardless yes it's very cool

3910
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:26,740
it's in like right in the middle of daikon 4

3911
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:28,740
you should watch it it's only 4 minutes long and it's the best anime ever

3912
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:30,740
I have seen daikon 4

3913
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:32,740
I can't get into

3914
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,740
Steven Seagal I hate him he's a fat

3915
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:36,740
shit old movie

3916
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,740
executive action is the greatest

3917
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:40,740
movie of our generation

3918
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:42,740
fucking you know what I love

3919
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:44,740
that's right because I was all the wrong

3920
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:46,740
generation I identify as an 80s kid

3921
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,740
you know I love action movies

3922
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:50,740
the cornier the better

3923
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:52,740
you know I love

3924
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:54,740
everything by Stallone and Schwarzenegger

3925
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,740
I love Jean Claude Van Damme

3926
02:19:56,740 --> 02:19:58,740
but something about Steven Seagal

3927
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:00,740
I just look at him and I want to puke

3928
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:02,740
he doesn't look like he can do any of the things he's doing in his movies

3929
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:04,740
he doesn't look like he can beat anyone up

3930
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:06,740
he looks like just a fat dad

3931
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:08,740
he's got some major dad bond going on

3932
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:10,740
he's the worst action star in the history of action cinema

3933
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:12,740
he belongs in

3934
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:14,740
he belongs in like Uncle Buck

3935
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:16,740
he's like a John Candy actor who was

3936
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:18,740
cast into an action hero

3937
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,740
I've seen like

3938
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:22,740
a compilation of like oh really cheesy

3939
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:24,740
hilarious Steven Seagal moments and I'm like

3940
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:26,740
this would be funnier if anyone other than

3941
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:28,740
Steven Seagal would make money in this scene

3942
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:30,740
some executives were like

3943
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:32,740
this is Steven Seagal we made him

3944
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:34,740
a bad action hero as a joke

3945
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:36,740
and that's just his whole career is just based on that

3946
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:38,740
but then they forgot it

3947
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:40,740
how do you feel about like Charles Bronson

3948
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:42,740
he's the greatest actor of all time

3949
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:44,740
yeah he's great Charles Bronson is great

3950
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:46,740
he's good of course he's the fucking man

3951
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:48,740
I love all of them they're all great except

3952
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:50,740
he's the only one Steven Seagal is the only guy I hate

3953
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:52,740
he sucks

3954
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:54,740
you said Charles Bronson but I thought of

3955
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:56,740
Charles Barclay, Bronson, Marle

3956
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:58,740
Marle and Brandon

3957
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:00,740
Jesse you made me think of one thing

3958
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:02,740
that I pretty much can never get into

3959
02:21:02,740 --> 02:21:04,740
is the so bad it's good principle

3960
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:06,740
because most things that are so bad

3961
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:08,740
they're good are like

3962
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:10,740
really sparse with things that are so bad it's good

3963
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:12,740
which is why like Garzy's doing

3964
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:14,740
the Digi introduced me to and that one's really great

3965
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:16,740
at least the first episode because that one is

3966
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:18,740
so dense with interestingly hilarious

3967
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:20,740
bad stuff but most

3968
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:22,740
so bad it's good things

3969
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:24,740
same as I feel about like the guilty pleasure label

3970
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:26,740
like if it's so bad it's good then it's just good

3971
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:28,740
yeah

3972
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:30,740
it depends on how you're looking at it

3973
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:32,740
but Davoo you really should watch the room

3974
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:34,740
because the room has gone so far

3975
02:21:34,740 --> 02:21:36,740
beyond ironic enjoyment for me

3976
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:38,740
that I just love every single bit of it

3977
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:40,740
yeah Nate I did watch the room

3978
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:42,740
I didn't get a whole lot more out of it than just

3979
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:44,740
like to be honest when I watched the nostalgic critics review

3980
02:21:44,740 --> 02:21:46,740
because he just showed all the funny parts

3981
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:48,740
give it another try

3982
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:50,740
hold on I already

3983
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:52,740
watched the room and it wasn't like that

3984
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:54,740
good like because you know whenever you watch

3985
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:56,740
a review even if it's one of those really

3986
02:21:56,740 --> 02:21:58,740
long that guy with the glasses style ones

3987
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:00,740
which basically just shows the movie

3988
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:02,740
it doesn't quite capture

3989
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:04,740
what the actual experience of the movie is

3990
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:06,740
so it's not quite spoiling

3991
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:08,740
the room has all these

3992
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:10,740
really long scenes that aren't

3993
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:12,740
that full of like really funny stuff

3994
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:14,740
what are you talking about man

3995
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:16,740
every second of that movie is funny

3996
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:18,740
it's true it's all like every line

3997
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:20,740
Tommy says is instant gold

3998
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:22,740
it's fucking amazing

3999
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:24,740
but I just want to say that I too

4000
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:26,740
got into it via the nostalgic critic review

4001
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:28,740
and I watched that video like a bunch of times

4002
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:30,740
then I got into the movie so I'm just saying

4003
02:22:30,740 --> 02:22:32,740
Davoo I don't know

4004
02:22:32,740 --> 02:22:34,740
how many times you've seen it

4005
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:36,740
something about the room is that I can see how you

4006
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:38,740
would think that on like a first viewing

4007
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:40,740
okay I know you said you saw

4008
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:42,740
the nostalgic critic review so maybe this is

4009
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:44,740
not you maybe you're not a naive viewer

4010
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:46,740
like I'm gonna describe but someone who

4011
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:48,740
watched the room one time probably

4012
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:50,740
wouldn't he would there would be some funny bits

4013
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:52,740
they laughed at but I think it

4014
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:54,740
takes like several watches and like I

4015
02:22:54,740 --> 02:22:56,740
think you kind of have to discuss it and like digest it

4016
02:22:56,740 --> 02:22:58,740
to really understand the depth and the

4017
02:22:58,740 --> 02:23:00,740
density and complexity

4018
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:02,740
it's such a social movie

4019
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:04,740
you kind of slightly different

4020
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:06,740
I want to change my terms

4021
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:08,740
I'm never going to be able to appreciate

4022
02:23:08,740 --> 02:23:10,740
movies the way that James

4023
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:12,740
Rolfe does even remotely

4024
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:14,740
and the way that he can appreciate movies

4025
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:16,740
like horror movies

4026
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,740
and they're like really terrible and

4027
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:20,740
like I don't know what he gets out of it

4028
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:22,740
and that's definitely something I can't get into before

4029
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:24,740
and cheesy and a cheesy horror

4030
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:26,740
it's just like

4031
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:28,740
I just feel like people can really get into

4032
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:30,740
movies because they're movies

4033
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:32,740
and the craft of

4034
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:34,740
film itself is

4035
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:36,740
captivating to them but see that's exactly what

4036
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:38,740
makes the room cool because the deviations

4037
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,740
from what you'd expect a good movie to be

4038
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:42,740
are done so hilariously

4039
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:44,740
in that movie that is

4040
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:46,740
I can't look at the room

4041
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:48,740
even as a bad movie

4042
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:50,740
like to me it has a place

4043
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:52,740
that no other film in history has

4044
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:54,740
and it fits exactly for the room

4045
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:56,740
I didn't know you were such a fan

4046
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:58,740
you're a kinder experience

4047
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:00,740
I've been down to clown with the room

4048
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:02,740
since time immemorial

4049
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:04,740
have you been to the live shows

4050
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:06,740
where they play in theaters and throw the spoons

4051
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:08,740
and shit? I've seen it

4052
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:10,740
in theaters and stuff

4053
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:12,740
that's what I was saying

4054
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:14,740
so much has been what makes the room

4055
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:16,740
enjoyable

4056
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:18,740
and it was like the best thing I've ever been to

4057
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:20,740
it was so much fun

4058
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:22,740
so much of what makes it enjoyable

4059
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:24,740
is the social aspect of it

4060
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:26,740
is having a bunch of guys in a room

4061
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:28,740
and everyone knows the lines

4062
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:30,740
and moves in their minds and everything

4063
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:32,740
that did make it better but I just want to clarify

4064
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:34,740
I've already loved it intensely before going to that

4065
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:36,740
I know Jesse was also a big Rocky Horror fan

4066
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:38,740
so it's kind of the same

4067
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:40,740
same thing

4068
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:42,740
I'm with DeVoo

4069
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:44,740
because I don't get like

4070
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:46,740
because I don't think that's quite what we're describing

4071
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,740
the room is more

4072
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:50,740
I think of the room as being just like Garzi's wing

4073
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:52,740
where it's so

4074
02:24:52,740 --> 02:24:54,740
there's so much to appreciate

4075
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:56,740
and so much of it's outright memes

4076
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:58,740
and with the room there's stuff that you can quote

4077
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:00,740
every day of your life

4078
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:02,740
I think DeVoo is talking more like just like

4079
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:04,740
old timey effects and corny dialogue

4080
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:06,740
there's a lot of those

4081
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:08,740
kind of more like the cinemasticist

4082
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:10,740
how he can get so into some of those old

4083
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:12,740
schlock movies

4084
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:14,740
and it's not a cultural thing

4085
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:16,740
it's not him joking with his friends

4086
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:18,740
it's just him watching these movies

4087
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:20,740
and enjoying them by himself

4088
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:22,740
are you familiar with this one James Rawl video

4089
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,740
the top 40

4090
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:26,740
shitty shark movies

4091
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:28,740
he and his wife watch them more

4092
02:25:28,740 --> 02:25:30,740
than 40 shark movies

4093
02:25:30,740 --> 02:25:32,740
and like Sharknada was coming out

4094
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:34,740
as he was making the list so we put it at number 5

4095
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:36,740
at the last second

4096
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:38,740
he had the mental ability

4097
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:40,740
to watch all of those

4098
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:42,740
I'm with you dude

4099
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:44,740
I can only barely stand to watch one good video

4100
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:46,740
I could

4101
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:48,740
see the thing is that like what you were saying

4102
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:50,740
about like being so enamored with the

4103
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:52,740
craft of film I could definitely

4104
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:54,740
do that with anime

4105
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:56,740
I don't think I would enjoy all those shitty anime

4106
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:58,740
necessarily

4107
02:25:58,740 --> 02:26:00,740
but I could easily watch any

4108
02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:02,740
shit anime just because it's anime

4109
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:04,740
because I'm so enamored with knowing

4110
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:06,740
everything about it and knowing every single

4111
02:26:06,740 --> 02:26:08,740
possible thing

4112
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:10,740
I think it really is more than just appreciating

4113
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:12,740
to appreciate something like these

4114
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:14,740
it's not about really judging it by itself

4115
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:16,740
it's about having a larger context

4116
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,740
of what the work is

4117
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:20,740
and how it deviates from that and why that's

4118
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,740
so cool but I do think that like

4119
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:24,740
with stuff like the room in Garzi's wing

4120
02:26:24,740 --> 02:26:26,740
that's like a different story

4121
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:28,740
because it's not just that it's so bad it's good

4122
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:30,740
it's so bad it's like amazing

4123
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:32,740
like legitimately the funniest

4124
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:34,740
movie ever

4125
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,740
it's got green light with these things

4126
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:38,740
it's like the fact that people like check the box

4127
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:40,740
like okay ship this is just like

4128
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:42,740
holy shit it's amazing

4129
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:44,740
I mean a lot of what

4130
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:46,740
makes bad things

4131
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:48,740
really bad things good and interesting

4132
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:50,740
is the way that it sort of

4133
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:52,740
forms a narrative about the person

4134
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:54,740
exactly the things you learn about Tommy

4135
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:56,740
by watching that movie are

4136
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:58,740
yeah you learn about Tommy when you watch

4137
02:26:58,740 --> 02:27:00,740
the room you learn about what's his name

4138
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:02,740
I just want to bring this up briefly

4139
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:04,740
that I've recently become fascinated as of

4140
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:06,740
the latest YMS video where he talked about

4141
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,740
the three movies by that one fucking weird guy

4142
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:10,740
those look so good

4143
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,740
they look pretty fucking hilarious

4144
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:14,740
and it suddenly dawned on me

4145
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:16,740
that like all these guys

4146
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:18,740
obviously these directors are fucking weird

4147
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:20,740
right they're definitely weird people

4148
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:22,740
and like their movies always have like

4149
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:24,740
suicide like strong themes

4150
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:26,740
of suicide and depression and death

4151
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:28,740
and it's like these are like

4152
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,740
tormented people

4153
02:27:30,740 --> 02:27:32,740
like these are obviously people who

4154
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:34,740
are trying to express themselves because

4155
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:36,740
they've probably lived a whole

4156
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:38,740
life of being fucking weird and nobody gets them

4157
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:40,740
and so they try to make a movie so people

4158
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,740
can get them and people get them even less

4159
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:44,740
and they get it all wrong and that's why they want

4160
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:46,740
to fucking kill themselves

4161
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:48,740
there's no way to win

4162
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:50,740
I bet the guy from that new YMS review

4163
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,740
he had like a laptop back in the 90s

4164
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:54,740
when he was nerdy and kids made fun of him

4165
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:56,740
and broke his laptops and now all he can do

4166
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:58,740
in his movies is break more laptops

4167
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:00,740
and all of his movies to vent his frustration

4168
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:02,740
about laptops

4169
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:04,740
and yeah so like did you I totally

4170
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:06,740
I'm like that with video games

4171
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:08,740
like right now I'm on Moby games

4172
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:10,740
I click random game and without exception

4173
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:12,740
I'm at least a little bit interested

4174
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:14,740
because the fact

4175
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,740
that video games exist

4176
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:18,740
is always the most mind blowing

4177
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:20,740
incredible fact that I can

4178
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:22,740
ever think no matter how many times I do it

4179
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:24,740
that's how I feel about anime

4180
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:26,740
and yeah and a lot of people seem

4181
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:28,740
to be that way with film like they just

4182
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:30,740
can't believe that this film is

4183
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:32,740
happening and it never gets old to them

4184
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:34,740
dude you have no idea how many times

4185
02:28:34,740 --> 02:28:36,740
I like I sit back on my bed

4186
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:38,740
and I'm like because I know enough about

4187
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:40,740
anime to know that this is like

4188
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:42,740
like I always think

4189
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:44,740
of it as like 40 people making all

4190
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:46,740
anime right like that's a gross

4191
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:48,740
exaggeration but anime is so incestuous

4192
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:50,740
that it's like

4193
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,740
it really is compared to anything like

4194
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:54,740
compared to the world at large

4195
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:56,740
tiny handful of people

4196
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:58,740
on this far away archipelago

4197
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:00,740
in the middle of fucking nowhere

4198
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:02,740
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

4199
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:04,740
who are sitting there like

4200
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,740
creating this it is

4201
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:08,740
an archipelago it's a bunch of islands

4202
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:10,740
totally an archipelago

4203
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:12,740
you know

4204
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:14,740
it's just

4205
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:16,740
a bunch of

4206
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:18,740
this handful of people on this island

4207
02:29:18,740 --> 02:29:20,740
somewhere far away who have been doing

4208
02:29:20,740 --> 02:29:22,740
this thing for so long

4209
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:24,740
that there's this whole culture around it

4210
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:26,740
this whole like

4211
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:28,740
it's own trajectory of development all these

4212
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:30,740
things and like 45 shows coming out

4213
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:32,740
of season and yet

4214
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:34,740
it's so insular

4215
02:29:34,740 --> 02:29:36,740
that it doesn't make sense to anyone else

4216
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:38,740
like how the fuck does anime exist

4217
02:29:38,740 --> 02:29:40,740
how are they still making it

4218
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:42,740
how is that fuck how is it not died

4219
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:44,740
like it it just keeps getting

4220
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:46,740
more insular it never gets

4221
02:29:46,740 --> 02:29:48,740
bigger and broader and more appealing to the rest

4222
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:50,740
of the world like every once in a while it does

4223
02:29:50,740 --> 02:29:52,740
at least netflix is helping

4224
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,740
and attack on titan people watch

4225
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:56,740
that shit but then a show will come out

4226
02:29:56,740 --> 02:29:58,740
that like I feel like 12 people

4227
02:29:58,740 --> 02:30:00,740
can possibly appreciate it

4228
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:02,740
and I'm like how are these 12 people

4229
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:04,740
gonna fund this show that only 12 people

4230
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:06,740
made

4231
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:08,740
each one of them buys 12

4232
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:10,740
even in the age of light novels did you

4233
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:12,740
do you still feel that way or do you just feel

4234
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:14,740
that way about some shows light novels are the most

4235
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:16,740
insular those are the ones that are like

4236
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:18,740
yeah but they haven't established audience already

4237
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:20,740
right but that's the thing

4238
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:22,740
there it is

4239
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:24,740
for the most part in japanese anime

4240
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:26,740
it's just

4241
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:28,740
it's crazy that

4242
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:30,740
there's a whole market

4243
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:32,740
that is so small

4244
02:30:32,740 --> 02:30:34,740
and so like plays to itself

4245
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:36,740
and has

4246
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:38,740
it doesn't seem to be trying to get any

4247
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:40,740
bigger for the most part

4248
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:42,740
and yet it somehow

4249
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:44,740
can generate more content

4250
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:46,740
than like any other medium

4251
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:48,740
like what other medium has 45

4252
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:50,740
news things coming out every

4253
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:52,740
fucking three months that is

4254
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:54,740
an insane amount of content

4255
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:56,740
video games but I guess there's way less people

4256
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:58,740
45 video games

4257
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:00,740
going steam probably

4258
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,740
I mean in indie games

4259
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:04,740
I guess so but in indie games also like

4260
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:06,740
one guy making it where an anime is like

4261
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:08,740
a team of 100 people

4262
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:10,740
that's fair that's fair

4263
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:12,740
you don't know just how many games

4264
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:14,740
there are on steam I remember on a digi bros

4265
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:16,740
you were saying eventually you've seen

4266
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:18,740
all the steam games no eventually

4267
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:20,740
you've seen all the steam games that are linked

4268
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:22,740
to by other steam games and recommended

4269
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,740
pages if you go to

4270
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:26,740
like list all games by most

4271
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:28,740
recent multiple games come out every

4272
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:30,740
day yeah yeah

4273
02:31:30,740 --> 02:31:32,740
well whatever that's cool all right we get

4274
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:34,740
the point it is sweet it is sweet

4275
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:36,740
let's do another one

4276
02:31:36,740 --> 02:31:38,740
hold on I want to figure out how to do that

4277
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:40,740
before we move on

4278
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:42,740
from the subject I know that the subject

4279
02:31:42,740 --> 02:31:44,740
evolved a little bit but it was originally

4280
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:46,740
things that are so bad it's good and before

4281
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:48,740
we move on I can't help but mention

4282
02:31:48,740 --> 02:31:50,740
Christian Weston Changlin

4283
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:52,740
the electric hedgehog pokemon

4284
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:54,740
which um wait

4285
02:31:54,740 --> 02:31:56,740
have you hippos read it

4286
02:31:56,740 --> 02:31:58,740
Nate has read it

4287
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:00,740
digi de vu jesse have you guys read

you guys should do it

4290
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:06,740
okay I have read the entire

4291
02:32:06,740 --> 02:32:08,740
thing multiple times

4292
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:10,740
I was way into the whole

4293
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:12,740
thing in like college and a little

4294
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:14,740
after and um

4295
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:16,740
the thing about sonichu is

4296
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:18,740
the the comic itself

4297
02:32:18,740 --> 02:32:20,740
I mean it looks terrible obviously you can tell

4298
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:22,740
just by looking at it that the art is bad

4299
02:32:22,740 --> 02:32:24,740
the story is

4300
02:32:24,740 --> 02:32:26,740
very often extremely boring

4301
02:32:26,740 --> 02:32:28,740
and usually completely

4302
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:30,740
incomprehensible

4303
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:32,740
but the challenge and the

4304
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:34,740
satisfaction of reading sonichu

4305
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:36,740
comes from understanding

4306
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:38,740
Christian Weston Changlin himself

4307
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:40,740
understanding his mindset

4308
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:42,740
and understanding what was happening in his life

4309
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:44,740
when he was drawing these things

4310
02:32:44,740 --> 02:32:46,740
and fucking figuring out

4311
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:48,740
how to parse what it is he's trying to say

4312
02:32:48,740 --> 02:32:50,740
and often it is extremely obvious what's going on

4313
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:52,740
but sometimes it's brutally difficult

4314
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:54,740
like

4315
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:56,740
like there's a scene

4316
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:58,740
there's a scene where

4317
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:00,740
uh like

4318
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:02,740
he beats up a bunch of cops

4319
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:04,740
at a bowling alley

4320
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:06,740
in the comic yeah jerk cops

4321
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:08,740
and he says like they I'm not the

4322
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:10,740
weak person I was I'm much saltier now

4323
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:12,740
and like

4324
02:33:12,740 --> 02:33:14,740
what does that mean right

4325
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:16,740
well if you dig enough

4326
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:18,740
you find out that um

4327
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:20,740
Christian Weston Chandler went to like some

4328
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:22,740
bacon in like 2005

4329
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:24,740
at which he met the voice actors

4330
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:26,740
that played Hayat in excel saga

4331
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,740
and excel saga contains

4332
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,740
a joke where in excel

4333
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:32,740
says ah I'm not the sweet

4334
02:33:32,740 --> 02:33:34,740
person she thinks I am I'm much saltier

4335
02:33:34,740 --> 02:33:36,740
wait did Christian start

4336
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:38,740
the salt thing like

4337
02:33:38,740 --> 02:33:40,740
is that how salt became a thing that people

4338
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:42,740
know okay no no

4339
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:44,740
he means he means that he's tough

4340
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:46,740
um yeah so he it was it's

4341
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:48,740
actually a stolen joke

4342
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:50,740
from excel saga with its

4343
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:52,740
context removed and butchered to the point

4344
02:33:52,740 --> 02:33:54,740
which he stole a lot from including his own

4345
02:33:54,740 --> 02:33:56,740
inclusion in the story as a character

4346
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:58,740
there's dozens

4347
02:33:58,740 --> 02:34:00,740
and dozens yeah excel saga

4348
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:02,740
is like an unsung an unsung

4349
02:34:02,740 --> 02:34:04,740
hero of like not know that

4350
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,740
at all yeah it's big it's big

4351
02:34:06,740 --> 02:34:08,740
it's yeah it's even the reason I haven't read

4352
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:10,740
sonnet you like all of his plagiarized

4353
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:12,740
the reason I haven't read sonnet you is

4354
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:14,740
I've always been under the impression that one

4355
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:16,740
day you were going to just tell me the

4356
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:18,740
entire CW

4357
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:20,740
story that's what he did with me that's what he did with me back

4358
02:34:20,740 --> 02:34:22,740
years ago I've been I've been waiting for the day

4359
02:34:22,740 --> 02:34:24,740
that we can sit down and you can just describe

4360
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:26,740
the whole I just like to propose

4361
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:28,740
for radcon let's just have the sonnet you

4362
02:34:28,740 --> 02:34:30,740

4364
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:34,740
but sit down by the fire and then

pulls out the tome it's dusty

4366
02:34:36,740 --> 02:34:38,740
he blows the pages all the dust comes

4367
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:40,740
off the tome by the way

4368
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:42,740
is uh is

4369
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:44,740
oolulila's book yeah you should bring

02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:46,740
that too

4371
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:48,740
legend of the legend of the ten

4372
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:50,740
elemental masters which I also own

4373
02:34:50,740 --> 02:34:52,740
oh but yeah I don't think I've ever

4374
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:54,740
mentioned this on the show but I have a piece of

4375
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:56,740
original Christian art I have a comic

4376
02:34:56,740 --> 02:34:58,740
page that I commissioned from him

4377
02:34:58,740 --> 02:35:00,740
that shows the secret fate of the

4378
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:02,740
brown-shirted imposter that was never shown

4379
02:35:02,740 --> 02:35:04,740
in the comic I was like please liquid

02:35:12,740 --> 02:35:14,740
to him probably on my twitter put that up

4385
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:16,740
and I want to see it yeah

4386
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:18,740
again um

4387
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:20,740
I was gonna say something

4388
02:35:20,740 --> 02:35:22,740
about um

4389
02:35:22,740 --> 02:35:24,740
yeah it's like it's the whole

4390
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:26,740
sonnet you saga is like this weird puzzle

4391
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:28,740
that you gotta unpack but once you do

4392
02:35:28,740 --> 02:35:30,740
it's like it's it's dense

4393
02:35:30,740 --> 02:35:32,740
with meaning in the in the same kind of way

4394
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:34,740
the room is by the way there's

4395
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:36,740
I did I did link you to the way to

4396
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:38,740
list all new games on steam

4397
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:40,740

02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,740
one I had already found but I'm seeing

4401
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:48,740
9351

4402
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:50,740
not that many games well yeah I narrowed

4403
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:52,740
it I narrowed out uh I narrowed out

4404
02:35:52,740 --> 02:35:54,740
software and downloadable content and that stuff

4405
02:35:54,740 --> 02:35:56,740
okay well just full games who

4406
02:35:56,740 --> 02:35:58,740
gives a shit let's move on

4407
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:00,740
I have another one

4408
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:02,740
thing I can't get into and I need to

4409
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:04,740
you know preclude I need to

4410
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:06,740
disclaim this you know I'm gonna sound

4411
02:36:06,740 --> 02:36:08,740
like a nerd he's gonna talk about economics

4412
02:36:08,740 --> 02:36:10,740
here it comes

4413
02:36:10,740 --> 02:36:12,740
something I can't get into

4414
02:36:12,740 --> 02:36:14,740
I'm gonna sound like a jerk

4415
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:16,740
so I want to so as soon as I say this

4416
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:18,740
I'm gonna have to clarify why immediately

4417
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:20,740
mm-hmm I can't I was

4418
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:22,740
the same with the gender binary I can't

4419
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:24,740
get into sports

4420
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:26,740
because not because of like athleticism

4421
02:36:26,740 --> 02:36:28,740
fine with that you expect to be argued with

4422
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:30,740
by anyone in this call like none of us

4423
02:36:30,740 --> 02:36:32,740
fucking yeah I think our audience is gonna

4424
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:34,740
be mostly who the hell was gonna make you sound

4425
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:36,740
like even though I know I do like

4426
02:36:36,740 --> 02:36:38,740
football and I watch football occasionally but

4427
02:36:38,740 --> 02:36:40,740
even though I know most people will agree with me I just

4428
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:42,740
know there's some subconscious judgment of

4429
02:36:42,740 --> 02:36:44,740
like because you know you don't have

4430
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:46,740
any athletic ability that's why right

4431
02:36:46,740 --> 02:36:48,740
well you know that might be part of it

4432
02:36:48,740 --> 02:36:50,740
but the real reason is

4433
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:52,740
is that there's no level

4434
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:54,740
design I you know

4435
02:36:54,740 --> 02:36:56,740
exactly

4436
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,740
one level design there is exactly

4437
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:00,740
that's not because I think about this

4438
02:37:00,740 --> 02:37:02,740
Final Fantasy 13 is the worst

4439
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:04,740
game ever but because for one simple

4440
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:06,740
reason it's all a hallway right okay but

4441
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:08,740
imagine this what about a Final Fantasy 7

4442
02:37:08,740 --> 02:37:10,740
you can change your character I'm at 13

4443
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:12,740
I'm at Final Fantasy 13 okay

4444
02:37:12,740 --> 02:37:14,740
yeah I actually

4445
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,740
I didn't even hear you say so

4446
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:18,740
okay I'm sorry but

4447
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:20,740
but here's the difference is that

4448
02:37:20,740 --> 02:37:22,740
every time you play Final Fantasy 13 in this

4449
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:24,740
example your characters are all different

4450
02:37:24,740 --> 02:37:26,740
and it's a different team comp and you get to

4451
02:37:26,740 --> 02:37:28,740
have a different team that you're fighting

4452
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:30,740
you know what's funny to me about this

4453
02:37:30,740 --> 02:37:32,740
argument is that one of

4454
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:34,740
my favorite video games

4455
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:36,740
of all time is Mario

4456
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:38,740
Power Tennis which has no

4457
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:40,740
level design and it's one of the best

4458
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:42,740
games ever and

4459
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:44,740
I also like watching Tennis on TV

4460
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:46,740
so I don't like watching Tennis at all

4461
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:48,740
boring why don't you fucking

4462
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:50,740
why don't you fucking get some

4463
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:52,740
DFW David Foster Wall

4464
02:37:52,740 --> 02:37:54,740
essays and go read Infinite Jest you fucking

4465
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:56,740
you fucking

4466
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:58,740
by the way David David

4467
02:37:58,740 --> 02:38:00,740
Foster Wall yeah it is about tennis

4468
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:02,740
oh god nobody knew that

4469
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:06,740
I've got the audio book I can

4470
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:08,740
listen to it and watch tennis

4471
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:10,740
at the same time you know what I totally

4472
02:38:10,740 --> 02:38:12,740
I totally don't agree oh my god

4473
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:14,740
I can play Mario Power Tennis and listen to Infinite Jest

4474
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:16,740
oh my god

4475
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:18,740
I have to buy the new Mario Tennis game

4476
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:20,740
for the Wii U this is the

4477
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:22,740
greatest realization of my life

4478
02:38:22,740 --> 02:38:24,740
I might be drunk now by the way

4479
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:26,740
I actually don't agree with what I said

4480
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:28,740
before about the you can't get into it

4481
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:30,740
I think actually the definition is

4482
02:38:30,740 --> 02:38:32,740
can you really get into it

4483
02:38:32,740 --> 02:38:34,740
and become a fan of it not just have

4484
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:36,740
isolated moments of enjoyment

4485
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:38,740
let me tell you it's like I turn on

4486
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:40,740
no shut up I turn on tennis

4487
02:38:40,740 --> 02:38:42,740
and I'm like hmm that's kind of cool

4488
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:44,740
that's kind of and then I'm done I'm done

4489
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:46,740
I'm bored I'm that's it that's it

4490
02:38:46,740 --> 02:38:48,740
I'm not like into tennis

4491
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:50,740
because there's because it's the same

4492
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:52,740
thing every time and I know it's all about

4493
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:54,740
the staff and people but that's not enough for me

4494
02:38:54,740 --> 02:38:56,740
the reason people enjoy it is because

4495
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:58,740
all the players they know the ins and the outs

4496
02:38:58,740 --> 02:39:00,740
they know the staff they have expectations for what's going to happen

4497
02:39:00,740 --> 02:39:02,740
the majority of the appeal of sports

4498
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:04,740
to sports fans is the narrative

4499
02:39:04,740 --> 02:39:06,740
it's all about

4500
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:08,740
but there's just not a narrative

4501
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:10,740
there's not like a world that they're inhabiting

4502
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:12,740
it's the same location every time

4503
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:14,740
and I you know I would

4504
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:16,740
dislike the world they're inhabiting is our world

4505
02:39:16,740 --> 02:39:18,740
the location is

4506
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:20,740
no they're not

4507
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:22,740
it's the same court every time

4508
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:24,740
it's not there's four different types of courts

4509
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:26,740
you've got the clay court the grass court

4510
02:39:26,740 --> 02:39:28,740
the fucking the super bouncy one

4511
02:39:28,740 --> 02:39:30,740
that's not enough

4512
02:39:30,740 --> 02:39:32,740
the players as characters exist

4513
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:34,740
in the real world that's where the stakes are

4514
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:36,740
you've got that world

4515
02:39:36,740 --> 02:39:38,740
you've got that one court where the

4516
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:40,740
physical tangible way

4517
02:39:40,740 --> 02:39:42,740
you've got the one court where sometimes the tiles

4518
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:44,740
there's like water underneath

4519
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:46,740
and you fall into piranha plants and stuff

4520
02:39:46,740 --> 02:39:48,740
what about snakes and ladders

4521
02:39:48,740 --> 02:39:50,740
shoots and ladders god damn it

4522
02:39:50,740 --> 02:39:52,740
but Davoo more than

4523
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:54,740
just the game is relevant to the game

4524
02:39:54,740 --> 02:39:56,740
with a ladder

4525
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:58,740
we at hippo were both trying to make a reverent jokes

4526
02:39:58,740 --> 02:40:00,740
while you guys were talking

4527
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:02,740
if it were the other way around

4528
02:40:02,740 --> 02:40:04,740
let's say like football

4529
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:06,740
just think about how much cooler football would be

4530
02:40:06,740 --> 02:40:08,740
if it took place on a mountain

4531
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:10,740
yeah it wouldn't be even anymore

4532
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:12,740
but it would be the coolest thing

4533
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:14,740
wasn't that what homestuck art was about

4534
02:40:14,740 --> 02:40:16,740
the one that hussy

4535
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:18,740
went through so much effort to get

4536
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:20,740
it's not homestuck

4537
02:40:20,740 --> 02:40:22,740
the football player on the mountain

4538
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:24,740
fighting like a dragon

4539
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:26,740
that football player fighting against

4540
02:40:26,740 --> 02:40:28,740
an evil unicorn with an

4541
02:40:28,740 --> 02:40:30,740
erupting mountain

4542
02:40:30,740 --> 02:40:32,740
imagine if soccer

4543
02:40:32,740 --> 02:40:34,740
took place in a marsh

4544
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:36,740
and they had to get around

4545
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:38,740
there's an interesting thing

4546
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:40,740
back when

4547
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:42,740
in England football

4548
02:40:42,740 --> 02:40:44,740
used to be played

4549
02:40:44,740 --> 02:40:46,740
between towns

4550
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:48,740
and they would kick the ball from one town to the other

4551
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:50,740
through forests and over rivers

4552
02:40:50,740 --> 02:40:52,740
that's so cool

4553
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:54,740
that would be what you would want to see

4554
02:40:54,740 --> 02:40:56,740
this is exactly

4555
02:40:56,740 --> 02:40:58,740
what hippo wants all football to look like

4556
02:41:02,740 --> 02:41:04,740
that's pretty great

4557
02:41:08,740 --> 02:41:10,740
I'll link that in the description

4558
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:12,740
I'm the one editing this

4559
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:14,740
two of you have said you were going to link something in the description

4560
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:16,740
forgetting that I added

4561
02:41:16,740 --> 02:41:18,740
interview digi you said you were going to link that fan art

4562
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:20,740
that I made and you didn't link it

4563
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:22,740
I had to wait for a commenter to point it out

4564
02:41:22,740 --> 02:41:24,740
and I had to go in and put it in

4565
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:26,740
okay let's

4566
02:41:26,740 --> 02:41:28,740
Jesse do you have another thing you can't get into

4567
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:30,740
oh yeah

4568
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:32,740
okay new fighting games

4569
02:41:32,740 --> 02:41:34,740
can't do it

4570
02:41:34,740 --> 02:41:36,740
okay

4571
02:41:36,740 --> 02:41:38,740
so I can't get into fighting games in general

4572
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:40,740
I used to

4573
02:41:40,740 --> 02:41:42,740
really like street fighter

4574
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:44,740
but that was when I was young and naive

4575
02:41:44,740 --> 02:41:46,740
I used to play street fighter 2 on our SNES

4576
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:48,740
yeah when we had the Super Nintendo

4577
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:50,740
and it was just casually

4578
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:52,740
it was great

4579
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:54,740
any fighting game

4580
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:56,740
that I grew up with

4581
02:41:56,740 --> 02:41:58,740
and have a fondness for

4582
02:41:58,740 --> 02:42:00,740
is street fighter, Mortal Kombat

4583
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:02,740
Smash Brothers, whatever

4584
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:04,740
I have my character

4585
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:06,740
I have my guy

4586
02:42:06,740 --> 02:42:08,740
I know all the moves, I know how to play it

4587
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:10,740
I can be reasonably competent at it for the rest of my life

4588
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:12,740
but any

4589
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:14,740
game that's just coming out

4590
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:16,740
I don't have anybody around to play with

4591
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:18,740
so I don't have a fucking

4592
02:42:18,740 --> 02:42:20,740
there's no social aspect to it

4593
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:22,740
I don't have the ability

4594
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:24,740
I don't have the ability

4595
02:42:24,740 --> 02:42:26,740
I don't like you getting everybody's names confused

4596
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:28,740
I fucking shwasted making it as ass to yourself

4597
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:30,740
on the internet

4598
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:32,740
everybody shut the fuck up for a second

4599
02:42:32,740 --> 02:42:34,740
god damn it let Jesse continue

4600
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:36,740
I don't have the ability to like

4601
02:42:36,740 --> 02:42:38,740
learn a new character

4602
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:40,740
shut the fuck up

4603
02:42:40,740 --> 02:42:42,740
shit

4604
02:42:42,740 --> 02:42:44,740
oh christ

4605
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:46,740
you got me to that point

4606
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:48,740
it took you two and a half hours but you did it

4607
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:52,740
Davoo kicked me out of the podcast

4608
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:54,740
that didn't do it, you started yelling at me about yell

4609
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:56,740
that didn't do it

4610
02:42:56,740 --> 02:42:58,740
but you finally pushed me

4611
02:42:58,740 --> 02:43:00,740
right over the edge

4612
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:02,740
I'm sorry

4613
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:06,740
okay go on

4614
02:43:06,740 --> 02:43:08,740
I'm listening

4615
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:10,740
I don't know

4616
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,740
that's fucking it

4617
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:14,740
I fucking would have had more if you'd let me talk the first time

4618
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:16,740
alright

4619
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:18,740
I have a really easy time

4620
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:20,740
getting into new fighting games

4621
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:22,740
cause all my friends are fighting game addicts

4622
02:43:22,740 --> 02:43:24,740
all they do is talk about fighting games

4623
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:26,740
play fighting games

4624
02:43:26,740 --> 02:43:28,740
I don't have the time nor the patience

4625
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:30,740
nor the ability nor the incentive

4626
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:32,740
to learn a new character in a new game

4627
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:34,740
that's my whole point that's all I wanted to say

4628
02:43:34,740 --> 02:43:36,740
move on to the next one

4629
02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:38,740
the last fighting game

4630
02:43:38,740 --> 02:43:40,740
I was able to get into

4631
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:42,740
I guess I kinda got into smash at some point

4632
02:43:42,740 --> 02:43:44,740
but I got into

4633
02:43:44,740 --> 02:43:46,740
I just like the aesthetic of guilty gear so much

4634
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:48,740
and I thought that Kai looked so cool

4635
02:43:48,740 --> 02:43:50,740
I thought he was such a cool looking dude

4636
02:43:50,740 --> 02:43:52,740
that I managed to sit down

4637
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:54,740
for long enough to learn how to sort of play

4638
02:43:54,740 --> 02:43:56,740
Kai in guilty gear

4639
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:58,740
I have this real burning desire

4640
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:00,740
I have a lot of weird plans for when

4641
02:44:00,740 --> 02:44:02,740
we all eventually live near each other

4642
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:04,740
and one of them is that

4643
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:06,740
Jesse is always describing

4644
02:44:06,740 --> 02:44:08,740
guilty gear as like the coolest game

4645
02:44:08,740 --> 02:44:10,740
that he's never gotten into or never played

4646
02:44:10,740 --> 02:44:12,740
and like I have this

4647
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:14,740
dream of having Jesse around

4648
02:44:14,740 --> 02:44:16,740
and I can be like Jesse

4649
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:18,740
let's play guilty gear and I can

4650
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:20,740
I can be the one who finally gets

4651
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:22,740
Jesse into guilty gear

4652
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:24,740
cause I fucking love guilty gear

4653
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:26,740
How do you feel about that Jesse? Are you into that?

4654
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:28,740
I'm all into that

4655
02:44:28,740 --> 02:44:30,740
Oh so you are open to it

4656
02:44:30,740 --> 02:44:32,740
I thought that you weren't interested in new games

4657
02:44:32,740 --> 02:44:34,740
Well if you had been listening Nate you would have heard

4658
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:36,740
I'm sorry

4659
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:38,740
Wow Nate I'm actually shocked

4660
02:44:38,740 --> 02:44:40,740
that you actually didn't get his point

4661
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:42,740
Oh right cause there's no one to play with

4662
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:44,740
Okay right I'm with you

4663
02:44:44,740 --> 02:44:46,740
I'll play

4664
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:48,740
guilty gear with you fucks

4665
02:44:48,740 --> 02:44:50,740
Yeah it's a fun game, we used to play with you

4666
02:44:50,740 --> 02:44:52,740
Playing video games online is miserable and shit

4667
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,740
even when it's with people you know

4668
02:44:54,740 --> 02:44:56,740
I have no interest in playing games online

4669
02:44:56,740 --> 02:44:58,740
Oh man that's funny cause like

4670
02:44:58,740 --> 02:45:00,740
I can't definitely cannot get into

4671
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:02,740
playing online games randomly

4672
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:04,740
It's not an appealing idea

4673
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:06,740
This is relevant I gotta tell you

4674
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:08,740
Hey Tom be back

4675
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:10,740
Tom you love guilty gear, how do you feel about playing it

4676
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:12,740
online?

4677
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:14,740
I don't play guilty gear online

4678
02:45:14,740 --> 02:45:16,740
Interesting

4679
02:45:16,740 --> 02:45:18,740
Well let me tell you guys cause playing online sucks

4680
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:20,740
I played League of Legends for years online

4681
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:22,740
and it was only so that I would have

4682
02:45:22,740 --> 02:45:24,740
an excuse to hang out with my friends

4683
02:45:24,740 --> 02:45:26,740
because they live far away in other states

4684
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:28,740
I agree

4685
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:30,740
Overwatch now and shit

4686
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:32,740
I played Halo 2 back in the day all the time

4687
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:34,740
but I've never played it online

4688
02:45:34,740 --> 02:45:36,740
with my friends

4689
02:45:36,740 --> 02:45:38,740
We all like, you know, schedule it together

4690
02:45:38,740 --> 02:45:40,740
we'd all play, I've never played solo by myself

4691
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:42,740
Same thing after college when I played Black Ops

4692
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:44,740
when I played with some of my friends

4693
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:46,740
but I hate playing online by myself

4694
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:48,740
Me too

4695
02:45:48,740 --> 02:45:50,740
because I'm being social in general

4696
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:52,740
so just a bunch of people yelling fag in my ear

4697
02:45:52,740 --> 02:45:54,740
playing a game that's really boring

4698
02:45:54,740 --> 02:45:56,740
so I hate that

4699
02:45:56,740 --> 02:45:58,740
I used to play a single player game that's constructed around

4700
02:45:58,740 --> 02:46:00,740
having experience

4701
02:46:00,740 --> 02:46:02,740
If only they made a single player game

4702
02:46:02,740 --> 02:46:04,740
about guys yelling fag in your ear

4703
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:06,740
I'm into that

4704
02:46:06,740 --> 02:46:08,740
I used to play Halo and Gears of War online

4705
02:46:08,740 --> 02:46:10,740
but that was because you could have

4706
02:46:10,740 --> 02:46:12,740
a split screen with you and your friend

4707
02:46:12,740 --> 02:46:14,740
but you were in the same match together

4708
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:16,740
online so that was always fucking cool

4709
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:18,740
I did that with Halo 2 a lot too

4710
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:20,740
I'd go to my friend Mike's house and we'd just fucking

4711
02:46:20,740 --> 02:46:22,740
get the Xbox going

4712
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:24,740
When you have a friend next to you

4713
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:26,740
they're all yelling at you like

4714
02:46:26,740 --> 02:46:28,740
what the fuck man

4715
02:46:28,740 --> 02:46:30,740
don't use the fucking sniper that you and your friend

4716
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:32,740
can just be like listen to this fucking idiot

4717
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:34,740
When it's just you hearing that voice

4718
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:36,740
it wears on your soul after a while

4719
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:38,740
You're like does this guy really

4720
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:40,740
feel this strongly about this video game

4721
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:42,740
I'm sorry I used the sniper rifle

4722
02:46:42,740 --> 02:46:44,740
please

4723
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:46,740
please forgive me

4724
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:48,740
I get it

4725
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:50,740
you seem to care a lot more than I do

4726
02:46:50,740 --> 02:46:52,740
so I'll just back out of this match

4727
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:54,740
and go back to other things

4728
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:56,740
I immediately muted the chat

4729
02:46:56,740 --> 02:46:58,740
and overwatch once I got there

4730
02:46:58,740 --> 02:47:00,740
There's only

4731
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:02,740
three multiplayer online games

4732
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:04,740
that I can stand

4733
02:47:04,740 --> 02:47:06,740
it's Hearthstone, World of Warcraft

4734
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:08,740
and Team Fortress 2

4735
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:10,740
Hearthstone and Team Fortress 2

4736
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:12,740
is okay because when I lose

4737
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:14,740
it doesn't feel so bad and in World of Warcraft

4738
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:16,740
I can just beat by myself

4739
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:18,740
but in every other game

4740
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:20,740
I've ever played online

4741
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:22,740
including Mario Kart Wii

4742
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:24,740
and fucking

4743
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:26,740
anything

4744
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:28,740
it makes me so infuriated that I

4745
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:30,740
break things and I hate everyone

4746
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:32,740
It's the worst

4747
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:34,740
There's one game that I did play online

4748
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:36,740
by myself and I didn't have a ton of fun

4749
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:38,740
with it but it was

4750
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:40,740
the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

4751
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:42,740
I had to do it because you had to

4752
02:47:42,740 --> 02:47:44,740
for the story you had to get your

4753
02:47:44,740 --> 02:47:46,740
readiness up by playing

4754
02:47:46,740 --> 02:47:48,740
which is a crock of shit

4755
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:50,740
it was like horde mode

4756
02:47:50,740 --> 02:47:52,740
so that was a bit more

4757
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:54,740
because it wasn't like people screaming at you

4758
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:56,740
that you're a fag

4759
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:58,740
people working together or trying to

4760
02:47:58,740 --> 02:48:00,740
or at least doing their own thing

4761
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:02,740
it was more palatable

4762
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:04,740
Relevant to that

4763
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:06,740
most people

4764
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:08,740
when they characterize online gaming

4765
02:48:08,740 --> 02:48:10,740
it's people yelling at you

4766
02:48:10,740 --> 02:48:12,740
but those times when you get someone

4767
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:14,740
who compliments you and stuff

4768
02:48:14,740 --> 02:48:16,740
I always feel like that's the most heartwarming

4769
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:18,740
in the world to realize that some random

4770
02:48:18,740 --> 02:48:20,740
stranger is a halfway decent person

4771
02:48:20,740 --> 02:48:22,740
is always really nice

4772
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:24,740
I think the idea of online gaming would be

4773
02:48:24,740 --> 02:48:26,740
fucking great if people didn't suck so much ball

4774
02:48:26,740 --> 02:48:28,740
I will say

4775
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:30,740
that I am a big fan of

4776
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:32,740
MMORPGs like Terra

4777
02:48:32,740 --> 02:48:34,740
and Black Desert but I play them totally

4778
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:36,740
solo and talk to nobody

4779
02:48:36,740 --> 02:48:38,740
so I just play them because I like the mechanics

4780
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:40,740
World of Warcraft is my favorite

4781
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:42,740
single player

4782
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:44,740
I'm surprised

4783
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:46,740
actually that is a great transition

4784
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:48,740
because I was going to bring this up

4785
02:48:48,740 --> 02:48:50,740
as one of the things I can't get into

4786
02:48:50,740 --> 02:48:52,740
which is like

4787
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:54,740
playing

4788
02:48:54,740 --> 02:48:56,740
online games in particular

4789
02:48:56,740 --> 02:48:58,740
and just generally any game that's

4790
02:48:58,740 --> 02:49:00,740
not about beating it in like

4791
02:49:00,740 --> 02:49:02,740
a sitting

4792
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:04,740
I love single player games

4793
02:49:04,740 --> 02:49:06,740
where I can sit down for 2 or 3 days

4794
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:08,740
and beat the whole game

4795
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:10,740
and be done with it for as long as I want

4796
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:12,740
Dark Souls 3

4797
02:49:12,740 --> 02:49:14,740
beat it in 18 hours

4798
02:49:14,740 --> 02:49:16,740
played a little bit more

4799
02:49:16,740 --> 02:49:18,740
just because I like the game so much

4800
02:49:18,740 --> 02:49:20,740
and then fucking forgot about Doom

4801
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:22,740
beat the main campaign, went back a little bit

4802
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:24,740
alright I'm fucking tired of Doom let's move on with my life

4803
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:26,740
any game that's like

4804
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:28,740
you play it regularly or you come back to it

4805
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:30,740
or there's not an easy out

4806
02:49:30,740 --> 02:49:32,740
for me what's always made me paranoid

4807
02:49:32,740 --> 02:49:34,740
about playing online games

4808
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:36,740
is the idea that if I leave

4809
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:38,740
I fuck somebody over

4810
02:49:38,740 --> 02:49:40,740
oh yeah that's a trap right there

4811
02:49:40,740 --> 02:49:42,740
they're setting for you

4812
02:49:42,740 --> 02:49:44,740
yeah in a lot of those games and I could not even imagine

4813
02:49:44,740 --> 02:49:46,740
like one like League of Legends

4814
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:48,740
where the matches are like 45 minutes long

4815
02:49:48,740 --> 02:49:50,740
it's a nightmare dude

4816
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:52,740
you know first person shooter games is not too bad

4817
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:54,740
it's like somewhat because

4818
02:49:54,740 --> 02:49:56,740
I like to be able to just get up at any time

4819
02:49:56,740 --> 02:49:58,740
when I'm playing a game I like to just go like

4820
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,740
I literally in Dark Souls sometimes

4821
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:02,740
I smack an enemy and he's dead

4822
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:04,740
and then I realize I'm hungry and I put the controller down

4823
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:06,740
and I go eat or you know

4824
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:08,740
someone calls me to go do something

4825
02:50:08,740 --> 02:50:10,740
like I really value that

4826
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:12,740
and when I can't do that

4827
02:50:12,740 --> 02:50:14,740
when it's like oh shit I have to finish this match

4828
02:50:14,740 --> 02:50:16,740
before I can go eat dinner

4829
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:18,740
you know that it's like

4830
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:20,740
unbelievable stress for me

4831
02:50:20,740 --> 02:50:22,740
and I cannot handle it

4832
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:24,740
not to co-op the point

4833
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:26,740
but yeah lol and mobas

4834
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:28,740
are something that I cannot get into

4835
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,740
and that I honestly fucking hate

4836
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:32,740
I can't get into any point and click games

4837
02:50:32,740 --> 02:50:34,740
I cannot stand point and click

4838
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:36,740
controls in video games

4839
02:50:36,740 --> 02:50:38,740
no no

4840
02:50:38,740 --> 02:50:40,740
some friends of mine tried to get

4841
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:42,740
I played League of Legends for a while with some friends

4842
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:44,740
and they tried to ease me

4843
02:50:44,740 --> 02:50:46,740
into it but they could not

4844
02:50:46,740 --> 02:50:48,740
help themselves but to get mad at me

4845
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:50,740
it's because you depend on everyone to carry

4846
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:52,740
the weight of a team it's brutal you know

4847
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:54,740
yeah I know right like they were counting

4848
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:56,740
on me but like I'm a noob I couldn't

4849
02:50:56,740 --> 02:50:58,740
you can't play with friends like that

4850
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:00,740
and it fucking sucked and I played

4851
02:51:00,740 --> 02:51:02,740
enough I had a couple of good

4852
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:04,740
kills I had some fun occasionally

4853
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:06,740
it wasn't just like D&D it wasn't

4854
02:51:06,740 --> 02:51:08,740
all bad there were good there were highlight moments

4855
02:51:08,740 --> 02:51:10,740
but then I sort of got

4856
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:12,740
okay with warwick like I sort of

4857
02:51:12,740 --> 02:51:14,740
figured out how to play warwick decently

4858
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:16,740
and I was like oh cool now I'm starting to

4859
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:18,740
have a little bit of fun and they were like

4860
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:20,740
okay now stop playing warwick

4861
02:51:20,740 --> 02:51:22,740
pick up a new character learn the first out of like

4862
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:24,740
a hundred god damn champs you need to learn

4863
02:51:24,740 --> 02:51:26,740
and then repeat for every

4864
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:28,740
and then repeat for every character

4865
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,740
until you know them all because that's the

4866
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:32,740
only way you can fucking be good at this game

4867
02:51:32,740 --> 02:51:34,740
I was like no I don't understand

4868
02:51:34,740 --> 02:51:36,740
how anyone I cannot

4869
02:51:36,740 --> 02:51:38,740
understand how anyone has any fun

4870
02:51:38,740 --> 02:51:40,740
with these fucking games unless they're at like

4871
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:42,740
a super high competitive level

4872
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:44,740
that takes thousands of hours to get to

4873
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:46,740
and who the fuck would want to do

4874
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:48,740
because the thing is I only did it because

4875
02:51:48,740 --> 02:51:50,740
my friends played you know I think the

4876
02:51:50,740 --> 02:51:52,740
people who I think the people who get really

4877
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:54,740
into those kind of games are ones who like

4878
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:56,740
don't really do anything else

4879
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:58,740
Oh absolutely my brother

4880
02:51:58,740 --> 02:52:00,740
shade gets really into like

4881
02:52:00,740 --> 02:52:02,740
like right now he's really into overwatch

4882
02:52:02,740 --> 02:52:04,740
and it's like overwatch came out

4883
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:06,740
and now that is what he does

4884
02:52:06,740 --> 02:52:08,740
that would be awesome

4885
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:10,740
apparently all my friends are playing it now

4886
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:12,740
but shade is definitely going to be the one

4887
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:14,740
who's the highest skilled in playing the most

4888
02:52:14,740 --> 02:52:16,740
because he gets into a game and he'll just

4889
02:52:16,740 --> 02:52:18,740
like not stop for months

4890
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:20,740
it's all he does

4891
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:22,740
he's actually editing a

4892
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:24,740
overwatch video just comparing

4893
02:52:24,740 --> 02:52:26,740
all the running speeds of all the characters

4894
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:28,740
like proving which ones are the fastest

4895
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:30,740
and slowest like just because he fucking

4896
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:32,740
felt like it you know

4897
02:52:32,740 --> 02:52:34,740
well he's I don't know it's not like a

4898
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:36,740
narrated video it's like just

4899
02:52:36,740 --> 02:52:38,740
footage and music it's just remember

4900
02:52:38,740 --> 02:52:40,740
when the fucking he said it to his own

4901
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:42,740
music to which is cool remember when the

4902
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:44,740
Game Grumps dude made that like clapping thing

4903
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:46,740
of all the smash oh yeah that was great

4904
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:48,740
just reminds me of that but before we

4905
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:50,740
compare the running speeds first we

4906
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:52,740
have to talk about we'll have to talk about

4907
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:54,740
parallel universes

4908
02:52:54,740 --> 02:52:56,740
yeah oh if only the best

4909
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:58,740
meme ever

4910
02:52:58,740 --> 02:53:00,740

that's a that's a weird

4919
02:53:16,740 --> 02:53:18,740
that's a burn on you that's like

4920
02:53:18,740 --> 02:53:20,740
I failed to have sex with your girlfriend

4921
02:53:20,740 --> 02:53:22,740
it's really boned me out right now

4922
02:53:22,740 --> 02:53:24,740
damn oh damn

4923
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:26,740
hahahaha

4924
02:53:26,740 --> 02:53:28,740
hahahaha

4925
02:53:28,740 --> 02:53:30,740
hahahaha

4926
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:32,740
hahahaha

4927
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:34,740
all right Tom what's your

4928
02:53:34,740 --> 02:53:36,740
all right I don't think I can follow that up

4929
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:38,740
no um one of the things I've written here

4930
02:53:38,740 --> 02:53:40,740
is sports slash reality tv

4931
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:42,740
I think spucking retarded

4932
02:53:42,740 --> 02:53:44,740
we did cover sports but not reality

4933
02:53:44,740 --> 02:53:46,740
we did sports we did not do I want to talk

4934
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:48,740
about reality well let Tom start

4935
02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:50,740
yeah yeah yeah I don't know I just

4936
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:52,740
my mother is obsessed with reality tv

4937
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:54,740
so I see it all the time

4938
02:53:54,740 --> 02:53:56,740
because all she does is watch tv when she's not

4939
02:53:56,740 --> 02:53:58,740
at work

4940
02:53:58,740 --> 02:54:00,740
and I've just seen like the depravity that

4941
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:02,740
she's been watching it ever since like the first survivor

4942
02:54:02,740 --> 02:54:04,740
like so oh yeah

4943
02:54:04,740 --> 02:54:06,740
so I've just I've I've

4944
02:54:06,740 --> 02:54:08,740
watched it evolve

4945
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:10,740
via proxy and it's just the most

4946
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:12,740
disgusting vapid boring

4947
02:54:12,740 --> 02:54:14,740
shit ever and I don't yeah I mean

4948
02:54:14,740 --> 02:54:16,740
I can understand why people like it

4949
02:54:16,740 --> 02:54:18,740
but I just can't believe people are so stupid

4950
02:54:18,740 --> 02:54:20,740
that they like it there's one

4951
02:54:20,740 --> 02:54:22,740
reality tv show that I do like

4952
02:54:22,740 --> 02:54:24,740
is called I'm a celebrity get me out of here

4953
02:54:24,740 --> 02:54:26,740
I don't know whether you guys have I don't know

4954
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:28,740
but it's um a bunch of celebrities

4955
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:30,740
trapped in an Australian jungle

4956
02:54:30,740 --> 02:54:32,740
and they have to do challenges in order to get

4957
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:34,740
food and you're just

4958
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:36,740
you're just seeing them go insane over

4959
02:54:36,740 --> 02:54:38,740
like a course of a week or two

4960
02:54:38,740 --> 02:54:40,740
it's pretty good

4961
02:54:40,740 --> 02:54:42,740
all right I too I'm not really

4962
02:54:42,740 --> 02:54:44,740
into reality tv show hold on

4963
02:54:44,740 --> 02:54:46,740
wait before you start I want to ask Hippo

4964
02:54:46,740 --> 02:54:48,740
I want to

4965
02:54:48,740 --> 02:54:50,740
I want to say that if it's celebrities

4966
02:54:50,740 --> 02:54:52,740
I don't think it entirely counts

4967
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:54,740
because at that point

4968
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:56,740
it's basically like a panel show with a

4969
02:54:56,740 --> 02:54:58,740
broader concept right

4970
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:00,740
like celebrities are famous for the

4971
02:55:00,740 --> 02:55:02,740
fact that they have a personality

4972
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:04,740
and are interesting people

4973
02:55:04,740 --> 02:55:06,740
on some level as opposed to reality

4974
02:55:06,740 --> 02:55:08,740
shows like what makes it reality

4975
02:55:08,740 --> 02:55:10,740
is that it's just real people

4976
02:55:10,740 --> 02:55:12,740
supposedly well the thing about these celebrities

4977
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:14,740
is that they're washed up and nobody know right

4978
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:16,740
nobody actually know we have a few like

4979
02:55:16,740 --> 02:55:18,740
they've been in a tv show we have a bunch of shows

4980
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:20,740
like that we had the the surreal

4981
02:55:20,740 --> 02:55:22,740
life which was like the like

4982
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:24,740
basically a bunch of d-list celebrities

4983
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:26,740
doing the like a regular

4984
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:28,740
reality show but I don't know

4985
02:55:28,740 --> 02:55:30,740
I feel like there's something slightly different because to me the whole point

4986
02:55:30,740 --> 02:55:32,740
of it being reality is that it's

4987
02:55:32,740 --> 02:55:34,740
supposed to be just like well a window

4988
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:36,740
into the life of some well you are seeing them

4989
02:55:36,740 --> 02:55:38,740
like literally stop and go in

4990
02:55:38,740 --> 02:55:40,740
it's hilarious there's a reality

4991
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,740
there for sure okay that's why I

4992
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:44,740
that's why I'm hesitant to get to see the reality show

4993
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:46,740
because it sounds too good

4994
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:48,740
all right anyway Ben was saying something

4995
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:50,740
okay

4996
02:55:50,740 --> 02:55:52,740
yeah I don't really make a habit of watching

4997
02:55:52,740 --> 02:55:54,740
reality shows I haven't seen that many but there are

4998
02:55:54,740 --> 02:55:56,740
some that I have really really

4999
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:58,740
enjoyed I want to tell you

5000
02:55:58,740 --> 02:56:00,740
the first one the first one was

5001
02:56:00,740 --> 02:56:02,740
penny arcade strip search

5002
02:56:02,740 --> 02:56:04,740
which was not on tv it was a web series

5003
02:56:04,740 --> 02:56:06,740
and I should preface this by saying that I

5004
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:08,740
don't really like penny arcade the comic

5005
02:56:08,740 --> 02:56:10,740
or find it funny at all and yet

5006
02:56:10,740 --> 02:56:12,740
I fucking love everything that

5007
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:14,740
Gabe and Tycho do I think

5008
02:56:14,740 --> 02:56:16,740
like every interview with them and every

5009
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:18,740
like I listen to their podcast

5010
02:56:18,740 --> 02:56:20,740
and I think that as dudes

5011
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:22,740
they're just fucking awesome I love the shit

5012
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:24,740
out of them and they decided

5013
02:56:24,740 --> 02:56:26,740
that hey we've got this fucking comic empire

5014
02:56:26,740 --> 02:56:28,740
and all this money let's just do

5015
02:56:28,740 --> 02:56:30,740
something and they decided to have a

5016
02:56:30,740 --> 02:56:32,740
reality show where they invited

5017
02:56:32,740 --> 02:56:34,740
all of these cartoonists all these bait

5018
02:56:34,740 --> 02:56:36,740
you know more or less unknown cartoonists

5019
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:38,740
into a house

5020
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:40,740
and they had them do challenges

5021
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:42,740
and and fucking compete

5022
02:56:42,740 --> 02:56:44,740
to win like a spot like

5023
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:46,740
basically like working in the penny arcade

5024
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:48,740
office and like being like an official

5025
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:50,740
penny arcade partner and

5026
02:56:50,740 --> 02:56:52,740
the thing about this show was

5027
02:56:52,740 --> 02:56:54,740
that Gabe and Tycho set out to make it

5028
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:56,740
as like as

5029
02:56:56,740 --> 02:56:58,740
bog standard a reality

5030
02:56:58,740 --> 02:57:00,740
show as possible they wanted to direct

5031
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:02,740
everything so that the artist would hate

5032
02:57:02,740 --> 02:57:04,740
each other and want to kill each other

5033
02:57:04,740 --> 02:57:06,740
and foster bitter rivalry

5034
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:08,740
and drama but

5035
02:57:08,740 --> 02:57:10,740
they couldn't because they're weak

5036
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:12,740
because Gabe and Tycho are weak bitches

5037
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:14,740
and they did not have the fucking

5038
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:16,740
emotional stones to carry through

5039
02:57:16,740 --> 02:57:18,740
with this plan of theirs

5040
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:20,740
so what ended up happening is they all became

5041
02:57:20,740 --> 02:57:22,740
best friends and they all like loved each

5042
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:24,740
other and like they all cried when they

5043
02:57:24,740 --> 02:57:26,740
left because they loved each other so much

5044
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:28,740
and they couldn't bear to leave one another behind

5045
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:30,740
it was that sounds like

5046
02:57:30,740 --> 02:57:32,740
a deconstruction of the whole

5047
02:57:32,740 --> 02:57:34,740
concept of reality shows

5048
02:57:34,740 --> 02:57:36,740
yes it was an unintentional

5049
02:57:36,740 --> 02:57:38,740
deconstruction of the whole concept

5050
02:57:38,740 --> 02:57:40,740
and it was fucking awesome

5051
02:57:40,740 --> 02:57:42,740
some of the challenges are really stupid

5052
02:57:42,740 --> 02:57:44,740
and some episodes are better than others

5053
02:57:44,740 --> 02:57:46,740
but like some of the

5054
02:57:46,740 --> 02:57:48,740
people in there were really great

5055
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:50,740
and like a couple of them formed

5056
02:57:50,740 --> 02:57:52,740
beautiful friendships that continue to this day

5057
02:57:52,740 --> 02:57:54,740
I gotta tell you a bunch of

5058
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:56,740
watching that show with you

5059
02:57:56,740 --> 02:57:58,740
a couple of more fucking

5060
02:57:58,740 --> 02:58:00,740
assholes though one or two of them were shitty

5061
02:58:00,740 --> 02:58:02,740
but just like watching some of these

5062
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:04,740
kind of shittier people

5063
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:06,740
make great comics and like bloom

5064
02:58:06,740 --> 02:58:08,740
it was like awesome it felt so good

5065
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:10,740
to watch people be like

5066
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:12,740
forced to get their shit together

5067
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:14,740
and they did and then they won

5068
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:16,740
oh man it was awesome like Maki

5069
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:18,740
Maki was so cool

5070
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:20,740
Maki wasn't my favorite

5071
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:22,740
he's the first guy I thought of

5072
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:24,740
thought of my head

5073
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:26,740
Katie Rice was the best by the way

5074
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:28,740
Katie Rice for life

5075
02:58:28,740 --> 02:58:30,740
alright you guys are getting too specific

5076
02:58:30,740 --> 02:58:32,740
I'm sorry

5077
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:34,740
I've seen hundreds of

5078
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:36,740
reality shows I know this

5079
02:58:36,740 --> 02:58:38,740
because I made a list of every TV show I've ever seen recently

5080
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:40,740
and I was deeply disturbed

5081
02:58:40,740 --> 02:58:42,740
by a lot of the shows I had to include

5082
02:58:42,740 --> 02:58:44,740
on my list as having seen

5083
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:46,740
the worst one

5084
02:58:46,740 --> 02:58:48,740
this was the absolute bottom of

5085
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:50,740
the barrel show on my entire list

5086
02:58:50,740 --> 02:58:52,740
the one that I was the most ashamed to have seen one episode of

5087
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:54,740
and Jesse

5088
02:58:54,740 --> 02:58:56,740
I feel like you've I think you've made

5089
02:58:56,740 --> 02:58:58,740
reference to this show before

5090
02:58:58,740 --> 02:59:00,740
rock of love with Brett Michaels

5091
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:02,740
oh jeez

5092
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:04,740
I don't know

5093
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:06,740
if that's the spin off of Flavor of Love

5094
02:59:06,740 --> 02:59:08,740
or if it's the other way around

5095
02:59:08,740 --> 02:59:10,740
it was a spin off of Flavor of Love

5096
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:12,740
yeah

5097
02:59:12,740 --> 02:59:14,740
well they all come from each other

5098
02:59:14,740 --> 02:59:16,740
like Brett and Michael's show came from Flavor of Flavishow

5099
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:18,740
which came from the surreal life season 3

5100
02:59:18,740 --> 02:59:20,740
they all spin out of each other

5101
02:59:20,740 --> 02:59:22,740
it's a night tequila tequila one

5102
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:24,740
a self perpetuating night tear

5103
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:26,740
night tequila's from that too

5104
02:59:26,740 --> 02:59:28,740
I love New York

5105
02:59:28,740 --> 02:59:30,740
there

5106
02:59:30,740 --> 02:59:32,740
I've seen a lot of these fucking shows

5107
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:34,740
because my mom has always been

5108
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:36,740
really into just all of it

5109
02:59:36,740 --> 02:59:38,740
she'll watch all of it and the thing is

5110
02:59:38,740 --> 02:59:40,740
I think that the reason that reality shows are so popular

5111
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:42,740
because I cannot

5112
02:59:42,740 --> 02:59:44,740
I cannot

5113
02:59:44,740 --> 02:59:46,740
tolerate them

5114
02:59:46,740 --> 02:59:48,740
every second of it is pain for me

5115
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:50,740
and the reason is that they are

5116
02:59:50,740 --> 02:59:52,740
edited so fucking awkwardly

5117
02:59:52,740 --> 02:59:54,740
where like

5118
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:56,740
you can just hear

5119
02:59:56,740 --> 02:59:58,740
they try to make it look real

5120
02:59:58,740 --> 03:00:00,740
but the more you know about filmmaking

5121
03:00:00,740 --> 03:00:02,740
the more you can't believe any of it

5122
03:00:02,740 --> 03:00:04,740
the thing that really gets me every time

5123
03:00:04,740 --> 03:00:06,740
is like how fucking obviously

5124
03:00:06,740 --> 03:00:08,740
they're manipulating your emotions

5125
03:00:08,740 --> 03:00:10,740
like if these things happen in real life it'd be like

5126
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:12,740
oh he said this to me

5127
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:14,740
even on like a production level

5128
03:00:14,740 --> 03:00:16,740
it's like you see all these people

5129
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:18,740
and sometimes you're like

5130
03:00:18,740 --> 03:00:20,740
how can they have audio that good from where they are

5131
03:00:20,740 --> 03:00:22,740
like there's parts in Survivor

5132
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:24,740
where they'll be out in the water

5133
03:00:24,740 --> 03:00:26,740
right and then they'll be talking to each other

5134
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:28,740
but they'll film it from an angle where you can't see

5135
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:30,740
their faces and they'll have

5136
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:32,740
a conversation that

5137
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:34,740
I know as someone who knows

5138
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:36,740
how to make film you can't

5139
03:00:36,740 --> 03:00:38,740
have that conversation with that audio

5140
03:00:38,740 --> 03:00:40,740
because the only way to do it would be

5141
03:00:40,740 --> 03:00:42,740
if they had lapel mics and those wouldn't

5142
03:00:42,740 --> 03:00:44,740
survive in the water

5143
03:00:44,740 --> 03:00:46,740
the way that they're in the water

5144
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:48,740
and the reason they're not filming them from the front

5145
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:50,740
is because they're ADR'ing those lines in

5146
03:00:50,740 --> 03:00:52,740
they're adding in later

5147
03:00:52,740 --> 03:00:54,740
there's so much stuff that's falsified

5148
03:00:54,740 --> 03:00:56,740
or fake or it's edited weirdly

5149
03:00:56,740 --> 03:00:58,740
where they'll have someone giving like a speech

5150
03:00:58,740 --> 03:01:00,740
and you can hear where each part of the

5151
03:01:00,740 --> 03:01:02,740
sentence that they're saying is not one

5152
03:01:02,740 --> 03:01:04,740
sentence but you can tell that it's stitched together

5153
03:01:04,740 --> 03:01:06,740
I hear you dude I just have to defend

5154
03:01:06,740 --> 03:01:08,740
because the best one

5155
03:01:08,740 --> 03:01:10,740
the other example I know Ben was going to give

5156
03:01:10,740 --> 03:01:12,740
was the pickup artist

5157
03:01:12,740 --> 03:01:14,740
which is

5158
03:01:14,740 --> 03:01:16,740
that is the other one I was going to say

5159
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:18,740
me and Ben were into that for a time back in the day

5160
03:01:18,740 --> 03:01:20,740
and this show was so

5161
03:01:20,740 --> 03:01:22,740
it was so important to me to see

5162
03:01:22,740 --> 03:01:24,740
it was powerfully emotional

5163
03:01:24,740 --> 03:01:26,740
it was the story of a bunch of

5164
03:01:26,740 --> 03:01:28,740
scared, helpless men

5165
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:30,740
trying to make their

5166
03:01:30,740 --> 03:01:32,740
carve out a little piece of happiness for

5167
03:01:32,740 --> 03:01:34,740
themselves in the world and watching their growth

5168
03:01:34,740 --> 03:01:36,740
over the course of this series and them

5169
03:01:36,740 --> 03:01:38,740
becoming real fucking human beings

5170
03:01:38,740 --> 03:01:40,740
was beautiful and it was completely

5171
03:01:40,740 --> 03:01:42,740
real and the emotions that

5172
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:44,740
mystery felt when they had to leave

5173
03:01:44,740 --> 03:01:46,740
it was like when they had to kick a guy out

5174
03:01:46,740 --> 03:01:48,740
it was like they're casting about

5175
03:01:48,740 --> 03:01:50,740
lonely men these were lonely men in need

5176
03:01:50,740 --> 03:01:52,740
of help but like the rules of the competition

5177
03:01:52,740 --> 03:01:54,740
dictated it one of them had to be

5178
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:56,740
like it was hosted by mystery

5179
03:01:56,740 --> 03:01:58,740
mystery was like sad and emotional

5180
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:00,740
when he had to kick some of them off

5181
03:02:00,740 --> 03:02:02,740
there's a huge gradient in quality between them

5182
03:02:02,740 --> 03:02:04,740
not all of them are equally terrible

5183
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:06,740
I've always heard that RuPaul's Drag Race

5184
03:02:06,740 --> 03:02:08,740
is kind of like what you guys just described

5185
03:02:08,740 --> 03:02:10,740
where it's like a way more emotional and like

5186
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:12,740
legit feeling show

5187
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:14,740
it's just that so much of reality TV

5188
03:02:14,740 --> 03:02:16,740
is

5189
03:02:16,740 --> 03:02:18,740
like creating the same kind of

5190
03:02:18,740 --> 03:02:20,740
narratives that you could get anyways

5191
03:02:20,740 --> 03:02:22,740
like from a well made

5192
03:02:22,740 --> 03:02:24,740
show but trying to

5193
03:02:24,740 --> 03:02:26,740
make it well made god damn it

5194
03:02:26,740 --> 03:02:28,740
the idea the idea is

5195
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:30,740
hey hey it's just as good

5196
03:02:30,740 --> 03:02:32,740
a narrative as a regular TV show

5197
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:34,740
but it's real so that makes it better

5198
03:02:34,740 --> 03:02:36,740
except it feels even less real

5199
03:02:36,740 --> 03:02:38,740
because I can see the seams

5200
03:02:38,740 --> 03:02:40,740
so easily like every little thing

5201
03:02:40,740 --> 03:02:42,740
there's no seams in the pickup artist god damn it

5202
03:02:42,740 --> 03:02:44,740
look look okay I hear what you're saying and let's say that that's

5203
03:02:44,740 --> 03:02:46,740
true but the thing is though these

5204
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:48,740
men were actually helped

5205
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:50,740
by this show real good

5206
03:02:50,740 --> 03:02:52,740
was done to the world

5207
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:54,740
I don't doubt that some of them are more real than others

5208
03:02:54,740 --> 03:02:56,740
and I will say that if we're doing

5209
03:02:56,740 --> 03:02:58,740
net shows my favorite one is

5210
03:02:58,740 --> 03:03:00,740
Thumbs Up which is a series

5211
03:03:00,740 --> 03:03:02,740
about these two Korean guys

5212
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:04,740
who like um

5213
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:06,740
stick their thumbs up and show their butts is that what it's about

5214
03:03:06,740 --> 03:03:08,740
no it's a pretty low budget

5215
03:03:08,740 --> 03:03:10,740
it's like a low budget internet

5216
03:03:10,740 --> 03:03:12,740
show where it was about these two guys hitchhiking

5217
03:03:12,740 --> 03:03:14,740
across the US and they did like

5218
03:03:14,740 --> 03:03:16,740
three seasons of it were like the first season

5219
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:18,740
is they had to make it from

5220
03:03:18,740 --> 03:03:20,740
like from like Vegas

5221
03:03:20,740 --> 03:03:22,740
all the way to Florida only

5222
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:24,740
hitchhiking or only taking free rides like they would

5223
03:03:24,740 --> 03:03:26,740
they would train hop a lot and do all this

5224
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:28,740
like a like sleeping weird

5225
03:03:28,740 --> 03:03:30,740
fucking like run down places

5226
03:03:30,740 --> 03:03:32,740
in the middle of nowhere and like but their camera

5227
03:03:32,740 --> 03:03:34,740
man would travel like individually

5228
03:03:34,740 --> 03:03:36,740
like he would film them sometimes

5229
03:03:36,740 --> 03:03:38,740
on the road and then he would like drive to

5230
03:03:38,740 --> 03:03:40,740
stuff like that

5231
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:42,740
and then they did one season where they went from

5232
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:44,740
Texas to Alaska

5233
03:03:44,740 --> 03:03:46,740
and then the last like the third season

5234
03:03:46,740 --> 03:03:48,740
they crossed China all the way through hitchhiking

5235
03:03:48,740 --> 03:03:50,740
alone and I don't know if they ever did more

5236
03:03:50,740 --> 03:03:52,740
but like I don't know if that counts as

5237
03:03:52,740 --> 03:03:54,740
reality TV but it was definitely in the

5238
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:56,740
vein of it but it was

5239
03:03:56,740 --> 03:03:58,740
show is probably don't count just cause like

5240
03:03:58,740 --> 03:04:00,740
I was talking about like the

5241
03:04:00,740 --> 03:04:02,740
shit that's on like network TV

5242
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:04,740
like my mom watches like fucking

5243
03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:06,740
matchmaker which is fucking garbage

5244
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:08,740
you know maybe we got a little way from Thomas

5245
03:04:08,740 --> 03:04:10,740
it's yeah well

5246
03:04:10,740 --> 03:04:12,740
I think it's worth mentioning those other shows

5247
03:04:12,740 --> 03:04:14,740
just because of the fact that

5248
03:04:14,740 --> 03:04:16,740
those like that shows how like

5249
03:04:16,740 --> 03:04:18,740
cause they're obviously inspired by reality TV

5250
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:20,740
these internet shows that are much better

5251
03:04:20,740 --> 03:04:22,740
internet shows I just my internet cut out

5252
03:04:22,740 --> 03:04:24,740
everyone stop what's been said in the last

5253
03:04:24,740 --> 03:04:26,740
minute I didn't my internet died

5254
03:04:26,740 --> 03:04:28,740
taboo dude just

5255
03:04:28,740 --> 03:04:30,740
just calm down it's just nothing's

5256
03:04:30,740 --> 03:04:32,740
been said I

5257
03:04:32,740 --> 03:04:34,740
I thought it was a real thing of any

5258
03:04:34,740 --> 03:04:36,740
important thing I can't get into so

5259
03:04:36,740 --> 03:04:38,740
so yeah

5260
03:04:38,740 --> 03:04:40,740
I was gonna

5261
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:42,740
wait until there was a good time I'm a big fan of

5262
03:04:42,740 --> 03:04:44,740
naked and afraid I want to talk about

5263
03:04:44,740 --> 03:04:46,740
how great that show is

5264
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:48,740
from like a something about

5265
03:04:48,740 --> 03:04:50,740
it you know from a concept is amazing from

5266
03:04:50,740 --> 03:04:52,740
a philosophical standpoint it just touches

5267
03:04:52,740 --> 03:04:54,740
something primal deep inside me I mean

5268
03:04:54,740 --> 03:04:56,740
like this the whole concept of the

5269
03:04:56,740 --> 03:04:58,740
you take a man a woman they get naked

5270
03:04:58,740 --> 03:05:01,740
in the jungle they have to survive you know there's nothing sexual about it but then they

5271
03:05:01,740 --> 03:05:03,740
get to that point where it's at night and they got

5272
03:05:03,740 --> 03:05:05,740
a cuddle and they got a spoon and that's just

5273
03:05:05,740 --> 03:05:07,740
profoundly beautiful you know

5274
03:05:07,740 --> 03:05:09,740
that's what it's all about

5275
03:05:09,740 --> 03:05:11,740
that's what I've always wanted to watch

5276
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:13,740
that's like my ideal vision for what the world should be

5277
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:15,740
I think we should all be naked and afraid together

5278
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:17,740
as opposed to

5279
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:19,740
clothed and depressed alone

5280
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:21,740
when the third impact

5281
03:05:21,740 --> 03:05:23,740
when the third impact comes

5282
03:05:23,740 --> 03:05:25,740
all this left are naked

5283
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:27,740
Jesse and Fluttershy they will comfort

5284
03:05:27,740 --> 03:05:29,740
each other in each other's arms

5285
03:05:29,740 --> 03:05:31,740
or hooves and it will be beautiful

5286
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:33,740
you know right taboo what was the thing you can't get into

5287
03:05:33,740 --> 03:05:35,740
yeah well I was thinking of

5288
03:05:35,740 --> 03:05:37,740
extreme makeover home addition

5289
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:39,740
and that reminded me of something I can't get into

5290
03:05:39,740 --> 03:05:41,740
oh like house flipping shows

5291
03:05:41,740 --> 03:05:43,740
that one is all about like hey we need

5292
03:05:43,740 --> 03:05:45,740
there's this really tragic story

5293
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:47,740
of this family and they have a shitty house and everyone

5294
03:05:47,740 --> 03:05:49,740
the entire universe comes together

5295
03:05:49,740 --> 03:05:51,740
to build them an amazing house

5296
03:05:51,740 --> 03:05:53,740
that show is literally like

5297
03:05:53,740 --> 03:05:55,740
everything every single element

5298
03:05:55,740 --> 03:05:57,740
of emotional manipulation you can

5299
03:05:57,740 --> 03:05:59,740
possibly imagine packed into one show

5300
03:05:59,740 --> 03:06:01,740
but there's two things about it

5301
03:06:01,740 --> 03:06:03,740
that really really get under

5302
03:06:03,740 --> 03:06:05,740
my skin about is the fact that

5303
03:06:05,740 --> 03:06:07,740
they have these kids in the show you know the kids

5304
03:06:07,740 --> 03:06:09,740
who were part of the family and they always

5305
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:11,740
build them a room

5306
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:13,740
that looks exactly like everything that

5307
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:15,740
they want at that exact moment

5308
03:06:15,740 --> 03:06:17,740
which not only will they be embarrassed

5309
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:19,740
to have when they're an adult

5310
03:06:19,740 --> 03:06:21,740
they'll be embarrassed to have next year

5311
03:06:21,740 --> 03:06:23,740
I hear you dude I hear you on this but that's just one

5312
03:06:23,740 --> 03:06:25,740
that always bothered me but then after watching

5313
03:06:25,740 --> 03:06:27,740
the show more I realized oh wait

5314
03:06:27,740 --> 03:06:29,740
wait hold on for a second here

5315
03:06:29,740 --> 03:06:31,740
these are people who are dirt broke

5316
03:06:31,740 --> 03:06:33,740
they can't afford this giant house

5317
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:35,740
how is this happening

5318
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:37,740
and I remember seeing like news stories

5319
03:06:37,740 --> 03:06:39,740
don't they like give it to them

5320
03:06:39,740 --> 03:06:41,740
well like how can they afford the bills

5321
03:06:41,740 --> 03:06:43,740
is the thing and I remember seeing

5322
03:06:43,740 --> 03:06:45,740
like I remember my mom saying there's like a news

5323
03:06:45,740 --> 03:06:47,740
story of like oh yeah one year later

5324
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:49,740
this totally broke family is even more

5325
03:06:49,740 --> 03:06:51,740
broke having to pay property taxes

5326
03:06:51,740 --> 03:06:53,740
on this three-story house

5327
03:06:53,740 --> 03:06:55,740
oh dude and so one of the what here's what I

5328
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:57,740
think one of the best things you can do is look

5329
03:06:57,740 --> 03:06:59,740
up the follow-ups of all reality show

5330
03:06:59,740 --> 03:07:01,740
people yeah nightmares there's a whole

5331
03:07:01,740 --> 03:07:03,740
website dedicated to what happened

5332
03:07:03,740 --> 03:07:05,740
to every kitchen nightmares

5333
03:07:05,740 --> 03:07:07,740
right they all become famous

5334
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:09,740
yeah so this is what I can't get into

5335
03:07:09,740 --> 03:07:11,740
charity imagine the idea

5336
03:07:11,740 --> 03:07:13,740
of giving someone something I just think is

5337
03:07:13,740 --> 03:07:15,740
so imprecise so hard to figure out

5338
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:17,740
the idea of giving

5339
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:19,740
anything it's just like if someone gives

5340
03:07:19,740 --> 03:07:21,740
me something I'm like I can't more hardcore

5341
03:07:21,740 --> 03:07:23,740
you know I can't like if someone

5342
03:07:23,740 --> 03:07:25,740
gives me something I'm like I don't I wish you

5343
03:07:25,740 --> 03:07:27,740
give me this like it would have been better for everyone

5344
03:07:27,740 --> 03:07:29,740
if I feel the total opposite

5345
03:07:29,740 --> 03:07:31,740
I want everyone to give me everything

5346
03:07:31,740 --> 03:07:33,740
all the time please go to

5347
03:07:33,740 --> 03:07:35,740
patreon.com

5348
03:07:35,740 --> 03:07:37,740
everyone

5349
03:07:37,740 --> 03:07:39,740
I don't think I ever

5350
03:07:39,740 --> 03:07:41,740
everyone except for DeVoo because

5351
03:07:41,740 --> 03:07:43,740
we want money or not

5352
03:07:43,740 --> 03:07:45,740
I want absolutely everything

5353
03:07:45,740 --> 03:07:47,740
that anyone wants to give me I will

5354
03:07:47,740 --> 03:07:49,740
absolutely accept

5355
03:07:49,740 --> 03:07:51,740
a Lannister takes

5356
03:07:51,740 --> 03:07:53,740
what is that a thing they say

5357
03:07:53,740 --> 03:07:55,740
or takes what is

5358
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:57,740
given I'm pretty sure

5359
03:07:57,740 --> 03:07:59,740
there's a good reason to give

5360
03:07:59,740 --> 03:08:01,740
but when I'm talking

5361
03:08:01,740 --> 03:08:03,740
about stuff like Christmas did you an elephant

5362
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:05,740
never forgets that's not

5363
03:08:05,740 --> 03:08:07,740
I said pays his debts god damn it

5364
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:09,740
the elephant family lives

5365
03:08:09,740 --> 03:08:11,740
in the southern islands

5366
03:08:11,740 --> 03:08:13,740
they're not from up

5367
03:08:15,740 --> 03:08:17,740
I'm 90% sure

5368
03:08:17,740 --> 03:08:19,740
and said a Lannister takes what is you know that's

5369
03:08:19,740 --> 03:08:21,740
interesting DeVoo I feel differently

5370
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:23,740
I like the idea of charity

5371
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:25,740
I just will never do it because I don't give a fuck

5372
03:08:25,740 --> 03:08:27,740
about anyone besides me

5373
03:08:27,740 --> 03:08:29,740
I'll definitely take you know

5374
03:08:29,740 --> 03:08:31,740
with Christmas

5375
03:08:31,740 --> 03:08:33,740
there's definitely an element of that to it Nate

5376
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:35,740
but I'm also very distrustful

5377
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:37,740
of the people that take charity

5378
03:08:37,740 --> 03:08:39,740
like I don't I do not trust

5379
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:41,740
let's get to the heart of the matter

5380
03:08:41,740 --> 03:08:43,740
even if they offer me

5381
03:08:43,740 --> 03:08:45,740
even if they offer me statistics claiming

5382
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:47,740
everyone without fail operates

5383
03:08:47,740 --> 03:08:49,740
in self interest whether they admit it or not

5384
03:08:49,740 --> 03:08:51,740
and every charity is there to make

5385
03:08:51,740 --> 03:08:53,740
at the very least to make you feel good about

5386
03:08:53,740 --> 03:08:55,740
doing it that is an unquestionable fact

5387
03:08:55,740 --> 03:08:57,740
if you want to give to a charity

5388
03:08:57,740 --> 03:08:59,740
do you want to feel about it

5389
03:08:59,740 --> 03:09:01,740
just put like a hundred dollars in your pocket

5390
03:09:01,740 --> 03:09:03,740
and walk around Chicago for an hour

5391
03:09:03,740 --> 03:09:05,740
and dole it out to bums

5392
03:09:05,740 --> 03:09:07,740
yeah the poor community will have that money

5393
03:09:07,740 --> 03:09:09,740
at least Lynn

5394
03:09:09,740 --> 03:09:11,740
at least you know that it's going to someone

5395
03:09:11,740 --> 03:09:13,740
like yeah

5396
03:09:13,740 --> 03:09:15,740
even if it's someone who's panhandling

5397
03:09:15,740 --> 03:09:17,740
who's like not a real bum

5398
03:09:17,740 --> 03:09:19,740
you know it's going to him

5399
03:09:19,740 --> 03:09:21,740
he earned it to have that money disappear out of your

5400
03:09:21,740 --> 03:09:23,740
wallet like that

5401
03:09:23,740 --> 03:09:25,740
it's not going to be an entrepreneur

5402
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:27,740
something the way by the Susan G. Coleman foundation

5403
03:09:27,740 --> 03:09:29,740
to pay for their pink helmets and their stupid wrist bands

5404
03:09:29,740 --> 03:09:31,740
it's not even that like okay look

5405
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:33,740
Patreon that's like

5406
03:09:33,740 --> 03:09:35,740
I mean that's it kind of belongs

5407
03:09:35,740 --> 03:09:37,740
in the same realm as like

5408
03:09:37,740 --> 03:09:39,740
your friends with someone and you go to dinner

5409
03:09:39,740 --> 03:09:41,740
and you pay the tab sometimes and sometimes they do

5410
03:09:41,740 --> 03:09:43,740
there's this there's like this

5411
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:45,740
unwritten exchange

5412
03:09:45,740 --> 03:09:47,740
of benefit to one another

5413
03:09:47,740 --> 03:09:49,740
that you give that's what Patreon is

5414
03:09:49,740 --> 03:09:51,740
well that's why

5415
03:09:51,740 --> 03:09:53,740
the idea behind

5416
03:09:53,740 --> 03:09:55,740
charity is that

5417
03:09:55,740 --> 03:09:57,740
there is also

5418
03:09:57,740 --> 03:09:59,740
an unspoken thing which is that you

5419
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:01,740
elevate someone's life and then

5420
03:10:01,740 --> 03:10:03,740
they no longer are fighting

5421
03:10:03,740 --> 03:10:05,740
and squalor to eat

5422
03:10:05,740 --> 03:10:07,740
and then maybe they turn out to be a great

5423
03:10:07,740 --> 03:10:09,740
artist because they can finally pursue their passions

5424
03:10:09,740 --> 03:10:11,740
but why don't they just fucking deal with it

5425
03:10:11,740 --> 03:10:13,740
like fuck them I don't care

5426
03:10:13,740 --> 03:10:15,740
I don't care about anything

5427
03:10:15,740 --> 03:10:17,740
well it's just it's like to me the

5428
03:10:17,740 --> 03:10:19,740
whole idea of

5429
03:10:19,740 --> 03:10:21,740
uplifting the lower

5430
03:10:21,740 --> 03:10:23,740
members of our society is that

5431
03:10:23,740 --> 03:10:25,740
it might benefit me in the long run

5432
03:10:25,740 --> 03:10:27,740
you're absolutely right and if I could

5433
03:10:27,740 --> 03:10:29,740
better everyone immediately however

5434
03:10:29,740 --> 03:10:31,740
I am not willing to lose even a single

5435
03:10:31,740 --> 03:10:33,740
cent of my own money to do so

5436
03:10:33,740 --> 03:10:35,740
I mean I don't blame you I don't

5437
03:10:35,740 --> 03:10:37,740
think it's necessarily true that

5438
03:10:37,740 --> 03:10:39,740
you're automatically like

5439
03:10:39,740 --> 03:10:41,740
I don't think that

5440
03:10:41,740 --> 03:10:43,740
the only means to the end of

5441
03:10:43,740 --> 03:10:45,740
people being better is giving them money

5442
03:10:45,740 --> 03:10:47,740
sometimes it means to that end

5443
03:10:47,740 --> 03:10:49,740
by the way I think no place on being a good person

5444
03:10:49,740 --> 03:10:51,740
I can't become a fan of

5445
03:10:51,740 --> 03:10:53,740
it's like something the idea of giving

5446
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:55,740
something is like it's just one

5447
03:10:55,740 --> 03:10:57,740
of many great things to do

5448
03:10:57,740 --> 03:10:59,740
but it's not something that I ever think of

5449
03:10:59,740 --> 03:11:01,740
as something that's good in itself

5450
03:11:01,740 --> 03:11:03,740
and I think that the whole idea of like Christmas gifts

5451
03:11:03,740 --> 03:11:05,740
to adults doesn't work at least

5452
03:11:05,740 --> 03:11:07,740
for me there's just nothing

5453
03:11:07,740 --> 03:11:09,740
that anyone can find me

5454
03:11:09,740 --> 03:11:11,740
oh my god Christmas

5455
03:11:11,740 --> 03:11:13,740
Christmas gifts is such a

5456
03:11:13,740 --> 03:11:15,740
fucking like flash

5457
03:11:15,740 --> 03:11:17,740
here's what it is here's my theory about Christmas gifts

5458
03:11:17,740 --> 03:11:19,740
stupid waste of everybody

5459
03:11:19,740 --> 03:11:21,740
the whole tradition of giving people

5460
03:11:21,740 --> 03:11:23,740
gifts on Christmas was invented back in

5461
03:11:23,740 --> 03:11:25,740
like you know the 1800s

5462
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:27,740
back when everyone made everything by hand

5463
03:11:27,740 --> 03:11:29,740
so that made a lot of sense

5464
03:11:29,740 --> 03:11:31,740
today everyone just buys stuff

5465
03:11:31,740 --> 03:11:33,740
so it doesn't make it doesn't make a difference

5466
03:11:33,740 --> 03:11:35,740
but I just want to say I like

5467
03:11:35,740 --> 03:11:37,740
I kind of like the idea of giving gifts on some

5468
03:11:37,740 --> 03:11:39,740
level just because oftentimes

5469
03:11:39,740 --> 03:11:41,740
you like will under no other

5470
03:11:41,740 --> 03:11:43,740
circumstances will you ever give the people you care about

5471
03:11:43,740 --> 03:11:45,740
anything I know that's true of me

5472
03:11:45,740 --> 03:11:47,740
I never give anyone anything

5473
03:11:47,740 --> 03:11:49,740
I'm forced to do nice things

5474
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:51,740
for people I really do I really do

5475
03:11:51,740 --> 03:11:53,740
I feel like you would give gifts more

5476
03:11:53,740 --> 03:11:55,740
if there weren't obligations

5477
03:11:55,740 --> 03:11:57,740
to do so maybe maybe

5478
03:11:57,740 --> 03:11:59,740
I don't think I would

5479
03:11:59,740 --> 03:12:01,740
I would never give anyone anything

5480
03:12:01,740 --> 03:12:03,740
I had a fun moment

5481
03:12:03,740 --> 03:12:05,740
when I like once I was old enough

5482
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:07,740
to have my own money and then Christmas

5483
03:12:07,740 --> 03:12:09,740
rolled around it was like exciting because it's like

5484
03:12:09,740 --> 03:12:11,740
an expression of the fact that I'm an adult

5485
03:12:11,740 --> 03:12:13,740
with his own income now that I can buy things

5486
03:12:13,740 --> 03:12:15,740
for people sure yeah

5487
03:12:15,740 --> 03:12:17,740
the person here just likes being nice

5488
03:12:17,740 --> 03:12:19,740
sometimes yes you're the only one

5489
03:12:19,740 --> 03:12:21,740
yeah probably

5490
03:12:21,740 --> 03:12:23,740
I just gave Hippo 116

5491
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:25,740
dollars for his playing ticket

5492
03:12:25,740 --> 03:12:27,740
but Tom you're really doing it for yourself though aren't you

5493
03:12:27,740 --> 03:12:29,740
just to feel good about doing it

5494
03:12:29,740 --> 03:12:31,740
I'm not criticizing you

5495
03:12:31,740 --> 03:12:33,740
I think there's an element of both

5496
03:12:33,740 --> 03:12:35,740
in there

5497
03:12:35,740 --> 03:12:37,740
I'm going to visit my friend this week

5498
03:12:37,740 --> 03:12:39,740
and I'm giving her a computer

5499
03:12:39,740 --> 03:12:41,740
she doesn't have one so I'm giving her one

5500
03:12:41,740 --> 03:12:43,740
you're giving her one what

5501
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:45,740
so you're going to smash that press right

5502
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:47,740
I assume that's what's going on

5503
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:49,740
I don't think of giving stuff to your friends

5504
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:51,740
as being in the same realm as charity

5505
03:12:51,740 --> 03:12:53,740
because when you're giving stuff to your friends

5506
03:12:53,740 --> 03:12:55,740
it's deepening your bond

5507
03:12:55,740 --> 03:12:57,740
you're all sucking each other's dicks

5508
03:12:57,740 --> 03:12:59,740
and getting a good heart blowing

5509
03:12:59,740 --> 03:13:01,740
if you just give money to some kid

5510
03:13:01,740 --> 03:13:03,740
it's not going to suck your dick

5511
03:13:03,740 --> 03:13:05,740
what the hell kids suck my dick already

5512
03:13:05,740 --> 03:13:07,740
he got hit in explosion

5513
03:13:07,740 --> 03:13:09,740
and he doesn't have lips anymore

5514
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:11,740
I bet even if he sucked my dick he wouldn't be good at it

5515
03:13:11,740 --> 03:13:13,740
personally though I just have an obligation

5516
03:13:13,740 --> 03:13:15,740
because my name is Digi Bro

5517
03:13:15,740 --> 03:13:17,740
and like the first time I did something

5518
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:19,740
nice for someone after changing my name to that

5519
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:21,740
they said like man he really

5520
03:13:21,740 --> 03:13:23,740
earned the bro in his name

5521
03:13:23,740 --> 03:13:25,740
and ever since then I feel like I have to do something

5522
03:13:25,740 --> 03:13:27,740
really nice for somebody every couple of months

5523
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:29,740
so that I live up to Digi Bro

5524
03:13:29,740 --> 03:13:31,740
just so that more people will say that

5525
03:13:31,740 --> 03:13:33,740
Digi Bro give me some of that sweet Patreon

5526
03:13:33,740 --> 03:13:35,740
yeah

5527
03:13:35,740 --> 03:13:37,740
like I said I gave some to Hippo

5528
03:13:37,740 --> 03:13:39,740
but that was a sweet crunchy roll box

5529
03:13:39,740 --> 03:13:41,740
actually

5530
03:13:41,740 --> 03:13:43,740
4 or 5 months from now don't worry about it

5531
03:13:45,740 --> 03:13:47,740
everybody needs to get your plane tickets

5532
03:13:47,740 --> 03:13:49,740
by the way Hippo and DeVoo already have this

5533
03:13:49,740 --> 03:13:51,740
wait have we made a total announcement

5534
03:13:51,740 --> 03:13:53,740
about Radcon 2016

5535
03:13:53,740 --> 03:13:55,740
should we need to?

5536
03:13:55,740 --> 03:13:57,740
we don't need to

5537
03:13:57,740 --> 03:13:59,740
let's leave it a mystery for now

5538
03:13:59,740 --> 03:14:01,740
that's going to be too much of a mystery

5539
03:14:01,740 --> 03:14:03,740
you guys are just all going to

5540
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:05,740
hey everybody we're going to have a

5541
03:14:05,740 --> 03:14:07,740
you're going to have a conference at my house

5542
03:14:07,740 --> 03:14:09,740
in September

5543
03:14:09,740 --> 03:14:11,740
by the way it's not a convention

5544
03:14:11,740 --> 03:14:13,740
it's not a real convention

5545
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:15,740
none of you people listening are invited

5546
03:14:15,740 --> 03:14:17,740
don't get the wrong idea

5547
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:19,740
it's Radconference

5548
03:14:19,740 --> 03:14:21,740
I'm considering a conference or a summit

5549
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:23,740
but not a convention

5550
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:25,740
in case anyone doesn't get the joke

5551
03:14:25,740 --> 03:14:27,740
Radcon Conrad

5552
03:14:27,740 --> 03:14:29,740
is a Digi's house

5553
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:31,740
that's brilliant isn't it

5554
03:14:31,740 --> 03:14:33,740
someone still doesn't get it

5555
03:14:33,740 --> 03:14:35,740
who the fuck is Conrad

5556
03:14:35,740 --> 03:14:37,740
I feel like you're explaining it

5557
03:14:37,740 --> 03:14:39,740
made it way worse

5558
03:14:39,740 --> 03:14:41,740
anybody have anything else

5559
03:14:41,740 --> 03:14:43,740
we've been going for 3 hours

5560
03:14:43,740 --> 03:14:45,740
10 minutes

5561
03:14:45,740 --> 03:14:47,740
all I brought up was country

5562
03:14:47,740 --> 03:14:49,740
and classical music

5563
03:14:49,740 --> 03:14:51,740
and I guess old things

5564
03:14:51,740 --> 03:14:53,740
everyone in this chat is very mad

5565
03:14:53,740 --> 03:14:55,740
let's hear it

5566
03:14:55,740 --> 03:14:57,740
as soon as you said things that I didn't like

5567
03:14:57,740 --> 03:14:59,740
this was the first thing that came to mind

5568
03:14:59,740 --> 03:15:01,740
and I knew if I said it I'd get a mystery for it

5569
03:15:01,740 --> 03:15:03,740
oh boy

5570
03:15:03,740 --> 03:15:05,740
I want to hear it

5571
03:15:05,740 --> 03:15:07,740
it's punishingly difficult video games in the vein of Dark Souls

5572
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:09,740
I fucking hate it

5573
03:15:09,740 --> 03:15:11,740
well that's an oxymoronic statement right there

5574
03:15:11,740 --> 03:15:13,740
Dark Souls is not punishing

5575
03:15:13,740 --> 03:15:15,740
how have you not heard the 5 million videos

5576
03:15:15,740 --> 03:15:17,740
that people have come out with saying Dark Souls

5577
03:15:17,740 --> 03:15:19,740
isn't punishingly difficult

5578
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:21,740
this is a misunderstanding

5579
03:15:21,740 --> 03:15:23,740
how have you not heard that 5 times yet

5580
03:15:23,740 --> 03:15:25,740
yeah how

5581
03:15:25,740 --> 03:15:27,740
you fucking geek

5582
03:15:27,740 --> 03:15:29,740
well there you go

5583
03:15:29,740 --> 03:15:31,740
that's not how you do it

5584
03:15:31,740 --> 03:15:33,740
why are you even living if you're not playing Dark Souls

5585
03:15:33,740 --> 03:15:35,740
nothing in life is ever giving me joy

5586
03:15:35,740 --> 03:15:37,740
except for Dark Souls

5587
03:15:37,740 --> 03:15:39,740
punishingly difficult that's such a hacky phrase

5588
03:15:39,740 --> 03:15:41,740
I'm so sick of

5589
03:15:41,740 --> 03:15:43,740
punishing like what does it mean to be punished

5590
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:45,740
does it literally spank you after you lose

5591
03:15:45,740 --> 03:15:47,740
there's no such thing as punishingly difficult

5592
03:15:47,740 --> 03:15:49,740
I hate that term by the way

5593
03:15:49,740 --> 03:15:51,740
wait wait hold on

5594
03:15:51,740 --> 03:15:53,740
you are fucking wrong

5595
03:15:53,740 --> 03:15:55,740
there is such thing as punishing

5596
03:15:55,740 --> 03:15:57,740
if you have ever played Banjo fucking Kazooie

5597
03:15:57,740 --> 03:15:59,740
when you die in that game

5598
03:15:59,740 --> 03:16:01,740
you lose every collectible you picked up in the whole level

5599
03:16:01,740 --> 03:16:03,740
and you have to start over

5600
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:05,740
and if you lose 5 lives you have to start

5601
03:16:05,740 --> 03:16:07,740
from the fucking starting area of the game

5602
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:09,740
it's way over punishingly difficult

5603
03:16:09,740 --> 03:16:11,740
I just hate it when Tom says it

5604
03:16:11,740 --> 03:16:13,740
I mean

5605
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:15,740
it's such a hack

5606
03:16:15,740 --> 03:16:17,740
the best game ever

5607
03:16:17,740 --> 03:16:19,740
there's Crash Bandicoot

5608
03:16:19,740 --> 03:16:21,740
there's games like I wanna be the guy

5609
03:16:21,740 --> 03:16:23,740
which are deliberately punishingly difficult

5610
03:16:23,740 --> 03:16:25,740
so obviously punishingly difficult

5611
03:16:25,740 --> 03:16:27,740
IT is a thing but that's a Dark Souls

5612
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:29,740
doesn't like that

5613
03:16:29,740 --> 03:16:31,740
the best game ever

5614
03:16:31,740 --> 03:16:33,740
is Banjo

5615
03:16:33,740 --> 03:16:35,740
Tui

5616
03:16:35,740 --> 03:16:37,740
I just don't think there's that many consequences

5617
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:39,740
for dying in Dark Souls

5618
03:16:39,740 --> 03:16:41,740
the worst thing that happens

5619
03:16:41,740 --> 03:16:43,740
is you have to fight through the last

5620
03:16:43,740 --> 03:16:45,740
one minute again

5621
03:16:45,740 --> 03:16:47,740
it's fun because the combat is fun

5622
03:16:47,740 --> 03:16:49,740
so like I never feel like

5623
03:16:49,740 --> 03:16:51,740
I have to do something I don't wanna do

5624
03:16:51,740 --> 03:16:53,740
it's like oh boy

5625
03:16:53,740 --> 03:16:55,740
oh no I died and now I have to fight

5626
03:16:55,740 --> 03:16:57,740
the funnest level of all time

5627
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:59,740
again

5628
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:01,740
when you do it the 20th time it starts to get annoying though

5629
03:17:01,740 --> 03:17:03,740
well you shouldn't be that fucking shit

5630
03:17:03,740 --> 03:17:05,740
that takes you 20 tries

5631
03:17:05,740 --> 03:17:07,740
I'm the best gamer of all time

5632
03:17:07,740 --> 03:17:09,740
what makes Dark Souls hard to get into

5633
03:17:09,740 --> 03:17:11,740
way more than its difficulty

5634
03:17:11,740 --> 03:17:13,740
is just the steepness of its learning curve

5635
03:17:13,740 --> 03:17:15,740
the opaqueness of its UI and its systems

5636
03:17:15,740 --> 03:17:17,740
the fact that it doesn't explain how to play

5637
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:19,740
that is definitely the hardest thing about Dark Souls

5638
03:17:19,740 --> 03:17:21,740
and I am pretty confident that Tom is at that point

5639
03:17:21,740 --> 03:17:23,740
and once you know how to play it it's fucking easy

5640
03:17:23,740 --> 03:17:25,740
welcome to the Dark Souls commentary

5641
03:17:25,740 --> 03:17:27,740
I have created a faith build

5642
03:17:27,740 --> 03:17:29,740
called Father Matosis

5643
03:17:29,740 --> 03:17:31,740
you can all tell me your sins

5644
03:17:31,740 --> 03:17:33,740
alright advice to the whole audience

5645
03:17:33,740 --> 03:17:35,740
if you want to be good at Dark Souls

5646
03:17:35,740 --> 03:17:37,740
put all of your levels into

5647
03:17:37,740 --> 03:17:39,740
vitality or not vitality

5648
03:17:39,740 --> 03:17:41,740
if it's Dark Souls 3 but vigor

5649
03:17:41,740 --> 03:17:43,740
and strength

5650
03:17:43,740 --> 03:17:45,740
just put all of it into your life and your strength

5651
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:47,740
and then if you have a lot of life

5652
03:17:47,740 --> 03:17:49,740
then no matter how many times you get hit

5653
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:51,740
it doesn't matter because you have a million life

5654
03:17:51,740 --> 03:17:53,740
and the enemies won't do anything to you

5655
03:17:53,740 --> 03:17:55,740
and if you have a lot of strength you kill them all in one hit

5656
03:17:55,740 --> 03:17:57,740
so then you just run through every level

5657
03:17:57,740 --> 03:17:59,740
with a huge sword

5658
03:17:59,740 --> 03:18:01,740
upgrade your weapons by the way

5659
03:18:01,740 --> 03:18:03,740
that's the other thing

5660
03:18:03,740 --> 03:18:05,740
upgrade your weapons and you're done

5661
03:18:05,740 --> 03:18:07,740
that's it

5662
03:18:07,740 --> 03:18:09,740
it's gay and so is home stuck

5663
03:18:09,740 --> 03:18:11,740
it's all bad

5664
03:18:11,740 --> 03:18:13,740
the only game that's good is the color yellow

5665
03:18:13,740 --> 03:18:15,740
Tom did you have more to say about that subject

5666
03:18:15,740 --> 03:18:17,740
before we all snapped on you

5667
03:18:17,740 --> 03:18:19,740
I mean

5668
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:21,740
I guess to just move away from Dark Souls

5669
03:18:21,740 --> 03:18:23,740
and just like punishing the difficult games

5670
03:18:23,740 --> 03:18:25,740
quote unquote however you want to take that in general

5671
03:18:25,740 --> 03:18:27,740
I just

5672
03:18:27,740 --> 03:18:29,740
I don't like games

5673
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:31,740
I don't like games

5674
03:18:31,740 --> 03:18:33,740
I mean

5675
03:18:33,740 --> 03:18:35,740
I play games to de-stress

5676
03:18:35,740 --> 03:18:37,740
not to get stressed

5677
03:18:37,740 --> 03:18:39,740
like there's a threshold where

5678
03:18:39,740 --> 03:18:41,740
I stop having fun that starts becoming a chore

5679
03:18:41,740 --> 03:18:43,740
and any game that goes too far

5680
03:18:43,740 --> 03:18:45,740
past that line

5681
03:18:45,740 --> 03:18:47,740
I feel like I'm just like not getting anything

5682
03:18:47,740 --> 03:18:49,740
I'm completely in agreement with you now

5683
03:18:49,740 --> 03:18:51,740
I absolutely despise punishing games

5684
03:18:51,740 --> 03:18:53,740
I just don't think of Dark Souls as

5685
03:18:53,740 --> 03:18:55,740
and I did before that's why it took so long

5686
03:18:55,740 --> 03:18:57,740
for me to play it but once I figured out how

5687
03:18:57,740 --> 03:18:59,740
it works then it was easy as fuck

5688
03:18:59,740 --> 03:19:01,740
I played Contra

5689
03:19:01,740 --> 03:19:03,740
DS and that game fucking sucked

5690
03:19:03,740 --> 03:19:05,740
cause it was just like it's impossible

5691
03:19:05,740 --> 03:19:07,740
no one can fucking beat Contra

5692
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:09,740
you get hit once and you're dead

5693
03:19:09,740 --> 03:19:11,740
I tried playing Mega Man Zero

5694
03:19:11,740 --> 03:19:13,740
I played all of them and I loved them

5695
03:19:13,740 --> 03:19:15,740
and they were brutally difficult

5696
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:17,740
but I beat them all just cause they were so fun

5697
03:19:17,740 --> 03:19:19,740
like

5698
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:21,740
oh Mega Man Zero

5699
03:19:21,740 --> 03:19:23,740
I mentioned it in passing earlier

5700
03:19:23,740 --> 03:19:25,740
when everyone was yelling over each other

5701
03:19:25,740 --> 03:19:27,740
but like I legit quit Banjo-Kazooie

5702
03:19:27,740 --> 03:19:29,740
specifically I enjoyed

5703
03:19:29,740 --> 03:19:31,740
the game

5704
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:33,740
but the way that it punishes you when you die

5705
03:19:33,740 --> 03:19:35,740
is so unbelievably severe

5706
03:19:35,740 --> 03:19:37,740
because of the fact

5707
03:19:37,740 --> 03:19:39,740
because you have to collect like for certain

5708
03:19:39,740 --> 03:19:41,740
jiggies and stuff it'll be like collect every music note

5709
03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:43,740
in the level and if you lose a life

5710
03:19:43,740 --> 03:19:45,740
you have to collect everything

5711
03:19:45,740 --> 03:19:47,740
over again like it gets rid of everything

5712
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:49,740
you've collected and then if you lose 5 lives

5713
03:19:49,740 --> 03:19:51,740
it just arbitrarily

5714
03:19:51,740 --> 03:19:53,740
puts you in the very beginning

5715
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:55,740
of the game like you just have to

5716
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:57,740
walk back to where you were and it takes like

5717
03:19:57,740 --> 03:19:59,740
a long time so

5718
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:01,740
anytime like there's certain like

5719
03:20:01,740 --> 03:20:03,740
pretty big steep difficulty curve

5720
03:20:03,740 --> 03:20:05,740
in the game where it gets pretty hard later on

5721
03:20:05,740 --> 03:20:07,740
and it's like it's not that the challenges

5722
03:20:07,740 --> 03:20:09,740
weren't fun but

5723
03:20:09,740 --> 03:20:11,740
it is an early N64 game

5724
03:20:11,740 --> 03:20:13,740
and sometimes you die to the camera

5725
03:20:13,740 --> 03:20:15,740
sometimes you die to the

5726
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:17,740
you know like you attacked slightly off

5727
03:20:17,740 --> 03:20:19,740
from the enemy and then they hit you like there's a lot

5728
03:20:19,740 --> 03:20:21,740
of deaths that would be

5729
03:20:21,740 --> 03:20:23,740
forgivable if you were

5730
03:20:23,740 --> 03:20:25,740
instantly respawning and not losing everything

5731
03:20:25,740 --> 03:20:27,740
if we're defining punishing as just like

5732
03:20:27,740 --> 03:20:29,740
shittily designed and like

5733
03:20:29,740 --> 03:20:31,740
unreasonably

5734
03:20:31,740 --> 03:20:33,740
like a camera dad is punishing

5735
03:20:33,740 --> 03:20:35,740
well I think what Tom was talking about is

5736
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:37,740
no reason

5737
03:20:37,740 --> 03:20:39,740
what I really mean is games

5738
03:20:39,740 --> 03:20:41,740
games that I've not having fun with

5739
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:43,740
anymore games well I agree with that

5740
03:20:43,740 --> 03:20:45,740
I hate not fun games

5741
03:20:45,740 --> 03:20:47,740
really insightful Tom

5742
03:20:47,740 --> 03:20:49,740
I think what Tom was meaning is like

5743
03:20:49,740 --> 03:20:51,740
something harsh

5744
03:20:51,740 --> 03:20:53,740
here's the thing

5745
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:55,740
that I feel about video games

5746
03:20:55,740 --> 03:20:57,740
is I have like an ungodly

5747
03:20:57,740 --> 03:20:59,740
amount of patience

5748
03:20:59,740 --> 03:21:01,740
I can sometimes

5749
03:21:01,740 --> 03:21:03,740
summon infinite patience

5750
03:21:03,740 --> 03:21:05,740
it must have been the way we came up

5751
03:21:05,740 --> 03:21:07,740
because I feel the same way Ben

5752
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:09,740
okay okay like

5753
03:21:09,740 --> 03:21:11,740
like Newgrounds games that are like

5754
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:13,740
you know the games where like you fire yourself out of a cannon

5755
03:21:13,740 --> 03:21:15,740
and like how far you go gets you more money

5756
03:21:15,740 --> 03:21:17,740
and then you use that money to buy upgrades to your

5757
03:21:17,740 --> 03:21:19,740
cannon I can spend like

5758
03:21:19,740 --> 03:21:21,740
entire days like

5759
03:21:21,740 --> 03:21:23,740
upgrading games like that

5760
03:21:23,740 --> 03:21:25,740
and like some

5761
03:21:25,740 --> 03:21:27,740
and like if I put in a significant amount of

5762
03:21:27,740 --> 03:21:29,740
effort collecting all those music notes in Banjo

5763
03:21:29,740 --> 03:21:31,740
Kazooie and I die you better

5764
03:21:31,740 --> 03:21:33,740
fucking believe I'm gonna do it all again

5765
03:21:33,740 --> 03:21:35,740
I don't care right now Ben is trying to get

5766
03:21:35,740 --> 03:21:37,740
the hundredth and final crystal and grow home

5767
03:21:37,740 --> 03:21:39,740
something that seems completely ridiculous to

5768
03:21:39,740 --> 03:21:41,740
the rest of us but he's

5769
03:21:41,740 --> 03:21:43,740
he's chugging away it's like it's a matter of

5770
03:21:43,740 --> 03:21:45,740
except for this last one it wasn't even

5771
03:21:45,740 --> 03:21:47,740
that hard okay the last like five or so

5772
03:21:47,740 --> 03:21:49,740
we're pretty fucking hard I think I love

5773
03:21:49,740 --> 03:21:51,740
hard games but only when it's

5774
03:21:51,740 --> 03:21:53,740
like every moment of it is fun

5775
03:21:53,740 --> 03:21:55,740
anyways I was just gonna say like for Ben

5776
03:21:55,740 --> 03:21:57,740
getting like the last five out of these hundred

5777
03:21:57,740 --> 03:21:59,740
like it's the bell curve of fun

5778
03:21:59,740 --> 03:22:01,740
has curved down so you're getting so little

5779
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:03,740
fun for a time invested

5780
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:05,740
on the one hand yes it's

5781
03:22:05,740 --> 03:22:07,740
true even if it's not fun anymore I

5782
03:22:07,740 --> 03:22:09,740
continue to do it I can't stop

5783
03:22:09,740 --> 03:22:11,740
on the other hand grow home is such a great

5784
03:22:11,740 --> 03:22:13,740
fucking game it's fun even it's fun to

5785
03:22:13,740 --> 03:22:15,740
just glide around and just being in the

5786
03:22:15,740 --> 03:22:17,740
game is enjoyable so that's still fun

5787
03:22:17,740 --> 03:22:19,740
because like there's like

5788
03:22:19,740 --> 03:22:21,740
the original Ninja Gaiden for the

5789
03:22:21,740 --> 03:22:23,740
original Xbox yeah you can't say the

5790
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:25,740
original without meaning any

5791
03:22:25,740 --> 03:22:27,740
yes you have to say like the semi original

5792
03:22:27,740 --> 03:22:29,740
well he said for Xbox god damn it

5793
03:22:29,740 --> 03:22:31,740
he fakes me out for a second

5794
03:22:31,740 --> 03:22:33,740
yeah okay fine

5795
03:22:33,740 --> 03:22:35,740
why don't we just talk about every fucking

5796
03:22:35,740 --> 03:22:37,740
video game ever made

5797
03:22:37,740 --> 03:22:39,740
why don't we just make this an eight hour podcast

5798
03:22:39,740 --> 03:22:41,740
how about that why don't we just sit here

5799
03:22:41,740 --> 03:22:43,740
whatever Jesse do you fucking

5800
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:45,740
you know you can you can dip out

5801
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:47,740
and stop your recording if you watch

5802
03:22:47,740 --> 03:22:49,740
that's true holding you a gun no because

5803
03:22:49,740 --> 03:22:51,740
I wanted to make my final point I want

5804
03:22:51,740 --> 03:22:53,740
to make I want to I need to tell

5805
03:22:53,740 --> 03:22:55,740
say my final thoughts right well let us

5806
03:22:55,740 --> 03:22:57,740
get out of the way Tom hasn't been here

5807
03:22:57,740 --> 03:22:59,740
the whole time yeah trying to blow off

5808
03:22:59,740 --> 03:23:01,740
some stress from work every god fucking

5809
03:23:01,740 --> 03:23:03,740
princess Jesse over here

5810
03:23:03,740 --> 03:23:05,740
wait I want to hear about

5811
03:23:05,740 --> 03:23:07,740
I I I didn't know you guys

5812
03:23:07,740 --> 03:23:09,740
could hear me I was just muttering under

5813
03:23:09,740 --> 03:23:11,740
my I was

5814
03:23:11,740 --> 03:23:13,740
trying to

5815
03:23:13,740 --> 03:23:15,740
anybody no I uh

5816
03:23:15,740 --> 03:23:17,740
Tom I am curious

5817
03:23:17,740 --> 03:23:19,740
about this because of the fact that I know

5818
03:23:19,740 --> 03:23:21,740
you're a huge fan of like Ninja Gaiden

5819
03:23:21,740 --> 03:23:23,740
and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

5820
03:23:23,740 --> 03:23:25,740
which by my metric are unbelievably

5821
03:23:25,740 --> 03:23:27,740
fucking hard games so

5822
03:23:27,740 --> 03:23:29,740
this is definitely not about hard games

5823
03:23:29,740 --> 03:23:31,740
Ninja Gaiden is definitely pretty difficult

5824
03:23:31,740 --> 03:23:33,740
yeah never like people were bitching

5825
03:23:33,740 --> 03:23:35,740
like when Devil May Cry 3 came out that it was super fucking

5826
03:23:35,740 --> 03:23:37,740
hard and I didn't think it was hard at all

5827
03:23:37,740 --> 03:23:39,740
like oh yeah destroyed that game

5828
03:23:39,740 --> 03:23:41,740
and everyone's like this is hard

5829
03:23:41,740 --> 03:23:43,740
so it it's

5830
03:23:43,740 --> 03:23:45,740
but like there are other games that I'll find

5831
03:23:45,740 --> 03:23:47,740
fucking really difficult so it's weird

5832
03:23:47,740 --> 03:23:49,740
and I want to like Dark Souls

5833
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:51,740
because everybody here likes Dark Souls but

5834
03:23:51,740 --> 03:23:53,740
every time I play it I'm just not enjoying

5835
03:23:53,740 --> 03:23:55,740
the gameplay at all Tom with Tom if you played Bloodborne

5836
03:23:55,740 --> 03:23:57,740
yet are you are you leveling up

5837
03:23:57,740 --> 03:23:59,740
are you upgrading your weapons I've only played it

5838
03:23:59,740 --> 03:24:01,740
for a little bit but even just like the way

5839
03:24:01,740 --> 03:24:03,740
the game moves away your character moves the way

5840
03:24:03,740 --> 03:24:05,740
heavy heavy it takes time to get used to it

5841
03:24:05,740 --> 03:24:07,740
I don't have a ps4 anymore

5842
03:24:07,740 --> 03:24:09,740
oh yeah well I think

5843
03:24:09,740 --> 03:24:11,740
you would enjoy Bloodborne a lot more than

5844
03:24:11,740 --> 03:24:13,740
the other games because of the fact that

5845
03:24:13,740 --> 03:24:15,740
I think you might enjoy way faster

5846
03:24:15,740 --> 03:24:17,740
Dark Souls 3 because that's a lot faster as well

5847
03:24:17,740 --> 03:24:19,740
well Bloodborne in particular has

5848
03:24:19,740 --> 03:24:21,740
like a more aggressive like

5849
03:24:21,740 --> 03:24:23,740
Metal Gear Rising or

5850
03:24:23,740 --> 03:24:25,740
or like

5851
03:24:25,740 --> 03:24:27,740
Devil May Cry-esque feel to it

5852
03:24:27,740 --> 03:24:29,740
I don't know if anyone's going to disagree

5853
03:24:29,740 --> 03:24:31,740
with me on that I had this very long

5854
03:24:31,740 --> 03:24:33,740
argument in the past about

5855
03:24:33,740 --> 03:24:35,740
how I think Bloodborne is

5856
03:24:35,740 --> 03:24:37,740
after watching that video of Matthew Matosis

5857
03:24:37,740 --> 03:24:39,740
analyzing the first Devil May Cry it looks

5858
03:24:39,740 --> 03:24:41,740
a lot like Bloodborne in the sort of

5859
03:24:41,740 --> 03:24:43,740
yeah it has the same like I

5860
03:24:43,740 --> 03:24:45,740
yeah like the attack animations

5861
03:24:45,740 --> 03:24:47,740
I definitely see where you're coming from

5862
03:24:47,740 --> 03:24:49,740
like even though it plays like Dark Souls

5863
03:24:49,740 --> 03:24:51,740
it's a lot faster and it's

5864
03:24:51,740 --> 03:24:53,740
less punishing on your health where enemies just

5865
03:24:53,740 --> 03:24:55,740
do less damage and it's

5866
03:24:55,740 --> 03:24:57,740
more about regaining health because like

5867
03:24:57,740 --> 03:24:59,740
in that game every time an enemy hits you

5868
03:24:59,740 --> 03:25:01,740
if you hit them back within a certain

5869
03:25:01,740 --> 03:25:03,740
amount of time then you regain all the health

5870
03:25:03,740 --> 03:25:05,740
that they took from you which is a great

5871
03:25:05,740 --> 03:25:07,740
mechanic yeah which is a lot like Metal Gear Rising

5872
03:25:07,740 --> 03:25:09,740
where if you

5873
03:25:09,740 --> 03:25:11,740
kill enemies in a certain way you regain your health

5874
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:13,740
so it's got some of that

5875
03:25:13,740 --> 03:25:15,740
spectacle fighter aspect to it while

5876
03:25:15,740 --> 03:25:17,740
still being the free form

5877
03:25:17,740 --> 03:25:19,740
open world RPG that Dark Souls is

5878
03:25:19,740 --> 03:25:21,740
and I think that

5879
03:25:21,740 --> 03:25:23,740
Bloodborne in spite of being

5880
03:25:23,740 --> 03:25:25,740
I don't think it's easier than the other games

5881
03:25:25,740 --> 03:25:27,740
but I think it's so much easier

5882
03:25:27,740 --> 03:25:29,740
to get the point and be like oh yeah

5883
03:25:29,740 --> 03:25:31,740
this is fun which is why

5884
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:33,740
Aaron Hansen got into the Souls series

5885
03:25:33,740 --> 03:25:35,740
through that game because he totally

5886
03:25:35,740 --> 03:25:37,740
didn't get the point until that one and then it was like

5887
03:25:37,740 --> 03:25:39,740
oh now it all makes sense and then went back

5888
03:25:39,740 --> 03:25:41,740
and played all the others and that's how I

5889
03:25:41,740 --> 03:25:43,740
experienced it too so

5890
03:25:43,740 --> 03:25:45,740
maybe Bloodborne would be a good entry point

5891
03:25:45,740 --> 03:25:47,740
for you if you ever find a chance to play it

5892
03:25:47,740 --> 03:25:49,740
I need to get a PS4 again at some point

5893
03:25:49,740 --> 03:25:51,740
because now there's actually games coming out again

5894
03:25:51,740 --> 03:25:53,740
Did you like sell it to Nate or something?

5895
03:25:53,740 --> 03:25:55,740
I sold it to Nate because you wanted to get the new Kingdom Hearts

5896
03:25:55,740 --> 03:25:57,740
because you were hyped for Kingdom Hearts

5897
03:25:57,740 --> 03:25:59,740
Oh like that's gonna happen

5898
03:25:59,740 --> 03:26:01,740
you're gonna need the PS4K by the time that fucking

5899
03:26:01,740 --> 03:26:03,740
game comes out

5900
03:26:03,740 --> 03:26:05,740
possible possible

5901
03:26:05,740 --> 03:26:07,740
specifically because I remember going out

5902
03:26:07,740 --> 03:26:09,740
I believe I got the PS4 from you

5903
03:26:09,740 --> 03:26:11,740
specifically because Bloodborne was coming out

5904
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:13,740
and I wanted to be there

5905
03:26:13,740 --> 03:26:15,740
Hey Nate remember that time you bought the PS3 for Kingdom Hearts

5906
03:26:15,740 --> 03:26:17,740
I do remember that

5907
03:26:17,740 --> 03:26:19,740
I remember buying, I have a purge in my life

5908
03:26:19,740 --> 03:26:21,740
three PS3's with the intention of playing

5909
03:26:21,740 --> 03:26:23,740
Kingdom Hearts 3

5910
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:25,740
oh god just fucking kill me

5911
03:26:27,740 --> 03:26:29,740
Why did you betray me Square Enix

5912
03:26:29,740 --> 03:26:31,740
Why would you do this to me

5913
03:26:31,740 --> 03:26:33,740
Shit in the fucking head

5914
03:26:33,740 --> 03:26:35,740
Yeah, yeah I'm rolling in my fucking grave right now

5915
03:26:35,740 --> 03:26:37,740
Jesus Christ

5916
03:26:37,740 --> 03:26:39,740
Alright Jesse

5917
03:26:39,740 --> 03:26:41,740
I got, yeah

5918
03:26:41,740 --> 03:26:43,740
Okay

5919
03:26:43,740 --> 03:26:45,740
Well, well guys

5920
03:26:45,740 --> 03:26:47,740
It sure has been a great podcast

5921
03:26:47,740 --> 03:26:49,740
but it's time for my final thoughts

5922
03:26:49,740 --> 03:26:51,740
It's time to nuke this baby

5923
03:26:51,740 --> 03:26:53,740
It's been great being friends with you all

5924
03:26:53,740 --> 03:26:55,740
but it's time for my final thoughts

5925
03:26:55,740 --> 03:26:57,740
on yellow

5926
03:26:57,740 --> 03:26:59,740
Yeah, okay

5927
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:01,740
I don't have the energy

5928
03:27:01,740 --> 03:27:03,740
I don't have the energy to talk to you anymore

5929
03:27:03,740 --> 03:27:05,740
This is the greatest podcast I've ever been a part of

5930
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:07,740
Guys

5931
03:27:07,740 --> 03:27:09,740
This is the most I've ever enjoyed a podcast

5932
03:27:09,740 --> 03:27:11,740
Digi, you have to give this video another

5933
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:13,740
Yeah

5934
03:27:13,740 --> 03:27:15,740
I'm going to make the opening song

5935
03:27:15,740 --> 03:27:17,740
It's going to be Coldplay

5936
03:27:17,740 --> 03:27:19,740
I promise you

5937
03:27:19,740 --> 03:27:21,740
All the people out there in the world listen to this

5938
03:27:21,740 --> 03:27:23,740
All the, you know, impressionable youngsters

5939
03:27:23,740 --> 03:27:25,740
who may hear these people's bullshit

5940
03:27:25,740 --> 03:27:27,740
and believe it because you don't know any better

5941
03:27:27,740 --> 03:27:29,740
I just want to set you straight

5942
03:27:29,740 --> 03:27:31,740
I just want to let you know

5943
03:27:31,740 --> 03:27:33,740
yellow is actually

5944
03:27:33,740 --> 03:27:35,740
my favorite color

5945
03:27:35,740 --> 03:27:37,740
This is true, you know

5946
03:27:37,740 --> 03:27:39,740
I actually knew that

5947
03:27:39,740 --> 03:27:41,740
You know, I love

5948
03:27:41,740 --> 03:27:43,740
Starboard bow is yellow

5949
03:27:43,740 --> 03:27:45,740
Yes, right

5950
03:27:45,740 --> 03:27:47,740
I love Fluttershy

5951
03:27:47,740 --> 03:27:49,740
I love Oscar's yellow dress

5952
03:27:49,740 --> 03:27:51,740
Episode 8 of Neon Genesis

5953
03:27:51,740 --> 03:27:53,740
Who doesn't

5954
03:27:53,740 --> 03:27:55,740
I love bananas

5955
03:27:55,740 --> 03:27:57,740
I love all the yellow things

5956
03:27:57,740 --> 03:27:59,740
Yellow, such as myself

5957
03:27:59,740 --> 03:28:01,740
Yellow is 30

5958
03:28:01,740 --> 03:28:03,740
That's a fallacy

5959
03:28:03,740 --> 03:28:05,740
No, shut up

5960
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:07,740
You don't know

5961
03:28:07,740 --> 03:28:09,740
Guys

5962
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:11,740
I've been

5963
03:28:11,740 --> 03:28:13,740
I've been down with yellow for a long time

5964
03:28:13,740 --> 03:28:15,740
If my videos

5965
03:28:15,740 --> 03:28:17,740
If I had a video that was yellow

5966
03:28:17,740 --> 03:28:19,740
It would be because I purposely made it

5967
03:28:19,740 --> 03:28:21,740
yellow and seeing as how I did not

5968
03:28:21,740 --> 03:28:23,740
purposely make a video yellow

5969
03:28:23,740 --> 03:28:25,740
could not have been yellow

5970
03:28:25,740 --> 03:28:27,740
Did you feel when he claims that

5971
03:28:27,740 --> 03:28:29,740
I just say that I get video games more

5972
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:31,740
than everyone else because I am the best at them

5973
03:28:31,740 --> 03:28:33,740
Yeah

5974
03:28:33,740 --> 03:28:35,740
That doesn't, you know

5975
03:28:35,740 --> 03:28:37,740
Tasting your own medicine

5976
03:28:37,740 --> 03:28:39,740
I think we all do it

5977
03:28:39,740 --> 03:28:41,740
I think we're all fucking terrible people

5978
03:28:41,740 --> 03:28:43,740
It's true

5979
03:28:43,740 --> 03:28:45,740
I'm just saying that since we've established

5980
03:28:45,740 --> 03:28:47,740
that I am the best guy

5981
03:28:47,740 --> 03:28:49,740
at determining what is yellow

5982
03:28:49,740 --> 03:28:51,740
and what is not the best guy at finding it

5983
03:28:51,740 --> 03:28:53,740
Yeah

5984
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:55,740
If your victory for this argument

5985
03:28:55,740 --> 03:28:57,740
is that we have to accept that you

5986
03:28:57,740 --> 03:28:59,740
decide what is yellow, I'm down

5987
03:28:59,740 --> 03:29:01,740
I'm honestly down

5988
03:29:01,740 --> 03:29:03,740
I will accept that we're all going to change

5989
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:05,740
the definition of yellow to fit Jesse's

5990
03:29:05,740 --> 03:29:07,740
definition of yellow

5991
03:29:07,740 --> 03:29:09,740
Yellow's

5992
03:29:09,740 --> 03:29:11,740
Yellos are formative

5993
03:29:11,740 --> 03:29:13,740
Yellos are formative

5994
03:29:13,740 --> 03:29:15,740
Yellos are formative

5995
03:29:15,740 --> 03:29:17,740
You know

5996
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:19,740
Patreon one

5997
03:29:19,740 --> 03:29:21,740
Yes, Jesse

5998
03:29:21,740 --> 03:29:23,740
You know, that's one way to put it didgy

5999
03:29:23,740 --> 03:29:25,740
but you know, the more accurate way would be

6000
03:29:25,740 --> 03:29:27,740
to say that you should all be done

6001
03:29:27,740 --> 03:29:29,740
changing the definition of yellow

6002
03:29:29,740 --> 03:29:31,740
and you should go back to what it actually is

6003
03:29:31,740 --> 03:29:33,740
which is and has always been my definition

6004
03:29:33,740 --> 03:29:35,740
of yellow, which is the actual color yellow

6005
03:29:35,740 --> 03:29:37,740
not the color of my video

6006
03:29:37,740 --> 03:29:39,740
It's a simple formula, kids

6007
03:29:39,740 --> 03:29:41,740
It's a simple fact of the world

6008
03:29:41,740 --> 03:29:43,740
So what color are your videos

6009
03:29:43,740 --> 03:29:45,740
The color is normal, right?

6010
03:29:45,740 --> 03:29:47,740
Normal color

6011
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:49,740
My videos are definitely normal

6012
03:29:49,740 --> 03:29:51,740
You know, and you know

6013
03:29:51,740 --> 03:29:53,740
And that Christmas video

6014
03:29:53,740 --> 03:29:55,740
in particular, you know

6015
03:29:55,740 --> 03:29:57,740
It was really looking normal in that one for sure

6016
03:29:57,740 --> 03:29:59,740
You know, I'm going to have to

6017
03:29:59,740 --> 03:30:01,740
I'm going to have to download

6018
03:30:01,740 --> 03:30:03,740
Dude, I just smoked some weed

6019
03:30:03,740 --> 03:30:05,740
I got to go into my color packs

6020
03:30:05,740 --> 03:30:07,740
on my computer and download normal

6021
03:30:07,740 --> 03:30:09,740
like a font pack and throw it in there

6022
03:30:09,740 --> 03:30:11,740
So I can make stuff in Jesse's

6023
03:30:11,740 --> 03:30:13,740
style if I ever need to

6024
03:30:13,740 --> 03:30:15,740
It's funny that you're trying to make

6025
03:30:15,740 --> 03:30:17,740
my argument sound so

6026
03:30:17,740 --> 03:30:19,740
go out there by claiming

6027
03:30:19,740 --> 03:30:21,740
that normal is like some color

6028
03:30:21,740 --> 03:30:23,740
that I'm saying something so crazy

6029
03:30:23,740 --> 03:30:25,740
when I just say that the video looks normal

6030
03:30:25,740 --> 03:30:27,740
It looks how the human eye actually detects

6031
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:29,740
what the world looks like

6032
03:30:29,740 --> 03:30:31,740
I'm not talking to rocket science

6033
03:30:31,740 --> 03:30:33,740
in rooms with fluorescent light

6034
03:30:33,740 --> 03:30:35,740
It does look like what a podcast has been

6035
03:30:35,740 --> 03:30:37,740
I see such a fucking gauntlet

6036
03:30:37,740 --> 03:30:39,740
I can't believe it's still happening

6037
03:30:39,740 --> 03:30:41,740
Why to you

6038
03:30:41,740 --> 03:30:43,740
Is it yellow?

6039
03:30:43,740 --> 03:30:45,740
Is my question

6040
03:30:45,740 --> 03:30:47,740
Is it just because it's not actually

6041
03:30:47,740 --> 03:30:49,740
full yellow? There is a delta

6042
03:30:49,740 --> 03:30:51,740
in the yellow value of the image

6043
03:30:51,740 --> 03:30:53,740
Right there, he said it people

6044
03:30:53,740 --> 03:30:55,740
You heard it right from the horse's mouth

6045
03:30:55,740 --> 03:30:57,740
Just because it's not yellow doesn't mean

6046
03:30:57,740 --> 03:30:59,740
it's not yellow You don't understand how color works

6047
03:30:59,740 --> 03:31:01,740
in fucking video goddammit

6048
03:31:01,740 --> 03:31:03,740
There's a gulf between the yellowness

6049
03:31:03,740 --> 03:31:05,740
These guys are saying it's something

6050
03:31:05,740 --> 03:31:07,740
These guys argument that because it's not

6051
03:31:07,740 --> 03:31:09,740
ROY G BIF

6052
03:31:09,740 --> 03:31:11,740
ROY G BIF

6053
03:31:11,740 --> 03:31:13,740
ROY G BIF

6054
03:31:13,740 --> 03:31:15,740
There it is, we all live in our own realities

6055
03:31:15,740 --> 03:31:17,740
We all have our own

6056
03:31:17,740 --> 03:31:19,740
ideas about the world

6057
03:31:19,740 --> 03:31:21,740
And if one of us thinks

6058
03:31:21,740 --> 03:31:23,740
that one thing is yellow

6059
03:31:23,740 --> 03:31:25,740
and everyone else thinks it's something else

6060
03:31:25,740 --> 03:31:27,740
We can't tell that person they're wrong

6061
03:31:27,740 --> 03:31:29,740
Really, I mean we can say that they don't

6062
03:31:29,740 --> 03:31:31,740
agree with the general consensus

6063
03:31:31,740 --> 03:31:33,740
But it's no different than saying that something

6064
03:31:33,740 --> 03:31:35,740
is good

6065
03:31:35,740 --> 03:31:37,740
Good is in the eye of the beholder

6066
03:31:37,740 --> 03:31:39,740
Yellow is in the eye

6067
03:31:39,740 --> 03:31:41,740
of the beholder of yellow

6068
03:31:41,740 --> 03:31:43,740
We can't tell a man what is or isn't yellow

6069
03:31:43,740 --> 03:31:45,740
We can only tell him what we perceive

6070
03:31:45,740 --> 03:31:47,740
And just as some people might say

6071
03:31:47,740 --> 03:31:49,740
well there's a god

6072
03:31:49,740 --> 03:31:51,740
And therefore morality is determined

6073
03:31:51,740 --> 03:31:53,740
by what my god says

6074
03:31:53,740 --> 03:31:55,740
The next guy who doesn't believe in that god

6075
03:31:55,740 --> 03:31:57,740
will say you're wrong

6076
03:31:57,740 --> 03:31:59,740
And neither one you can really

6077
03:31:59,740 --> 03:32:01,740
say is right

6078
03:32:01,740 --> 03:32:03,740
I mean you can have scientific observations

6079
03:32:03,740 --> 03:32:05,740
to back your claims

6080
03:32:05,740 --> 03:32:07,740
But who's to say that science is correct

6081
03:32:07,740 --> 03:32:09,740
So there's really no way of disproving

6082
03:32:09,740 --> 03:32:11,740
that the beholder isn't yellow

6083
03:32:11,740 --> 03:32:13,740
by each individual person's standards

6084
03:32:13,740 --> 03:32:15,740
Roy G Biv

6085
03:32:15,740 --> 03:32:17,740
Introduce yourself to my buddy Roy G Biv

6086
03:32:17,740 --> 03:32:19,740
Jesse, I was going to teach you a thing or two

6087
03:32:19,740 --> 03:32:21,740
You ever played Smash Bros

6088
03:32:21,740 --> 03:32:23,740
when you're winning with Roy and the Kraus

6089
03:32:23,740 --> 03:32:25,740
by devolving into chaos

6090
03:32:25,740 --> 03:32:27,740
But what they don't realize is that I am prepared

6091
03:32:27,740 --> 03:32:29,740
to do this all day

6092
03:32:29,740 --> 03:32:31,740
Jesse, I will make a ten hour podcast

6093
03:32:31,740 --> 03:32:33,740
The Endless Podcast

6094
03:32:33,740 --> 03:32:35,740
Okay, Jesse, I have a question

6095
03:32:35,740 --> 03:32:37,740
that can be answered with yes, no, or

6096
03:32:37,740 --> 03:32:39,740
no

6097
03:32:39,740 --> 03:32:41,740
Okay, I'll give you the question, alright

6098
03:32:43,740 --> 03:32:45,740
In that visualization

6099
03:32:45,740 --> 03:32:47,740
that I showed you where I compared the colors

6100
03:32:47,740 --> 03:32:49,740
of your face and your beard and your eye

6101
03:32:49,740 --> 03:32:51,740
from a natural lighting shot

6102
03:32:51,740 --> 03:32:53,740
to a fluorescent lighting shot

6103
03:32:53,740 --> 03:32:55,740
and you see the individual colors

6104
03:32:55,740 --> 03:32:57,740
and there's the color on the left

6105
03:32:57,740 --> 03:32:59,740
is the color in your basement

6106
03:32:59,740 --> 03:33:01,740
Are those colors

6107
03:33:01,740 --> 03:33:03,740
more yellow, yes, less

6108
03:33:03,740 --> 03:33:05,740
yellow or the same amount of yellow

6109
03:33:05,740 --> 03:33:07,740
Does he even have that image?

6110
03:33:07,740 --> 03:33:09,740
The same amount of yellow to view, which is none

6111
03:33:09,740 --> 03:33:11,740
None yellow, okay

6112
03:33:11,740 --> 03:33:13,740
That's objectively

6113
03:33:13,740 --> 03:33:15,740
incorrect, yeah

6114
03:33:15,740 --> 03:33:17,740
You realize that light is made out of a combinate

6115
03:33:17,740 --> 03:33:19,740
There's one thing that really

6116
03:33:19,740 --> 03:33:21,740
I feel like we have a different opinion on what is a color

6117
03:33:21,740 --> 03:33:23,740
We need to get to the root

6118
03:33:23,740 --> 03:33:25,740
of this whole thing

6119
03:33:25,740 --> 03:33:27,740
Here's the problem though

6120
03:33:27,740 --> 03:33:29,740
I want to be able to

6121
03:33:29,740 --> 03:33:31,740
tell Jesse that there's a spectrum of light

6122
03:33:31,740 --> 03:33:33,740
by saying that light

6123
03:33:33,740 --> 03:33:35,740
Oh, there's a spectrum, alright, and he's on it

6124
03:33:39,740 --> 03:33:41,740
But the only problem, the reason why

6125
03:33:41,740 --> 03:33:43,740
that argument isn't going to work

6126
03:33:43,740 --> 03:33:45,740
is that the light spectrum is red, green, and blue

6127
03:33:45,740 --> 03:33:47,740
so it doesn't involve yellow

6128
03:33:47,740 --> 03:33:49,740
so he's going to not even accept that

6129
03:33:49,740 --> 03:33:51,740
as an argument

6130
03:33:51,740 --> 03:33:53,740
Don't computer monitors use like

6131
03:33:53,740 --> 03:33:55,740
blue, purple

6132
03:33:55,740 --> 03:33:57,740
monitors only use

6133
03:33:57,740 --> 03:33:59,740
monitors is RGB

6134
03:33:59,740 --> 03:34:01,740
It's cyan, yellow, magenta

6135
03:34:01,740 --> 03:34:03,740
spectrum

6136
03:34:03,740 --> 03:34:05,740
We've experienced the entire spectrum

6137
03:34:05,740 --> 03:34:07,740
in this podcast for sure

6138
03:34:07,740 --> 03:34:09,740
That's what happens when we all come together

6139
03:34:09,740 --> 03:34:11,740
It's true

6140
03:34:11,740 --> 03:34:13,740
Maybe all of our different perceptions of colors

6141
03:34:13,740 --> 03:34:15,740
is determined by our different levels of autism

6142
03:34:15,740 --> 03:34:17,740
Maybe that's why we don't all see it

6143
03:34:17,740 --> 03:34:19,740
Yeah, exactly

6144
03:34:19,740 --> 03:34:21,740
I have no autism

6145
03:34:21,740 --> 03:34:23,740
and so I

6146
03:34:23,740 --> 03:34:25,740
I don't see any yellow because I'm not autistic

6147
03:34:25,740 --> 03:34:27,740
unlike the rest of you

6148
03:34:27,740 --> 03:34:29,740
That's exactly right, did you

6149
03:34:29,740 --> 03:34:31,740
That picture that you made

6150
03:34:31,740 --> 03:34:33,740
Yes, obviously

6151
03:34:33,740 --> 03:34:35,740
the colors in the two pictures were different

6152
03:34:35,740 --> 03:34:37,740
but neither of them were yellow

6153
03:34:37,740 --> 03:34:39,740
in any way

6154
03:34:39,740 --> 03:34:41,740
Jesse, so are you saying that the other one looks blue to you?

6155
03:34:41,740 --> 03:34:43,740
No, what the fuck?

6156
03:34:43,740 --> 03:34:45,740
Because if something is less yellow

6157
03:34:45,740 --> 03:34:47,740
it's more blue

6158
03:34:47,740 --> 03:34:49,740
I had a feeling we were going to get to this

6159
03:34:49,740 --> 03:34:51,740
at some point and it was going to make it even worse

6160
03:34:53,740 --> 03:34:55,740
Light comes in two forms, yellow and blue light

6161
03:34:55,740 --> 03:34:57,740
Those are the two kinds of light

6162
03:34:57,740 --> 03:34:59,740
No, you idiot

6163
03:34:59,740 --> 03:35:01,740
Light comes in one form

6164
03:35:01,740 --> 03:35:03,740
White or else it's dark

6165
03:35:03,740 --> 03:35:05,740
No, there's a rainbow

6166
03:35:05,740 --> 03:35:07,740
of color

6167
03:35:07,740 --> 03:35:09,740
There's a rainbow, but the thing is

6168
03:35:09,740 --> 03:35:11,740
when light is normal, light is really shy

6169
03:35:11,740 --> 03:35:13,740
the colors are really shy

6170
03:35:13,740 --> 03:35:15,740
You need a prism which excites them

6171
03:35:15,740 --> 03:35:17,740
and makes them feel emboldened in their actions

6172
03:35:17,740 --> 03:35:19,740
It's like alcohol for people

6173
03:35:19,740 --> 03:35:21,740
This is like teaching

6174
03:35:21,740 --> 03:35:23,740
kindergartners

6175
03:35:23,740 --> 03:35:25,740
You guys are trying

6176
03:35:25,740 --> 03:35:27,740
to use alcohol as an example

6177
03:35:27,740 --> 03:35:29,740
Jesse, do you think that

6178
03:35:29,740 --> 03:35:31,740
just because that image

6179
03:35:31,740 --> 03:35:33,740
captured by your camera

6180
03:35:33,740 --> 03:35:35,740
is what it looked like in real life

6181
03:35:35,740 --> 03:35:37,740
does that to you mean that it isn't yellow?

6182
03:35:37,740 --> 03:35:39,740
No, Ben

6183
03:35:39,740 --> 03:35:41,740
What makes it not look like yellow is the fact

6184
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:43,740
that it does not look like yellow

6185
03:35:43,740 --> 03:35:45,740
I'm looking at my room right now

6186
03:35:45,740 --> 03:35:47,740
I don't know why this is so complicated

6187
03:35:47,740 --> 03:35:49,740
for you people to grasp

6188
03:35:49,740 --> 03:35:51,740
I don't know how anyone can be this retarded

6189
03:35:51,740 --> 03:35:53,740
that you people just can't understand

6190
03:35:53,740 --> 03:35:55,740
that it simply does not look like yellow

6191
03:35:55,740 --> 03:35:57,740
that it simply does not look like yellow

6192
03:35:57,740 --> 03:35:59,740
This is not rocket science

6193
03:35:59,740 --> 03:36:01,740
This is not open heart surgery

6194
03:36:01,740 --> 03:36:03,740
It does not

6195
03:36:03,740 --> 03:36:05,740
I repeat, does not

6196
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:07,740
look like yellow

6197
03:36:07,740 --> 03:36:09,740
I just don't believe in this idea that there is a

6198
03:36:09,740 --> 03:36:11,740
normal look

6199
03:36:11,740 --> 03:36:13,740
like everything is affected by the light source

6200
03:36:13,740 --> 03:36:15,740
that is on it

6201
03:36:15,740 --> 03:36:17,740
Jesse, I'm gonna fucking take this picture

6202
03:36:17,740 --> 03:36:19,740
Jesse, I'm gonna print this picture out

6203
03:36:19,740 --> 03:36:21,740
and take it around

6204
03:36:21,740 --> 03:36:23,740
and fucking Steve Harvey game shows

6205
03:36:23,740 --> 03:36:25,740
Ben, that's pointless

6206
03:36:25,740 --> 03:36:27,740
and go around to 100 people

6207
03:36:27,740 --> 03:36:29,740
on the screen and be like

6208
03:36:29,740 --> 03:36:31,740
what fucking color does this look like

6209
03:36:31,740 --> 03:36:33,740
and 99 out of 100

6210
03:36:33,740 --> 03:36:35,740
will look like you're a crazy person

6211
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:37,740
because it doesn't look like a color

6212
03:36:37,740 --> 03:36:39,740
it looks like a fucking picture of a guy

6213
03:36:39,740 --> 03:36:41,740
What the hell man?

6214
03:36:41,740 --> 03:36:43,740
Pictures don't have colors

6215
03:36:43,740 --> 03:36:45,740
Dude

6216
03:36:45,740 --> 03:36:47,740
What?

6217
03:36:47,740 --> 03:36:49,740
You see, I think that most people believe this

6218
03:36:49,740 --> 03:36:51,740
I'm going to red sweater

6219
03:36:51,740 --> 03:36:53,740
I'm going to red sweater

6220
03:36:53,740 --> 03:36:55,740
I'm going to red sweater

6221
03:36:55,740 --> 03:36:57,740
I've got frost on my face

6222
03:36:57,740 --> 03:36:59,740
The video itself is not happy

6223
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:01,740
You guys are out of your fucking minds

6224
03:37:01,740 --> 03:37:03,740
There is no way to prove or disprove

6225
03:37:03,740 --> 03:37:05,740
someone else's reality as

6226
03:37:05,740 --> 03:37:07,740
I am less real than you

6227
03:37:07,740 --> 03:37:09,740
So it's always an argument that everyone's

6228
03:37:09,740 --> 03:37:11,740
perceiving a reality as a fight

6229
03:37:11,740 --> 03:37:13,740
and there's no victory

6230
03:37:13,740 --> 03:37:15,740
There's no way to convince someone else that

6231
03:37:15,740 --> 03:37:17,740
they're seeing something wrong

6232
03:37:17,740 --> 03:37:19,740
Yeah

6233
03:37:21,740 --> 03:37:23,740
So I don't think there's such thing

6234
03:37:23,740 --> 03:37:25,740
as an objective truth about what's yellow

6235
03:37:25,740 --> 03:37:27,740
Like I said, yellow is

6236
03:37:27,740 --> 03:37:29,740
And it's one or the other

6237
03:37:29,740 --> 03:37:31,740
Neither is helping your case

6238
03:37:31,740 --> 03:37:33,740
A cacophony

6239
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:35,740
It's a cacophony of sound, that's true

6240
03:37:35,740 --> 03:37:37,740
But we do it, it's a cacophony

6241
03:37:37,740 --> 03:37:39,740
Yeah

6242
03:37:39,740 --> 03:37:41,740
You know, the burden of proof is on you guys

6243
03:37:41,740 --> 03:37:43,740
I'm proving it

6244
03:37:43,740 --> 03:37:45,740
This is more evidence

6245
03:37:45,740 --> 03:37:47,740
I'm taking the color of your face

6246
03:37:47,740 --> 03:37:49,740
in the basement videos

6247
03:37:49,740 --> 03:37:51,740
and then I have a list of shades of yellow

6248
03:37:51,740 --> 03:37:53,740
and there's one shade of yellow in particular

6249
03:37:53,740 --> 03:37:55,740
that's pretty ding...

6250
03:37:55,740 --> 03:37:57,740
I know but it's pretty ding similar

6251
03:37:57,740 --> 03:37:59,740
out of only like 30 that are listed

6252
03:37:59,740 --> 03:38:01,740
Here's what I'm going to do

6253
03:38:01,740 --> 03:38:03,740
I'm going to take the picture

6254
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:05,740
I'm going to put it in fucking manga studio

6255
03:38:05,740 --> 03:38:07,740
I'm going to blend the entire picture

6256
03:38:07,740 --> 03:38:09,740
into a single solid hue

6257
03:38:09,740 --> 03:38:11,740
and then I'm going to post that hue and you guys are going to look at it

6258
03:38:11,740 --> 03:38:13,740
and tell me what color does it fucking look like

6259
03:38:13,740 --> 03:38:15,740
I'm going to fucking see that

6260
03:38:15,740 --> 03:38:17,740
It's almost like if you change the picture

6261
03:38:17,740 --> 03:38:19,740
it'll be something different

6262
03:38:19,740 --> 03:38:21,740
It's not going to work, Jesse won't believe it

6263
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:23,740
because you altered the picture, it's not real

6264
03:38:23,740 --> 03:38:25,740
I'm only going to use the blur tool

6265
03:38:25,740 --> 03:38:27,740
and nothing more

6266
03:38:27,740 --> 03:38:29,740
and I don't care if Jesse doesn't find that valid

6267
03:38:29,740 --> 03:38:31,740
It's not valid

6268
03:38:31,740 --> 03:38:33,740
I think everyone's desperation to win this

6269
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:35,740
is really fucking hilarious

6270
03:38:35,740 --> 03:38:37,740
What's your response to this?

6271
03:38:37,740 --> 03:38:39,740
I want your rebuttal of this

6272
03:38:39,740 --> 03:38:41,740
This is a shade of yellow that looks very similar

6273
03:38:41,740 --> 03:38:43,740
to your skin in your basement videos

6274
03:38:43,740 --> 03:38:45,740
No, that's a shade of skin

6275
03:38:45,740 --> 03:38:47,740
that looks similar to my skin

6276
03:38:47,740 --> 03:38:49,740
You dumb fuck

6277
03:38:49,740 --> 03:38:51,740
Hey guys, guess what, Jesse

6278
03:38:51,740 --> 03:38:53,740
You're promoting racism because skin used to be a name of a color

6279
03:38:53,740 --> 03:38:55,740
for Crayola crowns

6280
03:38:55,740 --> 03:38:57,740
Skin, which is white people skin

6281
03:38:57,740 --> 03:38:59,740
that was racist

6282
03:38:59,740 --> 03:39:01,740
so they got rid of it

6283
03:39:01,740 --> 03:39:03,740
You're saying that yellow looks normal

6284
03:39:03,740 --> 03:39:05,740
because your skin is tangy

6285
03:39:05,740 --> 03:39:07,740
Your logic is getting pretty out there

6286
03:39:07,740 --> 03:39:09,740
How else am I supposed to rebut, Jesse

6287
03:39:09,740 --> 03:39:11,740
You're not supposed to rebut it

6288
03:39:11,740 --> 03:39:13,740
because there is no rebuttal

6289
03:39:13,740 --> 03:39:15,740
Jesse doesn't think it's yellow

6290
03:39:15,740 --> 03:39:17,740
Nothing is going to change that

6291
03:39:17,740 --> 03:39:19,740
We're all insane for arguing with him

6292
03:39:19,740 --> 03:39:21,740
but I find it so funny

6293
03:39:21,740 --> 03:39:23,740
that I can't stop

6294
03:39:23,740 --> 03:39:25,740
and I've also wasted

6295
03:39:25,740 --> 03:39:27,740
and I just love this podcast

6296
03:39:27,740 --> 03:39:29,740
I'm shocked, I'm shocked and appalled

6297
03:39:29,740 --> 03:39:31,740
by your guys insistence

6298
03:39:31,740 --> 03:39:33,740
on trying to rationalize your insane belief

6299
03:39:33,740 --> 03:39:35,740
that this fucking picture of me

6300
03:39:35,740 --> 03:39:37,740
is yellow

6301
03:39:37,740 --> 03:39:39,740
It's not in comparison

6302
03:39:39,740 --> 03:39:41,740
It has a yellow

6303
03:39:41,740 --> 03:39:43,740
hue tint to it

6304
03:39:43,740 --> 03:39:45,740
There's an overture of yellow

6305
03:39:45,740 --> 03:39:47,740
It's not even playing songs related to this argument anymore

6306
03:39:47,740 --> 03:39:49,740
He's just playing She's So Heavy by The Beatles

6307
03:39:49,740 --> 03:39:51,740
This conversation is fucking heavy

6308
03:39:51,740 --> 03:39:53,740
It's weighing on my soul like a fucking anchor

6309
03:39:53,740 --> 03:39:55,740
Does anybody have anything else that they can't get into?

6310
03:39:55,740 --> 03:39:57,740
Are we wrapping this up?

6311
03:39:57,740 --> 03:39:59,740
I hope this conversation haunts you all

6312
03:39:59,740 --> 03:40:01,740
for days to come

6313
03:40:01,740 --> 03:40:03,740
I hope you see my face in your nightmares

6314
03:40:03,740 --> 03:40:05,740
and I hope my face in your nightmares looks yellow

6315
03:40:05,740 --> 03:40:07,740
Motherfucker, because that's the only place

6316
03:40:07,740 --> 03:40:09,740
it's ever going to look yellow

6317
03:40:09,740 --> 03:40:11,740
is in your own sick imaginations

6318
03:40:11,740 --> 03:40:13,740
just like in your imaginations right now

6319
03:40:13,740 --> 03:40:15,740
You know what this video should mean?

6320
03:40:15,740 --> 03:40:17,740
I know how we can end this

6321
03:40:17,740 --> 03:40:19,740
I was just talking with Idol Yo-Kai

6322
03:40:19,740 --> 03:40:21,740
about this argument

6323
03:40:21,740 --> 03:40:23,740
and she says

6324
03:40:23,740 --> 03:40:25,740
that Jessi's videos look yellow

6325
03:40:25,740 --> 03:40:27,740
Oh, there you go

6326
03:40:27,740 --> 03:40:29,740
Why does that matter?

6327
03:40:29,740 --> 03:40:31,740
I'm just going to fade out this podcast

6328
03:40:31,740 --> 03:40:33,740
Why does that matter, Tom?

6329
03:40:33,740 --> 03:40:35,740
We had to sync with Tom

6330
03:40:35,740 --> 03:40:37,740
It's a funny thing that you mentioned Idol Yo-Kai

6331
03:40:37,740 --> 03:40:39,740
and I'll tell you exactly why

6332
03:40:39,740 --> 03:40:41,740
and I want everyone to gather around

6333
03:40:41,740 --> 03:40:43,740
and listen to this little tidbit

6334
03:40:43,740 --> 03:40:45,740
because Idol Yo-Kai is currently

6335
03:40:45,740 --> 03:40:47,740
drawing a picture for me

6336
03:40:47,740 --> 03:40:49,740
and I said to her

6337
03:40:49,740 --> 03:40:51,740
and this is a true story

6338
03:40:51,740 --> 03:40:53,740
I said I want my sunglasses

6339
03:40:53,740 --> 03:40:55,740
to be yellow

6340
03:40:55,740 --> 03:40:57,740
and guess what

6341
03:40:57,740 --> 03:40:59,740
Oh boy, I'm on board

6342
03:40:59,740 --> 03:41:01,740
She gave me her picture

6343
03:41:01,740 --> 03:41:03,740
and the sunglasses were wrong

6344
03:41:03,740 --> 03:41:05,740
the sunglasses were black

6345
03:41:05,740 --> 03:41:07,740
so she doesn't know what yellow is

6346
03:41:07,740 --> 03:41:09,740
Okay?

6347
03:41:09,740 --> 03:41:11,740
So I win!

6348
03:41:11,740 --> 03:41:13,740
That's it! Thank you!

6349
03:41:13,740 --> 03:41:15,740
Thank you for proving my point

6350
03:41:15,740 --> 03:41:17,740
The opening for this podcast should be

6351
03:41:17,740 --> 03:41:19,740
I win!

6352
03:41:19,740 --> 03:41:21,740
Guys, we need to sync with Tom

6353
03:41:21,740 --> 03:41:23,740
You've drawn your hat into the ring

6354
03:41:23,740 --> 03:41:25,740
with fools

6355
03:41:25,740 --> 03:41:27,740
Tom, on the count of three

6356
03:41:27,740 --> 03:41:29,740
we all say shit breaks

6357
03:41:29,740 --> 03:41:31,740
One, two, three

6358
03:41:31,740 --> 03:41:33,740
shit breaks

6359
03:41:33,740 --> 03:41:35,740
You know, what's really crazy is

6360
03:41:35,740 --> 03:41:37,740
one, two, three

6361
03:41:37,740 --> 03:41:39,740
shit breaks

6362
03:41:39,740 --> 03:41:41,740
You know what else we haven't even brought up

6363
03:41:41,740 --> 03:41:43,740
We just amplify this even more

6364
03:41:43,740 --> 03:41:45,740
Wait, everybody, everybody, everybody

6365
03:41:45,740 --> 03:41:47,740
Say goodbye

6366
03:41:47,740 --> 03:41:49,740
Bye

6367
03:41:49,740 --> 03:41:51,740
Yeah

6368
03:41:51,740 --> 03:41:53,740
I'm supposed to

6369
03:41:53,740 --> 03:41:55,740
be working

6370
03:41:55,740 --> 03:41:57,740
right now

6371
03:41:57,740 --> 03:41:59,740
But I'm not working

6372
03:41:59,740 --> 03:42:01,740
I'm doing nothing

6373
03:42:01,740 --> 03:42:03,740
My dick, I'm jerking

6374
03:42:03,740 --> 03:42:05,740
Myself, I'm sucking

6375
03:42:05,740 --> 03:42:07,740
I am an asshole

6376
03:42:07,740 --> 03:42:09,740
I am a stupid

6377
03:42:09,740 --> 03:42:11,740
I've got a deadline

6378
03:42:11,740 --> 03:42:13,740
Don't want to do it

6379
03:42:13,740 --> 03:42:15,740
I am an asshole

6380
03:42:15,740 --> 03:42:17,740
I am a stupid

6381
03:42:17,740 --> 03:42:19,740
I've got a deadline

6382
03:42:19,740 --> 03:42:21,740
Don't want to do it

6383
03:42:31,740 --> 03:42:33,740
What the hell is wrong with me?

6384
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:35,740
I'm supposed to

6385
03:42:35,740 --> 03:42:37,740
be making money

6386
03:42:39,740 --> 03:42:41,740
I'm supposed to

6387
03:42:41,740 --> 03:42:43,740
be creating

6388
03:42:43,740 --> 03:42:45,740
funny

6389
03:42:45,740 --> 03:42:47,740
Think that the people

6390
03:42:47,740 --> 03:42:49,740
gladly will pay

6391
03:42:49,740 --> 03:42:51,740
for artistic

6392
03:42:51,740 --> 03:42:53,740
genius

6393
03:42:53,740 --> 03:42:55,740
That's what they came for

6394
03:42:55,740 --> 03:42:57,740
Instead, I'm tweeting

6395
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:59,740
hashtag repeating

6396
03:42:59,740 --> 03:43:01,740
That's why

6397
03:43:01,740 --> 03:43:03,740
there's no heat

6398
03:43:03,740 --> 03:43:05,740
and holes in the ceiling

6399
03:43:07,740 --> 03:43:09,740
Yeah

6400
03:43:09,740 --> 03:43:11,740
It's quite the burden

6401
03:43:11,740 --> 03:43:13,740
It's a hard knock life

6402
03:43:13,740 --> 03:43:15,740
Being

6403
03:43:15,740 --> 03:43:17,740
a genius
