1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, okay, I'm, I'm, I'm, okay, I'm my audio.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Finally. I'm an audio guy.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Finally, God.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Damn.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're so dead. You're fucking dead.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh no. Oh no.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Fuck.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm fucked.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Dude.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I can't believe. I can't believe.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What, what a treat.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What a, what a treat to discover that you have not played frog fractions.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What, what a fucking joke.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What a joke of a person you are.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh man. I can't wait for the right fucking cockroaches to evolve into a civil war.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Where I just, it's not even gonna be a war.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm just gonna go to sleep and I'm gonna pour gasoline inside of your fucking room.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And just wait until you suffocate on gasoline.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Just, yeah, like, like everyone in RFCK will have to, will have to choose their side.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It will be, will be split right down the middle. Yes, Suri.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A group of rowdy fuckers and a group of cop killers cannot be divided.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was, it was rowdy fucker against cop killer.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, who would it be who? Oh, it's too difficult.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's no way, there's no way.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think I'm the cop killer.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, you do, huh? You fucking, you fucking establishment piece of shit.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You think you're the cop killer? I've been killing cops since I was a penis, bitch.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My mother was a cop and she died in childbirth.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, fuck. All right.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And when my mom died in childbirth, my dad gave me a little baby high five.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right, preview stream.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Fuck. Okay, okay, okay, here's the million dollar question.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because I have to like record like a sub region in OBS, right?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So it's like, it's like small. Should I keep it at its original size?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can like inflate it.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wait, you can record your whole screen. Isn't there a monitor setting?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, sure. But wouldn't I just want to record the bit that is actually relevant?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I guess. I don't know. I've never, I've never done that.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can just, you can just record the window.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But you think you're so smart.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm pretty clever.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, you know, you're right. You've convinced me.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thanks.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, thanks for taking me at my word.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All right.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay. Okay, so do we go?

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hang on. Let me, um,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, I don't want to see. All right. So I'm looking at your screen.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If I'm reading this, I'm gay. Yep. That's me.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yep.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're paid off.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I just fell for the trap. Okay.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yep. I guess we can go if you want to, if you want to head over to, if you want to head over to, I'm going to be, I'm going to be,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to start the video recording.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm going to, I'm going to help. Okay. I'm going to be a very helpful boy.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay. Okay. Okay.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
When you're recording on your frog on your quest to learn fractions with a frog.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm recording. I'm recording the screen capture and I'm singing up the audio now when I, on the count of three, I'm going to open a new tab.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So one, two, three, new tab. All right. One, two, three, new tab. All right. Sick.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't see anything.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, that's fine. It's because it's not, it's not on the fucking.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We got this.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We got to sync audio too.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh yeah. Okay. Well, I, hold on. This like, this like screen you're seeing isn't my screen. It's like its own thing and like the cloud.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay. Okay. On the count of three, we'll say peg. All right. One, two, three, peg.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right. Great job.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yep.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
One, two, three, peg. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's set in the mood. It's a tone piece.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
RFCK is a tone piece now.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That was completely not right on my screen, but if it's good on your screen, then I guess we'll do it.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't see anything on your screen.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No. Well, I meant, I meant as in, we didn't sync up audio wise.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Also, I'm not, okay, whatever. I'm not recording anything.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You aren't?

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm recording audio. I'm not recording video.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No. Yeah. Obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
As long as we've synced up audio wise, then we're good.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But are you, are you sure you're recording your video though? You're sure?

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Why would, yeah, why would it yeah?

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know. I don't know.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't even doubt myself. You fucking nihilist.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't believe in videos and therefore they never exist.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hold on. Before we go to FrogFactions, I'm gonna have like a joke.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
should introduce when... Hold on. Okay. Hold on. What the fuck is this? Pictures of a big

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:43,880
baby. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Introduce the podcast. Okay. Yeah, why not? Hey, welcome

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,480
back to the long-awaited Return Resurrection Reimagining Reboot of

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,720
Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers Episode 4. Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers. I think we've had way

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,040
more. I think we've had like at least like more than one. At least one.

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,560
There's at least one, and this is at least one and a half. Starring me. Starring me,

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,760
your hero, Ben St. and my bumbling sidekick, Munchy, with tiny heads. That's so funny.

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,960
It's so funny that you guys walked in just a moment while I was looking at

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,880
pictures of Ben to put in my collection. What are you? The pictures of Ben on the

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,880
screen right now. It's fucking crazy. Those babies are like 17 different

97
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,320
ethnicities, and I am only one, so... Oh, oh, oh. Checkmate. Checkmate. When I say that

98
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,200
you are you're a melting pot of cultures. I do believe, yeah, I'm all about

99
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,960
representation, dude. Even in my gene pool. Even in my very DNA. I know when I

100
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,720
think about Ben St. I think about Big Baby, Villains Wiki from Toy Story 3. It's

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,320
what I think about. Villains Wiki. That fucking baby was just misunderstood. God

102
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,720
damn it. Didn't he watch the movie? He just wanted to kill all Pokemon. He just

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,560
was mad because he was a mechanical spider now. Right. Tell the bitches. Oh my

104
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,800
god. So the other day I asked Munchy, surely you've played Frog Fractions,

105
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
and the greatest moment of my entire life was when he said,

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:30,120
Duh, Duh, no. What's that? Duh. Okay. Well, okay. First of all, I did say... We're

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,760
fixing that on Rowdyfuckers cop killers. We're recording. Boot up discord. I did say,

108
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:43,960
I did say it as if I had three, three, like an IQ in the single digits. However, I said

109
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,000
that I played like the first like three seconds, and then I was like eh. Yeah. That's why I

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,500
basically haven't seen any of it. Yeah, okay. Frog Fractions twin beard. What do you know

111
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,160
about Frog? What do you know about Frog Fractions Munchy? Okay. I know that Nate was like,

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:08,640
Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. Yeah. That is, that is so something he'd say.

113
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,860
And then I was like, okay, and then then then we were in a call to record the PCP and it was like,

114
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:22,620
I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure that Nate's a pretty I'm sure I'm sure that Nate thinks he loves frog fractions

115
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,500
But I'm sure but I'm sure that his appreciation is like is like is like a fucking kiddie pool

116
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,460
Compared to the vast ocean of wisdom that is my engagement with frog fractions

117
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,980
If you fucking like frog so much why don't you rub one?

118
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,580
Anyway, oh shit, he did I didn't expect that let's let's just fuck this duck shall we oh

119
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,580
That's what I've always what the fuck is this shit. Oh here. Ow my brain. That's pretty that's pretty loud

120
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,180
That's pretty that is pretty loud. It's pretty fucking loud. I'm gonna. Oh god. Wait turn I

121
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,260
Turn I turn volume down. I I guess I'll I'll turn mine down too

122
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,100
I'll cut this cut this part out of the podcast. Oh shit. Should I be recording the sound too? I should yeah, yeah, you should

123
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
Okay frog fractions

124
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,380
Are you recording the sound? Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay sweet

125
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Excellent, okay

126
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,060
All right frog fractions. We're gonna play all right month the kids

127
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,420
Know how we are. I know that you are in like fourth grade or something

128
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,180
So you I know you probably you probably don't even know simple you probably don't even know simple fucking

129
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,860
You probably don't even know the fucking chain rule for integration let alone fractions

130
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,340
But you're about to and when this frog is done with you you're gonna know

131
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:11,300
Everything about parts of things please please save me save me for this trap that I've laid for myself

132
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,380
Munchie and in the third grade the teacher came with me and said all right

133
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,780
We're gonna be learning about division and I and I sneezed and I feel like a huge fucking booger came out of my nose

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,940
And like it was all over my desk and all the kids laughed at me

135
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
I

136
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,220
Faggot it was hot. Yeah

137
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,620
Play frog fractions. Okay, so okay, so I like I want to get so now the learning

138
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,900
But you want to eat the bugs?

139
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,100
Frogs eat bugs and you want to protect the fruits you want to protect the fruit. Oh, why?

140
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,620
Frogs where are the fruits ever do for fucking me? I forget I forget what they do

141
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,700
But what see see you one fell on you. I think you want to

142
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,900
You might want to eat the fruits when they when they fall. I don't know

143
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,100
I mean the ones that are like on top of you just fall right on top this website. We're using to do this fucking sucks

144
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I have huge input delay. That's not even fair

145
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,580
Really, that's fine. Yeah, no, you're gonna be fine. Um, okay

146
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:16,420
Yeah, so you got to get upgrades you got to upgrade so you can really learn about fractions like in a really efficient alright

147
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,780
Uh

148
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,100
Don't give us don't get the cybernetic brain get the what's the top left one there?

149
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,260
No left

150
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Yeah, yeah, you want lock-on targeting?

151
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,620
Okay, so so so this game is like made for like for like shitty idiot babies, right?

152
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,700
Yeah, yeah, if you're a little kid and you don't know about fractions then this is the game for you

153
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,260
Anyway, it seems like it's not teaching me. It's just showing fractions on screen. Yeah

154
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,460
Well, I mean you gotta you gotta start by dipping your toe in just with the introduction

155
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,500
Just you know, they just get introduced the concept that fractions are a thing that exists

156
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,660
And you can you can see at the top there. It's tracking. Oh, fuck. I got two. It's tracking your fruit

157
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,620
It's tracking your indignity and it's tracking your Zork

158
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,660
Zork mids are gonna Zork mids are gonna be important later right now. Okay, just worry about fruit and indignity

159
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,780
No, I'm pretty I'm pretty honorable. I think I think this is fuck

160
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,660

Are you okay try the arrow keys to the arrow keys work?

180
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,060
No, the arrow keys are the ones that are making me go up and down like like my like page

181
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,100
Maybe we should have tried this before

182
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,980

Nothing I can fucking do

186
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,580
It like like it was working up until I like try to do up or down and then just wouldn't I'm

Yeah, I'm done with that. Okay. Yeah

189
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,820
All right, welcome to the second attempt. Yeah

190
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,060
Fucking fucking twin beard fucking twin beard can't program for shit apparently

191
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Whatever, you know, it's fine. You've you've learned the ropes. You're learning the ropes. You'll figure it out

192
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,300
You see you already got 16 Zork mids. You're off. Yeah, I got a ton of fucking Zork mids

193
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:16,420
When the ladies come to me say yo, how many Zork mids you guys say I'm fucking I can't talk to you your different race

194
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,420
You say I say 16. That's the age of consent in many states and they say damn

195
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,740
Damn

196
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,780
Into those fourth graders. Let's see. Oh, you can't get the turtle. Yeah. Yeah fuck shit. No, thanks, bitch

Yeah, say yeah, save up for that turtle save up for that turtle

198
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,740
I get that turtle. We got to get that turtle again and hope that it doesn't crash the fucking game again

199
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
So, uh, oh

200
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,700
Man before it was doing a thing before fuck it was doing a thing before I'll point it out

201
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,540
I'll point it out when it happens again. I'm sure it'll happen again, but the fractions. Oh, dude

202
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,020
You're indignant. You're indignant. He's going crazy, dude. Oh shit. I'm so shitty

203
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,420
Oh

204
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:10,100
You got too much indignity you got too much indignity. Oh, oh shit. Oh fuck. I'm shit at this game. Yeah. Yeah, you really are

205
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,940
I can't I can't believe it. I can't believe you would let the bugs do this

206
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,060
This would be fine if it was a toad, but since it's a frog it's a little bit

207
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,500
I can't I can't believe you would give the fucking these these bugs the satisfaction of owning your ass so thoroughly

208
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Hey

209
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,660
Oh my fucking god, I literally fucking hate this program and I I I was just talking about before the show how much

210
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,180
How cool it is. It's literally the fucking worst thing I've ever seen before

211
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,020
Yeah, you had nothing but praise for this piece of shit for this piece of shit server

212
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,620
This piece of shit

213
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,340
By the way, the way we're doing this viewer is that munchies playing it in in the rabbit something called rabbit and like

214
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,300
So is it working?

215
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
No Jesus fuck

216
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,460
I have no idea how to remedy this it

217
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,140
It fucking worked before it worked. I don't know what to do, Ben

218
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,260
Like the game you can't you can't fucking continue the all right all right

219
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,220
Is there some other fucking screen sharing app I I I don't we could do skype I guess

220
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,940
I don't even have skype on my computer. Wait, can you and even why can you not do it through um

221
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Can you not do it through discord?

222
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
I don't think so

223
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,540
Let's see

224
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,660
I mean, well, obviously we're not gonna fucking use this shit because it sucks. Yeah, this really this really sucks

225
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,740
Uh, I can't believe it. I can't believe this

226
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,740
I don't I don't understand. I don't understand the single fucking thing. Let's go to my notifications on twitter

227
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,420
Oh, hey a couple more people liked my post that actually feel good about myself

228
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Then yeah, why are women so easily manipulated? Well

229
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,500
It's because it's because they don't you know, they lack they lack several of the things that we men enjoy

230
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,580
um

231
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
moral fiber

232
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
And uh and rationality

233
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,180
um, it's the two the the two the two cornerstones of civilization really and

234
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,580
you know

235
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,420
Tragic tragically don't have a prostate male. How are you gonna fucking peg someone without if they don't have a pet prostate?

236
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,420
Yeah, how are you gonna pleasure someone if they don't have a problem? Nothing is more nothing is more pointless than the female anus

237
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,780
Yeah, nothing has ever been more feudal

238
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,740
More feudal feudal japan

239
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,420
There have never been more samurai's than female butts. That's true

240
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,020
Except for this this episode sucks

241
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,900
All right, all right accessibility

242
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
All right

243
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Wait, no don't don't turn golly-blin mode on

244
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:30,020
I don't get what we're oh shit. Should I do classic? Uh, no you go with next gen

245
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,540
Okay. Yeah, you gotta stay up to date. Yeah

246
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,180

00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
All right, just play

248
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah

249
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,700
Yeah, I guess so and then hey when you when you get to the when you get to the like upgrade menu

250
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,940
try like

251
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,140
I don't know. I think you can select with the arrow keys. I think

252
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Okay, all right. So here we are a third attempt third attempt to play the the little the little guy game the the game for little guys

253
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,820
A little tiny frog guys little tiny frog boys by the way despite featuring a frog

254
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,500
Um frog fractions does not endorse

255
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
They've been accumulating under the sea

263
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,740
Dude, you see you see what I mean the fucking the um, oh my fucking god the turtle functionality

264
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,500
That's fucking insane turtle functionality was is key to the

265
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:03,060
I knew my my my fucking my fellow animorph my fellow my my fellow jester

266
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
animorph

267
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
My fellow fucking

269
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,020
Um, oh my fucking god. I'm so powerful. Are you sold? Are you sold on frog fractions yet?

270
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,220
Oh my god. I'm so what's this mother fucker doing in the background. What's he what's his story?

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,900
Yeah. Yeah, the little little little fucking little little gestapo

275
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,660
I don't know man. It's just part of the deep lore of frog fractions. I guess

276
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,700
Uh, he frog fractions doesn't even fucking do my taxes for me. No, man. It's gonna it pays dividends

277
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,860
It pays, you know, it's hard. It's hard work now, but in the future you'll be glad you look bad back on this

278
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,460
And say I'm so glad that ben beat me up and made me learn math

279
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,700
Because that's what I do. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. The chicks don't dig on cyborg

280
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,620
Probably shouldn't be that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you can get a cybernetic brain

281
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,620
Or you can get yeah, yeah get the get the static cling tongue. You want that you want that? All right. All right

282
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,020
It's gonna fuck. It's gonna fuck these bugs right up

Oh my god. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh my god. This is you're in this is literally more math than fucking leonard avenge

294
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,820
You're you're you're in you're in bullet hell now, son

295

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,380
That's literally a single science right there now. You're in. Oh my god. Now. You're an exponential now

299
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:49,140
You're an exponential functions now. You're advanced you've gone on to advanced maths as the brit as the britons would say as the ang

300
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,260
Anglos the anglos. Yeah

00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,900
Oh my god, you ate all those bugs that just reminds me of how I fucking crushed it in uh in downwell on digi bros

305
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,420
And how that piece of shit digi has not released that video even though it's been like two fucking months

306
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Play that fucking game. I

307
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,540
murdered I fucking murdered down well, dude. I'm a champion. It's all warp drive

308
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:36,180
Oh, dude, it's all warp drive and you're flying dragon. Now. He'll really take you places. Oh my god. Oh my god

309
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,820
This isn't really happening. This is really. Oh my god. This is really glad you could follow me

310
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,020
We're dealing with a serious infestation here

311
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,780
um

312
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:51,540
Oh my god, so uh, so yeah, so you're about to learn some really hardcore fractions. I think

313
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,340
Oh my fucking

314
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,780
Be careful those asteroids. Don't let them push you around. Yeah, watch out. Okay. Okay. Watch out. You're still recording, right?

315
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:05,220
You're screen recording everything's good. Okay. I'm really paranoid. I'm really paranoid. We're gonna lose this choice footage

316
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,820
This this this this discovery only happens once

317
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,740
Yeah

318
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,700
Um, oh my god. Yeah, your dragon friends are going. Oh, oh dude. That was so much fun

319
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Fucking indignity. You just suffer

320
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:29,860
He just is way after way of it hot hot fucking christ hot fucking god. This this reminds me of my fucking bar mitzvah

321
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,900
You let the asteroids push you around we said not to do that. Yes. Yes, sir. Oh my fucking god

322
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,460
Oh, dude, watch watch that indignity

323
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,900
Actually, it doesn't even look like you're accumulating any

324
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,100
Uh, it looks like it looks like you're riding too high on your dragon friend with your warp drive

325
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,460
What's his name? It's terry cruise terry cruise the dragon the dragon bruise

326
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,060
Do a barrel roll. Wow. Oh good. Oh good had to have that

327
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,220
Dude, dude, you see mars in the background. That's fucking mars, dude

328
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,020
That's that's actually mars. Is that the real life? Is that the actual mars? That's the real life mars

329
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,740
It's got the fucking dry ice polar caps at the bottom

330
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:25,300
Dude, you're almost there, dude. You've almost I've got something for you to dry. It's my laundry. Please do it. It's my humps

331
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,300
Bitch, it's oh my god. Oh my god. It's more than I can take. Yeah

332
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,900
My my little heart my little beading heart

333
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Oh

334
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,980
Good flying with you lieutenant hop. See you on the other side

335
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,860
Yeah, oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, where are we now? We're going to mars, dude

336
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
Oh

337
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,860
Oh fuck

338
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,780
Oh fuck. Okay. It's time. It's time to get serious. Oh

339
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,700
All right, I wonder if the big guy has any tips about dealing with fractions

340
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,660
Ah

341
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Oh, fuck. Okay. Oh god

342
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Oh, he's unfortunate

343
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,260
No, no, no, no, no

344
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Holy shit

345
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,740
Okay, so now you're in now you're in the court of bug mars

346
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,820
You're accused of breaking and entering your native habitat bug mars with intent to perloin our delicious space. Oh, fuck. I'm surrounded by bugs

347
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,460
A minimum sentence of 20 years hard labor, but there's a special offer this week

348
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,100
How'd you like to become a naturalized citizen of bug mars?

349
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
um, um, um

350
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,300
Oh

351
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Oh, I you know, I'm

352
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,020
I I I have an affinity for bugs as we all seen in hashtag bug wars

353
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,660
I I I actually killed a bug and I and I and I'm more I'm more and it's lost heavily

354
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,380
He's now he's a fully realized pcp character the bug that died

355
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
He's real bug that died

356
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,860
Excellent. All you need to do is pass a test on the history and culture of this fine planet

357
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,740
Shall we we begin our bug plan flag as far as bug stripes?

358
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,460
I wonder I wonder why there's why there's uh the american the united states flag in bug mars, but it's fine. Yeah, that's

359
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,820
Shit, you're right. That's a that's a contradiction or is it just room for deeper lore?

360
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,180
Oh, it's obviously just fucking bugs a little bit on the nose, isn't it?

361
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,980
You can blame bug betsy ross for that one next question on the series bug

362
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
What is bug snooker's favorite player of ice cream?

363
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,020
Huh, when are we gonna get where are we gonna get to to troll jeegus?

364
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,420
When are we gonna get to that part of the history lesson here?

365
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,820
Uh, so wrong and it's all right four score and 20 bugs go bug in chief bug thomas chefferson

366
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:47,300
I literally I literally made the joke bug thomas chefferson like two days ago. Did I literally did you now?

367
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:55,300
I I I called him thomas bugerson thomas bugger. Well, you fucked it up because his name was bug thomas jefferson

368
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,580
As you can see so you so you fail you don't get to be a naturalized citizen

369
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,980
The only right you'll ever need. Oh fuck. I wasn't paying attention. Uh

370
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,180
You're you're you're you're crushing it munchie. You're I think I think they're I think the bugs are gonna accept you as one of their own

371
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,540
I think I think I think you've got this on lock frankly quite frankly. I mean, obviously

372
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,180
I mean, let me just drink my fucking

373
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:30,260
Sunrise I you know, you know, really I think bug mars is is is pretty a bunch of a bunch of crackpot in the spears day theorists

374
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,580
I think they I think they're all like 9 11 truthers. I don't think they really know what the fuck's going on

375
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,100
That's an entire people you that's an entire people you're throwing under the bus there

376
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,140
They're fucking bugs who cares last question mr. Hobb. How do you feel about fractions?

377
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,620
Oh, man, this is this is the only question that is

378
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Shit

379
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,140
Oh, you know, I gotta say

380
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,660
Ever since that day that I spit my nose

381
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:04,180
Juice outside of my body and the entire class saw me with my with my pants down legally and figuratively

382
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,260
Yeah, I've I've always known that I is my favorite my favorite ninja turtles Raphael. Yeah, I love them

383
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
Dick Masterson aka Raphael

384
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,460
I know right fractions. I'm impressed. Here's the first perfect score in our fake naturalization program

385
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,980
We were going to fire you into the sun, but instead we decided to give you a work visa

386
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
Yolo

387
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
But

388
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
Yeah

389
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,820
Oh here

390
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:44,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, please do this right do this right and never never regret it. Oh my god

391
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:50,580
All right. All right. All right. How are you guys? This is gonna. This is gonna define your life on bug mars from here on out

392
00:30:50,580 --> 00:31:03,300
I'm a bug. You did it, dude. Mars fractions are the best. Yep, well, oh my, oh fuck,

393
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,980
oh fuck, back right into the frame. Back to the old grind. This is, this is, this is

394
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,260
where you belong. This is, this is what you're most comfortable. This is what you were trained

395
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,180
for. Oh, the indignity, dude. The fucking indignity. Oh my god, bugs. Hey, what was that

396
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,380
thing that just fell? Bugs, why? I, I, I, oh my god, oh my god. What, what kind of

397
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:30,380
doubloons will they have on fucking bug Mars? Um, there's, there's plenty. Uh, PR. PR department.

398
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,140
Oh, I need, I need some, I need some branding. I need branding. Uh, it's too expensive. You

399
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:42,380
can get durians. Yeah, I want durians. I want, I want to go down into, uh, oh. Oh. Well,

400
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,140
this is just like my second bar mitzvah I had because I was disowned at my first one.

401
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:59,580
You know, you know what they say, um, a bar mitzvah in the hand is worth two in the bush.

402
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:19,500
I, you know, it almost feels like a disservice to talk over this part because you're meant,

403
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,260
because you're meant to just, you're meant to just sail around and listen to a calm voice explain

404
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,900
to you the history of boxing. But, let me turn my volume all the way up. But fuck it.

405
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,020
All right, I guess there's no more voice. I guess not. It'll, he'll be back. He'll be back

406
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,060
eventually. I guess in the meantime, just check out that sweet puffer fish. Well, he's gone now.

407
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,700
Fish ain't even shitty. I haven't even killed my dad yet.

408
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,860
Hey, look, it's a dory. It's a finding dory.

409
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:10,860
It's me. Can you prove it? I love what happened because I can't remember it.

410
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:21,660
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. While I vape, seems like the time for it.

411
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,060
Vape, vape, vape all day long. Vape, vape, vape. It's basically my whole personality.

412
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:36,060
Vape, vape, vape. He wears a thong. Vape, vape, vape. He's always wrong. His name is...

413
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,620
As, as Christian Weston Chandler once so creatively put it,

414
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,260
rap, rap, rap. That's a rap.

415
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,700
His words. His words, not mine. His words, not mine in the word, words of Christ.

416
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:01,260
Life is like a movie. And this movie doesn't have a surprise ending. The good guys win, quote from

417
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:08,060
J.C.W. Connors. I hate it when movies surprise me.

418
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,980
Oh, that one didn't even look like a fucking sea guy. That was a... Oh, it's a...

419
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:19,500
Coal! It's a coothaloo. It's a, it's a, it's a cuddle. It's a cuddlefish for cuddling.

420
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,940
Cuddlefish. Yeah, yeah. It's a horitair. It's a, it's a flathooloo.

421
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,100
It's a, it's a, it's a, yeah, horitair. That's right. It's a, it's a, it's a, hey,

422
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:35,340
don't click that. Don't click that. Don't click that. Okay. So, so sorry, Meister.

423
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,220
You know, you know, Ben, if there was one character that I could relate to you in all of

424
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:50,380
media fiction itself, it would be the heat miser from, from that one, like Claymation Santa Claus one.

425
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,980
The heat meister? The heat meister. Yeah. The heat meister. You mean the burger meister?

426
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,380
No, not the, well, the burger meister also as well. However, not.

427
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,900
The heat meister is a completely different original character.

428
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,620
You're talking about one of those Claymation Christmas specials?

429
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,340
Yeah. Yeah. Must not be one I've seen, because I don't know, I don't know any,

430
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,300
but I don't know anybody by the name of heat meister, sir.

431
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,340
I'm Mr. Heat Meister. I'm basically fucking sick.

432
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,860
Um, you know what they say, um, heat meister, heat meister, at the door,

433
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,500
run away quick, or you'll run no more. Yep. Magic the Gathering.

434
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,780
Dude, one time I was over, I was over at my cousin's house and we were playing,

435
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,140
we were playing fucking, uh, Magic Gathering. And all of a sudden, and, and, and it was on his

436
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:55,420
Xbox, he didn't actually have the cards on the Xbox version. So, so, so, so, so we were playing

437
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,660
and all of a sudden he just, he just starts jacking it and I leave the room.

438
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,780
Why'd you leave, faggot?

439
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,620
Because I didn't want to air up.

440
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:14,220
You clearly, clearly you don't know how to read the room, Munchy. Clearly you don't know how to

441
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,820
read the mood. Uh, that, well, you know, hey, it's a symptom of autism, I guess.

442
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,980
Yeah. We're all on the spectrum.

443
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,500
You know, I think it would be a leased artist, honestly.

444
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:37,180
Yeah, I think I would consider myself a leased game. Oh, God. Jesus Christ. Oh,

445
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,020
possibly my favorite thing you've ever said.

446
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,940
Oh, my God, it's Futurama. It's a, it's a crashed Futurama.

447
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,620
All right, now it's time for the true game to begin. Oh, my God. Hey, question,

448
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,260
are you capturing, is your, is OBS going to capture that mouse?

449
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,740
Yeah. There's no way to stop that. Oh, well, well, there is, but whatever.

450
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:11,740
Uh, that's fine. I just, we'll just throw this video out in the trash, where it belongs.

451
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:19,580
And by the trash, I mean the procrastinators channel. Okay. Now here, now this is for real.

452
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,820
Now this is the real shit, the raw shit.

453
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:29,020
Um, I feel an intense sound of pressure. You calm down and start taking your surroundings

454
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,260
for the first time since the seemingly dormant vessel sprang the life. The walls of the circular

455
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,580
room curve to meet at a point that must correspond to the curved nose of the outer hull lining the

456
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:44,300
walls. You see a porthole, a glowing display and a control deck. A ladder leads aft. Um, okay.

457
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,540
What? Oh, dude. What? Oh, no.

458
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,980
Did you, wait, wait, I see a tab. I see it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Please tell me that the game's

459
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,740
still open. Yeah, it, it won't let me go to it for some reason. What?

460
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:14,220
Is this, it's, is this like part of the game? No, no. This is part of the gameplay experience.

461
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,540
Well, maybe you should close all those other new tabs.

462
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:29,020
I can't interact with it at all. What? No. It's, it's locked me out.

463
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:41,980
Well, what do I do? Why, why? Oh, wait, wait, wait.

464
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:53,740
It seems to be responding. Wait, well, well, like, like, like, can you like minimize it and then open

465
00:38:53,740 --> 00:39:00,380
it again or something? Yeah, here. I'll go over a different tab real quick. I'll go, I'll go to Twitter.

466
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,100
Yeah. Something, something needs, something must be done. This, this won't stand.

467
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:16,700
Fucking rabbit. I hate it. I don't like it anymore. I, I can't fucking doing anything.

468
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,340
No, I'll, I'll, I'll change, I'll change like, like the broadcast

469
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,780
shit. Maybe. Oh, fuck. What? What? Oh, it just, it just looked crazy for a second. I missed it.

470
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,020
Nope. Still, still can't do anything.

471
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,500
The game's like safe over here. Yeah.

472
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,780
The question is just how do we get to it?

473
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,420
What happens when you right click? Nothing? Nothing. Because it's not doing anything?

474
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,340
Yeah, yeah. Like, I can move, I can move my mouse around, but it's not like, I can't interact with

475
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:18,380
anything. Yeah. Oh, wait, is that mouse in like the, the rabbit window? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see.

476
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:35,180
I don't know, man. Might have to restart. Oh, my fucking god. Why? Why? Why were we cursed?

477
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:42,620
Try like, opening a new window and like, see if rabbit works in a new window or something?

478
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,540
Like, like, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,860
All right. All right. All right. All right. Should I close the original one?

480
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:07,100
It's pretty risky. I don't know. I mean, I'll still have it open. If you close it, will this like,

481
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:15,020
whole thing end? Here, no, I'll give you the power. Okay. Wait, can you just like,

482
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:22,140
fucking transfer it to me? I think so, yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah, do that. All right,

483
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,660
you know that little thing next to the volume that says remote control? Click on that.

484
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:37,500
Oh, my god, I've got the fucking power. All right, all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm closing

485
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:45,420
that and then you'll be in charge and then I'll go back. Okay, but mine's, it's not letting me

486
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:52,540
do anything either. I, yeah, wait, why did, wait, are you Joseph? Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,

487
00:41:52,540 --> 00:42:00,220
I'm Joseph. I'm Joseph. How did, okay, is it saved? Is it fucking saved? I, I, I, I, I think so. Oh,

488
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:11,420
my god. It's a miracle. Yes. How, how, how did it work? Okay, whatever. That's great. Thank god.

489
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:19,580
Okay, now I see, now I see that there actually isn't any way, retrieve arms. Well done.

490
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,460
Now I, now I see that there actually isn't any way to get rid of that cursor because

491
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:30,940
that's just how rabbit works. That's fine. Yeah. Um, okay. Um, well, you can go to the

492
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,940
porthole, the display or the control deck. I think there's doors too. Okay, hold on.

493
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:46,140
Okay, okay, okay, okay. You're in, you're in a space spaceship hull command mod. You're in the,

494
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,620
you're in the command, the command module. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

495
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,420
No, no, no, you're in, you're in the command module. Oh, shit. Okay. Fuck.

496
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,180
Yeah, here we go. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

497
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:21,260
All right, let's check, let's see what my, what my, what my, what my, uh, my, my fetch modus is.

498
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,740
No, you got nothing. You got no, you got no modus, no modus operandi.

499
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,940
Shit. I'm talking like away from the modus operandi.

500
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,060
Getting money fastest by modus operandi. I've been ice cold since the night I saw my man die.

501
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,380
Yeah, yeah, my modus operandi is a malgum, a freelancer in the way of the samurai.

502
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,100
How do I live without you?

503
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,100
If I don't live without you.

504
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,540
We're seeing the two different ones, even though they're both the right, they can be real.

505
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,700
Um, look at the-

506
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:03,020
I wanna know how I ever, ever survive.

507
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,780
Wow, wow, wow.

508
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:11,020
Okay, okay, okay, okay, wait, just, just like look, just like look everywhere.

509
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:20,860
Okay. Yeah, let's go like look display or porthole.

510
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,540
I don't want, I don't want to have to fucking-

511
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,940
Here we go. A glowing green display shows a map of the galaxy with a destination you don't recognize.

512
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,700
An ETA of about 3,000 years, looking closer you see two on-screen buttons labeled root details

513
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,820
and new destination.

514
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,980
I'm gonna turn this bitch around.

515
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,900
The nav computer dumps you into an interface so obstruc that before you even consciously

516
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,340
process what's happening you've hit the back button and are at the main map again.

517
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,580
Excellent.

518
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,220
You two, you got your little frog brain, can't handle it.

519
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,300
Even though you fucking got the cyber brain that let you understand the wizardry of exponential

520
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,700
functions or exponential scientific notation, whatever.

521
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:11,100
Even though I'm frog Carl Karl Marx and I've invented communism I still can't wrap my brain

522
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,020
around simple reader functions.

523
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,180
Do root details.

524
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,900
Fuck.

525
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,020
The screen spills forth a slew of steps such as spiral spinward at Spathi system,

526
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,860
far faster than you can fathom.

527
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,860
Oh shit, it wouldn't let me do it all.

528
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:50,780
Uh, hmm, well, looks like you can't do anything with this, maybe?

529
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,420
Okay, what do you got?

530
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,180
You got the porthole and something else.

531
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,780
There was some other thing.

532
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,700
Ben, when am I gonna go back to doing bath in the third grade?

533
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,060
Soon, soon.

534
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:07,340
You just have to fucking, you just have to fucking escape from the cold abyss of space.

535
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,700
Jell-o, man.

536
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,780
Let me, let me drink some more of my germax.

537
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,340

Shit.

543
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,740
Oh god.

544
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,980
We can't do the, we can't do the licensing deal.

545
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,700
Oh boy, it's all falling through.

546
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,220
It's all falling through.

547
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,660
Um, all right, all right, shit.

548
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,580

553
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,900
and then I reheated it in the microwave.

554
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,500

Suck your dad's dick, friend.

559
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,620
It won't let me see the big babies.

560
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,700
Man.

561
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,940
I want to see big baby.

562
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,740
This game has taken-

563
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,140
It won't give me big baby.

564
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,740
This game's taken a dark turn into dark comedy.

565
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:18,460
Google image search big baby boys.

566
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:27,580
No, no, no, no, you seem to-

567
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,140
I want to see the big babies.

568
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,380
You seem to be having parser and or guess the verb trouble, Munchie.

569
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,420
Remember, you can always type help for assistance.

570
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,660
Help! I need big baby boys!

571
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,380
Give me the big baby boy!

572
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,020
I want to see him.

573
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,100
I want to see him grow up.

574
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,500
No, no, the pathos.

575
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,340
No, I want to see my big baby.

576
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:10,540
I'm a cool, I'm a cold, unfeeling, phony, two-faced, amoral protagonist, down on my luck.

577
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,980
And I've been in jail.

578
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,220
I haven't seen my big baby boy grow up.

579
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,540
He's been without his big old daddy.

580
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,700
He's even- a big baby boy has an even bigger daddy.

581
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,020
Rule number one of thorough dynamics.

582
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,180
Big baby boy has an even bigger daddy.

583
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,100
Oh, fuck.

584
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,380
I want to see him.

585
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:45,740
I want to see my- I want to give my baby boy a big, a big dad.

586
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,020
He deserves one.

587
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,300
No, Jesus. Jesus Christ, Munchie.

588
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,500
Oh, what the fuck?

589
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,940
Why don't we- I blacked out.

590
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,500
What are we doing?

591
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,460
Why don't we sleep?

592
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,260
I don't- you go and say look- just say look port hole.

593
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,380
Just say look port hole.

594
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,980
God, through the portal you can see a background of starshifting as the ship gently spins the

595
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,780
constellations.

596
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:18,940
Okay, um, fuck, just do look, because there's one other thing, and I guess you got to do the last

597
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,180
thing.

598
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,420
All right, uh, control-

599
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:23,740
Fuck.

600
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,500
Control deck.

601
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,940
Oh wait, oh no, you can go to- yeah, it's- okay, I don't know, it's either the control deck or the ladder.

602
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,740
Okay, say look control deck.

603
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,500
All right.

604
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,180
The control deck consists of an array of switches and a pair of joysticks.

605
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,780
Let's hope you never need to override the ship's autopilot, because these are definitely not

606
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,460
frog joysticks.

607
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,900
You should definitely fuck with them.

608
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,620
I don't understand what you want to fuck.

609
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,220
With them.

610
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,540
With them is what I want to fuck.

611
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:03,900
Fuck.

612
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,340
Um, say like, say like, say like, uh, uh-

613
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,340
Wait, wait, oh, wait, I fucking got it, I fucking got it.

614
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:11,660
Yeah.

615
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,020
No!

616
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,980
Fuck!

617
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,100
Okay, okay, okay, okay, enough pussy footage.

618
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,260
We need to go all in on learning fractions.

619
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,740
No more, no more pathos, no more big babies, no more big baby boys.

620
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,140
We need to fucking get- we need to do it.

621
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:41,100
Yeah, um, uh, push- wait, wait, push, push switch, push switch, push switches.

622
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,620
Oh, whatever.

623
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,420
Um, all right, go to the ladder.

624
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:55,340
This game is made by fucking little, little, little, little bit of a- you know what they call them.

625
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,220
Yeah, yeah, go to- go to ladder, go to ladder.

626
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,140
Or go aft.

627
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,340
Later, go to later, fucking nerd.

628
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,580
This is- looks like before you go and learn fractions, you better go learn to spell.

629
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:14,380
Ben, you are going to be vaporized into a fucking pooper-dipe-wearing baby fuck.

630
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:18,860
I'm gonna vape myself into a pooper-dipe-wearing baby fuck, you know what I'm saying?

631
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,620
This looks like an all-purpose living area.

632
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,780
A sleeping pod sits next to a nightstand.

633
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,300
A ladder leads to the four.

634
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,740
Okay, that's where you just were.

635
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,140
An oriental rug lies in the center.

636
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,820
You can't say that anymore.

637
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,580
Dude, check the rug.

638
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,940
All right, you know- okay.

639
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,100
The decorative oriental rug sits in the center of the room looking at it more closely.

640
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,100
It doesn't quite lay flat on the floor.

641
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,500
There's a significant dip around the middle.

642
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,900
Okay, maybe you gotta move it.

643
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:51,580
All right.

644
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,660
Moving the rug, you discover a recessed hatch.

645
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,900
Your score has gone up by two-fifths of a point.

646
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,660
Fuck- Oh, shit.

647
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,700
Fuck yes.

648
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,180
Fuck yes.

649
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,100
That's how you know it's progress.

650
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,900
They should remake this game, but the entire time,

651
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,780
overlaid on top of the entire game are two tracks.

652
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,100
Number one, the John Tron theme song at full blast of, like, maximum game.

653
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,980
In other words, not even recognizable anymore.

654
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,540
And then second, to balance it out,

655
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,940
put the angry video game nerd as well at full game, maximum blast over it.

656
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,900
Oh, Zoli, Quinn!

657
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,620
The joke is gamer culture.

658
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:41,020
Because gamers are a joke and gamers are over.

659
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,700
Gamers are dead.

660
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,300
Long with gamers.

661
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,660
Gamer justice!

662
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,700
Gamers, um, video games.

663
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,300
Okay.

664
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:06,140
open it you have to work you have to give the wheels a few spins the hatchpops

665
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,500
open okay

666
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:19,940
enter hatch go go to hatch yeah enter what what else was there there was a

667
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:26,740
you slipped through the hatch nearly every service in this room is covered

668
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,660
with a sticky pink goop which seems to be thicker near a gray machine a gray

669
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,100
machine sitting in the corner a hole in the wall exposes a nest of wires there's

670
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:41,700
a hatch leading back okay yeah that's that's what you just were okay um make

671
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:50,740
shit can town I only used it as far as can okay okay there's sticky goop there's

672
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,820
a gray machine and there's a hole in the wall these are these are the things these

673
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,260
with which we can fuck all right all right

674
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:10,780
shucks shit fuck this machine this machine won't be moved by your human by

675
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:18,020
your human desires by your human but my human etiquette no that that I really I

676
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:22,420
really want to get all up in that pink goop in yeah that's all I want I just

677
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,860
want to get mad fucking into that I just want to get super embroiled in that

678
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:31,460
fucking pink goop you real you are pink goop munchie you're that's what you're

679
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,380
made of anyone's ever said to me it's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me

680
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:41,140
like you're like you're like Winnie the Pooh like he when he was but with

681
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,120
sludge and goop yeah instead of fluff yes oh I thought you mean like he was

682
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,380
eating honey and that and that was gonna be oh the oh yeah actually that works

683
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,300
too that works too yeah you just got pots you just got pots and pots you just

684
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:07,300
got cans and cans of it look at look at examine the machine that's not you didn't

685
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,100
verb it you didn't verb it right the machine consists of a spigot aimed at a

686
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:17,780
flat platform a hand sheet of paper has been hastily taped over the base of the

687
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:27,340
platform definitely look at that paper this is the out-of-order note included

688
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:38,820
in your game package okay sure sounds good look at the hole in the wall a

689
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:45,740
spigot aimed at a flat platform that's Minecraft just go to just say just do

690
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:54,100
look at hole all right yeah cool yeah look hole go just head over to the look

691
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,540
hole peering into the exposed machine there you see what looks like an empty

692
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:07,260
coffee can that you're guessing doesn't belong there see it knew what you were

693
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,140
trying to do it damn it knew what you were trying to do there but it won't

694
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:18,620
it's not having it why why is it so fucking bigoted because it was made

695
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,220
because it was made by Mars bugs and Mars bugs lack empathy because they all

696
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,700
have all my god bugs they haven't even they haven't even fucking they haven't

697
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,460
even released and vanquished that the the synopete of their soul you do you

698
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,300
know do you know how do you know how you know that bugs are are bad and lack

699
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,780
moral fiber it's because they don't even they don't even have muskles they

700
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,300
can't even lift they don't even have muskles all their limbs are controlled

701
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,940
by by fucking liquid hydraulics they don't lift munchy they can't lift you

702
00:57:51,940 --> 00:58:03,100
know how you know that bows are amoral why because they're white now we're

703
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:12,540
into the stars to start a race war comes a kid with a knack for propaganda

704
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:32,620
this is the theme song of Adolf Hitler get that can oh my god I can actually

705
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,380
make can town now you twist the can and eventually comes loose but you've ripped

706
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,420
the insulation off of an adjacent wire in the process and it begins sparking as

707
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,860
it comes in contact with an adjacent strut you glance down at what you've

708
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:49,540
taken huh it really is a coffee can alright so you've got the can you've

709
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,140
got the machine you've got the hole in the wall and I think that's it for this

710
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:04,260
room was there something else in this room what was the term of it it was

711
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:12,060
it was machine it was goop oh goop yeah yeah yeah it was pink pink goop is what

712
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:28,260

714
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,620
fucking goop is stuck to the surface could you not just scrape some off I

715
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:43,820
scrape off goop from my body all the time I guess it's really I guess it's

716
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:51,540
really sticky like hella sticky so I scoop off sticky substance for my body

717
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,700
all the time I don't think you understand just how sticky this goop is this

718
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:03,100
goop because it could it possibly be more sticky this is this all of my blood

719
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:11,340
clots this goop is this goop is made of a thousand neutron stars this goop is my

720
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:16,860
god this goop is a neutron star that has been that has been ejaculated all over

721
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:25,140
into the stars to drink the pink goop starts a race war

722
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:33,420
well really gets around well I don't mind being plagiarized in various

723
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,180
different ways by me wait who who is that who is being plagiarized Jimmy

724
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:46,260
neutron oh the boy Jesus himself I I know I know exactly what to do but I don't

725
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:53,780
want to tell you because I feel like I'd be cheating fucking okay I remember yeah

726
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,740
this took this took me this puzzle took me a long fucking time I think I actually

727
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:05,020
I think I had to look up like one step of it I I didn't sign up to be fucking

728
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:12,540
Sherlock Holmes all right dude this is what it takes this is what it takes to

729
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:17,180
be a frog a frog in bug marks you have to be you have to be clever as well as

730
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:22,620
dexterous okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so you got the can there's a

731
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,660
machine and they don't remember if there's any there's a hole in the wall

732
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,380
there's the goop yeah there's the goop there's the hole in the wall there's the

733
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:35,100
machine you can't scoop the goop you can't scoop the goop munchy because it's

734
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,060
too sticky let's see what's on the machine again the machine consists of a

735
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:41,380
spigot aimed at a flat platform a handwritten sheet of paper has been

736
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:49,500
hastily taped over the base of the platform spigot and you see if I can

737
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:59,740
look at the platform yeah the machine oh same that really boils there's a

738
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:07,540
spigot there's the paper it's been taped on the platform and I guess that's it I

739
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:12,900
guess that's it for the machine it's just those two things you rip the note

740
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,260
off leaving a fluttering piece of electrical tape behind and revealing

741
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:27,940
hey all right I knew to facing public property will get me somewhere oh fuck

742
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:35,180
I'm retarded you are but that's just odd that's just autism for you yeah I mean

743
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,620
you know what is the questions of the day what of the control panel is rendered

744
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:42,980
unusual by the sticky pink goop you see a row of what look like radio preset

745
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:47,020
buttons all but two of which are stuck there's also a big red lever none of

746
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:53,180
these are legibly labeled okay so you got two buttons and a lever the machine

747
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:57,500
the machine where is dispensing mom's specialty the voice says pink goop

748
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,660
streams out of the faucets splashing against the flat platform and getting

749
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,580
everywhere a couple drops land in your mouth and you recognize the flavor bacon

750
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:09,020
milkshake oh my god atmospheric anomaly detected a different voice says a

751
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:12,500
wearing sound ensues and the bulk of the goop is sucked into invisible vents

752
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,580
leaving just enough goop floating around to be gross and annoying atmosphere

753
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:22,500
purified the voice says triumphantly okay okay so that good that goop is

754
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:28,380
floating meaning it's not stuck to the surfaces meaning oh I want that goop I

755
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,700
want that goop I want that you can't oh you can't get a meaningful amount just

756
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:38,180
by collecting loose goop fuck shit I fuck I thought that was it I thought we

757
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:44,180
okay well you know what okay well I think okay you know you you gotta get you

758
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,060
gotta get it to shoot into the can you just gotta squirt it right into the can

759
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:56,300
all right wait it came out of the faucet does that mean the spigot

760
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:13,220
you platform platform so hasty you place the can below the spigot okay yeah okay

761
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:21,100
here we go here we go it mostly gets everywhere but the coffee can does end

762
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,540
up filled you grab the can atmospheric anomaly detected the vents do their

763
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:30,980
ineffectual thing atmosphere purified so that's all I want I'm at mystery to

792
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,420
baby then how will I currency survive how is this how is the system of

793
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,340
government gonna fucking hold up it's a bigger baby get some bigger did a big

794
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:37,180
old daddy yeah dads dads grow linearly dads grow linearly babies grow

795
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:41,380
exponentially in the fullness of time a baby's eclipse there eclipse their dads

796
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:45,620
and bigness this is the issue with all the Roman Empire now it's gonna fall to

797
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:50,460
the it's gonna lead to the fall of the big baby empire babies as emtotically

798
01:07:50,460 --> 01:08:00,380
approach infinite bigness you got to leave the hatch you got to leave the

799
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:10,780
hatch right you're done here I think go go to hatch okay cabin's quarters a

800
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:19,820
sleeping pod sits next to it okay I guess examine the sleeping pod no you

801
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:29,020
fucked it you fucked it you exame I think I think you did everything in the

802
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:34,100
other room well there was nothing else to do with like the control panel because

803
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,740
it just wouldn't let you do anything the sleeping pod looks like a bed with a

804
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,700
lid but you've got to assume it's got some sort of suspended animation

805
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:45,180
functionality I mean right there's a hole on the top next to a gauge reading

806
01:08:45,180 --> 01:09:00,260
empty that seems important okay all right use goop on hole you bring the can

807
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,260
close to the hole and the hole sucks the pink group right in the gate the nearby

808
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:19,940
gauge fills up your score has gone up by nine halves of a point so is it done I

809
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:26,460
is it ready I don't know is it ready try I don't know for any of us are ready for

810
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:33,940
for a parenthood true I don't know if we can all if we can't even be prepared for

811
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:37,580
the for the biggest boy the world's ever gonna see the biggest the biggest

812
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:42,060
responsibility the biggest adventure of all the biggest adventure of all child

813
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:51,980
rearing child child husbandry as it's known I wait try getting in the pod

814
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:59,020
Gert Gert in Bud you can't safely sleep until you're confident you return to

815
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:13,100
bug Mars by the end of the trip I think what what what does this blast game want

816
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,660
me to do and what does that to do with reuniting with my fucking son was was

817
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:22,100
there more to the pod or did you do everything with that I I think you did

818
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:27,460
me okay maybe you got to go fuck around maybe you got to go aft yeah yeah yeah

819
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,620
the sleeping pod looks like a bed with a lid yeah yeah yeah there's a hole in the

820
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:35,740
top next to a gauge reading full okay all right I guess I guess that's all there

821
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:44,300
is I think you should go to the ladder and go back to the control panel a command

822
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,140
the walls of the circular to meet at a point that must correspond to the curve

823
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:54,580
knows the hole a porthole a glowing display okay check the display because

824
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:58,740
you tried the control deck and it didn't do anything

825
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:15,980
no this no this is this is this is a this is a go to new destination then

826
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:23,780
have computer no no okay that's no good try root details again I feel like

827
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:31,860
something must have changed you did all the screen splits forth yeah alright go

828
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:46,940
to the control deck what look look control deck no no no no no no frog

829
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,740
fractions listen Ben not everyone could have studied how to make the perfect big

830
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:57,780
baby I was gonna mess up along the way but that's that that's just part of the

831
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,340
parenting process you know learning learning as you go learning as you go

832
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:07,140
you and the baby can learn together the control just imagine a big baby would

833
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:14,580
just fucking break all my bones immediately up on looking at it these are

834
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:24,820
definitely not frog joysticks there's got to be something you can do with these

835
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:34,820
you you fix the you fix the you got the goop you filled you filled yeah you'll

836
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:39,660
have to be more specific as to what you want to do with the controls okay okay

837
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:48,460
move them what do you got you have an an array of switches and a pair of joysticks

838
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:55,340
I don't know what do you do with what do you do with joysticks

839
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:16,940
what the fuck great great great I'm stumped I'm stumped wait look at the

840
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:23,380
porthole again I mean it didn't it didn't show anything before through the

841
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:27,580
porthole you can see the background of stars yeah the constellations are all

842
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:32,980
unfamiliar okay so that's no help

843
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:43,180
hmm I'm getting the sinking suspicion that everything we've done up to this

844
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:50,020
point has been a major waste of time yes like in Homestuck for example like in

845
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:57,540
Homestuck just like the classic panel the classic panel retcon later in a

846
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:02,260
month in one of it I don't know in one of the moves that was maybe not the worst

847
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:08,060
in one of the retcons that was maybe not the worst in Homestuck

848
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:21,100
the battle the bat the bit wait you want to just look up what to do yeah I

849
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:27,380
have no idea what the fucks going on okay okay here I'll do it

850

853
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:07,140
yeah yeah yeah yeah there's yeah there's something there's something else to do

854
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,620
in the machine room and there's something else to do in the captain's

855
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:17,900
quarters too alright alright alright okay I won't I won't be more specific than

856

I hate myself for and I hate everything to do with and I wish I was dead it's a

876
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,620
manual for the navigation computer in the computer man module after leaping

877
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,420
through you feel confident you understand how to use the interface well and if

888
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,500
to be spent going through bug customs luckily you can sleep through most of it

1270
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:16,440
yeah here's here's how here's when I knew here's when I knew that Dr. Wolf was

1271
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:22,840
not a good person I met him at fucking Brony con at the first Brony con I went

1272
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:29,200
to I we were like making small talk or something and and he was like and he was

1273
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:35,160
like you know sitting all cross-legged and being all like yeah and and he said

1274
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:38,560
something like he was hungry like he wanted to get something to eat and I

1275
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:44,160
was like oh well there's a pretty good hotdog stand right across the the street

1276
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,680
like because we were right near the exits and I like pointed right out the door

1277
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:52,560
I was like there's a hotdog stand right over there and he was like I think I can

1278
01:59:52,560 --> 02:00:02,880
do a bit better than that and um I thought someone needs to kill this man

1279
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:19,040
nicknames doctor or dog oh good oh good 34 he's 34 and thank God oh okay okay

I I also have a I also have a Dr. Wolf story at that exact same Brony con I

1281
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:29,760
think yeah I think I could do a bit better than that

1282
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:38,200
it's so perfect okay okay okay I forget I think like like like when I first came

1283
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:48,320
up to you guys we were rough we we we we we we were riffin we had um we had a

1284
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:52,820
We had a good report. We got some rapport going.

1285
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:53,820
We were riffing.

1286
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:54,820
Yeah, yeah.

1287
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:56,820
We were riffing.

1288
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:58,820
We were jamming in the name of the Lord.

1289
02:00:58,820 --> 02:00:59,820
We were jamming.

1290
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:00,820
Yeah.

1291
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:07,820
And there was like a meme sort of, that I don't know how it occurred.

1292
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:12,820
Bottom right corner. Is telekinesis possible? Check out our science fiction map.

1293
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:16,820
Yeah, for a unicorn it is. For a unicorn it is.

1294
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:17,820
Oh, you.

1295
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:18,820
Anyway, anyway.

1296
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:24,820
Anyway, the point is I go up to Dr. Wolf and he's surrounded by his lesion of fans.

1297
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:25,820
And I ask him.

1298
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:26,820
His adoring fans.

1299
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:27,820
His adoring fans.

1300
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:28,820
His adoring fans.

1301
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:29,820
His adoring fan base.

1302
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:36,820
Rivaled only by KP's weird fucking sycophant horde.

1303
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:38,820
And I ask him two simple questions.

1304
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:41,820
Number one, did the banks kill JFK?

1305
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:46,820
Number two, did you kill Dryden horseshoes?

1306
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,820
Did you kill him?

1307
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:51,820
I've heard this, I think. Or at least I've heard the second part.

1308
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:56,820
Yeah, simple questions for a simple man.

1309
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:57,820
For a simple man.

1310
02:01:57,820 --> 02:02:02,820
And then like, he's like sitting down cross legged as you described.

1311
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:03,820
Yeah, yeah.

1312
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:04,820
And he looks up to me.

1313
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:09,820
Sitting down cross legged, looking at his laptop with his hand.

1314
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:10,820
Yeah, exactly.

1315
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:13,820
Cleaning to the side with his hand and his chin.

1316
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:18,820
With his hand and his chin, brow furrowed in concentration.

1317
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:21,820
And he looks up to me.

1318
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:24,820
I've never met Dryden horseshoes.

1319
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:28,820
I don't know anything about Dryden horseshoes.

1320
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:34,820
I mean, I know the name, but beyond that, no idea.

1321
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:39,820
Me thinks the lady doth protest too much.

1322
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:40,820
He fucking knows.

1323
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:41,820
He knew.

1324
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:43,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1325
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:47,820
And I tell that to Jesse later and he said that they've literally talked before.

1326
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:48,820
Oh my God.

1327
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:52,820
So Dr. Wolf lied to my fucking face.

1328
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:57,820
Really, really, really just...

1329
02:02:57,820 --> 02:02:58,820
Wow.

1330
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:02,820
You know, has it ever...

1331
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:06,820
You know, I don't think Digi's gonna mind me saying this here.

1332
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:09,820
Because literally nobody gives a shit anymore.

1333
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:16,820
But Digi said that one of his greatest regrets in his life and his career

1334
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:21,820
was fucking featuring that first Dr. Wolf Fluttershy video on Equestria Daily

1335
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:23,820
because it started the monster.

1336
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:26,820
It started the fucking monster that is Dr. Wolf.

1337
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:27,820
Like it's all Digi's fault.

1338
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:30,820
It's all Digi's fault that Dr. Wolf exists.

1339
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,820
And it makes him mad and it makes me mad.

1340
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:38,820
Dr. Wolf, fucking look at him.

1341
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:39,820
Just, hold on.

1342
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:40,820
Just look at this fucking guy.

1343
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:41,820
Wait, wait, wait.

1344
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:42,820
Go down.

1345
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:43,820
Go down.

1346
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:44,820
Art...

1347
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:45,820
Oh, artists.

1348
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:46,820
God.

1349
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:47,820
God damn.

1350
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:50,820
Let's see what they have to say about you.

1351
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,820
Oh, I'm listed as a fucking artist?

1352
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:53,820
Bulls fucking shit.

1353
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:54,820
Never.

1354
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:55,820
I never drew anything.

1355
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:58,820
I never drew anything for that piece of shit.

1356
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:03,820
That guy, that guy fucking scammed his artists and didn't fucking pay them shit.

1357
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:04,820
He could afford.

1358
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:08,820
He could afford to pay them fairly and he never fucking did.

1359
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:13,820
I heard it from multiple sources that the dude just fucking scammed his artists

1360
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:17,820
and tried to get by paying them next to nothing even though.

1361
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:19,820
He has a fucking real job.

1362
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:21,820
He has a fucking real job.

1363
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,820
He's an accountant.

1364
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:32,820
He's making an actual salary and yet he can't fucking afford to take a little bit out of

1365
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:34,820
his fucking rank-eating Patreon.

1366
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:38,820
His Patreon, which is a drop in the fucking bucket to his actual salary,

1367
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:41,820
and just pay his fucking artists.

1368
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:42,820
Fuck that guy.

1369
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:46,820
Believe this innocent face.

1370
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,820
Could this face do any wrong, Ben?

1371
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:53,820
Could this face do any wrong?

1372
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:54,820
I hate it, Munchie.

1373
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:55,820
I think not.

1374
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:56,820
I hate him.

1375
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:59,820
I came into this in good faith.

1376
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,820
I came into this in good faith.

1377
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:02,820
Oh yeah, Doctor Wolf.

1378
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:05,820
What a funny story about that.

1379
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:09,820
What a silly existence.

1380
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:11,820
But now I'm not laughing anymore, Munchie.

1381
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,820
Now I'm mad.

1382
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:13,820
Now I'm mad.

1383
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:14,820
I'm mad again.

1384
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:17,820
Do you like how your page is completely fucking barren?

1385
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:23,820
Good.

1386
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:24,820
Good.

1387
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:27,820
Hold on.

1388
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:29,820
This is the Rift Cafe wiki.

1389
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:32,820
I wish I wasn't on it at all.

1390
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:35,820
When is this going to be a T-Bap wiki?

1391
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,820
A whole wiki for T-Bap?

1392
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:38,820
There could have been, man.

1393
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:40,820
There fucking could have been a T-Bap wiki.

1394
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:41,820
Why didn't we do it?

1395
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:44,820
Why didn't we just break off from the fucking thing

1396
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,820
and just do our own pony thing?

1397
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:52,820
You just need to fucking hashtag magsurviveT-Bap.

1398
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:55,820
There's too many unleft questions.

1399
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:57,820
There's too many unleft questions.

1400
02:05:57,820 --> 02:06:01,820
There's too many plot threads unresolved.

1401
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:04,820
Every time, every single time, me or Nate brings up

1402
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:06,820
raise these bros.

1403
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:08,820
We both just get real quiet and sad

1404
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:12,820
because it never happened and we both wish

1405
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:15,820
that raise these bros had actually happened.

1406
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:18,820
But now it's too late and we don't want to do it anymore.

1407
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:20,820
We wish that back when we had the drive,

1408
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:23,820
we had fucking seen it through and made it happen.

1409
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:24,820
It's never too late.

1410
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:26,820
He happens to be a Mormon.

1411
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:28,820
He happens to be a Mormon.

1412
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:30,820
Shut the fuck up.

1413
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:33,820
Oh, his eldest niece is a brony.

1414
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:36,820
His eldest niece is a brony, Munchy.

1415
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:38,820
Her O.C.

1416
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:39,820
That is insane.

1417
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,820
Daffodilia.

1418
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:44,820
Doctor Wolf fell into the psychological...

1419
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:45,820
Wait, wait, wait.

1420
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,820
The psychological role of the brony fan

1421
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:50,820
without respecting it, expecting it at all.

1422
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,820
Even before he started a moment with Doctor Wolf,

1423
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:54,820
people called him the Psychologist of the Fan.

1424
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:56,820
I'm gonna fucking kill myself if I think about

1425
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:00,820
Doctor Wolf for one more second.

1426
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:02,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1427
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:05,820
Let's go to...

1428
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,820
It's not a full page.

1429
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:09,820
Eleora. Let's go to Eleora.

1430
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:12,820
The legendary Eleora.

1431
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:15,820
Girlfriend of the Cult of Personality.

1432
02:07:15,820 --> 02:07:17,820
What was his name?

1433
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:19,820
Toon Critic. It's Toon Critic's girlfriend.

1434
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:20,820
Toon Critic?

1435
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:23,820
Yeah. She's 31? What the fuck?

1436
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:25,820
How...

1437
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:26,820
What the fuck?

1438
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:29,820
How are these people literally like...

1439
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:31,820
I thought she was like 18.

1440
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:33,820
I thought she was like 18.

1441
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:35,820
Wait, how old is Toon Critic?

1442
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:37,820
She's 31?

1443
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:39,820
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1444
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,820
I mean...

1445
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:44,820
Hold on.

1446
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:46,820
24!

1447
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:48,820
He's 24!

1448
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:50,820
Whoa.

1449
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:53,820
Whoa.

1450
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:56,820
Is it... is it weird?

1451
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:59,820
Is it weird that I think that's fucked up?

1452
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:01,820
No. No.

1453
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:03,820
It's fucked up.

1454
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:05,820
Okay, good. Okay, good.

1455
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:07,820
Okay, good.

1456
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:09,820
I mean, it's certainly abnormal.

1457
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:13,820
I mean...

1458
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:16,820
Imagine calling yourself Toon Critic in earnest.

1459
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:18,820
Toon Critic Y2K.

1460
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:21,820
Toon Critic Y2K.

1461
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:23,820
Like, if that name...

1462
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:26,820
Like, that's literally the worst name I've ever heard.

1463
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:31,820
It is...

1464
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:33,820
Munchy...

1465
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:37,820
I mean, I make a lot of bold claims.

1466
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:39,820
I make a lot of bold statements.

1467
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:42,820
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

1468
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,820
Sometimes I go a little too far.

1469
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:49,820
But let me say to you, in complete earnestness.

1470
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:51,820
In complete...

1471
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:53,820
Yes, in anything.

1472
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:56,820
In complete and utter sincerity, with no hyperbole.

1473
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:06,820
The Toon Critic Y2K is the worst name.

1474
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:09,820
And the worst OC.

1475
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:11,820
The worst design.

1476
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:13,820
The worst human being.

1477
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:15,820
Oh my god.

1478
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:19,820
That has ever existed or ever will exist.

1479
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:21,820
You're stealing his fucking bones.

1480
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,820
What? What?

1481
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:25,820
You're stealing his bones again.

1482
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:27,820
You're gonna make silverware out of him.

1483
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:29,820
There's nothing good.

1484
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:31,820
Look at his... Look at him.

1485
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:33,820
Oh my god. Oh my god.

1486
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:35,820
Like, I don't have to say anything.

1487
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:37,820
I don't have to say anything.

1488
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:39,820
Just...

1489
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:41,820
Look.

1490
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:43,820
Just look and you'll understand.

1491
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:45,820
Even fucking...

1492
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:49,820
Ah, babes.

1493
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:51,820
Mere babes in the crib.

1494
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:53,820
We'll see what I'm talking about.

1495
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,820
Wait, wait.

1496
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,820
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, Munchy.

1497
02:09:57,820 --> 02:09:59,820
But there's more.

1498
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:01,820
There's more.

1499
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:03,820
His pony sonan has a name.

1500
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:05,820
Sketch Charmer.

1501
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:07,820
Or Toon Store.

1502
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:09,820
Toon Store!

1503
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:11,820
Toon Store!

1504
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:13,820
Oh my god. His name is Toon Storm.

1505
02:10:13,820 --> 02:10:15,820
Oh my god. His name is Toon Storm.

1506
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:17,820
Oh, no.

1507
02:10:17,820 --> 02:10:19,820
Oh, no.

1508
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:25,820
Munchy,

1509
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:27,820
everything I said about Toon Critic

1510
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,820
just a minute ago is absolutely true

1511
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:31,820
and yet I love him.

1512
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:33,820
I love him.

1513
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:35,820
I'm so glad.

1514
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:37,820
I'm so glad he's real.

1515
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:39,820
Can we... I haven't even...

1516
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:41,820
I haven't even gotten...

1517
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:43,820
I haven't even touched on the top hat and scarf.

1518
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:47,820
That's all I've been looking at.

1519
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:49,820
I mean...

1520
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:51,820
Oh god. Oh Jesus.

1521
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:53,820
The red...

1522
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:55,820
The red hair...

1523
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:57,820
The black hair with the red tips.

1524
02:10:57,820 --> 02:10:59,820
It's like fucking dementia raven way

1525
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:01,820
over here.

1526
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:03,820
What? Okay.

1527
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:05,820
I've never known...

1528
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:07,820
I mean, I've looked at this guy.

1529
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:09,820
I've seen this avatar so many times.

1530
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:11,820
I've never thought to question...

1531
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:13,820
What the fuck is with the stripes on his hooves?

1532
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:15,820
Not his hooves, his legs.

1533
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:17,820
What is with the fucking stripes?

1534
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:19,820
They're like...

1535
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:21,820
Is he wearing armbands?

1536
02:11:21,820 --> 02:11:23,820
They're like, oh, they're like whisk warmers.

1537
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:25,820
He's got to warm up.

1538
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:27,820
He's got to warm up to bring on the Toon Storm, bro.

1539
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:29,820
Toon Storm!

1540
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:33,820
That's...

1541
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:35,820
impeccable. Good job.

1542
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:37,820
Good job, Toon Critic Light 2K.

1543
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:39,820
This man...

1544
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:41,820
This man...

1545
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:47,820
He really ought to calm a man.

1546
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:49,820
This boy.

1547
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:51,820
He created this.

1548
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:53,820
He might even not even have created himself.

1549
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:55,820
He might have commissioned someone else to make it,

1550
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:57,820
for all we know.

1551
02:11:57,820 --> 02:11:59,820
He made this.

1552
02:11:59,820 --> 02:12:01,820
This image that we are beholding now.

1553
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:03,820
He looked at that, and he was like,

1554
02:12:03,820 --> 02:12:05,820
this is good.

1555
02:12:05,820 --> 02:12:07,820
This'll do.

1556
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:09,820
This is how I want...

1557
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:11,820
This will do nicely.

1558
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,820
This fits into my...

1559
02:12:13,820 --> 02:12:15,820
This fits into my master plan.

1560
02:12:15,820 --> 02:12:17,820
I agree with the direction this is taking.

1561
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:21,820
Everything I want to say,

1562
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:23,820
this image says,

1563
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:25,820
will run with it.

1564
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:27,820
I concur, good sir.

1565
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:29,820
I believe in the message of this image.

1566
02:12:29,820 --> 02:12:31,820
I believe in it.

1567
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:33,820
Oh god.

1568
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:35,820
Oh my fucking god.

1569
02:12:35,820 --> 02:12:37,820
I can't believe it.

1570
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:39,820
I can't believe it.

1571
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:41,820
He's just red and black.

1572
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:43,820
He's just red and black.

1573
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:49,820
He's all different shades of red.

1574
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:53,820
He's all different shades of red.

1575
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,820
Okay, okay, okay.

1576
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:57,820
Toon Storm is good.

1577
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:59,820
But the fact that he fancies himself

1578
02:12:59,820 --> 02:13:01,820
a charmer.

1579
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:03,820
He fancies himself a charmer.

1580
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:05,820
To the point where he would call himself

1581
02:13:05,820 --> 02:13:07,820
a sketch charmer.

1582
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:11,820
There's just...

1583
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,820
There's just no end.

1584
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:15,820
There's no end to what I could say

1585
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:17,820
about this guy.

1586
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:19,820
Oh, the bands on his legs are not arm bands

1587
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:21,820
as previously blue pair of stripes.

1588
02:13:21,820 --> 02:13:23,820
Oh, thank god.

1589
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:25,820
He looks a little trivia.

1590
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:27,820
He's actually called Flame Amigo.

1591
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:29,820
Oh my god, Flame Amigo.

1592
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:31,820
He must have changed his name.

1593
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:33,820
He must have thought he was muscling in

1594
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:35,820
on Josh Scorcher's territory.

1595
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,820
Well, okay, okay.

1596
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:39,820
Josh, let's not even...

1597
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:41,820
Let's not bring up the fucking

1598
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,820
the fucking nightmare that is

1599
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,820
Josh Scorcher.

1600
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:47,820
I like the fact that he just put

1601
02:13:47,820 --> 02:13:49,820
his phone number area code

1602
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:51,820
at the end of his fucking

1603
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:53,820
Flame Amigo.

1604
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:55,820
I think that's what it is.

1605
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:57,820
It has to be.

1606
02:13:57,820 --> 02:13:59,820
There's no...

1607
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:01,820
You're just not going to throw around

1608
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:03,820
the number 619.

1609
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:05,820
You're not going to do that.

1610
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:07,820
Is that an area code? I don't know.

1611
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:09,820
That's my area code.

1612
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:11,820
Maybe your neighbors.

1613
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:13,820
Maybe I am him.

1614
02:14:13,820 --> 02:14:15,820
Maybe it's like a doctor...

1615
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:17,820
A doctor wolf, a doctor hide

1616
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:19,820
scenario.

1617
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:21,820
Toon Critic has been shipped with many others

1618
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:23,820
besides Ellie, including Golden Fox

1619
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,820
and Keyframe.

1620
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:27,820
Oh, Toon broke

1621
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:29,820
up with Ellie sometime in late

1622
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:31,820
2015. Oh man, I'm way behind.

1623
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:33,820
I'm way behind on the Pony Lore.

1624
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:35,820
Holy fuck. Okay, okay, okay.

1625
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,820
So what I'm gathering from this is that

1626
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:39,820
they were shipped together because that's

1627
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:41,820
how humans work, I suppose.

1628
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:43,820
Wait, was in a...

1629
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,820
Was in a cannon...

1630
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:47,820
This is...

1631
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:49,820
This bullet point is blurring the line

1632
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:51,820
of fantasy and reality so hard for me.

1633
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:53,820
It's so meta

1634
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:55,820
that I can't even wrap my puny little

1635
02:14:55,820 --> 02:14:57,820
P-brain around it.

1636
02:14:57,820 --> 02:14:59,820
Okay, hold on.

1637
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,820
I think by in a cannon

1638
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:03,820
ship they just mean that they were fucking dating

1639
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:05,820
these fucking bastards.

1640
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:07,820
I can't believe she's 31.

1641
02:15:07,820 --> 02:15:09,820
Alright, okay.

1642
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:11,820
Excellent.

1643
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:13,820
You know, I think past now

1644
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:15,820
she'll ask my phone number.

1645
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:17,820
No way. Maybe that's why he was

1646
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:19,820
flame-flame-amigo-619.

1647
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:21,820
Maybe he put your

1648
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:23,820
area code. Yeah, maybe.

1649
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:25,820
Look, there's nothing.

1650
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:27,820
There's nothing. There's literally nothing.

1651
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:29,820
There's nothing.

1652
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:31,820
Oh, past analysis.

1653
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:33,820
Why?

1654
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:35,820
I don't know. Was he not good enough

1655
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:37,820
for you people?

1656
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,820
Did he not come up with snuff?

1657
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:41,820
Yeah, I mean

1658
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:43,820
for fuck's sake.

1659
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:45,820
You know what it is. Come on. You know, here's

1660
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:47,820
the fucking gets me.

1661
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:49,820
Like, the amount

1662
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:51,820
of information on your fucking

1663
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:53,820
rift cafe wiki entry

1664
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:55,820
is like, it has nothing

1665
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:57,820
to do with

1666
02:15:57,820 --> 02:15:59,820
your fucking product.

1667
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:01,820
Like, it's just all about how active

1668
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:03,820
in the community you are.

1669
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:05,820
Like, this is what,

1670
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:07,820
the rift cafe does not exist

1671
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:09,820
for any purpose.

1672
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:11,820
Except for the fucking

1673
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:13,820
rifters, for the rifters

1674
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:15,820
who want to be rifters, who just fucking

1675
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:17,820
circle jerk themselves over

1676
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,820
just how fucking important in their own

1677
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:21,820
gay little community they are.

1678
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:23,820
Oh, god. Oh, nothing makes me

1679
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:25,820
nothing makes me matter.

1680
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:27,820
Nothing makes me matter in the pony fucking days.

1681
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:29,820
Jesus Christ, Munchy. Munchy, god.

1682
02:16:29,820 --> 02:16:31,820
I'm so fucking, I'm so fucking glad.

1683
02:16:31,820 --> 02:16:33,820
I'm so fucking glad I escaped

1684
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:35,820
Munchy. I'm so, I

1685
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:37,820
can't believe it. I didn't, they didn't

1686
02:16:37,820 --> 02:16:39,820
all make it out. We have to go back.

1687
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:41,820
No, no, never.

1688
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:43,820
We have to go back. We have to go back.

1689
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,820
We have to be like,

1690
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:47,820
we have to be like,

1691
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:49,820
like Plato's allegory of the cave.

1692
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:51,820
You know what I'm saying? No.

1693
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:53,820
Like, we, yes.

1694
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:55,820
We found out there's like an entire other

1695
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:57,820
world outside of this little pond.

1696
02:16:57,820 --> 02:16:59,820
Yeah, we went, they're not going to believe us.

1697
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:01,820
No, like, we're gonna,

1698
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:03,820
we're gonna, we're gonna go back

1699
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:05,820
in there and like, and they're just watching,

1700
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:07,820
they're just watching like,

1701
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:09,820
they're little fucking shadow ponies,

1702
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:11,820
and there's like, there's like,

1703
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,820
there's like, you know, you can make like,

1704
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:15,820
YouTube videos that aren't like,

1705
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:17,820
a fucking review of

1706
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:19,820
my little pony with your avatar

1707
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:21,820
in the corner and they'd be like,

1708
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:23,820
well, well, well,

1709
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:25,820
well, well, well, where's

1710
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:27,820
my birthday cake?

1711
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:29,820
Well, well,

1712
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:31,820
just stop me. I just don't believe

1713
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:33,820
you. I just don't.

1714
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:35,820
They're just gonna like, they're just gonna like,

1715
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:37,820
confer amongst themselves and like,

1716
02:17:37,820 --> 02:17:39,820
no, I think, I think it's better.

1717
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:41,820
I think it's better the way we were doing it.

1718
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:43,820
I think we're really, I think we're really getting

1719
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:45,820
some good results.

1720
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:47,820
Oh, thanks for your input.

1721
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:49,820
She hasn't known

1722
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:51,820
a plea. She notably has

1723
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:53,820
a slight hypocrisy streak.

1724
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:55,820
She has known to despise

1725
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:57,820
puns will quite frequently make them

1726
02:17:57,820 --> 02:17:59,820
a slight

1727
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:01,820
hypocrisy streak.

1728
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:05,820
I'm gonna fucking kill whoever wrote this.

1729
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:07,820
I'm gonna fucking murder them.

1730
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:09,820
I hate...

1731
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:11,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1732
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:13,820
She is, she...

1733
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:15,820
She also

1734
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:17,820
tries to stay as fair as possible

1735
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:19,820
in all things and is not above

1736
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:21,820
listening to criticism. She also is

1737
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:23,820
well aware of how attractive slash

1738
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:25,820
cute she is and will occasionally use

1739
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:27,820
this to her advantage. What the fuck?

1740
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:29,820
What is this?

1741
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:31,820
God, what is this

1742
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:33,820
based on? What is it? It's fucking

1743
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:35,820
it's, it's

1744
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:37,820
fucking turtles all the way down.

1745
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:39,820
It's all the way down. Only the turtle

1746
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:41,820
in this metaphor, the turtle is

1747
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:43,820
like some made up bullshit that doesn't even exist.

1748
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:45,820
Mm-hmm.

1749
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:47,820
That's...

1750
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:49,820
Is this relevant?

1751
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:51,820
Is this relevant to anyone?

1752
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,820
Ben, we're looking through world

1753
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:57,820
through our rear view.

1754
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:01,820
Was this ever relevant?

1755
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:03,820
I've, I've...

1756
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:05,820
I have no clue.

1757
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:07,820
I want, I want analysis

1758
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:09,820
anarchy to be like a lecturer.

1759
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:11,820
Oh my god, I know what I have to do.

1760
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:13,820
A lecture on analysis anarchy?

1761
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:15,820
Yes, we fucking...

1762
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:17,820
Dude, I've got, I've got, I'm so

1763
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:19,820
I'm so fucking sad.

1764
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:21,820
I'm so fucking sad that I didn't do a second lecture

1765
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,820
at Radcon 2. I should have just

1766
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:25,820
on Tails Get Strolled. I should have just

1767
02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:27,820
fucking bit the bullet and done Tails Get Strolled.

1768
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:29,820
It would have been great. Everyone would have loved me.

1769
02:19:29,820 --> 02:19:31,820
We just need more lectures.

1770
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:33,820
We just, and chief among them needs to be

1771
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:35,820
TF2 analysis anarchy.

1772
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:37,820
Yeah, we need...

1773
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:39,820
I'm very fucking invested in the narrative

1774
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:40,820
of that.

1775
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:41,820
Of analysis anarchy?

1776
02:19:41,820 --> 02:19:42,820
Yeah.

1777
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:43,820
Are you gonna...

1778
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:45,820
Are you gonna watch them? Are you gonna watch

1779
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:47,820
all 30 episodes?

1780
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:49,820
I've watched like half of them

1781
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:51,820
before just like, just thinking like

1782
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:53,820
oh my, my, I'm going to

1783
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:55,820
I'm going to lose function of my body.

1784
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:57,820
My body, my soul

1785
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,820
I'm going to be able to control my body anymore.

1786
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:01,820
Okay, I want you, I want you to...

1787
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:03,820
Wait, wait, wait, first I want you to appreciate,

1788
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:05,820
I want you to appreciate, ironically

1789
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:07,820
despite her character's very forward

1790
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:09,820
and aggressive demeanor,

1791
02:20:09,820 --> 02:20:11,820
Eliora is fairly shy and withdrawn

1792
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:13,820
in real life. Ironically.

1793
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:15,820
Ironically.

1794
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:17,820
Ironically.

1795
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:18,820
Ironically.

1796
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:19,820
Oh my god.

1797
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:20,820
Yeah, that's irony for you.

1798
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:21,820
Okay, okay, okay.

1799
02:20:21,820 --> 02:20:22,820
Okay, okay.

1800
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:23,820
Imagine.

1801
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:25,820
I'm, I'm, I'm...

1802
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:27,820
This is long after the pony days.

1803
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:29,820
I'm thinking about TF2

1804
02:20:29,820 --> 02:20:31,820
and I think, oh man,

1805
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:33,820
I wonder if there's any like, TF2 analysis

1806
02:20:33,820 --> 02:20:34,820
I could watch, you know?

1807
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:36,820
I really, really get in the meat and bones of this game.

1808
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:38,820
Yeah, I miss, I miss, you know,

1809
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:39,820
I'm so behind on the ponies.

1810
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:41,820
I need pony, I need the, the,

1811
02:20:41,820 --> 02:20:43,820
I need to be brought up to speed on the ponies

1812
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:46,820
by watching just hours and hours

1813
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:48,820
of analysis.

1814
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:50,820
I need to watch 45 minute analyses

1815
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:52,820
of 20 minute episodes.

1816
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:54,820
Yeah, I just want, I just want

1817
02:20:54,820 --> 02:20:57,820
to watch some, some analysis of, of, of TF2.

1818
02:20:57,820 --> 02:21:00,820
So let me type in to, to, to YouTube.

1819
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:03,820
TF2 analysis, to, to get some reviews

1820
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,820
or urges, just, you know, whatever

1821
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:07,820
analysis of the video game, TF2.

1822
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:08,820
Oh my god.

1823
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:10,820
And then the first thing comes up.

1824
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:12,820
Thumbnail, phantom horn.

1825
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:13,820
No.

1826
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:14,820
As a soldier.

1827
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:15,820
My...

1828
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:16,820
No.

1829
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:18,820
Analysis anarchy, TF2.

1830
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:19,820
No.

1831
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:21,820
I click on it and I have no idea

1832
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:23,820
what the fuck is going on.

1833
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:25,820
Ugh.

1834
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:27,820
Jesus Christ.

1835
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:29,820
I'm so sad.

1836
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:31,820
I'm so fucking sad

1837
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:33,820
that my name is fucking attached to it.

1838
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:35,820
I fucking, I fucking,

1839
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:37,820
when that video came out

1840
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:39,820
and I saw what I had done,

1841
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:41,820
I fucking lost my shit.

1842
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:43,820
It was like, it might be

1843
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:45,820
like the worst I've ever felt about anything

1844
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:47,820
in my entire life.

1845
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:48,820
Jesus Christ.

1846
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:49,820
It's just like, yeah.

1847
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:51,820
When I saw, when I saw the product

1848
02:21:51,820 --> 02:21:53,820
that I had fucking hitched my wagon to,

1849
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:54,820
I was like,

1850
02:21:54,820 --> 02:21:56,820
oh god, I've made a terrible mistake.

1851
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:58,820
I've made a terrible mistake

1852
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:00,820
and I hate myself.

1853
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:01,820
But hey,

1854
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:03,820
that's the way the cookie comes.

1855
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:05,820
The, the entire like,

1856
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:07,820
that like, just the idea

1857
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,820
of that series is fucking

1858
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:10,820
insane.

1859
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:12,820
Like, it's most incoherent

1860
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:13,820
fucking...

1861
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:14,820
It's...

1862
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:15,820
Okay, okay, okay.

1863
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:17,820
It's like, it's like someone just,

1864
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:19,820
it's like some, some idiot,

1865
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:21,820
stupid people were talking

1866
02:22:21,820 --> 02:22:22,820
and like,

1867
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:23,820
two of them said,

1868
02:22:23,820 --> 02:22:25,820
one of them said like two things

1869
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,820
next to each other

1870
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:28,820
and like,

1871
02:22:28,820 --> 02:22:29,820
someone else

1872
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:31,820
laughed about it.

1873
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:33,820
And then they all unanimously decided like,

1874
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:34,820
that is a great idea.

1875
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:35,820
We should fucking

1876
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:37,820
get right on it.

1877
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:38,820
And then they just did.

1878
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:40,820
And then they just did.

1879
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:41,820
And then they were like,

1880
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:43,820
this retarded idea that we had,

1881
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:45,820
this retarded thing that someone said,

1882
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:46,820
let's fucking just,

1883
02:22:46,820 --> 02:22:48,820
let's fucking make it happen

1884
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:49,820
as necessary.

1885
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:51,820
Let's fucking pool our fucking shitty

1886
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:52,820
Patreon money

1887
02:22:52,820 --> 02:22:54,820
and pay some fucking

1888
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:55,820
hack

1889
02:22:55,820 --> 02:22:56,820
to make it.

1890
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:57,820
And then,

1891
02:22:57,820 --> 02:22:59,820
even though it sucks,

1892
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:00,820
let's keep making it.

1893
02:23:00,820 --> 02:23:01,820
Because,

1894
02:23:01,820 --> 02:23:02,820
I don't know,

1895
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:04,820
what else are we gonna do?

1896
02:23:04,820 --> 02:23:05,820
Oh god.

1897
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:07,820
It's, it's, it's,

1898
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:08,820
okay, it's like,

1899
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:10,820
it's like a fan fiction

1900
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:12,820
of these, these avatars,

1901
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:14,820
these pony sonas.

1902
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:15,820
Oh yeah, that's right.

1903
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:16,820
These pony sonas.

1904
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:18,820
It's crossover fan fiction

1905
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:20,820
of O.C.'s,

1906
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:23,820
of a whole other fucking franchise.

1907
02:23:23,820 --> 02:23:24,820
Yeah.

1908
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:26,820
Inside

1909
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:27,820
of a,

1910
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:29,820
a modified version

1911
02:23:29,820 --> 02:23:31,820
of the Team Fortress 2

1912
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:33,820
map coal town,

1913
02:23:33,820 --> 02:23:35,820
for some reason,

1914
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:37,820
these ponies have formed a

1915
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:39,820
Team Fortress 2 team,

1916
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:40,820
MVM,

1917
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:42,820
Team Fortress 2 team.

1918
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:44,820
And during the fight with robots,

1919
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:46,820
they, they, they engage

1920
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:48,820
in, in relationship scuffles.

1921
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:49,820
One of which.

1922
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:51,820
Scuffles!

1923
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:53,820
One, the, the, the main focus of,

1924
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:56,820
and, and, and one, one includes

1925
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:58,820
the, the relationship of Joss Scorcher

1926
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:00,820
and Ink Rose,

1927
02:24:00,820 --> 02:24:02,820
uh, Ink Rose being 16,

1928
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:04,820
and J, I, I believe at least,

1929
02:24:04,820 --> 02:24:06,820
and, and Joss Scorcher being like

1930
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:07,820
28, right?

1931
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:09,820
I think he was like 22.

1932
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:11,820
Okay.

1933
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:13,820
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's better.

1934
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:14,820
Yeah.

1935
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:15,820
You know, in hindsight,

1936
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:17,820
I got really mad about like the age

1937
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:19,820
thing in hindsight.

1938
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:21,820
I wish I hadn't cause like who gives

1939
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:22,820
a shit.

1940
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:24,820
I was, I was really just mad that I,

1941
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:26,820
they had made this terrible video and

1942
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,820
I hated it.

1943
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:29,820
That's, that was my real problem.

1944
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:30,820
Um, yeah.

1945
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:32,820
Um, if I, if I,

1946
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:36,820
put me in a room,

1947
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:38,820
put me in a room

1948
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:39,820
with a gun

1949
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:41,820
and just one bullet,

1950
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:44,820
and then put in front of me

1951
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:46,820
Dr. Wolf,

1952
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:48,820
Joss Scorcher,

1953
02:24:48,820 --> 02:24:50,820
and Digi Bro.

1954
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:53,820
And, and, and, and it'll be the most

1955
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:55,820
difficult decision of my life,

1956
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:57,820
the most difficult decision I've ever

1957
02:24:57,820 --> 02:24:58,820
had to make.

1958
02:24:58,820 --> 02:24:59,820
Um,

1959
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:01,820
but someone's going to die.

1960
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:03,820
Do, do you like

1961
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:05,820
that Digi has

1962
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:07,820
barely anything on his

1963
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:09,820
fucking profile?

1964
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:11,820
Like, like, barely anything.

1965
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:13,820
Oh, on the, on the wiki?

1966
02:25:13,820 --> 02:25:14,820
Yeah.

1967
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:17,820
What?

1968
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,820
Look.

1969
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:19,820
Even though he fucking,

1970
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:21,820
he fucking made

1971
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:23,820
like a backstory and shit.

1972
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:25,820
Like he has, like he has,

1973
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:27,820
he has his info out there,

1974
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:28,820
his fucking character.

1975
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:29,820
His character had a backstory.

1976
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:30,820
Will no one create

1977
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:32,820
MOP analysis videos.

1978
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:34,820
Uh, uh, upload schedule none.

1979
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:38,820
Oh my god, that's fanart by the

1980
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:39,820
Burning Donut.

1981
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:41,820
I fucking hate the Burning Donut.

1982
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:42,820
I hate that guy.

1983
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:43,820
Why do you hate the Burning Donut?

1984
02:25:43,820 --> 02:25:44,820
Who's that?

1985
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:46,820
He's this piece of absolute ass.

1986
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:48,820
Oh my god,

1987
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:49,820
the fucking Burning Donut.

1988
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:51,820
See, Monchi,

1989
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:53,820
let, let me, let me go,

1990
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:55,820
let me take this opportunity to go on a

1991
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:57,820
bizarre and pointless tangent about

1992
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,820
my feelings for a minute.

1993
02:25:58,820 --> 02:26:00,820
Oh my fucking god.

1994
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:02,820
Yeah, alright.

1995
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:04,820
See, see,

1996
02:26:04,820 --> 02:26:06,820
yeah.

1997
02:26:06,820 --> 02:26:08,820
Yeah.

1998
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:10,820
I mean,

1999
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:12,820
there's a lot, there's a lot going on here.

2000
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:14,820
Um, the,

2001
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:15,820
see, alright.

2002
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:17,820
I couldn't, I couldn't draw that well for a

2003
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:18,820
long time.

2004
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,820
I could like sort of draw a little bit,

2005
02:26:19,820 --> 02:26:20,820
like my whole life.

2006
02:26:20,820 --> 02:26:21,820
Um,

2007
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:22,820
but I'm a,

2008
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,820
not to toot my own horn,

2009
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:25,820
but I'm a real smart guy.

2010
02:26:25,820 --> 02:26:27,820
I'm the smartest guy in the fucking universe.

2011
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,820
I'm literally the smartest person who ever lived.

2012
02:26:29,820 --> 02:26:30,820
Yeah, sure, of course.

2013
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:31,820
And that's, that's true.

2014
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:32,820
That's God's honest truth.

2015
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:34,820
And um,

2016
02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:35,820
uh,

2017
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:37,820
and I fucking,

2018
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:39,820
and I learned and I learned how to draw

2019
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:41,820
and I think I did it

2020
02:26:41,820 --> 02:26:43,820
because I'm really smart.

2021
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:45,820
Like I think that the fact that I'm fucking smart

2022
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:47,820
had something to do with my ability

2023
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:49,820
to fucking become capable

2024
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:51,820
of producing

2025
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:53,820
grave and images in defiance

2026
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:55,820
of, in defiance of God's law.

2027
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:57,820
Um, anyway,

2028
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:59,820
so all that, that being said,

2029
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:01,820
when I meet someone who can kind of draw,

2030
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:03,820
but who's like

2031
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:05,820
fucking stupid, it like baffles me.

2032
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:07,820
Like, I can't understand

2033
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:09,820
how someone can be stupid

2034
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:11,820
and also like,

2035
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:13,820
can be like a,

2036
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:15,820
like a competent artist.

2037
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:17,820
And the Burning Donut is, is one of these people,

2038
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:19,820
like he's so dumb,

2039
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:21,820
like he's fucking incoherent.

2040
02:27:21,820 --> 02:27:23,820
He's, he's, he's like,

2041
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:25,820
I've talked to him once or twice and he just has no fucking clue

2042
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:27,820
what he's doing at any given time.

2043
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:29,820
And yet, and yet he produces

2044
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:31,820
on a somewhat regular schedule

2045
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:33,820
some pretty, some pretty okay,

2046
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:35,820
some more or less competent

2047
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:37,820
fucking sexy

2048
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:39,820
Anthropony pinups.

2049
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:41,820
I mean, I mean,

2050
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:43,820
look at this picture of Trixie right here.

2051
02:27:43,820 --> 02:27:45,820
Okay, like the anatomy

2052
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:47,820
is competent, the figure is fine,

2053
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:49,820
um, the lighting is inept,

2054
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:51,820
the lighting is inept because she should be

2055
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:53,820
illuminated by her sparkles and yet she's

2056
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:55,820
weirdly in shadow, so like it kind of

2057
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,820
sucks, but like whatever.

2058
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:59,820
Um, I don't know, and he's just

2059
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:01,820
anyway, anyway, I've talked to this guy,

2060
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:03,820
this, this guy contacted me one time

2061
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:05,820
and he asked me like

2062
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:07,820
Ben, how do I

2063
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:09,820
fucking make my Patreon

2064
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:11,820
succeed? And I was like

2065
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:13,820
well, let me have a look at your Patreon

2066
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:15,820
and I looked at it and it was like

2067
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:17,820
this wall of text

2068
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:19,820
with no, there was, it was like

2069
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:21,820
it was like a, it was like no punctuation,

2070
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:23,820
it was like misspelled, it was like a piece of shit,

2071
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:25,820
it had, it was just sort of this fucking ramble.

2072
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:27,820
It was just this pointless ramble

2073
02:28:27,820 --> 02:28:29,820
about how bad, about how much he wants

2074
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:31,820
to make art. And I was like

2075
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,820
listen guy, listen guy,

2076
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:35,820
what you need to do, like this is

2077
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:37,820
aimless, like you need to like offer awards,

2078
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:39,820
you know, you need to like,

2079
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:41,820
you need to like say in your Patreon

2080
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:43,820
like what you're actually doing, because his

2081
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:45,820
Patreon was like, pledge to my Patreon

2082
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:47,820
and if I make,

2083
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:49,820
if I hit like $500 a month,

2084
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:51,820
then maybe

2085
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:53,820
I'll start drawing a comic.

2086
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:55,820
And I was like

2087
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:57,820
listen you, you stupid bastard,

2088
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:59,820
like you gotta just start doing it

2089
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:01,820
and be like, here I'm doing this

2090
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:03,820

02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:05,820
and wanna support it, pledge to my Patreon.

2092
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:07,820
You can't be like, if I make money

2093
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:09,820
then I'll start doing a thing

2094
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:11,820
because nobody is gonna want

2095
02:29:11,820 --> 02:29:13,820
to support you. And he just

2096
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:15,820
fucking, like I told him all that

2097
02:29:15,820 --> 02:29:17,820
and I gave him my advice and he was like thanks

2098
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,820
and then he went and like didn't listen to any of it.

2099
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:21,820
He like, he cleaned up the

2100
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:23,820
text on his Patreon but he didn't like

2101
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:25,820
he didn't like actually fix any of the problems.

2102
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:27,820
His fucking

2103
02:29:27,820 --> 02:29:29,820
his fucking reward, like his highest reward

2104
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:31,820
tier is like $50 a month or something

2105
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:33,820
and if you pledge $50 a month it's like

2106
02:29:33,820 --> 02:29:35,820
you will literally become a part

2107
02:29:35,820 --> 02:29:37,820
of the creative process of making my

2108
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:39,820
comic. So it's basically like

2109
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:41,820
you'll write my comic for me.

2110
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:43,820
Like, is what it is.

2111
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:45,820
Anyway, I don't know.

2112
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:47,820
Sorry, that was a big, that was a big pointless

2113
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:49,820
aggression but I just think the burning donut

2114
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:51,820
he just pisses me off especially

2115
02:29:51,820 --> 02:29:53,820
and he just represents a lot of what I think

2116
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:55,820
is the worst fucking instincts

2117
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:57,820
and a lot of lazy, shiftless artists out

2118
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,820
there. And the worst fucking

2119
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:01,820
part is that he makes like $50 a month

2120
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:03,820
on Patreon. I don't fucking know why.

2121
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:05,820
I guess it's because he makes fucking pony

2122
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:07,820
pinups for fucking KFC's

2123
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:09,820
sex sluts to jack their little

2124
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:11,820
fucking KFC. Their little dicks too.

2125
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:13,820
Listening to

2126
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:15,820
suicidal tendencies

2127
02:30:15,820 --> 02:30:17,820
reading

2128
02:30:17,820 --> 02:30:19,820
watching Kill La Kill

2129
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,820
playing no systems

2130
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:23,820
eating whatever

2131
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:25,820
I can afford on food stamps

2132
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:27,820
drinking NOS

2133
02:30:27,820 --> 02:30:29,820
I don't even know what NOS is. Is it a beverage?

2134
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:31,820
Oh, okay.

2135
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,820
The idea of listening to

2136
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:35,820
suicidal tendencies

2137
02:30:35,820 --> 02:30:37,820
and watching Kill La Kill

2138
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:39,820
and eating whatever I can afford

2139
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:41,820
on food stamps

2140
02:30:41,820 --> 02:30:43,820
I really think

2141
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:45,820
this guy

2142
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:47,820
is the next step of human evolution

2143
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:49,820
evolution.

2144
02:30:49,820 --> 02:30:51,820
This is what I want us all to become.

2145
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:53,820
He obviously

2146
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:55,820
fares well in all sorts of situations.

2147
02:30:55,820 --> 02:30:57,820
He obviously

2148
02:30:57,820 --> 02:30:59,820
is able to

2149
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:01,820
climb through the ranks.

2150
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:03,820
He is fucking

2151
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:05,820
poor

2152
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:07,820
and I feel that

2153
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:09,820
this is what he deserves.

2154
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:13,820
Excellent. Very...

2155
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:15,820
for 12 years.

2156
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:17,820
I just, I just, man

2157
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:21,820
and this is

2158
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:23,820
Digi Brony's legacy.

2159
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:25,820
Digi Brony's legacy is a

2160
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:27,820
fucking piece of fan art by the burning

2161
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:29,820
doughnut. It's a holy

2162
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:31,820
chain.

2163
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:35,820
Oh my god.

2164
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:39,820
He is a ship with Tommy Oliver.

2165
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:41,820
He's one of the first and most popular

2166
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:43,820
shipments in the Brony analysis community.

2167
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:45,820
Really it's not because nobody fucking

2168
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:47,820
wrote in any of his information.

2169
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:49,820
Wait, does Tommy Oliver have a page?

2170
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:51,820
Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to find one.

2171
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:53,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2172
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:57,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

2173
02:31:57,820 --> 02:31:59,820
okay, okay, okay.

2174
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,820
Oh god. Oh yeah!

2175
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:03,820
Look at that.

2176
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:05,820
He's ship with Digi Bros.

2177
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:07,820
when the first one was pop-thrush.

2178
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:09,820
Oh yes.

2179
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:11,820
Tommy is openly bisect...

2180
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:13,820
Wait, does Vita have a fucking

2181
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:15,820
page?

2182
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:17,820
Wait, wait.

2183
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:19,820
Who's Vita breakfast?

2184
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:21,820
Oh my god!

2185
02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:23,820
Why?

2186
02:32:23,820 --> 02:32:25,820
Why?

2187
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:27,820
Oh

2188
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:29,820
This is why.

2189
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:31,820
This is why people like Vita exist

2190
02:32:31,820 --> 02:32:33,820
because fucking idiots,

2191
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:35,820
fucking idiots will catalog all their

2192
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:37,820
fucking misanthropic

2193
02:32:37,820 --> 02:32:39,820
sociopathy here.

2194
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:41,820
This is why scumbags like Vita

2195
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:43,820
and Cream Man fucking do their shit

2196
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:45,820
and love it.

2197
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:47,820
Oh my fucking god.

2198
02:32:47,820 --> 02:32:49,820
Oh Christ, this is a fucking trap seat.

2199
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:51,820
Can we fucking go in?

2200
02:32:51,820 --> 02:32:53,820
This page is a mix of jokes and

2201
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:55,820
facts.

2202
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:57,820
How can we fucking nuke?

2203
02:32:57,820 --> 02:32:59,820
Can we fucking nuke the Rift Cafe?

2204
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:01,820
No, I'm fucking going to the Rift Cafe

2205
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:03,820
right fucking now and I'm deleting

2206
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:05,820
Vita's page and I'm probably gonna delete

2207
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:07,820
like it does in other pages.

2208
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:09,820
Why fucking nuke? It's a public wiki.

2209
02:33:09,820 --> 02:33:11,820
I can do anything I want.

2210
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:13,820
Just gonna roll it back.

2211
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:15,820
No one will notice.

2212
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:17,820
Nobody gives a shit.

2213
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:21,820
I'm like...

2214
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:23,820
What?

2215
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:25,820
What?

2216
02:33:25,820 --> 02:33:27,820
One of the most

2217
02:33:27,820 --> 02:33:29,820
likable veterans of the Rift

2218
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:31,820
is how it begins.

2219
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:33,820
Edit.

2220
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:35,820
Classic editor.

2221
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:37,820
Let's see.

2222
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:39,820
Let's see.

2223
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:41,820
Ben, you're a monster.

2224
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:43,820
Oh my god.

2225
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:45,820
Look at this astounding

2226
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:47,820
301 subscribers.

2227
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:49,820
Wait, where?

2228
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:51,820
Where does it say that?

2229
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:53,820
On the fucking Rift Cafe.

2230
02:33:53,820 --> 02:33:55,820
That's 301.

2231
02:33:55,820 --> 02:33:57,820
Astounding.

2232
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:59,820
Why N1?

2233
02:33:59,820 --> 02:34:01,820
Why not just whatever?

2234
02:34:01,820 --> 02:34:03,820
How do I delete it?

2235
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:05,820
Shouldn't there just be a fucking delete button?

2236
02:34:07,820 --> 02:34:09,820
I don't know.

2237
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:11,820
Hey, hey, hey.

2238
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:13,820
Fucking bitch.

2239
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:17,820
Listen to me.

2240
02:34:17,820 --> 02:34:19,820
I need your help.

2241
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:21,820
I need your help to erase Vita's legacy.

2242
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:23,820
They have his Skype.

2243
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:25,820
His Skype? Oh, all I want to do is just

2244
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:27,820
contact him.

2245
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:29,820
Ugh.

2246
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:33,820
Let's go to this YouTube, shall we?

2247
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:37,820
Yes.

2248
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:39,820
He's still using the avatar I made him.

2249
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:41,820
Where? Let me see, let me see.

2250
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:43,820
On his YouTube.

2251
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:47,820
I can't believe this.

2252
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:49,820
Oh, he's all the way up to

2253
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:51,820
399 subscribers.

2254
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:53,820
Oh my god.

2255
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:55,820
In like the two years since then.

2256
02:34:55,820 --> 02:34:57,820
He's posted, he posted one week ago.

2257
02:34:57,820 --> 02:34:59,820
He's, oh wait, wait, wait.

2258
02:34:59,820 --> 02:35:01,820
Okay, but he didn't post for seven months

2259
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:03,820
before that.

2260
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:07,820
What's he doing?

2261
02:35:07,820 --> 02:35:09,820
The fuck is he doing? I don't know what these videos are.

2262
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:11,820
Oh, he's got a little fucking

2263
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:13,820
video of him with a keyframe.

2264
02:35:13,820 --> 02:35:15,820
Keyframe and puzzle. Oh, keyframe.

2265
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:17,820
Fucking keyframe.

2266
02:35:17,820 --> 02:35:19,820
Let's fucking talk about keyframe.

2267
02:35:19,820 --> 02:35:21,820
Just some fucking girl.

2268
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:23,820
Just some useless girl

2269
02:35:23,820 --> 02:35:25,820
who comes in with nothing.

2270
02:35:25,820 --> 02:35:27,820
Some KFC sex life.

2271
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:29,820
Some KFC sex life. She comes in

2272
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:31,820
with like one drawing

2273
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:33,820
of an OC. She comes in

2274
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:35,820
she's there for like a week

2275
02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:37,820
she makes like one video

2276
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:39,820
and then on with the waterworks

2277
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:41,820
on with the fucking oh no

2278
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:43,820
suddenly I'm really poor and I'm getting

2279
02:35:43,820 --> 02:35:45,820
and my family is abusing me

2280
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:47,820
and oh no my life is

2281
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:49,820
ruined. Oh, somebody help me

2282
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:51,820
and then they do and then

2283
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:53,820
a dozen people pledge to her patreon

2284
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:55,820
get her like I don't know like a hundred bucks a month

2285
02:35:55,820 --> 02:35:57,820
or something and probably they fucking

2286
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:59,820
give her money to like I don't know

2287
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:01,820
she's got a bunch of money and now she's

2288
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:03,820
been for a while, for a while

2289
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:05,820
their fucking keyframe was making

2290
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:07,820
more than on patreon than me and it

2291
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:09,820
fucking ate at me. It like ate at my

2292
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:11,820
heart. It ate at my fucking heart

2293
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:13,820
because she's useless.

2294
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:15,820

reason which I find pretty

2297
02:36:19,820 --> 02:36:21,820
that is odd. That is

2298
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:23,820
that is very odd.

2299
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:25,820
theory brownie is like the poster child

2300
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:27,820
of being real. I don't

02:36:27,820 --> 02:36:29,820

so thoroughly suffused

2546
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:15,820
with ineptitude

2547
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:17,820
in in every in every

2548
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:19,820
like step of its creation

2549
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:21,820

it's like it's like it's ineptly

2553
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:29,820
ineptly conceived

2554
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:31,820
ineptly planned

2555
02:45:31,820 --> 02:45:33,820
inept ineptly executed

2556
02:45:33,820 --> 02:45:35,820
ineptly delivered

2557
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:37,820
and and ineptly

2558
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:47,420
consumed. Like even, even the viewers, like even the viewing experience is just, it just

2559
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:55,340
couldn't happen. It couldn't be the way it is if it wasn't, just the viewers just have

2560
02:45:55,340 --> 02:46:00,660
to be retarded. Like they just have to be retarded. Like everyone, I'm sorry. No I'm

2561
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:06,620
not sorry. Fuck me I'm not sorry. Everyone who watches Kim Possible, or has ever watched

2562
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:12,860
a Kim Possible a lot, has to be retarded. There's no other explanation. You wouldn't,

2563
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:18,180
you wouldn't do it. You wouldn't do it if you weren't retarded. You just wouldn't do

2564
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:19,180
it.

2565
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:25,140
Look, look, look, look recent wiki activity from, from a fandom user on Fee, what, what,

2566
02:46:25,140 --> 02:46:26,140

2567
02:46:26,140 --> 02:46:27,140
Wait.

It's god.

2569
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:32,180
Wait, I'm gonna, you know what I have to do, you know what I have to do? I have to go

2570
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:36,900
in and make like a couple minor changes just to like get that change off of like the most

2571
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:39,180
recent changes list.

2572
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,180
Oh my god.

2573
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:41,180
Like, yeah.

2574
02:46:41,180 --> 02:46:42,180
Like that's what I, that's what I have to do.

2575
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:48,340
Let's, let's, let's look at some of these guys. They're, they're up and coming. Who's

2576
02:46:48,340 --> 02:46:49,340
wooden sword?

2577
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:55,340
Up and, uh, some up and comers, some fucking up and comers in the pony analysis community.

2578
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:56,340
Age 15.

2579
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:57,340
Age 15.

2580
02:46:57,340 --> 02:46:58,340
Oh.

2581
02:46:58,340 --> 02:46:59,340
Age 15.

2582
02:46:59,340 --> 02:47:06,100
Oh, look at, look at that fucking, look at that fucking, uh, avatar. Um, that is a striking,

2583
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:08,060
that is a striking character design.

2584
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:09,060
It's bold.

2585
02:47:09,060 --> 02:47:10,060
Yeah.

2586
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:11,060
It's bold.

2587
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:14,540
Memorable. It's gonna stick with me till the day I fucking die, which is today, said

2588
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:16,500
Ben, cocking his gun.

2589
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:20,260
He was devastated when he heard Club Penguin was shut down. It still haunts him to this

2590
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:21,260
day.

2591
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:22,260
It was shut down like a month ago.

2592
02:47:22,260 --> 02:47:26,780
It still haunts him to this day, even though it was like, like two weeks ago.

2593
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:32,260
To date, he is the only person in the 2010s to care about Club Penguin. That's not fucking

2594
02:47:32,260 --> 02:47:34,020
true, dude.

2595
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:35,020
What about Gibbo?

2596
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:41,780
I, I, I, if, okay, I want to see if he's like, I'm sorry, go back for one second. Go back

2597
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:48,380
for 77 subscribers, 77 subscribers. Um, what, okay, how's this for fucking characterization?

2598
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:52,220
Wooden sword often complains that because he is in Australia, he's always late to Skype

2599
02:47:52,220 --> 02:47:57,420
conversations and podcasts since by the time he arrives, everyone is getting ready for

2600
02:47:57,420 --> 02:47:58,420
bed.

2601
02:47:58,420 --> 02:48:04,500
Everyone is getting ready for bed. Deep, deep lore, deep characterization, important shit.

2602
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:05,500
Shoot me.

2603
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:09,300
Um, okay, okay. I, I, okay, I'm assuming he's gonna have a video about the end of Club

2604
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:18,220
Penguin. And if it has more than Hippo's video, I'm, no, he's got 77, he's got 77 subscribers.

2605
02:48:18,220 --> 02:48:21,500
This is not, this is not a true up and comer.

2606
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:22,500
Okay.

2607
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:23,500
15.

2608
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:24,500
What?

2609
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:25,500
15, lol.

2610
02:48:25,500 --> 02:48:31,500
God, what, what kind of fucking retards we associate with a 15 year old?

2611
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:35,500
Hard to imagine. Hard to imagine, really.

2612
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:39,500
Ooh, you have to be retarded.

2613
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:48,220
Uh, wait, uh, I love Kim Possible a lot. Trivia. For her 3,000 subscriber special in which it's

2614
02:48:48,220 --> 02:48:56,220
traditional to sing winter wrap up, KP saying traditional or wait, wait, it's, it's traditional

2615
02:48:56,220 --> 02:49:02,220
to sing winter wrap up or some other MLP related song, KP saying discord instead of winter

2616
02:49:02,220 --> 02:49:06,820
wrap up. Okay. I have many questions. One, since when was it traditional to do anything

2617
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:11,420
for 3,000 subscribers? Since when was it traditional to sing winter wrap up? And what

2618
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:16,700
is the point of saying traditional to sing winter wrap up or some other MLP related song?

2619
02:49:16,700 --> 02:49:20,660
Why not just say it's traditional to sing an MLP related song? Even though it isn't

2620
02:49:20,660 --> 02:49:24,180
and there are no traditions and this is all just a bunch of made up bullshit. It's all

2621
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:27,700
just a bunch of bullshit from the top down.

2622
02:49:27,700 --> 02:49:34,700
Okay. Okay. Okay. We have so many.

2623
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:40,620
Wait, wait, wait. His talents include editing, humor, analysis kind of, and annoying other

2624
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:44,140
ponies intentional or otherwise. He takes inspiration.

2625
02:49:44,140 --> 02:49:53,140
He takes inspiration from Cat Icarus, Pina Fina Gala, Zondron, and Space Hamster, etc.

2626
02:49:53,140 --> 02:50:00,740
That's, imagine, imagine boldly stating you take inspiration from Cat Icarus and Pina

2627
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:07,540
Butter Gamer, the most, the most original, the most bold, the most, the boldest faces

2628
02:50:07,540 --> 02:50:09,540
on the internet today.

2629
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:15,980
Oh, you know, you know, you, you, you, you, you. Okay. Oh, my God. You know how it's canon.

2630
02:50:15,980 --> 02:50:23,420
It's canon that there exists the ICPCP that is a juggalo, a juggalo, a alter ego of everyone

2631
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:25,620
in the PCP. You know, you know, that's a thing, right?

2632
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:31,500
I mean, I know about the Japanese juggalo. That's about. The Japanese juggalo is Digi's

2633
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:36,420
ICPCP counterpart. I honestly, I have not heard of the ICPCP.

2634
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:44,380
Okay. The ICPCP is real. Okay. And if this guy liked clowns, he would be my, he would

2635
02:50:44,380 --> 02:50:46,380
be my ICPCP.

2636
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:52,100
Really? Yeah. Yeah. Cause he's, he's everything. He's like, cause he's just a baby. He's just

2637
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:55,780
like me if I was shitty. He's just a baby boy, just like you.

2638
02:50:55,780 --> 02:51:02,980
He's just a baby. Look at all his friends. Oh, Pet O Pat Rex 11, Mr. Left Turn, Martyr

2639
02:51:02,980 --> 02:51:09,220
Boy, uh, uh, Onyx the Dragon, Game Link Reviews, Doodled Pony and Freedom Flash, you know,

2640
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:16,980
all the greats. Although a bunch of nonsense, he often jokes about being horse famous in

2641
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:25,140
his videos. Wow. What a, what a concept. What a fucking original, uh, you know, I don't

2642
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:30,500
even have a problem. I don't have a problem with this guy cause he's a kid. Like I'm not

2643
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:35,620
blaming him. I'm not blaming him for being terrible and being useless and for him being

2644
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:40,380
worthless and for his content being shit. I'm not blaming him for any of that. I'm blaming

2645
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:46,460
whoever wrote this wiki article for feeling that this was a worthwhile thing to catalog.

2646
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:50,380
You know what? No. You know what? It's probably him. He probably just wrote it about himself.

2647
02:51:50,380 --> 02:51:53,140
Yeah. I was just about to say, I guarantee you that he wrote this myself.

2648
02:51:53,140 --> 02:51:57,660
Okay. So it's fine. In that case, it's fine. You know what? That's, that's why Pete, that's

2649
02:51:57,660 --> 02:52:01,620
why like me and Digi don't have any fucking thing on our fucking wiki page. Just cause

2650
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:06,300
we didn't give enough of a shit to go in and write our own fucking articles. Yeah. That's,

2651
02:52:06,300 --> 02:52:11,660
that's the solution. That's, that's the justice. People in the PCP fan chat, please fucking make

2652
02:52:11,660 --> 02:52:18,980
the wiki, please work. Yeah. Please. Like mine's fine. Mine's okay. I mean, it could

2653
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:25,780
be better. Mine's literally just, lol. Ugh. Now mine's, mine's, mine's alright. I think

2654
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:34,100
I did okay, but like, yeah, mages is like a sentence long. Yeah. Why isn't fucking phantom

2655
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:41,380
horn in the transgender pain? His gender is, his gender is unicorn, dude. He's a, his gender

2656
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:54,380
is trans unicorn. Oh, I'm weak. Oh, I'm weak with rage. Okay. Okay. Undefined gender. Okay.

2657
02:52:54,380 --> 02:53:00,700
What the fuck? What do you mean, undefined gender? He's a fucking girl. Whatever. Whatever,

2658
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:04,420
man. Okay. Okay. There's literally nothing in non-fucking. Even though fucking the other

2659
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:13,300
ones are both, ugh. I like how that one's just human. Oh, it's maluminous. That's. Who?

2660
02:53:13,300 --> 02:53:19,660
Yeah. That, that fucker. Who? Who? Wait, wait, I, it was, she, I talked to what's his name.

2661
02:53:19,660 --> 02:53:23,540
It's also, it's a, it's a guy. It's a trans girl. It's a male. So that's, so that's,

2662
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:27,340
so that's, so that's bullshit. It's a girl. That's bullshit. Well, I guess, I guess it

2663
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:35,180
is under literally female. Yeah, they're, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ahhhh! Look at the, look,

2664
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:44,020
look at this face. Hmm. Yes. The brony gallery. He takes, he takes an in-depth look at a particular

2665
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:48,540
artist on DeviantArt. Currently, she's only done two episodes of the series, but plans

2666
02:53:48,620 --> 02:53:54,020
to work. Good. Yeah. Your Patreon dollars at work, everybody. I don't know why I'm so

2667
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:58,020
mad. I don't know why I'm so mad. This person makes like a hundred dollars. This person

2668
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:02,100
makes like, this person makes like a hundred dollars on Patreon, which is not that much

2669
02:54:02,100 --> 02:54:06,260
in the grand scheme of things, but there's so many better people. There's like talent,

2670
02:54:06,260 --> 02:54:11,380
there's like talented fucking people out there that make like thirty dollars a month on Patreon.

2671
02:54:11,380 --> 02:54:15,780
And, oh god, I just want to throw up just thinking about the fucking iniquity of this

2672
02:54:15,860 --> 02:54:29,060
world. Keyframe is also a talented artist. Shut your fucking mouth. I want to die. Look, look. I want to

2673
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:34,140
look at. God, just remembering, remembering when I made less on Patreon than Keyframe.

2674
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:46,700
Those were dark days. Those were dark fucking days. Look, look, look, look, look. Jesus. Look at

2675
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:52,620
this. Look. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's fine. I mean, I've seen, after all the horrors I've

2676
02:54:52,620 --> 02:55:00,340
seen today, this is fine. This is okay. The iPod. Oh, oh wait. I just, oh yeah, I just realized

2677
02:55:00,460 --> 02:55:08,500
it's an iPod. iPod. That's good. That's good shit. That's good shit. Don't they have fucking,

2678
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:15,580
don't they have fucking Samsung's in Ponyville? That's my question for you, my friend. Oh,

2679
02:55:15,580 --> 02:55:20,780
he's my age. Oh no, he's slightly younger than me, but he's, this is, I'm sure this is out of date,

2680
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:30,340
so he's probably my age. Yeah, probably. He's, hmm. What a fucking hack. Who's, who's, who's,

2681
02:55:30,340 --> 02:55:39,260
who's, who's another guy? Digi. We, we've already seen this. He's the only one I know. Yeah,

2682
02:55:39,260 --> 02:55:43,100
let's answer what made, let's see what's going on with me. Oh fuck Mad Munchkin. Oh, okay. You're

2683
02:55:43,100 --> 02:55:54,340
at Lethal Rormage. Nothing. Wow. Okay, well, there's a couple of things here. Yeah, Lethal

2684
02:55:54,340 --> 02:56:01,780
Halloween, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Why,

2685
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:06,740
why is all of the people for the, for the horseshoe crew literally like they just don't have any?

2686
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:13,860
Um, is there a reason for that? Um, well, what about, what about Jesse? Oh, go to fucking Jesse.

2687
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:21,860
Oh my. I'll bet he's gonna have nothing to, I'll bet he's just gonna. Oh my god. Yeah, he's, yeah,

2688
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:28,300
it's gonna be bad. It's gonna be real bad. I, prepare to get mad. I'm mad already. One, two, three.

2689
02:56:28,300 --> 02:56:45,580
Oh, my. Yeah. Oh, it's my. Oh, hell yeah, bro. Oh, I'm hit with a tidal wave. A tidal wave of

2690
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:57,220
what? Nostalgia? Like, man, holy shit. This is shit, bro. Fucking sick, fucking sick, bro. Okay,

2691
02:56:57,260 --> 02:57:03,180
first of all, the fact that it, like, for some reason has this, which I, like, I, like, like,

2692
02:57:03,180 --> 02:57:10,660
like, this was the first piece of fan art, I think he got, pretty sure, please. Yeah. Was it, was it

2693
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:17,780
really? It was made, like, 45 minutes after the first episode of, of, of his fucking thing came out.

2694
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:31,060
Uh, impressive. So it must be. Yeah. Possibly. You know, I fucking, I sent him another image that

2695
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:35,700
he used, like, the basis of, of, of, of, like, one of his videos. It was, it was some, like,

2696
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:40,900
thing where he and Digi are the fucking retarded, like, Muppets old people thing, right? Yeah,

2697
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:46,100
yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. And that, I remember that. That mother fucker didn't even mention me in the

2698
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:53,940
description. Who? Wait, Jesse or Digi? Jesse. Yeah, Jesse. Can't. Well, fuck him. I'll never

2699
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:59,620
forgive him. I'll never forgive him. I wouldn't. A bunch of bullshit. Who's gay as hell? That's

2700
02:57:59,620 --> 02:58:06,340
frankly, frankly, that's gay as hell. It was the only word for it. Um, fucking credit your, credit

2701
02:58:06,340 --> 02:58:14,060
your artists, credit your artists people. Um, Jesus. Jesus Christ. Mad, mad munchkin. I hate mad

2702
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:22,620
munchkin. I hate mad munchkin. A fellow munchy. Don't ever touch her hat. She said don't ever touch

2703
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:28,700
her ass. Her hat. Don't. Oh, is that, is that her character that she gets mad if you touch her

2704
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:34,940
hat? Quirky. Just kill me, munchy. Just fucking kill me. One time she encountered Mary Sue, a

2705
02:58:34,940 --> 02:58:44,300
parody of the Mary Sue is generally found in the MLP fandom. Oh boy. What a fucking load of bullshit.

2706
02:58:44,300 --> 02:58:49,500
Hey, you know what? These people are so fucking old. What? This is another, this is another person who,

2707
02:58:50,780 --> 02:58:58,140
this is another person who like, like keyframe because she had like a sad tear jerky like, oh,

2708
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:04,460
I feel so bad for myself. Fucking a moment with Dr. Wolfe. I'm pretty sure this person got like,

2709
02:59:04,940 --> 02:59:10,140
I don't know, some fucking money out of it too or something. Maybe not a Patreon or something.

2710
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:14,780
Oh, yeah, Indiegogo. Let's fucking see. Let's fucking see because fucking Dr. Wolfe,

2711
02:59:14,780 --> 02:59:22,940
fucking Dr. Wolfe plugged her or something. She got $5,000, wants to raise money for local

2712
02:59:22,940 --> 02:59:27,580
charities and expand the business. What a bunch of bullshit. What a bunch of fucking bullshit.

2713
02:59:27,580 --> 02:59:34,300
Imagine, hold on. Imagine, okay, imagine this actually being successful. The phrase

2714
02:59:34,300 --> 02:59:40,220
wants to raise money for local charities and expand the business. What does that even mean?

2715
02:59:41,260 --> 02:59:51,820
What does that even mean? What business? What business? Local charity. Fundraiser to support

2716
02:59:51,820 --> 02:59:59,660
business and local charities. Raise money to put back into my local community. Oh my god.

2717
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:06,540
Expanding the business itself. Okay, so what this means is that this is money that's going to her

2718
03:00:06,540 --> 03:00:15,820
that she can buy things with. Local things. What, like, what charities and support? I have the

2719
03:00:15,820 --> 03:00:21,660
means, I have the means. You know what this is? You know what this is? Oh my god. I'll tell you

2720
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:31,100
exactly what this is. This is just, like, I buy things and I give to charity. So just fucking

2721
03:00:31,820 --> 03:00:37,500
give me money and eventually it will go into my local economy and the charities that I support

2722
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:47,340
already. Can you imagine a more blatant, like, just give me money? I actually think this is more

2723
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:52,620
disgusting because this is basically like mask, this is like masquerading as a charity, but really

2724
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:58,940
it's just give me money to spend how I see fit. And then because fucking Dr. Wolf plugged her,

2725
03:00:58,940 --> 03:01:06,620
she made $5,000. How fucking Jesus Christ. What kind of person do you have to be?

2726
03:01:08,540 --> 03:01:15,260
Thanks for reading. Stay creative. Oh, each shit. Oh, each shit. You know what? Her art

2727
03:01:15,260 --> 03:01:19,340
fucking sucks and I hate it. It's a terrible style. It's ugly. It's stupid. She's worthless.

2728
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:26,780
I haven't seen. Fucking look at it. It looks like garbage. I hate it. It's not good. It's not good.

2729
03:01:26,780 --> 03:01:34,380
It's not even close to good. It's far from good. It's weak. You're gonna kick off. It's weak and

2730
03:01:34,380 --> 03:01:37,420
she's wearing, you know what, you know what that is? You know what that is in her stupid head?

2731
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:43,420
It's the webcomic artist hat. It's the hat that all webcomic artists are legally obligated to wear.

2732
03:01:43,980 --> 03:01:51,980
You're not fucking wrong. You know what the worst part about it is is that's a big hat too.

2733
03:01:51,980 --> 03:01:54,380
It's not a tiny hat. She's disrespecting the munchie name.

2734
03:01:55,660 --> 03:02:04,060
Disgusting. Who fucking, the guy who makes Dresden Kodak wears that hat. The girl awkward zombie

2735
03:02:04,060 --> 03:02:09,660
wears that hat. Brony Curious wears that hat. Brony Curious wears a much worse hat.

2736
03:02:10,220 --> 03:02:15,500
Yeah. I don't know. There's a bunch more that wear that same stupid hat.

2737
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:20,300
Look at this. It's just like shorthand for I draw a webcomic.

2738
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:26,060
Look at this. That's fucking creativity at work, Boyo.

2739
03:02:29,020 --> 03:02:36,220
This is literally just Rainbow Dash. This is Rainbow Dash with a shirt on and you change the color

2740
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:41,420
and you tried to fucking screw with like the line work a little bit on the bottom but you

2741
03:02:41,420 --> 03:02:49,980
fucked up and it looks like garbage. This is, oh my god. She's a fan of Doctor Who,

2742
03:02:49,980 --> 03:02:55,500
Gravity Falls, anime and other anime shows. It's just Phineas and a Fur, Dexter's Laboratory and the

2743
03:02:55,500 --> 03:03:00,700
Powerpuff Girls. You know what, I'm thinking that maybe we need to fucking split this into two

2744
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:07,660
rowdy fuckers copkilling. I'm thinking we've spent, we've spent like as much time jerking our dicks

2745
03:03:07,660 --> 03:03:13,740
off about how much we hate the bro analysis community as we have been playing Frog Fractions.

2746
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:19,820
Okay, okay, Ben. You have to like make no fucking illusions to like, that's what this is going to

2747
03:03:19,820 --> 03:03:25,180
turn into. It just turns into us fucking going down memory lane. Did you say, oh yeah, we have a lot

2748
03:03:25,180 --> 03:03:31,260
to say about Frog Fractions. A lot to say about Frog Fractions. We have many video game opinions.

2749
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:41,100
Also, Enoch144 on Steam, Buy Me Grow Up, Buy Me Glittermitten Grove, Buy Me Grow Up, Buy Me Glittermitten

2750
03:03:41,100 --> 03:03:47,660

2751
03:03:47,660 --> 03:03:53,500
for literally nothing. I'm sure someone, I'm sure some generous person will buy me Grow Up and or

2752
03:03:53,580 --> 03:03:59,740
Glittermitten Grove please. Thank you. I love you. Does this person still watch the show? Who?

2753
03:04:00,860 --> 03:04:07,100
Dear Cotton Candy. Dear Cotton Candy? Did she ever, did she ever watch Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers?

2754
03:04:08,060 --> 03:04:13,260
Oh, well, I just, oh yeah, I guess you're right. I guess like the thumbnail of Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers

2755
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:21,100
like is a natural deterrent. Yeah, well, against the weak-minded. Yeah. Yeah. In other words, females.

2756
03:04:21,180 --> 03:04:25,820
In other words, females. This is, this is, it's a girl repellent and I mean that in the best possible

2757
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:33,020
way. Oh God. Oh my God. That bright acid green just like, they're like, oh, it's like, it's like a

2758
03:04:33,020 --> 03:04:39,580
citronella candle and they're like the mosquito. It's like way too potent for their fucking, their,

2759
03:04:39,580 --> 03:04:45,500
their, their weak and their, their weak and bland heart to handle. Yeah. Yeah. Um, what were you

2760
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:54,060
saying about CC? Oh, nothing. I'll never say it. Okay, good. Kimmy Sparkle, the only fucking,

2761
03:04:54,060 --> 03:04:59,980
the only good one. Oh, wait, wait, was, oh, were you on CC's page? Is that what it was? I wasn't

2762
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:05,580
looking. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um, yeah, I love Kimmy Sparkle. I love Kimmy Sparkle so much.

2763
03:05:06,460 --> 03:05:11,820
Kimmy Sparkle is actually the best thing that ever happened in MLP. Like, fucking,

2764
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:20,540
it's so good. It's so fucking good. Somebody, Munchy. Yeah. Kimmy Sparkle is like the, it's

2765
03:05:20,540 --> 03:05:25,340
like the best idea. It's like the most, it's like such an obvious idea. Like when I saw Kimmy Sparkle,

2766
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:31,340
I was like, somebody had to do this and I'm so glad they did. Yeah. How was she the only one?

2767
03:05:33,580 --> 03:05:40,540
Uh, I think, I think we, I thought, I think it was just too cool that everyone embroiled in it.

2768
03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:47,580
It was just too cool. Like no one wanted to, to even think about the fact that, that it wasn't

2769
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:52,300
incredibly great. Like it was, it was just the best, the best thing. The thing, the thing about,

2770
03:05:53,100 --> 03:05:57,500
are you talking about brony analysis? Are you talking about Kimmy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's

2771
03:05:57,500 --> 03:06:02,540
a brony analysis. See, here's what fucking kills me. Is that like, what fuck, what kills me

2772
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:07,500
about Kimmy Sparkle is that at some point in there, Kimmy Sparkle was like collabing with people.

2773
03:06:08,460 --> 03:06:15,580
Like, uh, not Eliora, um, like Persian Poetus, right? Like she had like a crossover video with

2774
03:06:15,580 --> 03:06:22,780
Persian Poetus and a couple other people. But the thing is that like all the other, all the people

2775
03:06:22,780 --> 03:06:28,780
that they, she crossed over with, like, like treated it seriously. Like, like they made like

2776
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:33,900
serious, like they treated Kimmy Sparkle as though she was like an actual person and like an actual

2777
03:06:33,900 --> 03:06:43,340
personality and not a fucking parody of them. Yeah. Like, I don't know, man. I just, it was

2778
03:06:43,340 --> 03:06:48,060
so good. How was there not more? How was that? I just, I wish there had been, I wish there had

2779
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:53,980
been more Kimmy Sparkles, but like on the other hand, I guess that like the fact that there was

2780
03:06:53,980 --> 03:07:01,820
only one just speaks, just speaks to how much we fucking needed her. And then she made like four

2781
03:07:01,900 --> 03:07:07,740
videos and then fell off the map and that was sad. But like, she was just too good. She was the hero

2782
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:12,540
we needed, but not the one we deserved. We definitely did not deserve her. We definitely did not deserve

2783
03:07:12,540 --> 03:07:19,340
Kimmy and she was not appreciated enough. And I guess that's why she left. She was too good for

2784
03:07:19,340 --> 03:07:25,020
us. Kimmy Sparkle is the special quote unquote self-proclaimed only Pegasus reviewer. However,

2785
03:07:25,020 --> 03:07:33,340
this is false because there are many more, including keyframe. I love Composibla and Eliora.

2786
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:39,580
Ah, the three big, the three, the three Titans. Her creator is none other than Shirt Club Palms.

2787
03:07:40,860 --> 03:07:51,820
Kill me. Just fucking kill me. Who, who's this? Oh my God, this one, this fucking one, this fucking

2788
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:56,860
one kills me. Okay, let me fucking tell you, I know, I don't even need to read. She's 30 years old,

2789
03:07:56,860 --> 03:08:04,300
by the way. I don't need to read. I don't need to read anything about this person. Here's all I have

2790
03:08:04,300 --> 03:08:11,100
to say about Lightning Bliss. Lightning Bliss had a moment with Dr. Wolfe and the issue,

2791
03:08:14,460 --> 03:08:20,700
the issue that Lightning Bliss was grappling with, that she needed the doctor's help with, was

2792
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:31,980
the problem of having people, the problem of people judging her for having an alicorn OC.

2793
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:41,180
Holy shit. Yeah, fucking unpack that for a minute. Unpack, unpack the astounding,

2794
03:08:41,180 --> 03:08:48,620
the astounding absence of self-awareness that would have to, that would have to have occurred,

2795
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:55,580
that would have to exist, the chain, just the unbroken, the unbroken chain of failure to recognize,

2796
03:08:55,580 --> 03:09:00,700
to fucking step outside yourself for one fucking second and understand your place in the world

2797
03:09:00,700 --> 03:09:07,580
and what you truly are, that would lead up to that occurring, that would lead up to a video of a

2798
03:09:07,580 --> 03:09:13,020
moment with Dr. Wolfe, fucking people are bullied, people judge me for having an alicorn OC, but

2799
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:20,940
I'm not going to take it anymore. Fuck. Dr. Wolfe has to help her through it. Yeah, she had, this is

2800
03:09:20,940 --> 03:09:28,060
an issue that she fucking grapples with and she, she can't, oh my Christ. There's just nothing,

2801
03:09:28,060 --> 03:09:34,380
there's just nothing she can do, there's just nothing, there's nothing, there's, she's being,

2802
03:09:34,380 --> 03:09:40,860
she's just the victim of an unwarranted cyber bullying. Yeah, people don't understand,

2803
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:48,060
the problem is that people don't understand the creative vision behind her OC. If they did,

2804
03:09:48,060 --> 03:09:53,740
they would see that they are, they are the fool, that they themselves are the fool for, for what

2805
03:09:53,740 --> 03:09:58,780
they do to her, but no, they're too blind, they're too blind and too fucking judgmental, Munchy,

2806
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:05,580
they're too judgmental, they can't, they can't see that in this, clearly in this fucking case of all

2807
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:14,860
cases, it's warranted. In this case, it's special and deserved. Like this alicorn, this, this alicorn

2808
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:20,060
that we're looking at right now is not, it's like, no, but look at that fucking avatar,

2809
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:24,780
fucking look at it for a second Munchy, fucking, fucking look at it, look at it Munchy, thank you,

2810
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:35,100
thank you, okay, all like this, this is not your typical run of the mill Mary Sue alicorn

2811
03:10:35,100 --> 03:10:40,060
that we're looking at here, this is not that, this, this is unique, this is special, this,

2812
03:10:40,060 --> 03:10:45,420
this brings a whole new fucking dimension to the, to the quote unquote Mary Sue. This is,

2813
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:51,820
this is a character with depth and dimensionality behind it, okay, this is other alicorns, yeah,

2814
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:57,980
like other alicorns give the practice of making alicorn or sees a bad name by being like, by

2815
03:10:57,980 --> 03:11:04,380
being like too cool and being like too special and being yeah, I'll admit it, I'll, I'll say it,

2816
03:11:04,460 --> 03:11:10,300
Mary Sue's right, like those al, like those alicorns give, give this person a bad name,

2817
03:11:10,300 --> 03:11:16,380
this person has to grapple with the unearned negative reputation that others have fucking,

2818
03:11:16,380 --> 03:11:24,220
the stigma that others have imbued alicorn OCs with. I, I have no, there's no end, Munchy,

2819
03:11:24,220 --> 03:11:30,380
there is no fucking end to the spite and the bile and the vitriol that I feel for this person.

2820
03:11:30,380 --> 03:11:34,460
There's no light at the end of the tunnel. What? There's no light at the end of the tunnel,

2821
03:11:34,460 --> 03:11:38,860
it's all, it's all agony, there's no fucking hope. There's no, there's,

2822
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:45,900
I'm looking into, I'm looking into the eyes, I'm, yeah, there's no light, there's no light,

2823
03:11:45,900 --> 03:11:49,660
there's no light at the end of the tunnel that is the eyes that let the, that are the window

2824
03:11:49,660 --> 03:11:55,740
to the soul of the person that has created fucking, what is their name, fucking rainbow bliss?

2825
03:11:56,700 --> 03:12:03,340
Something fucking retarded. Rainbow wishes? There's just nothing.

2826
03:12:03,340 --> 03:12:14,220
Canker sores. There's, there's just nothing. I mean this whole, oh. What? What, what the fuck are

2827
03:12:14,220 --> 03:12:19,820
these? I don't know, I don't know what's happening, I don't know what's happening with their feet.

2828
03:12:20,620 --> 03:12:29,180
God, I didn't even notice. Are they gems? Are they like metal plates? They're toenails.

2829
03:12:29,180 --> 03:12:37,260
Oh, oh, ew, oh, I hope not. Oh, I hope that's not what that is. I fucking hope that's not what that

2830
03:12:37,260 --> 03:12:42,300
is, dude. No. Because if that's what that is, we're gonna have a fucking problem.

2831
03:12:44,220 --> 03:12:48,700
Look at her like, look at her like too cool for school fucking rat tail. Her like fucking

2832
03:12:48,700 --> 03:12:56,380
elephant rat tail. What do you mean, she needs to bring, she needs to breathe some life into the

2833
03:12:56,380 --> 03:13:02,140
Alicorn OC and she needs to breathe some life with her original fucking- I guess, dude, I guess

2834
03:13:02,140 --> 03:13:08,540
it's original, but don't fucking tell me that it's not some bullshit. Look at that bold stance.

2835
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:14,220
She has something to fucking say, and she's not gonna, she's not gonna be beheldant to your

2836
03:13:14,220 --> 03:13:19,500
pre-existing notions that Alicorn overseas aren't cool. Look at how that tail fucking clips through

2837
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:28,220
the ground that her hooves are on. Look at how the tail goes below, goes below where her fucking

2838
03:13:28,220 --> 03:13:33,420
hooves meet the ground. How the fuck does that work? Okay, look at her goggles. Do you like how

2839
03:13:33,420 --> 03:13:38,700
the goggles are at one side of the face because that horn should realistically be in between,

2840
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:44,700
like above the far side goggle and beneath? I did, I did, I did notice that, Munchy. I did

2841
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:50,460
notice how the goggles are on one side. Um, hey, do you like how her fucking cutie mark,

2842
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:56,940
how her fucking cutie mark overlaps the seam between her torso and back leg? Do you like that?

2843
03:13:57,340 --> 03:14:01,660
Do you like that, Munchy? Yeah, me too. Big fan, big fan over here.

2844
03:14:02,540 --> 03:14:12,540
This, I just realized too that that that that that these like these these like goggles like like

2845
03:14:12,540 --> 03:14:18,140
the actual like like like lens part like are completely different art style and look completely

2846
03:14:18,140 --> 03:14:28,140
different than the rest of the body. Yeah, they were clearly drawn by an inept amateur who thought,

2847
03:14:28,140 --> 03:14:33,500
I mean, just look at how they're fucking like the shape of the goggles looks like they've been

2848
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:39,900
melted. Yeah. Like, look how thin this one is. Yeah.

2849
03:14:43,340 --> 03:14:48,620
This is, it's all on one side, it's all on one side of the hair in the horn. It's all on one side.

2850
03:14:48,620 --> 03:14:54,220
The pink lenses, the pink lenses on the brown goggles, on the white, on the black hair.

2851
03:14:54,620 --> 03:14:56,620
Think about it.

2852
03:14:58,860 --> 03:15:04,940
Look, look, just look at the fucking, look at the fucking pixelation of the edge of that cutie

2853
03:15:04,940 --> 03:15:09,900
mark. Look at the fucking aspect ratio of that cutie mark on that tiny ass leg.

2854
03:15:11,740 --> 03:15:16,140
It was, it's just, it's like, it's like the cutie mark doesn't, it's like the cutie

2855
03:15:16,140 --> 03:15:21,100
mark doesn't even exist. Like it's just been like painted on the glass that we're viewing this caged

2856
03:15:21,100 --> 03:15:32,540
animal through. Oh, fuck. God. The way this like, this like line is going to,

2857
03:15:32,540 --> 03:15:36,220
it looks like it's going right into her fucking asshole, not going like above it or anything.

2858
03:15:36,220 --> 03:15:40,620
You're right. Yeah, it's too low. It's too, yeah, it doesn't look like it connects to the spine.

2859
03:15:42,140 --> 03:15:46,460
It should be, it should be coming out the fucking top of the ass, not the bottom you faggots.

2860
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:53,420
Oh my god. Do you like how obviously this is like, like control T and photoshop.

2861
03:15:53,420 --> 03:15:58,060
Oh my god. Yeah, I just noticed that. Yeah, look how fucking, look how fucking, what's the word,

2862
03:15:59,020 --> 03:16:02,860
skewed? Look how fucking skewed the ass. Yeah, like fully skewed and distorted.

2863
03:16:02,860 --> 03:16:10,460
Look how skewed the aspect ratio on those wings are. They're so fucking bad. It's all so bad. Also,

2864
03:16:11,420 --> 03:16:19,820
look how, look how, look how huge the ears are. Wait, wait, wait, okay, okay. The ears are huge

2865
03:16:20,780 --> 03:16:26,940
and so is the fucking line on the ears, meaning that the ear, like that's an ear asset that was

2866
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:34,620
just taken and like fucking enlarged. Line and all, line and all. Control T, you just, just like,

2867
03:16:35,180 --> 03:16:42,300
yeah, just, just fucking drag that shit. Look how, look where the horn, look how huge her

2868
03:16:42,300 --> 03:16:49,020
forehead is. Like look where the eyes end and the horn must begin. Look how much fucking space there

2869
03:16:49,020 --> 03:16:54,380
is between the eyes and the horn, dude. Exactly, exactly. So the line would be like this. Ideally,

2870
03:16:54,380 --> 03:16:58,460
the horn would be right here and then like, like downward because it should be on the forehead,

2871
03:16:58,460 --> 03:17:04,460
but now it's like basically on the top of the head now. Yeah, basically, and the ears just

2872
03:17:04,460 --> 03:17:09,420
like fucking go bat, like bat, like bat ears. I mean, maybe that's intentional. I don't know. I kind

2873
03:17:09,420 --> 03:17:13,580
of, I kind of like like the huge ears. Like I think they look fine, except for the fact that,

2874
03:17:13,580 --> 03:17:17,740
that the, that the line on them is so fucking thick that you can tell they were just controlled to

2875
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:25,340
eat. Yeah. It really, it really gets me though. It really gets me that the tail goes below where

2876
03:17:25,340 --> 03:17:32,460
the hooves meet the ground. Like that really bothers me. Like the only, the only logical

2877
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:38,380
explanation for it is that like, it's actually like the tail is extending like so far into the

2878
03:17:38,380 --> 03:17:44,460
foreground that it like, look, that like from our upward viewing angle, like it looks further down.

2879
03:17:44,460 --> 03:17:50,300
You know what I'm saying? But like, but like, it's, it's behind her. Like the tail is behind

2880
03:17:50,300 --> 03:17:55,980
her and yet it suddenly like shoots forward. Oh my God, the positioning of the tail in,

2881
03:17:55,980 --> 03:18:04,140
in 3D space is insane. It's insanity. Let's, let's, let's examine the chain of events here.

2882
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:11,260
This person, this person makes this OC. Yeah. Actually, actually, no, no, no. I, I, I read a

2883
03:18:11,260 --> 03:18:17,420
little bit on the summary page. She originally had a Pegasus like OC. Okay. So assuming just this

2884
03:18:17,420 --> 03:18:23,020
without a horn. Yeah. Then a quote unquote important change happens in her life and she

2885
03:18:23,020 --> 03:18:29,420
changes it to an alicorn. So she has this OC. Wait, is that, is that what it said? Is that

2886
03:18:29,420 --> 03:18:33,340
what the wiki said? That an important change happened in her life and that she made it into

2887
03:18:33,340 --> 03:18:39,900
an alicorn? Yes. Okay. That's interesting. This is interesting. So this, wait, what is this person's name?

2888
03:18:41,980 --> 03:18:47,740
Uh, lightning blitz. Lightning blitz. That's it. Lightning blitz, not rainbow blitz. Yeah,

2889
03:18:47,740 --> 03:18:54,780
good stuff. Good stuff. Okay. Okay. So she is representing herself. She's representing her

2890
03:18:54,780 --> 03:19:02,940
ideas and everything about herself through this image. This is the image that she, that she chooses,

2891
03:19:02,940 --> 03:19:07,980
that she willingly represents herself with, right? That's, that, that, that's event number one. Yeah.

2892
03:19:07,980 --> 03:19:15,580
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Event number two, she, she gets a backlash for having an alicorn OC and

2893
03:19:15,580 --> 03:19:23,420
being an unoriginal, deplorable human being. Yeah. Okay. That is, that is what happened,

2894
03:19:24,060 --> 03:19:30,940
I believe. I can buy that. I buy that story. Okay. Okay. Okay. So at this point, she's already,

2895
03:19:30,940 --> 03:19:36,460
she's already off the deep end for just, for this existing. Yeah. Due to the fact that this exists,

2896
03:19:36,460 --> 03:19:40,620
she's already, like, like, she's, she's not worth it. We need to get rid of her. Like,

2897
03:19:40,620 --> 03:19:45,100
like, she's not worth saving. Yeah. Like, like, like, like, it's, it's gone to the point where,

2898
03:19:45,100 --> 03:19:50,380
like, a police tax force has to be, like, called in. Like, there's no point. Yeah, something has to

2899
03:19:50,380 --> 03:20:00,220
be done. Yeah. Yeah. So we're already at that point. Stage three, she contacts Dr. Wolfe. Well,

2900
03:20:00,220 --> 03:20:04,380
well, you know, you know, there's, there's another step, which is that she was making,

2901
03:20:04,380 --> 03:20:08,780
I think she made like a, like one or two, like, fucking review, you know, like the quote unquote

2902
03:20:08,780 --> 03:20:13,100
reviews that you can make in this community and can be considered like a legit creator.

2903
03:20:13,100 --> 03:20:19,180
Like, she made some fucking video of her with her OC talking about like, I don't know how

2904
03:20:19,980 --> 03:20:25,100
Twilight is gay or something. You know, like, she did a couple, she did a couple of those,

2905
03:20:25,100 --> 03:20:29,100
and she got active in the community. And like, she made a bunch of friends with a bunch of the

2906
03:20:29,100 --> 03:20:33,020
other people. And like, you know, she had her OC and da, da, da, da, and she was in the riff.

2907
03:20:33,020 --> 03:20:36,460
Like, like, that's, that's, that's step three, that's step three. Yeah.

2908
03:20:37,580 --> 03:20:42,700
Like, like, she, she just, she just stumbles, she just stumbles, asks forward and, and, and,

2909
03:20:42,700 --> 03:20:48,860
and to fame somehow. I mean, I mean, fame is, but yeah, into what, into what is, what is considered

2910
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:56,620
fame in, in, as far as, yeah, she becomes a notable name among this, like, fucking, this fucking cult.

2911
03:20:56,620 --> 03:20:59,100
It's called, it's called, it is slu. Yeah.

2912
03:21:00,940 --> 03:21:09,020
So, she, she, she achieves, she achieves horse famous. Yeah, such as it is. And then, and, and,

2913
03:21:09,020 --> 03:21:16,300
and then do, do, do the immense cyberbullying of people, of people telling her that his,

2914
03:21:16,300 --> 03:21:25,500
that her OC is uninspired in sippy drivel. Yep. Yep. She, she, she contacts the mythical

2915
03:21:26,140 --> 03:21:32,380
legendary Dr. himself, Dr. Wool. Yeah. Cause she's, cause she's got the hookups, right? Cause like,

2916
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:37,420
she's in the fucking riff and she's talking to tune critic and Eliora and Golden Fox and other

2917
03:21:37,420 --> 03:21:42,300
like heavy hitters, you know? They're, they're, they're, they're riffing, they're riffing, they're

2918
03:21:42,300 --> 03:21:47,580
having fun. Yeah, they're riffing, they're riffing the rift. Yeah, they're, they're riffing. Yeah.

2919
03:21:47,660 --> 03:21:56,620
She contacts Dr. Wool with a proposition unlike any of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm with you so far.

2920
03:21:56,620 --> 03:22:04,380
I'm with you. Let me come on your show. Yeah. I'm assuming she drew it or, you know, you know,

2921
03:22:04,380 --> 03:22:10,460
fuck it. We'll just get someone else to drop for, for, for, for maybe $10. Yeah. Yeah. I'll drop,

2922
03:22:10,460 --> 03:22:14,620
I'll drop 10 bucks on this fucking, on this important career move that I'm making.

2923
03:22:15,420 --> 03:22:19,180
I've got something. I've got, I've got, I've got something that's been eating away at me,

2924
03:22:19,180 --> 03:22:28,540
Doc. You, Dr. Wool, a, a, a re, a real licensed psychologist, which he totally is. He, he, he,

2925
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:34,220
he is the master of psychoanalysis and you need to come to him with all of your problems.

2926
03:22:34,220 --> 03:22:39,340
Yeah. Or else just what the fuck are you doing? Yeah, yeah. Just making the point. Doc, I got a

2927
03:22:39,340 --> 03:22:53,260
problem. People are making fun of me for being a no talent, awful, meaningless, a horrible waste of

2928
03:22:53,260 --> 03:23:00,700
existence. People are getting on my back for being the most uninspired, creatively bankrupt,

2929
03:23:01,660 --> 03:23:11,020
like horrible meat minuscule on the planet. Fuck meat minuscule. I need, I need to reach,

2930
03:23:11,020 --> 03:23:15,500
I need you to console me. I need you to tell me that everything's going to be okay.

2931
03:23:16,300 --> 03:23:23,180
Yeah. Yeah. Please tell me, tell me that it's okay to keep doing what I'm doing. That's what

2932
03:23:23,180 --> 03:23:30,140
she wants. Please. Yeah. I need, it, it, I need, I need you to tell me. Make it clear that the

2933
03:23:30,140 --> 03:23:35,980
official Doctor Wolf position, make it clear that the official Doctor Wolf position is that this is

2934
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:46,060
fine and good. Let, let the world fucking know. Yeah. That, that hashtag I stand with lightning

2935
03:23:46,060 --> 03:23:54,620
bliss, I stand in solidarity with the disabled and wounded veteran that is lightning bliss.

2936
03:23:55,260 --> 03:24:01,420
Oh no. Oh God, no. God, no, doc. Don't do it. Don't fucking sign that. Don't fucking sign that

2937
03:24:01,420 --> 03:24:08,540
infernal pact. But you know what? I know how the story ends. I know how the story ends and he

2938
03:24:08,540 --> 03:24:15,260
fucking, spoiler alert. He fucking did it. I could use another video. Yeah. Yeah. I need,

2939
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:20,700
I need more content to keep my patrons happy, to keep that fucking, to keep that fucking

2940
03:24:20,700 --> 03:24:25,980
meaningless trickle of money, just, just trickling away into my bank account so I can not pay my

2941
03:24:25,980 --> 03:24:34,540
artists with it. Oh my God. I say it's, I say it's a deal, Miss Bliss. Yeah. Yeah. I think,

2942
03:24:34,540 --> 03:24:41,420
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. I think we both stand, I think we

2943
03:24:41,420 --> 03:24:50,620
both stand to gain from our new union, our new business agreement. Yes. Yes. You supply, you

2944
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:57,500
supply, you supply the childish naivete and fucking utter incompetence and lack of self-awareness

2945
03:24:58,140 --> 03:25:04,540
that the community at large can empathize with and all provide and all provide the fucking bogus

2946
03:25:05,260 --> 03:25:11,660
trumped up absolute bullshit sense of creepy paternal authority and affirmation that people

2947
03:25:11,660 --> 03:25:18,460
like you and your miserable, ill crave, you know, to fucking rock yourselves to sleep at night

2948
03:25:18,460 --> 03:25:24,700
in your fucking, in your little, in your little fucking homemade cribs, in your little emotional

2949
03:25:24,700 --> 03:25:31,180
cribs that you sleep in. You fucks, you piece of shit. Jesus fucking Christ. You know, you know,

2950
03:25:32,380 --> 03:25:38,780
it's actually worse. It's actually even worse than you say, Munchy, because she wasn't, because

2951
03:25:38,780 --> 03:25:44,780
the criticism she was receiving is not, you, the criticism she was sensitive to is not like,

2952
03:25:44,780 --> 03:25:51,500
your shit sucks and you're terrible, because that, while true, is not a valid criticism in the,

2953
03:25:51,900 --> 03:26:00,140
in the Brony analysis escape, right? What, what the criticism was, was not anything substantial.

2954
03:26:00,140 --> 03:26:05,900
The criticism was that she was being written off specifically for being an alicorn and that

2955
03:26:05,900 --> 03:26:11,900
is unacceptable. You know what that is? That's literally racism. She was literally experiencing

2956
03:26:11,900 --> 03:26:18,700
racism for the, for the, for the, you know, she didn't choose this, Munchy. She didn't choose

2957
03:26:18,700 --> 03:26:23,980
to be an alicorn. This was, you know, this is just who she is and she doesn't deserve to be

2958
03:26:23,980 --> 03:26:29,500
judged for it because it's not like, because it's not like any kind of like creative decision making

2959
03:26:29,500 --> 03:26:37,020
or design ethos went into her being an alicorn. This is just who she is and you can't,

2960
03:26:37,020 --> 03:26:44,300
you can't fucking judge her for it, Munchy. You, you bigot. And, and if you do-

2961
03:26:44,780 --> 03:26:48,780
So much for the internet's most tolerant fandom, am I right guys?

2962
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:55,500
Yeah, yeah. Like they're just, like they're just, they just come into it, like they just come into

2963
03:26:55,500 --> 03:27:02,700
it. They come into watching her videos with all these assumptions based solely on the fact that

2964
03:27:02,700 --> 03:27:08,380
her al, her OC is an alicorn, which, you know, if they just gave her a chance, if they just,

2965
03:27:08,380 --> 03:27:14,140
if they just gave her a chance they would see, they would have all their fucking bigoted preconception

2966
03:27:14,540 --> 03:27:18,540
shattered, Munchy. They would have them shattered and they would see the beautiful person.

2967
03:27:18,540 --> 03:27:27,020
Their earth would be wrong at the sheer uniqueness and the sheer creativity coming out of, of, of,

2968
03:27:27,020 --> 03:27:34,140
of this fucking powerhouse of imagination. You know what, you know what, I'm, I'm look,

2969
03:27:34,140 --> 03:27:39,100
I'm not gonna read like any of it, but I looked at the wiki and I get the sense, I get the sense

2970
03:27:39,820 --> 03:27:46,140
that this OC, that this character actually does, like I'm not, I can't speak to its quality, although

2971
03:27:46,860 --> 03:27:52,620
I'm sure it's garbage. This, this, this character actually does like have some kind of a background

2972
03:27:52,620 --> 03:27:58,860
to it, which like, I'm sure it sucks, but I respect that there at least is one, right? Oh no, oh

2973
03:27:58,860 --> 03:28:04,940
never mind, never mind, because I'm seeing that like it's all tied in with the fucking Rift Cafe.

2974
03:28:05,820 --> 03:28:09,500
Yeah. Whatever, I don't know, at least there's something, like at least this person has some

2975
03:28:09,500 --> 03:28:14,700
kind of like a character, right? Even if it's shit. Lightning Bliss was a Pegasus pony, all right.

2976
03:28:14,700 --> 03:28:19,340
Even, even if it's shit and stupid and retarded, at least this person has something, at least this

2977
03:28:19,340 --> 03:28:26,460
person isn't Toon Critic, whose fucking OC background is, I review ponies and I wear a fucking hat and

2978
03:28:26,460 --> 03:28:33,500
a scarf, right? Oh my god. Oh my god. What? After investing her time and her artwork to others

2979
03:28:33,500 --> 03:28:39,980
whom requested it, she soon later started up the Lightning Bliss show after she felt the need to

2980
03:28:39,980 --> 03:28:48,300
express herself about the MLP series through her own imagery and animation capabilities. Oh my god.

2981
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:56,700
Who writes like that? It's like, okay, so her, so her, so her backstory, so her backstory is

2982
03:28:56,700 --> 03:29:01,180
she's an artist who started an MLP channel. That's, that's her backstory. Okay, never mind.

2983
03:29:02,140 --> 03:29:05,340
I mean, what is, I mean, there's this thing about, wait, no, go up, go up. The thing about

2984
03:29:05,340 --> 03:29:11,980
Lightning Bliss' dimension. Like, that's, okay, you know, maybe I was wrong. I thought for a second

2985
03:29:11,980 --> 03:29:17,580
that this person- Oh, I asked God that it was just this image and I was going to fucking die.

2986
03:29:18,220 --> 03:29:22,860
Like, I thought for, I thought for a second that they was like a backstory, but apparently there's

2987
03:29:22,860 --> 03:29:29,900
not, it's just I started a YouTube channel. Uh, here we go, here we go. Created after she first

2988
03:29:29,980 --> 03:29:34,620
started her show a few episodes later, originally Lightning Bliss hosted her show in an old hotel

2989
03:29:34,620 --> 03:29:40,860
cabin due she wasn't ready to be fully exposed to the rest of the Brony analysis reviewing community.

2990
03:29:40,860 --> 03:29:45,820
She also was nervous of the fact that she was an alicorn and feared she wouldn't be accepted.

2991
03:29:45,820 --> 03:29:51,660
With doubt in her mind, she rented out and did her reviews in quiet. Oh my god, after being isolated

2992
03:29:51,660 --> 03:29:57,900
and she couldn't expand her creativity. How much of this is real and how much of this is like fake,

2993
03:29:57,900 --> 03:30:03,260
like kayfabe? How much of this is kayfabe? I don't know. I'm thinking none. I'm thinking like

2994
03:30:03,260 --> 03:30:09,420
literally none, like zero to 1%. Lightning Bliss decided to break free of her fear and hide out

2995
03:30:09,420 --> 03:30:13,100
for the chance to become something more as a reviewer and as an alicorn but still have her

2996
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:20,940
place safe within the community. She whipped out her lioness tail and painted the special,

2997
03:30:20,940 --> 03:30:24,940
she painted the special dimension that opened within the fourth wall of the rift because she

2998
03:30:24,940 --> 03:30:29,500
is an alicorn. She felt it was only natural. She'd be in a place that represented the alicorn

2999
03:30:29,500 --> 03:30:34,460
mystery. Hence why it is similar to that of the dimension that was created by Princess Celestia,

3000
03:30:35,100 --> 03:30:40,780
though both dimension is tail painted and holds more unusual. Oh, her thing is that she like paints

3001
03:30:40,780 --> 03:30:46,140
things with her tail and they become real. That's her magic alicorn. It's even more unusual magical

3002
03:30:46,140 --> 03:30:53,340
properties than average. She's so unique. Holy shit. You know what? You know what? I take back

3003
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:58,060
everything I said. I take back everything I said. There is nothing redeeming about this person.

3004
03:30:58,060 --> 03:31:04,380
There is nothing redeeming about any of this. You know, I'm really, I'm actually torn because I,

3005
03:31:04,380 --> 03:31:13,820
man, I really like, okay, I like the idea. I like the idea of like telling a story through YouTube,

3006
03:31:13,820 --> 03:31:21,580
like with the conceit of like it, like with the self-awareness that it is being told through

3007
03:31:21,580 --> 03:31:27,660
YouTube. Like, I like the idea of like a fiction being constructed, like knowingly constructed

3008
03:31:27,660 --> 03:31:33,580
through the medium of like YouTube videos that are presented as YouTube videos. You know what I'm

3009
03:31:33,580 --> 03:31:41,260
saying? Yeah, yeah, like like like a marble hornet's bed and shit. Like spooky ARG shit. Yeah, yeah.

3010
03:31:41,260 --> 03:31:46,540
Like, like, like a character, like you're getting windows into a character, but the character is

3011
03:31:46,540 --> 03:31:52,220
presented through like the lens of like these are the YouTube videos that they make, you know?

3012
03:31:52,860 --> 03:31:58,860
Yeah. This is not, this is like trying at that, but like it's not that and it sucks and I hate it.

3013
03:31:58,860 --> 03:32:03,420
Like the whole rift, like the whole rift is like sort of that, but not really and I hate it.

3014
03:32:04,780 --> 03:32:12,140
Ben, this isn't a joke. The plot of like painting a window into a special dimension,

3015
03:32:12,220 --> 03:32:19,020
I kid you not, that was the plot of like a like right wherever you want short story I did in the

3016
03:32:19,020 --> 03:32:27,820
fifth grade. That's not a fucking joke. That's literally what the plot was. Like, it's like,

3017
03:32:28,860 --> 03:32:35,100
this is like such a, this is like such like a self-important, important, important self-important

3018
03:32:35,100 --> 03:32:41,660
story. This is such like a self-indulgent story, right? And like it's all for the grand,

3019
03:32:41,740 --> 03:32:49,980
like the grand climax of this story is that this person becomes a pony reviewer, right?

3020
03:32:51,180 --> 03:32:55,260
Like that's the, like that's the grand finale of this person's story.

3021
03:32:55,260 --> 03:32:56,940
And how grand it is.

3022
03:33:00,460 --> 03:33:08,620
She was, she was tormented, tormented by her fear of not being accepted by the analysis community

3023
03:33:08,620 --> 03:33:14,380
for being an alicorn, but she fucking rose above it. Oh god, I'm, I'm tired.

3024
03:33:14,380 --> 03:33:15,180
Christ above hate.

3025
03:33:15,180 --> 03:33:21,420
I'm tired and I can't, I'm getting, I'm actually like, I feel weak, like I feel weak and sick and hungry.

3026
03:33:22,060 --> 03:33:25,020
We haven't, we haven't even gone through the,

3027
03:33:27,740 --> 03:33:30,380
is this who I, is this who I think it is?

3028
03:33:30,380 --> 03:33:31,740
Yeah, man. Oh.

3029
03:33:31,740 --> 03:33:34,060
That's the, that's the man himself, the man in the myth.

3030
03:33:34,060 --> 03:33:34,860
It's the man himself.

3031
03:33:34,860 --> 03:33:39,180
The man in the myth, the legend. Let me, let me look at, give me a minute.

3032
03:33:39,180 --> 03:33:42,380
I need to look in my fridge and fucking find some calories to consume.

3033
03:33:43,340 --> 03:33:43,660
Okay.

3034
03:33:45,340 --> 03:33:47,020
Pause the right footage calculus here.

3035
03:33:50,540 --> 03:33:54,700
He's known for his opinion on, oh my god.

3036
03:33:55,900 --> 03:34:03,180
A notable, a notable characteristic of this, of this person is that he has an opinion.

3037
03:34:04,140 --> 03:34:06,540
He has an opinion on a word.

3038
03:34:08,140 --> 03:34:11,580
Not even that it's like a contrary, he just has a opinion.

3039
03:34:12,780 --> 03:34:19,740
He just has a, he has, no. This isn't believable.

3040
03:34:22,780 --> 03:34:25,420
Yes. Fuck yes. Jaffas.

3041
03:34:25,420 --> 03:34:25,660
Ben.

3042
03:34:25,660 --> 03:34:26,460
I got Jaffas.

3043
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:27,340
Ben. Okay, yeah.

3044
03:34:27,340 --> 03:34:27,980
Ben.

3045
03:34:27,980 --> 03:34:28,620
Yep.

3046
03:34:28,700 --> 03:34:35,020
A no, a notable characteristic of this pony has an opinion on double rainbow.

3047
03:34:36,620 --> 03:34:38,700
Hat is known for his opinion.

3048
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:39,100
Oh.

3049
03:34:39,100 --> 03:34:40,380
He has a opinion.

3050
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:43,100
Oh my fucking god, Munchie.

3051
03:34:43,100 --> 03:34:44,540
He has an opinion.

3052
03:34:45,660 --> 03:34:48,060
He, he's known for it in fact.

3053
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:48,300
Yeah.

3054
03:34:48,540 --> 03:35:02,300
I mean, I mean, I mean clearly what's meant to be communicated here is that he has like

3055
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:06,060
a notable opinion or like a controversial opinion.

3056
03:35:06,620 --> 03:35:10,140
Like that's what they're trying to say, but they didn't say it.

3057
03:35:10,540 --> 03:35:19,500
Okay. I like, okay, I like how they switch between Josh and Firebrand.

3058
03:35:19,500 --> 03:35:21,500
Okay. Firebrand is a Christian.

3059
03:35:21,500 --> 03:35:23,500
Josh formerly served in the Marines.

3060
03:35:24,220 --> 03:35:27,660
I like how both of these things are associated with JSW Connors,

3061
03:35:27,660 --> 03:35:30,700
and now I'm just going to, I'm just going to imagine that they are one and the same.

3062
03:35:30,700 --> 03:35:36,220
Wait a minute. So are they saying, so are they saying that like specifically Fire,

3063
03:35:36,220 --> 03:35:38,300
like the pony is a Christian?

3064
03:35:38,300 --> 03:35:40,940
Like not the guy, the pony is one.

3065
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:43,980
That's what it seems to be saying to me.

3066
03:35:43,980 --> 03:35:46,220
That's what my cutie mark is telling me, you might say.

3067
03:35:48,700 --> 03:35:52,700
Ink Rose and himself are shipped quite frequently in the fandom,

3068
03:35:52,700 --> 03:35:58,540
and even have two Fannin children by the name of Citrus Flossum and Morning Shine.

3069
03:35:58,540 --> 03:36:02,140
Well, Fannin, that's like the same thing as being real.

3070
03:36:02,220 --> 03:36:06,460
Yeah. So far.

3071
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:15,580
Somebody, somebody made a, oh, these Jaffas ate a whole roll of them.

3072
03:36:15,580 --> 03:36:22,140
Somebody made a drawing of keg standard and mod pie's son, and it was actually really good.

3073
03:36:22,940 --> 03:36:27,580
And it was weird. I found it on DeviantArt, and it was amidst like a bunch of other OCs

3074
03:36:28,540 --> 03:36:33,420
that like this person was not drawing like the analysis community.

3075
03:36:33,420 --> 03:36:35,820
Why that picture? Why that picture?

3076
03:36:37,580 --> 03:36:39,420
Stop everything.

3077
03:36:39,420 --> 03:36:42,140
Like this person, this person was not drawing like analysis.

3078
03:36:42,140 --> 03:36:45,340
He was drawing like kids of like in canon characters.

3079
03:36:45,340 --> 03:36:49,580
Like like the only, the only analysis personality that I saw among their work

3080
03:36:49,580 --> 03:36:54,700
was keg standard, and it was as the dad of like this son of mod pie.

3081
03:36:54,700 --> 03:36:56,700
So I don't know. And it was pretty cool too.

3082
03:36:57,340 --> 03:37:01,660
Yeah, it's pretty fucking cool. Let's see. Let's see what keg's up to.

3083
03:37:02,620 --> 03:37:07,420
Oh, why? Why don't they just fucking picture from the fucking videos?

3084
03:37:07,420 --> 03:37:11,180
Why don't they use the fucking canon art? This is Jesus.

3085
03:37:12,460 --> 03:37:16,700
Why? Like he looks like fucking garbage.

3086
03:37:16,700 --> 03:37:20,460
For him and for you are completely baffling.

3087
03:37:20,700 --> 03:37:26,380
Yeah, I just don't understand why.

3088
03:37:32,380 --> 03:37:36,380
Just nothing's here besides the fucking reference sheet and some shit part.

3089
03:37:36,380 --> 03:37:40,140
I'm fed up. I'm fed up with this world. Everybody betray me.

3090
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:47,660
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

3091
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:50,300
Okay, okay, okay.

3092
03:37:51,180 --> 03:37:53,420
Fin the pony. It's pretty good.

3093
03:37:53,420 --> 03:37:54,780
It's great. It's wonderful.

3094
03:37:55,660 --> 03:37:59,500
Might want to click on that pretty good. Vita pretty, pretty great.

3095
03:38:00,380 --> 03:38:04,780
Wait, what the fuck? I fucking erased that article. What the shit?

3096
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:09,020
Okay. Yeah, yeah, there we go. Fuck that boy.

3097
03:38:11,180 --> 03:38:14,460
He's done for a voice of reason.

3098
03:38:14,540 --> 03:38:19,100
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Master of the Rift.

3099
03:38:19,100 --> 03:38:22,620
The master. Ink is his apprentice.

3100
03:38:22,620 --> 03:38:25,020
Voice has a darker side called horror.

3101
03:38:27,580 --> 03:38:30,460
Sentience in a physical form and he now lives with Koi.

3102
03:38:30,460 --> 03:38:33,180
Can I see a picture? I want to fucking see horror score.

3103
03:38:34,140 --> 03:38:35,100
Well, there he is.

3104
03:38:37,100 --> 03:38:39,980
Voice of reason protecting his girlfriends.

3105
03:38:41,180 --> 03:38:44,140
Oh, Sega sisters, his girlfriend. That's beautiful.

3106
03:38:44,540 --> 03:38:47,020
That's beautiful. I saw her on the female list.

3107
03:38:47,020 --> 03:38:47,900
I need to, I need to-

3108
03:38:47,900 --> 03:38:53,260
Sega sister. Sega sister. Oh, my.

3109
03:38:53,260 --> 03:38:55,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me see, let me see.

3110
03:38:55,660 --> 03:38:56,140
Look.

3111
03:38:56,140 --> 03:38:59,580
That's her. That's her. There she is. There she fucking is.

3112
03:39:00,700 --> 03:39:03,020
Can I see, can I see an image, please?

3113
03:39:04,060 --> 03:39:09,340
Okay, so she's just Ink Rose. Like, like her pony is just Ink Rose.

3114
03:39:11,660 --> 03:39:13,980
Yeah, it's just red.

3115
03:39:15,100 --> 03:39:15,660
And brown.

3116
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:18,300
Why?

3117
03:39:21,900 --> 03:39:23,100
Why was this conceived?

3118
03:39:27,260 --> 03:39:29,260
Sega sister is heteroflexible.

3119
03:39:30,220 --> 03:39:30,460
What?

3120
03:39:33,420 --> 03:39:33,740
What?

3121
03:39:37,340 --> 03:39:39,100
I'm, it's heteroflexible.

3122
03:39:39,100 --> 03:39:40,300
Okay, please. Fucking.

3123
03:39:41,180 --> 03:39:46,140
Oh, I'm going to puke. I'm going to throw up, I'm going to throw up and die.

3124
03:39:47,500 --> 03:39:51,100
Those, I ate a whole, I ate a whole roll of jaffas and it wasn't enough.

3125
03:39:52,380 --> 03:39:57,740
Do you like how this unironically has way more like stuff on it than the PCP wiki?

3126
03:39:58,620 --> 03:40:06,540
Um, man, I don't fucking get, I don't fucking get the priorities of the people making the PCP wiki.

3127
03:40:07,260 --> 03:40:09,900
I just want to make shitty memes.

3128
03:40:09,900 --> 03:40:15,100
Yeah, it's, it's, oh my god, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love.

3129
03:40:15,100 --> 03:40:17,900
I've seen that guy, I've seen that guy before.

3130
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:19,340
I'm in love.

3131
03:40:19,340 --> 03:40:22,140
Okay, after this guy, we got to check out Dr. Fowl.

3132
03:40:22,860 --> 03:40:23,340
Okay.

3133
03:40:24,780 --> 03:40:25,980
A YouTube channel.

3134
03:40:25,980 --> 03:40:26,860
The Looney Turtle.

3135
03:40:26,860 --> 03:40:30,620
Eric, Eric the Human and Looney the Turtle. Oh, they collaborate. Oh, he's like hippo.

3136
03:40:31,660 --> 03:40:32,780
Oh, he's only 19.

3137
03:40:32,780 --> 03:40:35,260
Oh, it's just like, I gotta see this guy.

3138
03:40:35,420 --> 03:40:36,540
I gotta see this guy.

3139
03:40:36,540 --> 03:40:36,780
Yeah.

3140
03:40:38,220 --> 03:40:38,460
Okay.

3141
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:40,220
Oh, he has the same birthday.

3142
03:40:40,220 --> 03:40:40,300
Okay.

3143
03:40:40,300 --> 03:40:41,260
Isn't this curious?

3144
03:40:41,260 --> 03:40:44,700
How does he not, okay, that's a fucking injustice.

3145
03:40:44,700 --> 03:40:49,100
What the, well, he's not a, well, he doesn't, Munchy, he doesn't have a pony avatar.

3146
03:40:49,660 --> 03:40:50,300
He shouldn't.

3147
03:40:50,300 --> 03:40:51,100
Oh, okay.

3148
03:40:51,100 --> 03:40:54,140
He should never be, he should never even come close to this place.

3149
03:40:56,940 --> 03:40:58,780
It's sacred, it's sacred ground.

3150
03:40:58,780 --> 03:40:59,820
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3151
03:41:01,740 --> 03:41:04,940
One of, every one of this MLP analysis videos has the line,

3152
03:41:04,940 --> 03:41:05,980
hello interwebs.

3153
03:41:05,980 --> 03:41:08,140
I'm Eric and welcome to the Looney Turtle.

3154
03:41:12,540 --> 03:41:14,780
I want to see, I want to see, I want to see.

3155
03:41:14,780 --> 03:41:15,660
I'm interested.

3156
03:41:15,660 --> 03:41:17,020
You peak my curiosity.

3157
03:41:17,580 --> 03:41:19,660
Oh, my fucking god, this banner.

3158
03:41:19,660 --> 03:41:21,740
Look at him, look at him on the left there.

3159
03:41:21,740 --> 03:41:23,340
He looks ridiculous.

3160
03:41:23,340 --> 03:41:24,700
He looks fucking ridiculous.

3161
03:41:24,700 --> 03:41:26,540
He's at 34,000 subs.

3162
03:41:28,940 --> 03:41:34,220
Did you see that fucking lip syncing?

3163
03:41:35,340 --> 03:41:35,580
Yeah.

3164
03:41:40,620 --> 03:41:41,260
This is like,

3165
03:41:46,700 --> 03:41:50,460
this is like, okay, imagine if you, if you like, if you like,

3166
03:41:50,460 --> 03:41:52,300
you like kidnapped hippo, right?

3167
03:41:52,300 --> 03:41:52,620
Yeah.

3168
03:41:52,620 --> 03:41:55,820
Like, like, like, like he kidnapped him and he can do whatever you want with him.

3169
03:41:55,820 --> 03:41:58,620
And, and he took him and took him to a special factory.

3170
03:41:59,180 --> 03:42:04,540
And, and, and you, and you mixed together like all the worst parts about humanity

3171
03:42:05,180 --> 03:42:11,740
and all the most naive, awful, horrible, horrible aspects of, of, of, of like 2010,

3172
03:42:11,740 --> 03:42:13,260
like reviewer culture.

3173
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:17,740
And, and, and you like, you like tossed them in that you tossed them in there into the meat grinder.

3174
03:42:17,740 --> 03:42:24,860
And what came out is, is this disgusting hamburger of, of, of, of just, just awful,

3175
03:42:24,860 --> 03:42:26,700
awful, it's awful, it's awful.

3176
03:42:26,700 --> 03:42:29,900
It's like, man, I don't know.

3177
03:42:31,020 --> 03:42:32,620
Six hours ago.

3178
03:42:32,620 --> 03:42:42,380
I look, I look at this and I'm like, man, fucking anyone, fucking anyone can fucking make it on

3179
03:42:42,380 --> 03:42:47,500
YouTube if this, like, they just talk about the right things and they have like a, like,

3180
03:42:47,500 --> 03:42:49,180
all he had to do was draw a turtle.

3181
03:42:49,180 --> 03:42:52,140
Like he drew a turtle and he was, he had it fucking was made.

3182
03:42:52,140 --> 03:42:53,100
Like that, that was it.

3183
03:42:53,100 --> 03:42:53,580
He did it.

3184
03:42:53,580 --> 03:42:54,780
Like he, he did it.

3185
03:42:54,860 --> 03:42:57,980
You know, I guess he probably got his, he got a little bump.

3186
03:42:57,980 --> 03:43:01,420
He probably got that initial pony bump and then he just moved on.

3187
03:43:02,300 --> 03:43:03,020
I don't know.

3188
03:43:03,020 --> 03:43:05,180
Does there, I mean, am I crazy?

3189
03:43:05,180 --> 03:43:09,580
Do I, am I seeing, does there seem to you to be anything fucking like interesting or

3190
03:43:09,580 --> 03:43:12,300
notable about like his comedy at all?

3191
03:43:12,300 --> 03:43:12,620
No.

3192
03:43:12,620 --> 03:43:16,540
Like it looks like any other fucking goofy, shitty comedy,

3193
03:43:16,540 --> 03:43:18,940
fagotry that you'd see on any other channel.

3194
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:20,220
That's what I'm fucking seeing.

3195
03:43:20,220 --> 03:43:21,100
That's what I see.

3196
03:43:21,180 --> 03:43:24,300
Exactly the same as fucking everything else we've seen tonight.

3197
03:43:25,980 --> 03:43:31,500
A, a, a podcast known as Bro Talk, you know, the Rattyfuckers Cop Killers doesn't have the,

3198
03:43:31,500 --> 03:43:35,340
the unique and instantly recognizable branding that Bro Talk has.

3199
03:43:38,700 --> 03:43:41,020
I love the Rattyfuckers Cop Killers, dude.

3200
03:43:41,020 --> 03:43:42,300
I fucking, I need it.

3201
03:43:42,300 --> 03:43:43,340
It's, it's perfect.

3202
03:43:43,340 --> 03:43:43,900
I need it.

3203
03:43:43,900 --> 03:43:47,020
I'm glad we're not just besmirching it at all.

3204
03:43:47,980 --> 03:43:48,620
I'm, I'm gonna see.

3205
03:43:51,660 --> 03:43:55,900
I want to see how many views Bro Talk gets.

3206
03:43:59,020 --> 03:44:00,620
I want to get into the anime James.

3207
03:44:00,620 --> 03:44:01,980
Who's the guy you wanted to see?

3208
03:44:01,980 --> 03:44:02,940
Dr. Fowl.

3209
03:44:02,940 --> 03:44:03,660
Yeah, Dr. Fowl.

3210
03:44:03,660 --> 03:44:06,780
Oh my God, he's, he's perfect.

3211
03:44:08,060 --> 03:44:09,180
He looks really good.

3212
03:44:10,060 --> 03:44:11,420
He looks really good.

3213
03:44:12,060 --> 03:44:12,860
Yeah, he looks.

3214
03:44:15,900 --> 03:44:16,300
Look at it.

3215
03:44:16,940 --> 03:44:17,820
Look at his tail.

3216
03:44:19,980 --> 03:44:20,940
This is incredible.

3217
03:44:21,020 --> 03:44:23,580
Dr. Fowl's den for the mentally impaired.

3218
03:44:27,260 --> 03:44:28,380
What's your problem?

3219
03:44:29,260 --> 03:44:30,060
He's great.

3220
03:44:30,780 --> 03:44:31,980
He's fucking great.

3221
03:44:32,540 --> 03:44:37,500
Is this guy like, like a parody of Dr. Hold on.

3222
03:44:37,500 --> 03:44:40,700
I think he may be like a satire.

3223
03:44:45,180 --> 03:44:46,380
No, you know what?

3224
03:44:47,340 --> 03:44:48,780
He's not a satire.

3225
03:44:48,780 --> 03:44:53,180
He's just like, he's just like, he's just a fucking regular ass pony faggot.

3226
03:44:53,180 --> 03:44:57,980
He's just got like, he's just got like a slightly like kind of quirky and like

3227
03:44:57,980 --> 03:45:00,860
unself-serious kind of like humorous edge to him.

3228
03:45:02,220 --> 03:45:04,860
Oh yeah, he's the head honcho of the chicken brigade.

3229
03:45:06,940 --> 03:45:08,540
Ah, shit.

3230
03:45:08,540 --> 03:45:13,900
Yeah, he's not, he's like, he's like, he's like half a notch above your regular

3231
03:45:13,900 --> 03:45:22,140
fucking pony guy, but like he's not, he's not like, he's still, he's still one of them.

3232
03:45:23,180 --> 03:45:25,100
He's so cool and aloof.

3233
03:45:25,100 --> 03:45:26,780
He's, he's still one of them though.

3234
03:45:27,420 --> 03:45:29,340
I really wanted to like him.

3235
03:45:29,340 --> 03:45:33,580
Yeah, like I really, I really wanted this guy's whole existence to just,

3236
03:45:33,580 --> 03:45:35,260
I wanted him to be another Kimmy Sparkle.

3237
03:45:35,260 --> 03:45:37,740
I wanted him to be just be taking the piss out of the whole thing.

3238
03:45:40,220 --> 03:45:41,340
Dr. Fowl.

3239
03:45:42,220 --> 03:45:43,420
Oh my fucking god.

3240
03:45:44,140 --> 03:45:45,340
That would have been incredible.

3241
03:45:46,060 --> 03:45:51,100
Dr. Fowl, if you're watching this, please, please, please take a red pill, join the PCP.

3242
03:45:53,100 --> 03:45:53,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3243
03:45:53,740 --> 03:45:54,940
Don't go back, don't go back.

3244
03:45:54,940 --> 03:45:56,220
Dr. Fowl's backstory.

3245
03:45:56,220 --> 03:45:57,260
No, you fucking nerd.

3246
03:45:58,940 --> 03:46:03,580
Dr. Fowl's backstory, it is said he hails from the life being a stone of,

3247
03:46:03,580 --> 03:46:06,620
a stone bird that shattered to create life on the, okay, first of all,

3248
03:46:06,620 --> 03:46:09,020
this is written like a fucking grade schooler.

3249
03:46:09,020 --> 03:46:12,300
The byproduct of this being the energy that brought the rift into B.

3250
03:46:12,300 --> 03:46:14,940
Oh, his backstory is about the rift.

3251
03:46:14,940 --> 03:46:17,660
After a few iterations, Hephaestus, what?

3252
03:46:17,660 --> 03:46:20,540
Dr. Fowl was formed from the egg of his father's soul,

3253
03:46:20,540 --> 03:46:24,540
when it split off into two entities, Dr. Fowl and King Cocklesworth.

3254
03:46:24,540 --> 03:46:28,300
The bronalysis king born of the egg formed by the second Hephaestus.

3255
03:46:28,300 --> 03:46:30,140
Well, Dr. Fowl stayed in the present.

3256
03:46:30,140 --> 03:46:33,740
King Cocklesworth went into the future and ran the world as its king.

3257
03:46:33,740 --> 03:46:34,540
Did Dr. Fowl solve-

3258
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:36,940
This is kind of like incredible.

3259
03:46:36,940 --> 03:46:38,780
Yeah, it is actually.

3260
03:46:38,780 --> 03:46:41,900
Dr. Fowl saw the world and thought that he would take the form of a pony

3261
03:46:41,900 --> 03:46:42,700
to try to fit in.

3262
03:46:42,700 --> 03:46:46,540
But after growing a distaste for the content created by the people around him,

3263
03:46:46,540 --> 03:46:49,820
he took it upon himself to shed his pony form and take upon his true form.

3264
03:46:49,820 --> 03:46:50,780
What does he mean?

3265
03:46:50,780 --> 03:46:53,420
What does he fucking mean, his distaste for the content?

3266
03:46:53,420 --> 03:46:55,500
How fucking deep does this rabbit hole go?

3267
03:46:56,940 --> 03:46:58,060
We have to watch a video.

3268
03:46:58,060 --> 03:46:58,620
Yeah, we do.

3269
03:46:58,620 --> 03:46:59,500
Yeah, we do.

3270
03:46:59,500 --> 03:47:02,140
If there's like a lore video, we have to fucking watch that.

3271
03:47:04,540 --> 03:47:05,340
Fowl play.

3272
03:47:06,620 --> 03:47:08,220
407 subscribers.

3273
03:47:08,780 --> 03:47:11,020
Uh, the Hephaestus story?

3274
03:47:11,020 --> 03:47:13,420
Day 6, the birth time of the king!

3275
03:47:13,420 --> 03:47:14,140
Wait, wait, wait.

3276
03:47:14,140 --> 03:47:14,700
How fucking-

3277
03:47:15,820 --> 03:47:17,500
The Hephaestus story full.

3278
03:47:17,500 --> 03:47:18,460
Oh my god.

3279
03:47:18,460 --> 03:47:20,060
The Hephaestus story full.

3280
03:47:20,060 --> 03:47:21,100
Oh my god.

3281
03:47:21,100 --> 03:47:21,580
Jesus.

3282
03:47:23,260 --> 03:47:24,220
Jesus Christ.

3283
03:47:26,940 --> 03:47:28,220
Full screen that shit, dude.

3284
03:47:30,220 --> 03:47:32,700
In the beginning, there was the life lead.

3285
03:47:33,420 --> 03:47:38,300
An entity of unimaginable power that infused the planet with its spirit.

3286
03:47:39,340 --> 03:47:42,300
This caused the life being to the common state.

3287
03:47:43,020 --> 03:47:44,620
Causing its body to spit on-

3288
03:47:44,620 --> 03:47:45,340
Look at that!

3289
03:47:45,340 --> 03:47:49,820
Into many shards named the Aesthetes, throughout the omnivores.

3290
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:54,540
These rune stones were not the only thing coming from the life being.

3291
03:47:55,100 --> 03:48:01,020
But underneath the rune stone shelf was the icon, the lane of light and darkness.

3292
03:48:01,820 --> 03:48:06,220
And on the small tracks that the lean stone climbs with a glop of icon,

3293
03:48:06,860 --> 03:48:10,860
it falls into a beam known as the Wayfarer.

3294
03:48:11,580 --> 03:48:18,540
One of these Wayfarers is known as Hephaestus, or the Bird of Passage.

3295
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:24,300
Landing on a world in the taker and mummaging that doesn't clean us.

3296
03:48:24,300 --> 03:48:32,300
We are spoken as a journey of good, and, and not, and death, and everything between.

3297
03:48:35,420 --> 03:48:37,180
We were completely wrong about this guy.

3298
03:48:37,180 --> 03:48:38,060
Yeah, yeah.

3299
03:48:38,620 --> 03:48:42,380
Hephaestus took the form of a glowing white, ancient silhouette.

3300
03:48:43,100 --> 03:48:45,820
Traversing the barren planet, creating more-

3301
03:48:45,820 --> 03:48:47,180
I can't believe this.

3302
03:48:47,180 --> 03:48:48,540
More life he created.

3303
03:48:48,540 --> 03:48:50,860
I cannot fucking believe this.

3304
03:48:51,980 --> 03:48:53,020
I'm so delighted.

3305
03:48:53,100 --> 03:48:55,420
We've got to get this guy on the PCB.

3306
03:48:56,060 --> 03:48:58,300
He's got to be on an episode.

3307
03:48:58,300 --> 03:48:58,940
He's got-

3308
03:48:58,940 --> 03:49:02,460
Dude, we should fucking get him on the next Rowdyfuckers cop killers.

3309
03:49:03,020 --> 03:49:03,900
Yes, we should!

3310
03:49:04,540 --> 03:49:12,540
Mermaids and Sphinxes, one of his neoterics, a harpy known as Shine, caught his interest.

3311
03:49:12,540 --> 03:49:15,580
And after a short time together, they fell in love.

3312
03:49:15,580 --> 03:49:19,420
In a way to prolong Hephaestus' fate from existence,

3313
03:49:19,420 --> 03:49:22,540
the two merged their forms into an egg.

3314
03:49:23,740 --> 03:49:29,100
The egg combined with Hephaestus and the neoteric Shine laid dormant-

3315
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:31,420
This is some high-level Christ consciousness shit.

3316
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:34,940
Doing this stuff, the world began to develop.

3317
03:49:34,940 --> 03:49:36,540
This is super fucking-

3318
03:49:36,540 --> 03:49:38,140
This is super Greenpill.

3319
03:49:38,140 --> 03:49:41,900
And neither the two alicorn descendants of the neoterics.

3320
03:49:42,620 --> 03:49:48,060
Nearing the end of the a thousand years, the alicorns fought with a strong foe.

3321
03:49:48,700 --> 03:49:54,620
The energy of the battle caused the egg to hatch into Hephaestus, the second.

3322
03:49:55,260 --> 03:50:00,780
And gave the alicorns one day, capable only of observation.

3323
03:50:01,740 --> 03:50:05,260
Hephaestus the second began watching the world form,

3324
03:50:05,260 --> 03:50:08,540
and noticed a cave on the side of a large mountain.

3325
03:50:09,340 --> 03:50:15,740
In said cave was a wormhole into a space-like plane filled with floating rocks.

3326
03:50:16,620 --> 03:50:20,700
This plane seemed to connect many, many planes.

3327
03:50:21,420 --> 03:50:27,180
Suddenly, Hephaestus the second noticed a strange energy emanating from the whip.

3328
03:50:28,060 --> 03:50:30,060
Noticing the danger in the situation.

3329
03:50:31,580 --> 03:50:34,620
Used some of his power in an attempt to see-

3330
03:50:34,620 --> 03:50:35,900
This is the greatest-

3331
03:50:35,900 --> 03:50:39,740
This is the greatest development in the history of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers.

3332
03:50:39,740 --> 03:50:43,660
In the long and storied history of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers program.

3333
03:50:45,740 --> 03:50:47,900
Hephaestus took its toll on Hephaestus.

3334
03:50:47,900 --> 03:50:51,820
His body was weak and he had taken too much with energy.

3335
03:50:51,820 --> 03:50:57,100
His body shook as his soul left his body, splitting into two miles of purple light.

3336
03:50:58,060 --> 03:50:59,020
Why were they purple?

3337
03:50:59,020 --> 03:51:01,340
The light formed into egg shapes.

3338
03:51:02,140 --> 03:51:09,740
One disappeared through time, and the other merged with the limp, lifeless body of Hephaestus the second.

3339
03:51:10,540 --> 03:51:13,820
Hephaestus the second's body glowed and morphed into a new-

3340
03:51:13,900 --> 03:51:17,180
His own soul came out of him, split into two,

3341
03:51:17,180 --> 03:51:20,700
and then half of it went back into him and turned him into an egg.

3342
03:51:20,700 --> 03:51:23,900
The energy from the soul egg traveling through time

3343
03:51:23,900 --> 03:51:28,220
caused the rift hole to move to one of the many microplates.

3344
03:51:28,940 --> 03:51:33,900
The soul egg's destination, five thousand years into the future,

3345
03:51:33,900 --> 03:51:37,980
a land in which one hundred seasons of my little pony had aired.

3346
03:51:38,620 --> 03:51:43,180
It had formed into a humanoid body with a chicken's head.

3347
03:51:44,220 --> 03:51:49,340
After a brief glow, this Hephaestus remembered his past.

3348
03:51:49,340 --> 03:51:51,900
Alongside an ability to see specific errors.

3349
03:51:51,900 --> 03:51:53,340
Now we're getting real.

3350
03:51:53,340 --> 03:51:56,460
In detail, using this knowledge,

3351
03:51:56,460 --> 03:52:01,900
he quickly rose to become a respected figure in the future world,

3352
03:52:01,900 --> 03:52:05,340
eventually becoming crowned as King Cockroach.

3353
03:52:07,100 --> 03:52:11,580
In the past, the egg hatched into Hephaestus the second,

3354
03:52:11,580 --> 03:52:14,540
after flying around and seeing how much life had changed,

3355
03:52:14,540 --> 03:52:17,820
he overheard a bearded pony still in the past,

3356
03:52:17,820 --> 03:52:21,100
and learning the alicorns had taken a few liberties

3357
03:52:21,100 --> 03:52:23,580
aligning up the neoterics and Hephaestuses,

3358
03:52:24,300 --> 03:52:29,020
writing their names down as Hephaestus Applebee's Juniper Moonberry.

3359
03:52:29,820 --> 03:52:33,660
This Hephaestus decided in protest to this blasphemy

3360
03:52:33,660 --> 03:52:36,140
to make this his true name,

3361
03:52:37,020 --> 03:52:41,420
becoming known as Hephaestus Applebee's Juniper Moonberry.

3362
03:52:41,420 --> 03:52:44,380
Now it is known as Hephaestus Applebee's Juniper Moonberry,

3363
03:52:44,380 --> 03:52:47,660
through his aeus, Dr. Fowl.

3364
03:52:47,660 --> 03:52:50,220
Oh. Oh my god.

3365
03:52:50,220 --> 03:52:52,220
That's it. We did it.

3366
03:52:53,340 --> 03:52:54,380
Now we know.

3367
03:52:54,380 --> 03:52:57,820
He's everything, Munchie.

3368
03:52:57,820 --> 03:52:58,940
He's perfect.

3369
03:52:58,940 --> 03:53:00,620
He's a perfect human.

3370
03:53:00,620 --> 03:53:01,820
He's perfect.

3371
03:53:01,820 --> 03:53:04,540
He's the next evolution.

3372
03:53:11,740 --> 03:53:14,620
Wait, King Cocklesworth teaches you about the future.

3373
03:53:16,060 --> 03:53:17,180
Bottom right, bottom right.

3374
03:53:19,580 --> 03:53:20,620
This is important.

3375
03:53:22,700 --> 03:53:23,900
It's like a merit launch.

3376
03:53:23,900 --> 03:53:28,940
Hello. It is I, King Cocklesworth, and welcome to the King's...

3377
03:53:28,940 --> 03:53:30,780
This guy watches Jesse.

3378
03:53:30,780 --> 03:53:31,900
Did you know?

3379
03:53:31,900 --> 03:53:32,620
Yeah, he does.

3380
03:53:32,620 --> 03:53:35,420
King Cocklesworth. I'm from the future.

3381
03:53:35,420 --> 03:53:41,100
Yes. In the year 4000, we have had around 1000.

3382
03:53:41,340 --> 03:53:44,380
And 900 seasons of my little pony.

3383
03:53:44,380 --> 03:53:47,020
Each one has gotten better.

3384
03:53:48,780 --> 03:53:52,460
The show has gotten so good that they have transcended

3385
03:53:52,460 --> 03:53:54,300
and found peace in the plain beyond.

3386
03:53:55,100 --> 03:53:58,540
For me, though, well, I can't ascend just yet.

3387
03:53:58,540 --> 03:54:02,060
I have a kingdom to rule, and pitch is to take care of.

3388
03:54:02,060 --> 03:54:03,980
Like a dorky and linda.

3389
03:54:04,620 --> 03:54:09,420
I have to learn what is left of the brony analysis community.

3390
03:54:09,420 --> 03:54:12,540
I mean, I'm the third in a very prestigious line

3391
03:54:12,540 --> 03:54:14,700
dating back to the origins of the world.

3392
03:54:15,340 --> 03:54:20,380
I even inherited my name from the OG Hephaestus.

3393
03:54:20,380 --> 03:54:21,900
So I am very important.

3394
03:54:22,780 --> 03:54:25,340
He's like...

3395
03:54:26,780 --> 03:54:27,500
I'm in love.

3396
03:54:28,380 --> 03:54:34,140
He like rides the line so carefully and like so elegantly.

3397
03:54:35,020 --> 03:54:37,900
Like completely totally like unhinged.

3398
03:54:37,900 --> 03:54:38,940
You know what?

3399
03:54:38,940 --> 03:54:43,740
Like reading his description on the wiki just really did not do him justice.

3400
03:54:43,740 --> 03:54:44,060
Yeah.

3401
03:54:45,900 --> 03:54:46,700
Hold on.

3402
03:54:46,700 --> 03:54:48,780
He totally fucking watches Jesse.

3403
03:54:48,780 --> 03:54:50,540
Like there's no bones of that.

3404
03:54:50,540 --> 03:54:51,180
Yeah, yeah.

3405
03:54:51,180 --> 03:54:51,900
He's that's...

3406
03:54:51,900 --> 03:54:53,260
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3407
03:54:56,220 --> 03:54:58,300
Wait. Featured channels.

3408
03:54:58,300 --> 03:54:59,580
Lethal Aurora Mage.

3409
03:55:01,100 --> 03:55:01,900
Antony C.

3410
03:55:03,340 --> 03:55:04,060
Shelley D.

3411
03:55:04,860 --> 03:55:05,500
Huh.

3412
03:55:06,060 --> 03:55:06,300
What?

3413
03:55:07,100 --> 03:55:08,220
Corpulent Brony?

3414
03:55:09,100 --> 03:55:09,820
How I wonder...

3415
03:55:09,820 --> 03:55:12,780
Wait, I wonder if Mage knows this guy.

3416
03:55:12,780 --> 03:55:15,100
I wonder if Mage fucking knows this guy.

3417
03:55:15,100 --> 03:55:15,820
I'm gonna ask her.

3418
03:55:15,820 --> 03:55:18,620
If so, why hasn't she fucking shown us?

3419
03:55:18,620 --> 03:55:25,980
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking ask her right now and then kill her.

3420
03:55:27,100 --> 03:55:28,540
Have you seen this bird?

3421
03:55:35,020 --> 03:55:39,020
Whoa.

3422
03:55:39,020 --> 03:55:42,940
Okay, there's like one that's like said inside Dr. Wolf's thing.

3423
03:55:47,260 --> 03:55:48,460
Oh, okay, it's like...

3424
03:55:49,660 --> 03:55:51,500
It's like a remix of The Grinch or something.

3425
03:56:00,380 --> 03:56:00,860
I just...

3426
03:56:01,580 --> 03:56:04,220
Yeah, this guy is totally...

3427
03:56:04,220 --> 03:56:06,780
I'm gonna go fucking subscribe right now.

3428
03:56:06,780 --> 03:56:07,980
Yeah, do it.

3429
03:56:09,980 --> 03:56:15,260
I'm reading the lyrics of this like Mr. Grinch parody song he made about himself.

3430
03:56:15,260 --> 03:56:16,460
And he's totally...

3431
03:56:16,460 --> 03:56:22,620
Like the inspiration for this character was literally just he hated Dr. Wolf so fucking much.

3432
03:56:24,620 --> 03:56:25,420
Are you sure?

3433
03:56:27,420 --> 03:56:29,020
Look at the lyrics on screen right now.

3434
03:56:29,740 --> 03:56:32,620
Oh, oh god.

3435
03:56:35,340 --> 03:56:37,340
Wait, he says...

3436
03:56:39,340 --> 03:56:40,220
I'm not...

3437
03:56:40,220 --> 03:56:41,100
I don't know, man.

3438
03:56:41,820 --> 03:56:42,460
I'm not sure.

3439
03:56:42,460 --> 03:56:44,140
It sounds kind of like he's making...

3440
03:56:44,140 --> 03:56:48,860
He's making unflattering comparisons of himself to Dr. Wolf.

3441
03:56:48,860 --> 03:56:51,020
Like he's a bad version of Dr. Wolf.

3442
03:56:51,020 --> 03:56:52,220
Like Dr. Wolf is good.

3443
03:56:54,140 --> 03:56:54,780
I...

3444
03:56:54,780 --> 03:56:55,660
I don't know, man.

3445
03:56:56,620 --> 03:56:58,300
I'm not sure.

3446
03:56:58,300 --> 03:56:58,860
I'm not...

3447
03:56:58,860 --> 03:57:00,060
Like I'm actually not sure.

3448
03:57:00,060 --> 03:57:01,020
Like I want...

3449
03:57:01,020 --> 03:57:03,420
I want to believe that this guy is good.

3450
03:57:04,540 --> 03:57:05,420
But I don't know.

3451
03:57:05,980 --> 03:57:06,460
I could...

3452
03:57:06,460 --> 03:57:07,180
He could...

3453
03:57:07,180 --> 03:57:09,020
It could all just be a happy accident.

3454
03:57:11,740 --> 03:57:12,300
Could he be...

3455
03:57:12,300 --> 03:57:13,100
Like could such a...

3456
03:57:13,100 --> 03:57:13,260
Could such a genius...

3457
03:57:13,260 --> 03:57:16,380
The freest you could store other drawings while the sky says a therapist.

3458
03:57:16,380 --> 03:57:17,820
I feel like that has to be like...

3459
03:57:17,820 --> 03:57:18,940
No, but then he says...

3460
03:57:18,940 --> 03:57:22,060
Yeah, but he also says you just copied your show from the wolf.

3461
03:57:22,060 --> 03:57:23,180
Oh fuck.

3462
03:57:23,180 --> 03:57:23,500
Yeah.

3463
03:57:23,500 --> 03:57:28,860
Oh shit.

3464
03:57:29,980 --> 03:57:34,620
You're a fake gynecologist and psychologist chicken who thinks he's a god.

3465
03:57:35,500 --> 03:57:36,620
Uh...

3466
03:57:36,620 --> 03:57:37,100
Uh...

3467
03:57:40,140 --> 03:57:40,460
It's...

3468
03:57:41,420 --> 03:57:41,660
It's...

3469
03:57:42,380 --> 03:57:44,940
Man, that fucking backstory was so good though.

3470
03:57:46,620 --> 03:57:47,340
He...

3471
03:57:47,340 --> 03:57:51,660
This is the most perplexing thing I've ever fucking seen for my fucking life.

3472
03:57:51,660 --> 03:57:51,980
Yeah.

3473
03:57:53,660 --> 03:57:53,980
It's...

3474
03:57:55,820 --> 03:57:56,940
It's so...

3475
03:57:56,940 --> 03:57:58,380
I ju- I just can't tell.

3476
03:57:59,020 --> 03:57:59,420
No, I can't.

3477
03:57:59,420 --> 03:58:00,540
I just can't tell.

3478
03:58:00,540 --> 03:58:01,820
I feel like...

3479
03:58:01,820 --> 03:58:02,380
I don't know.

3480
03:58:02,380 --> 03:58:03,660
I'm kinda inclined...

3481
03:58:03,660 --> 03:58:05,500
I'm kind of inclined to believe...

3482
03:58:07,500 --> 03:58:10,140
That he is retarded, but like there's like glimmers.

3483
03:58:10,140 --> 03:58:13,340
There's like glimmers of understanding just starting to emerge there.

3484
03:58:14,220 --> 03:58:14,540
Yeah.

3485
03:58:18,940 --> 03:58:19,420
Hmm.

3486
03:58:20,620 --> 03:58:21,340
I fucking...

3487
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:23,260
I fucking admire this guy's like...

3488
03:58:23,740 --> 03:58:25,500
Drive to like do this.

3489
03:58:26,140 --> 03:58:26,860
Like he's...

3490
03:58:26,860 --> 03:58:28,380
He's doing something different.

3491
03:58:28,380 --> 03:58:29,820
I really appreciate that.

3492
03:58:31,260 --> 03:58:32,140
Like does he...

3493
03:58:32,140 --> 03:58:32,620
Wait.

3494
03:58:32,620 --> 03:58:33,260
Wait a minute.

3495
03:58:35,420 --> 03:58:35,980
He doesn't...

3496
03:58:37,180 --> 03:58:40,700
He doesn't even have any like episode reviews.

3497
03:58:41,820 --> 03:58:42,460
He doesn't.

3498
03:58:44,540 --> 03:58:45,900
So like what is he?

3499
03:58:47,100 --> 03:58:48,620
What is his purpose?

3500
03:58:49,820 --> 03:58:50,460
He's got a...

3501
03:58:50,460 --> 03:58:52,700
He's got a couple like podcasts.

3502
03:58:53,580 --> 03:58:54,060
Let's see.

3503
03:58:58,780 --> 03:58:59,260
Hold on.

3504
03:59:00,060 --> 03:59:00,620
Our play...

3505
03:59:02,300 --> 03:59:04,380
Oh, I guess this is like a let's play?

3506
03:59:06,060 --> 03:59:06,220
Yeah.

3507
03:59:06,220 --> 03:59:06,460
Okay.

3508
03:59:06,460 --> 03:59:06,700
Okay.

3509
03:59:06,700 --> 03:59:07,820
It's like a let's play.

3510
03:59:07,820 --> 03:59:08,140
Okay.

3511
03:59:09,020 --> 03:59:09,820
Okay.

3512
03:59:09,820 --> 03:59:10,540
There was some like...

3513
03:59:10,540 --> 03:59:12,940
Actually, it was Dungeon and Dragons.

3514
03:59:13,820 --> 03:59:16,540
His latest videos is like a Brony RPG,

3515
03:59:16,540 --> 03:59:20,220
which I assume is like a D&D podcast thing or something.

3516
03:59:21,020 --> 03:59:21,340
Yeah.

3517
03:59:24,460 --> 03:59:25,500
Yeah.

3518
03:59:26,700 --> 03:59:27,100
Okay.

3519
03:59:30,140 --> 03:59:31,180
Skimming through this.

3520
03:59:31,820 --> 03:59:32,220
Okay.

3521
03:59:32,220 --> 03:59:32,540
Okay.

3522
03:59:32,540 --> 03:59:32,780
Okay.

3523
03:59:32,780 --> 03:59:33,100
Okay.

3524
03:59:33,100 --> 03:59:33,900
Okay.

3525
03:59:33,900 --> 03:59:35,180
Here's what I think.

3526
03:59:36,380 --> 03:59:40,700
This is either like a Jayce Conner sort of like deep cover troll.

3527
03:59:41,660 --> 03:59:43,740
Or he's like...

3528
03:59:44,860 --> 03:59:46,700
He's like a hyper-autist.

3529
03:59:46,700 --> 03:59:49,500
Like not just like we've never seen before.

3530
03:59:50,460 --> 03:59:56,380
Like like like like and he really has like insane like tapestry woven in his fucking head.

3531
03:59:56,380 --> 04:00:00,140
And that just just just just still happens to be to be funny to us.

3532
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:01,340
Yeah.

3533
04:00:01,340 --> 04:00:02,380
For all the reasons he intends.

3534
04:00:03,420 --> 04:00:03,740
Yeah.

3535
04:00:05,740 --> 04:00:05,980
It's...

3536
04:00:08,060 --> 04:00:10,540
I just I can't I can't get a read on the guy.

3537
04:00:11,500 --> 04:00:12,060
I think...

3538
04:00:12,060 --> 04:00:14,140
We have to fucking talk to him.

3539
04:00:14,140 --> 04:00:14,780
We have to.

3540
04:00:16,540 --> 04:00:18,700
Yeah, I think if we're ever gonna if we're ever...

3541
04:00:18,700 --> 04:00:20,060
It's the only way to know for sure.

3542
04:00:20,860 --> 04:00:21,340
Yeah.

3543
04:00:21,340 --> 04:00:23,340
Wait, what is Dr. Fowle's birthday party?

3544
04:00:23,340 --> 04:00:24,860
It's five minutes long.

3545
04:00:24,860 --> 04:00:26,060
It's probably another song.

3546
04:00:27,260 --> 04:00:27,900
Yeah, probably.

3547
04:00:34,460 --> 04:00:35,340
Oh shit, singing.

3548
04:00:37,020 --> 04:00:39,020
There's no description apparently?

3549
04:00:41,900 --> 04:00:42,780
No, thanks.

3550
04:00:42,780 --> 04:00:43,340
I don't want to...

3551
04:00:43,340 --> 04:00:44,380
Wait, skip ahead.

3552
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:44,940
Skip ahead.

3553
04:00:45,820 --> 04:00:46,140
Okay.

3554
04:00:49,180 --> 04:00:50,940
I don't know why it's taking so long to...

3555
04:00:50,940 --> 04:00:52,460
Because it's paused, you ding-dong.

3556
04:00:53,180 --> 04:00:54,140
Oh, holy shit.

3557
04:00:57,660 --> 04:00:58,140
Here.

3558
04:01:04,620 --> 04:01:06,460
Yeah, do you want to watch this?

3559
04:01:06,460 --> 04:01:06,940
No.

3560
04:01:07,660 --> 04:01:08,140
Yeah.

3561
04:01:09,660 --> 04:01:10,140
Wait.

3562
04:01:10,940 --> 04:01:11,740
Okay, hold on.

3563
04:01:13,740 --> 04:01:15,740
Third 40 fucking minutes.

3564
04:01:16,700 --> 04:01:19,340
Third 40 fucking minutes.

3565
04:01:21,340 --> 04:01:22,940
King of Limba, Dr. Fowle.

3566
04:01:22,940 --> 04:01:25,900
Oh, that's a podcast thing.

3567
04:01:25,900 --> 04:01:26,860
Oh, okay.

3568
04:01:26,860 --> 04:01:30,300
Wait, April Fool is a moment with Dr. Fowle, the movie.

3569
04:01:45,740 --> 04:01:57,900
Oh, welcome to Dr. Fowle's death for the mentally impaired.

3570
04:01:57,900 --> 04:01:59,260
What's your problem?

3571
04:02:02,780 --> 04:02:03,740
Fucking hell.

3572
04:02:04,300 --> 04:02:05,420
He's empty.

3573
04:02:05,420 --> 04:02:06,460
What's going on?

3574
04:02:06,460 --> 04:02:08,220
Does no one have any problems?

3575
04:02:09,180 --> 04:02:11,740
Jack looked across the floor of the empty barn

3576
04:02:11,740 --> 04:02:15,340
and bled for a leave into Scott's body, still in pain.

3577
04:02:15,340 --> 04:02:16,380
Oh, I'm not impressed.

3578
04:02:23,980 --> 04:02:25,100
Yeah, let's skip ahead.

3579
04:02:25,100 --> 04:02:27,100
It's just this for 13 minutes.

3580
04:02:31,180 --> 04:02:33,340
Maybe if we were like listening to like...

3581
04:02:38,380 --> 04:02:41,900
You know, I honestly gotta say, I think you may be a retard.

3582
04:02:42,700 --> 04:02:46,300
Yeah, maybe if we were like high as shit, bro,

3583
04:02:46,300 --> 04:02:48,940
maybe if we were like super fucking stone,

3584
04:02:48,940 --> 04:02:51,900
then maybe we'd like get it, you know?

3585
04:02:52,780 --> 04:02:56,140
Yeah, that must be it.

3586
04:02:57,660 --> 04:03:02,700
He's undoubtedly an interesting character, however.

3587
04:03:02,700 --> 04:03:04,220
Yeah, yeah.

3588
04:03:07,580 --> 04:03:09,660
I wonder, let's see if Mage said anything.

3589
04:03:10,620 --> 04:03:11,020
No.

3590
04:03:12,860 --> 04:03:15,420
I wonder, maybe he just featured her because he likes her.

3591
04:03:16,620 --> 04:03:17,020
Maybe.

3592
04:03:23,420 --> 04:03:26,460
What can you say about Dr. Fowle?

3593
04:03:27,740 --> 04:03:28,620
Say what you like.

3594
04:03:29,580 --> 04:03:32,220
He's got Cajones.

3595
04:03:33,660 --> 04:03:37,740
He's got show, he's got show bits, you know what I'm saying?

3596
04:03:38,460 --> 04:03:39,980
He's got show, he's got show...

3597
04:03:39,980 --> 04:03:41,180
He's got a cute bird.

3598
04:03:41,180 --> 04:03:43,820
He's got show bits and a vice, you know what I'm saying?

3599
04:03:44,940 --> 04:03:46,140
I know exactly what you're saying.

3600
04:03:46,140 --> 04:03:47,420
Yeah, he's gonna kill you.

3601
04:03:47,420 --> 04:03:49,580
He's got a cool character.

3602
04:03:49,580 --> 04:03:53,260
Yeah, unlike just, he's almost as cool as TuneCriticY2K.

3603
04:03:54,220 --> 04:03:57,580
Almost, I mean, no one can be as cool as him.

3604
04:03:59,100 --> 04:04:03,020
All right, Baroni Dance Party, very good.

3605
04:04:03,580 --> 04:04:06,700
We gotta see this.

3606
04:04:08,540 --> 04:04:09,340
More nothing.

3607
04:04:11,420 --> 04:04:13,580
I am going into the fucking...

3608
04:04:16,860 --> 04:04:17,900
Oh no, I can't...

3609
04:04:18,780 --> 04:04:23,740
I was gonna edit Vita out of the fucking pages and category mail,

3610
04:04:23,740 --> 04:04:26,380
but it won't let me, I think I have to have an account

3611
04:04:26,380 --> 04:04:28,060
and I'm not fucking willing to make an account.

3612
04:04:29,180 --> 04:04:29,900
God damn it.

3613
04:04:29,900 --> 04:04:32,860
Yeah, accounts are late.

3614
04:04:32,860 --> 04:04:34,380
That's how they fucking get you.

3615
04:04:34,380 --> 04:04:35,420
That's how they get you.

3616
04:04:35,980 --> 04:04:40,300
I bet you could delete the page too if you had an account.

3617
04:04:42,540 --> 04:04:44,220
I'm actually not sure about that.

3618
04:04:44,220 --> 04:04:46,700
I think I'm not sure if the leading pages

3619
04:04:46,700 --> 04:04:49,100
is even like a thing that Wikis do.

3620
04:04:49,100 --> 04:04:51,820
I think they just expand outward forever and ever

3621
04:04:51,820 --> 04:04:55,100
and can never be fucking, and can never be clipped.

3622
04:04:56,780 --> 04:04:58,220
Let's see who FNGR is.

3623
04:04:58,220 --> 04:05:02,700
I have a basic understanding of him and I don't like him.

3624
04:05:02,700 --> 04:05:05,500
FNGR is like, I don't know.

3625
04:05:06,700 --> 04:05:11,340
He's just like a guy who seems weirdly invested

3626
04:05:11,340 --> 04:05:14,540
and trolling people, but is actually...

3627
04:05:15,340 --> 04:05:18,220
I've never actually known him to troll anyone.

3628
04:05:18,220 --> 04:05:22,380
He just seems to like to be there when people get trolled.

3629
04:05:23,740 --> 04:05:26,140
Like he just likes to see people in distress,

3630
04:05:26,140 --> 04:05:27,900
but doesn't actually do anything.

3631
04:05:29,580 --> 04:05:29,900
What?

3632
04:05:30,700 --> 04:05:33,500
That description.

3633
04:05:33,500 --> 04:05:36,220
He just likes to be there when shit goes bad.

3634
04:05:38,220 --> 04:05:40,300
He's just like invested in drama,

3635
04:05:40,300 --> 04:05:43,580
but I don't know of him actually causing any.

3636
04:05:43,580 --> 04:05:44,780
Maybe he does, I don't know.

3637
04:05:46,060 --> 04:05:48,780
For no good reason, or FNGR for short.

3638
04:05:48,780 --> 04:05:49,500
He likes to like...

3639
04:05:49,500 --> 04:05:52,380
The biggest drama lightning rods in the community.

3640
04:05:52,380 --> 04:05:55,420
He likes to poke people and prod them

3641
04:05:55,420 --> 04:05:58,220
and try and make them mad about stuff

3642
04:05:58,300 --> 04:05:59,580
that like other people did.

3643
04:06:02,620 --> 04:06:04,540
Although he refers to himself as a Dallas,

3644
04:06:04,540 --> 04:06:08,060
he spends more time making his limbo podcasts

3645
04:06:08,060 --> 04:06:11,340
as well as weekly commentary on the Brony drama titled

3646
04:06:11,340 --> 04:06:12,700
How Not to Brony.

3647
04:06:15,180 --> 04:06:16,860
He's an FPFC member.

3648
04:06:16,860 --> 04:06:17,980
I don't know what that is.

3649
04:06:17,980 --> 04:06:19,020
Pony fuck casts.

3650
04:06:21,340 --> 04:06:22,300
Oh, you know what?

3651
04:06:23,420 --> 04:06:28,140
Oh man, me, I have no fucking clue why.

3652
04:06:28,620 --> 04:06:30,940
I think it was FNGR himself, or maybe it was Vita

3653
04:06:30,940 --> 04:06:34,140
that added me to the Pony fuck cast Skype call.

3654
04:06:34,700 --> 04:06:35,020
Yeah.

3655
04:06:35,020 --> 04:06:36,060
And I joined in.

3656
04:06:36,060 --> 04:06:37,260
They did that to me once too.

3657
04:06:39,260 --> 04:06:41,580
Me and my friend just recited the history

3658
04:06:41,580 --> 04:06:43,180
of the Byzantium Empire to them.

3659
04:06:44,460 --> 04:06:46,300
And it was incredible.

3660
04:06:46,300 --> 04:06:48,780
The entire time I was playing mariachi music in the background.

3661
04:06:52,380 --> 04:06:53,100
It was great.

3662
04:06:54,700 --> 04:06:56,700
I see he's got a Patreon.

3663
04:06:57,420 --> 04:06:57,740
Yeah.

3664
04:06:58,380 --> 04:06:59,500
I wanna see his YouTube.

3665
04:07:02,620 --> 04:07:03,580
How many subs?

3666
04:07:03,580 --> 04:07:04,460
Like 3,000?

3667
04:07:05,740 --> 04:07:06,780
Yeah, like 3,000.

3668
04:07:10,780 --> 04:07:11,500
How not?

3669
04:07:12,940 --> 04:07:14,700
I hold on.

3670
04:07:16,860 --> 04:07:17,260
Yeah.

3671
04:07:17,260 --> 04:07:20,060
What is this about Digi drama in the Brony community?

3672
04:07:20,620 --> 04:07:21,660
That seems strange.

3673
04:07:21,660 --> 04:07:22,540
It's a yo.

3674
04:07:24,700 --> 04:07:26,460
That's fucking why.

3675
04:07:27,340 --> 04:07:28,700
Why 40 minutes?

3676
04:07:31,020 --> 04:07:32,220
Oh, here, here.

3677
04:07:32,220 --> 04:07:34,140
The best thing they fucking added to YouTube.

3678
04:07:34,140 --> 04:07:34,620
Hold on.

3679
04:07:38,380 --> 04:07:40,460
Did you see how he misspelled following?

3680
04:07:41,500 --> 04:07:41,980
Yeah.

3681
04:07:57,260 --> 04:07:57,740
What?

3682
04:08:04,140 --> 04:08:05,340
All right, I don't care anymore.

3683
04:08:05,340 --> 04:08:06,300
Yeah, this sucks.

3684
04:08:07,260 --> 04:08:08,380
This sucks and it's gay.

3685
04:08:09,260 --> 04:08:13,500
One time, I even, someone linked me like the videos that he did,

3686
04:08:13,500 --> 04:08:16,700
like specifically about me or like about the PCP.

3687
04:08:16,700 --> 04:08:18,780
And I didn't care about that either because it sucked.

3688
04:08:23,340 --> 04:08:24,940
Oh God, Munchie.

3689
04:08:24,940 --> 04:08:26,220
I don't think I can do anymore.

3690
04:08:26,940 --> 04:08:27,980
I'm on death's door.

3691
04:08:29,100 --> 04:08:30,220
Hold on, hold on.

3692
04:08:30,220 --> 04:08:31,020
I'm here.

3693
04:08:31,020 --> 04:08:32,220
No, have mercy.

3694
04:08:33,180 --> 04:08:34,540
I don't know what's the trailer.

3695
04:08:34,540 --> 04:08:35,580
Actually, no, I don't want to.

3696
04:08:36,300 --> 04:08:37,180
I actually don't want to.

3697
04:08:39,020 --> 04:08:39,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3698
04:08:39,980 --> 04:08:40,700
Actually, go back.

3699
04:08:40,700 --> 04:08:42,140
I just saw fucking keg standard.

3700
04:08:43,740 --> 04:08:44,060
What?

3701
04:08:47,340 --> 04:08:47,660
What?

3702
04:08:48,780 --> 04:08:49,500
What?

3703
04:08:49,500 --> 04:08:52,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3704
04:08:53,660 --> 04:08:53,900
Did you?

3705
04:08:54,940 --> 04:08:55,340
You know what?

3706
04:08:55,340 --> 04:08:55,820
What is this?

3707
04:08:55,820 --> 04:08:57,420
I actually knew about this.

3708
04:08:57,420 --> 04:08:58,780
I remember this.

3709
04:08:58,780 --> 04:08:59,260
Hold on.

3710
04:09:25,820 --> 04:09:48,540
Okay, don't care.

3711
04:09:48,540 --> 04:09:49,100
I'm glad.

3712
04:09:49,100 --> 04:09:50,380
I'm so glad, Munchie.

3713
04:09:50,380 --> 04:09:53,500
I'm so glad that we read about the lore of,

3714
04:09:54,460 --> 04:10:00,540
not past analysis, a voice of reason so that we know about horror scores.

3715
04:10:00,540 --> 04:10:01,980
So I understood that reference.

3716
04:10:02,940 --> 04:10:10,700
I'm so, I'm so fucking happy that this part of our lives is fucking over with.

3717
04:10:10,700 --> 04:10:16,380
Yeah, it's died down.

3718
04:10:16,380 --> 04:10:21,580
I think, I think probably a lot of these people have moved on, but not all of them.

3719
04:10:22,540 --> 04:10:26,860
Man, we saw a couple of YouTube channels and they all updated pretty recently.

3720
04:10:27,740 --> 04:10:28,380
