1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Goodbye, dry dumps, though I barely knew you at all, you had the grace to stay in me, while normal shits would fall, fall out of the asshole, still filled with that juicy moisture that the body craves, which you needlessly dump away.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now it's January, my ship will fly like dust in the wind, it's my dried up sandy feces, must flow with the breeze.

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I would have liked to kept you, but you were just a cry, the moisture is all gone now, now the dry shit sand must fly.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Dry dump December, never forget.

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was going to announce my secret, secret announcement, but it's not quite, I'll be one day shy of when I'm ready to say what that is, so I can't quite say it yet.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So the day after this drops, check my Twitter, and I, well, probably then that day. I don't see why not. I'll be announcing what that is.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's going to be very funny. But in the meantime, I'm Ben St, and this is Give and Take.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey, you know, speaking of secret projects, I said last time about mine that it would be done by the end of the year, I was pretty confident.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And the day after, immediately, things came to my attention that would push it back. So I was pretty optimistic.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Can I say, I told you so.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sure, I don't mind that.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, woo! I want to know the details, but obviously I'm sure you can't go into detail.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can say that it was optimistic of me to think that I would be able to work hard while Christmas was happening and even afterwards. I'm so exhausted.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, is it?

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I'm like, I don't want to work.

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's not that there were more things that needed doing.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There are more things that need doing, but they're like intensive things that you can't just, you can't just like,

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I will do a little bit here and there. You need to dedicate a day to it.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And it's like, it's the holidays. Let's chill out, for fuck's sake.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And, you know, Christmas holidays goes into New Year's Eve. That's also like a thing.

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I'm like, all right, next year, early next year.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, you know, when you get close to being finished with something, like the closer it gets to being done, the longer, the harder it takes.

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The harder it is to like, what am I saying? The more like polish it takes? You know what I mean?

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, I mean, the 80-20 rule.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, but the thing was, I already had been like, I knew that and I was thinking about it.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I'm like, when last episode was recorded, I was like, we're really close.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then it was like, actually, no, there's these other things that you didn't think about that need to be added.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And so the news changed the way of things.

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, I would love to know which things, but I'll have to ask another time.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You'll have to go to patreon.com slash give and take. It'd be a money spender to get the Money Spender's podcast where I will drop the deets on that one.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
See, the secret secret secret of the secret project is that there is no project and I'm just making people sign up to my Patreon so they can hear about it.

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The secret project is a viral marketing campaign advertising something on the Patreon that doesn't exist.

33
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That would be really funny, actually. Actually, if it were that. Not that I'm saying it isn't that, but if it were that, it would be really funny.

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We can't rule anything out.

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, okay. Well, you know what? That's okay.

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I would have liked it. It would have been nice and neat and tidy.

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
To have it done by the end of the year.

38
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, like whatever.

39
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I mean, I missed my goal of having Phantom's Revenge out by exactly one year after I announced it on Twitter.

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I missed that by like a week.

41
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You did release the beta, though. That's out.

42
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Did I mention? Yeah, last week I think I said I was gonna release the beta. Was that just this week that I released that?

43
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think so. It's only been out for a couple days. I haven't played it out.

44
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wow. Yeah. This past week has just felt like a lifetime is the thing.

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wow, okay. I can't believe that happened in the same week as everything else.

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, I guess I did release that fucking thing.

47
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I released the Phantom's Revenge beta on Patreon and it's good.

48
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I expected it to have bugs. It did have some bugs. It had some small bugs. It had some typos.

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It had a couple...it had one bug that I don't...is very upsetting because a few people have reported it.

50
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And...okay, I mean, I have to sort of briefly explain what it is.

51
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's a bug that a few people have encountered that is like basically you get to the end of the game and instead of just letting you play the game normally,

52
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it stops you from being able to use your attack command for some reason.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then people that are like, and they try to use other commands and they use a different command that you're not supposed to be able to use

54
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and the game like softlocks and like you just can't do anything, the menu just like dies.

55
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I...so basically it just means you can't beat the game.

56
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And not everyone's gotten it, but several people have and I can't replicate it.

57
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't know what those people did to make it happen. I can't make it happen, which means I can't find it and I don't know how to fix it, which is very upsetting.

58
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You would need to gather more information about what computer they're running it on and things like that.

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In case it's like a, I don't know, Mac or Windows thing.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't think...well, I think all those people are running it on Windows.

61
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't think it's going to matter what computer they're running it on. I think it's got to be in the code of the game.

62
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I just...they must be doing something.

63
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like they must have...I don't know. I don't know what it is.

64
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But it's a terrible bug that is...I can't let it stay in the game. This is one that needs fixing.

65
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But I also can't find it and they can't give me any additional information about how they found it.

66
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I'm just like, uh, okay. I guess I gotta find it.

67
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think you should ask them to, like, record their gameplay.

68
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And if it happens to them again, send that game so you can study what's happening.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That would be my only idea.

71
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, I mean, they've explained to me pretty clearly what it looks like.

72
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But like, they're...and they've asked them, like, okay, what are the conditions under which it happens?

73
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And they've fully explained that to me too. So it's not...

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I'm just like, hmm, I don't know what else it could be, but it's got to be something.

75
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like maybe it's that they died and reset a certain number of times before doing it or something like that.

76
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I mean, what's the code that causes the end of the game?

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, the game? Okay.

78
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Does the menu change a bit?

79
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What I think is happening, what I think is happening is that against the final boss, you're not supposed to...

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think the final boss is basically...

81
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Some sort of code is happening that is making the game think that the boss has been...

82
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Not defeated, like the boss doesn't enter a defeated state, but the menu that generates lists of enemies that are targetable during an attack phase.

83
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think it is removing the boss...when the boss is attacked, it is removing it from the list.

84
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And so when it comes time to do an attack, the menu sees there are no enemies to attack, and then it says, you know, you can't attack, no enemies to attack, right?

85
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think that's what is happening. I just don't know why it's happening, because when I've tried it myself, it doesn't happen.

86
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, you know, this is...

87
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was fixing bugs that people were reporting me, and it was all little minor stuff. It was all, haha, very silly, very funny.

88
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is the one that I'm like, shit. This one, I don't know how to fix it. I mean, I'm sure I'll get it eventually.

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
At the moment, I'm like...

90
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know how to fix it. It wasn't supposed to be hard. This was supposed to be easy.

91
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When you go to try and replicate it, do you start from that stage, or do you start the whole game?

92
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, I've been mostly starting it from that stage. I have to...

93
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yesterday, I was talking about it, and someone suggested instead of starting up the game at that stage, start from the beginning,

94
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and not in the game maker demo run function, but in the external zip file.

95
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, the external executable that I created that I made downloadable for people.

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It might run differently, so I have to try it out in there.

97
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But other people have gotten to the same point and not had the issue happen, so it's not guaranteed, apparently.

98
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It is fucked, and all that is to say nobody has beaten the demo, or the beta.

99
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:55,000
People beat the alpha, and I made the beta to be a little less hard than the alpha, but nobody has beaten the beta.

100
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I'm sad to say I think it's probably because of this bug that just ruins the game.

101
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But not entirely. It's not entirely because of that, but I think it's...

102
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Maybe if that weren't the case, somebody would have beaten it by now, but nobody has.

103
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I'm a bit bummed about all that, but I'll figure it out.

104
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, other than that, the game is a masterpiece, obviously.

105
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Looks great, runs great, tugs at the heartstrings, makes you cry, makes you laugh.

106
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Memories still last a lifetime.

107
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
A satisfying conclusion to the arc of the character of Phantom Horn.

108
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, so I got that to continue chugging away on this week.

109
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, I can't believe that it was in the same week as Christmas, and as me getting COVID.

110
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's very funny.

111
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
How are you feeling, Ben?

112
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, pretty decent.

113
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I felt really bad on Christmas Eve.

114
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I felt really bad on Christmas.

115
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I felt better the next day.

116
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Today is the day after, the day after Christmas, and I feel...

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, mostly okay, I think. It's a little hard to say.

118
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I had a fever.

119
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was getting a fever in the early stages on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th.

120
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A fever was coming and going.

121
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I was getting up to about 100 or 101 degrees, and I felt fever, and I felt hot and cold.

122
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I felt chills, felt sweaty, alternating between the two.

123
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Very bad, very unpleasant.

124
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And then that kind of went away.

125
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sometimes I feel a little bit of it.

126
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Right now I'm feeling a little bit warm all of a sudden, first for no reason.

127
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I've been taking my temperature, and I haven't had any fever in a day or two.

128
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And they say, according to CDC guidelines or whatever,

129
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that you are probably, you might be non-contagious,

130
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you might have kicked the infection as of three days after having a fever.

131
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Even if a sore throat persists or other things persists,

132
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
if you haven't had a fever in a few days, you might be over it, you might not be contagious anymore.

133
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But I guess that's good.

134
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This morning I felt like I might be losing my sense of smell, but I wasn't sure.

135
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And there were other factors at play.

136
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The room was really dry, and my nose hurt because the air was dry.

137
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And also I've been eating menthol, menthol Ricolas.

138
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Maybe the menthol was interfering with my smell.

139
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So I was frantically smelling things, and I could smell some things.

140
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So I was like, okay, maybe it's fine.

141
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But then other things, I was like, I feel like it used to be stronger.

142
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I feel like I used to be able to smell it stronger.

143
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can't tell. I can't tell if I'm just imagining it.

144
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Sounds like you sort of are still stuffed up, which is normal to not smell so good during a cold anyway.

145
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because of all the nose problem, the mucus and the stuff.

146
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, but I don't think it's... I have a little bit of a nose thing.

147
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't think it's that.

148
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I wasn't stuffy this morning when I was smelling stuff.

149
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Now I kind of am.

150
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you were dry, then you couldn't have made enough mucus to get stuffy.

151
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But you also can't smell when you're dry.

152
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You just got to drink a bunch of water, and hopefully it'll flush itself out and you can smell better.

153
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The symptoms have been like...

154
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's just like a rotating list of things that just keep happening.

155
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Like rotisserie chicken.

156
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
COVID is like a big rotisserie chicken, just going around and around and around.

157
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Juicy and delicious, but you can't smell it.

158
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The symptoms just keep changing.

159
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Like sometimes I have a fever, sometimes I have a stuffy nose,

160
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
sometimes I'm coughing, sometimes I'm sneezing, sometimes I'm just fine.

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Like I woke up on... This is a tragic story.

162
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I tested... So I thought I might be sick.

163
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I tested myself on the night of the 23rd, and it was negative.

164
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And I was like, great.

165
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And then I woke up, but I felt sick.

166
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So I woke up early the day of the 24th, before my mom was supposed to come get me.

167
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, my whole family was supposed to come get me for Christmas Eve.

168
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I was like, okay, I'm going to test again.

169
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And I tested, and I was positive.

170
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And it was like a little pink line appeared on the test strip.

171
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Very faintly. I was like, shit, but it's positive.

172
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So I had to call them and tell them, guys, Christmas is fucking canceled.

173
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Like I got COVID.

174
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah.

175
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That was very sad.

176
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Quick note, by the way, a few people made fun of me and said,

177
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
the monkey's paw curled.

178
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Multiple people made some comment to that effect.

179
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Because last time on the episode, I said,

180
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
if I got COVID, at least I wouldn't have to do my stupid family Christmas Eve party.

181
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Which is true. I meant it.

182
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I meant it about my extended family aunts and uncles and cousins party.

183
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I hate those. I don't care about that stuff.

184
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't care about those people. I have nothing to say to them.

185
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I did not mean it about my like, regular, like seeing my family for regular Christmas.

186
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That I was very sad about. I had a very sad Christmas this year.

187
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That sucks.

188
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does. I was pretty bummed about it.

189
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But anyway, anyway, so I tested positive.

190
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So then the next day, Christmas, I woke up and I was like,

191
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't feel anything at all. I don't feel like I have a fever.

192
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't feel a headache. I don't feel runny nose. I don't feel anything.

193
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I feel like, could I be over it?

194
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So I went to, I went and I got another test and I took it.

195
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And it was, the red line this time was like dark crimson.

196
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It was like, no, you're way more positive now than you were before.

197
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, dear. A Christmas nightmare.

198
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah. Yeah. So, but I didn't feel worse.

199
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like I have continued to feel a little bit better.

200
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm still not 100%, but I feel much better today than I did on Christmas.

201
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I was like, like I can, like it was hard to like walk.

202
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like I was getting like, fatigue going upstairs and stuff.

203
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Now I'm like, you know, I feel mostly normal, except for, except for a little bit.

204
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But it's like 90% there.

205
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So I'm hoping that I'm over it mostly or I'm going to be over it soon.

206
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The, when you Google it, it says like, you, you, some, I found some sources that say,

207
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
oh yeah, when you're like, yeah, when you're like five or 10 days in a lot of people,

208
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
they start to feel better, but then like five or 10 days, bam, now it comes back and then they get long COVID

209
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and then they're sick for like a month.

210
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Like, oh, okay. Yeah, that's cool.

211
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So for me, that would be in about three to in about three to five days,

212
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
that would be the 10 day mark for when I got sick.

213
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So I guess we'll see by then if it comes roaring back.

214
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was a bit nervous. Hey, you there? Can you hear me?

215
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I was a bit nervous. Okay, I hear you.

216
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was a bit nervous to record this podcast because having a conversation, having like a talk will be a test for the scariest symptom of COVID,

217
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
which is a brain fog, which is when you just can't think and remember stuff correctly.

218
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And it happens for the same reason that you sometimes lose smell and taste,

219
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
which is why I was very scared this morning when I woke up and I thought maybe I can't smell stuff,

220
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
which is that according to some Google results, COVID just destroys your brain.

221
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Just kills part of your brain, just shrinks it, no matter what, even in a mild case.

222
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Just if you've had COVID, you have less brain than you had before.

223
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So you're going to be hyper aware of how witty you're being this episode.

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, I am. And every time I stutter and stammer, I think, I've got it.

225
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I've lost my brain. I'm permanently stupider.

226
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But, babe, you stutter and stammer all the time.

227
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I know I do. I know I do. I know I do.

228
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
As Trixie made fun of, famously made fun of, in Who Are These Podcasts.

229
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But little did she know, it would be my saving grace.

230
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I could point you to go, ah, that's proof that I still have my brain, though.

231
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's very scary. It's very upsetting.

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I could imagine, yeah.

233
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Because it's your brain, so you don't know at any moment.

234
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, I can't imagine.

235
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't imagine a more upsetting symptom that you could tell me is a symptom of a disease that I just found out that I have.

236
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's like, try not to think about it.

237
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Just try to relax.

238
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because I guess getting stressed out is not going to do anything.

239
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But it's hard, I understand.

240
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Not thinking about it.

241
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, when I tell people that I'm worried that COVID will destroy part of my brain,

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I usually feel like they just scoff at me.

243
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Nobody seems to care or take that seriously, that that is a thing that you can read about on Google.

244
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Is that it does that? There's nothing you can do about it.

245
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I mean, I haven't heard that.

246
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But I also don't know that many people who have gotten COVID either.

247
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There's not that many reports about it, but there's a few.

248
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I was furiously googling, looking for reasons to believe that this would not happen.

249
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I couldn't find that much about it.

250
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Obviously, there's not that much research into it yet.

251
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But there's a few very disturbing ones.

252
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And I don't know, there was one.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Were those people vaccinated, though, when they got that?

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Was it the same strain that you read about?

255
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Some of them were from before the vaccine was available.

256
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Some of them were studying the brains of people who died of COVID,

257
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
which is like, okay, maybe that's kind of a self-selecting sample right there.

258
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There was at least one.

259
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No, there's at least one that specifically says,

260
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
even people that had a mild case still saw a brain loss.

261
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And that was comparing cat scans or brain scans of people that had had them before they had COVID,

262
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and they got scanned after, and they just compared it.

263
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And it was like, yeah, across the board.

264
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I think that, and that one was the word, I think that one,

265
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
there's a line in it, and there's a video that goes along with the two,

266
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and the nurse in the video repeats it.

267
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And they say something that's a little bit of the effect of,

268
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
this could be a major health crisis in the future.

269
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
All these people, the effect on the brain was something similar to what you see in Alzheimer's,

270
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
or what you see in the aging process, right?

271
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It just made the brain effectively older.

272
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And it's like, oh, well, this could be a major health crisis in the future.

273
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Maybe all these people will just be at increased risk for Alzheimer's later.

274
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And it's like, oh, okay.

275
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Maybe on the one hand, I want to say, well, that's pretty ridiculous.

276
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
A third of the population has had COVID.

277
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Are you telling me that in the future, and that number is only going to go up,

278
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
it seems like probably everyone will eventually get COVID.

279
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Are you telling me that due to the COVID pandemic, 20, 30 years from now,

280
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in the future, everyone will just be at increased risk for Alzheimer's?

281
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Are just way more people going to have Alzheimer's?

282
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's ridiculous.

283
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But then also, what if they will, though?

284
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What if that is just a thing that will happen because of this?

285
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Was it just one nurse saying this in this one video?

286
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Was there like anyone else saying it?

287
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I remember the wording was a bit ambiguous,

288
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
because it wasn't clear if she was talking about these people as in these specific people

289
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the study was about, or if she's talking about these people as in people who have had COVID.

290
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Generally.

291
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I would imagine they're talking about the specific case of the people who had a mild case,

292
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
the person who had a mild case, but still had brain change, brain shrink.

293
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Here we go.

294
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's called, it's W.W.W.

295
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The Scientific American, even mild cases of COVID may leave a mark on the brain.

296
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is the one.

297
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Okay, this one, because like, right, the COVID,

298
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
COVID affects your, it makes you lose smell and taste sometimes.

299
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And smell and memory are in like the same.

300
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think they're in the hippocampus.

301
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I think that's right.

302
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But they're in a related part of the brain and like,

303
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I guess where a lot of the effect happens is there.

304
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And so like, when it fucks up your smell,

305
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
it's doing similar damage to a place where it might fuck up your memory.

306
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Could you link that?

307
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, sure.

308
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's right here.

309
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There's a video too, which,

310
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it's not really like, it's not playing here.

311
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
One time I had this article open.

312
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I had this very article that I'm about to link to you.

313
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And I went to like pick up some, like my grocery delivery and I came back and,

314
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and it had started playing a video.

315
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I hadn't told it to play one.

316
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Maybe it wasn't this one.

317
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Maybe it was just a similar one, but it was another way.

318
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It had auto started playing a video that I hadn't even aware.

319
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And yeah, there was a nurse saying the same thing about like,

320
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
this could be a major health crisis going forward.

321
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, maybe it's this one, the CMAJ news,

322
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
which has like the same, the same title.

323
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm getting like a dry throat from talking about it.

324
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think I might just be talking too much.

325
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm going to take a sip of my, my black raspberry,

326
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
blackberry, clear splash sparkling water beverage from stop and shop.

327
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, I'm lucky, I guess.

328
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I haven't got COVID yet.

329
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And I did manage to like the last minute get my booster that I've been told like,

330
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
well, I didn't even get my booster.

331
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I put off getting it like a fucking idiot.

332
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I mean, I did as well.

333
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And I was like, I should, I should probably get it before like the Christmas Eve party,

334
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
but there's no way I'm going to get one in time.

335
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

336
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But then miraculously, my phone popped up with a notification.

337
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You can now get your booster sign up at the website.

338
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm like, fuck.

339
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay.

340
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I was kind of waiting for them to do that because people had told me you can just sign

341
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
up, but I'm like, I guess I could have.

342
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But like, there was one like a few miles away and it was on Christmas Eve morning.

343
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So I'm like, fine, that's good.

344
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll have the booster in the morning.

345
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And then in the evening, there'll be people around.

346
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And hopefully none of them have COVID.

347
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah.

348
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I haven't actually tested since then, but I've, everyone in the family's felt fine.

349
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Nobody who has been to the party has reported anything.

350
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So that was, that's a lucky one.

351
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And my arm hurt for a bit.

352
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And that was it.

353
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But it was a Moderna.

354
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It was a Moderna booster.

355
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I got, I got, I got Pfizer Pfizer Moderna.

356
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's my code.

357
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's my secret code.

358
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You, you can't mix and match.

359
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You're going to die.

360
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
If I'm a level in like a PS one game and you've got like four symbols to choose.

361
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

362
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's your, it's Pfizer Pfizer Moderna.

363
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's my level.

364
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Pfizer Pfizer Moderna.

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah.

366
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Cool.

367
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Good.

368
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

369
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I didn't, I, I didn't get my booster.

370
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Obviously I regret that now.

371
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't know if it would have made a difference because.

372
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Omicron is apparently very good at not giving a fuck if you're vaccinated.

373
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It was just very funny.

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I mean, I heard that like, um, you got it at like Munchie.

375
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Munchie's like a house party with a bunch of people.

376
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yeah.

377
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And those people were boosted and a bunch of them got it.

378
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.

379
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Or at least some of them were boosted.

380
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I heard the Munchie, oh, I had to like cancel a flight to go see his parents for Christmas

381
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
because of that.

382
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

383
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
They had a, they had Christmas plans and they had to.

384
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah.

385
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Maybe even worse than, maybe even probably, you know, probably even worse than mine honestly

386
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
because they were going to travel to see their families.

387
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I was just going to go.

388
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Well, I mean, I was going to see like, you know, I mean, I've seen my parents not that

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
long ago, but like, you know, Nate and Michelle were in town and my sister and her boyfriend

390
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
were in town.

391
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We were going to do a family.

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You know, I didn't get to see them.

393
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Who knows when I'll see him again, but oh well.

394
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But yeah.

395
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Munchie had a similar.

396
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
A similarly tragic, uh, cancellation.

397
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Uh, you know, Cassie too.

398
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Everyone over there at the Munchie house.

399
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Everyone got sick.

400
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They're all just sick.

401
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Sucks.

402
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And then I'm going to be flying in there soon.

403
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Presuming that like I can, I probably will be able to.

404
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So hopefully we'll have a herd immunity, I guess.

405
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Bye then.

406
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
When are you?

407
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah.

408
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
When are you coming?

409
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Like, like soon, right?

410
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like second week of January, I think.

411
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh, so like three weeks from now or less.

412
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh, wow.

413
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let me see.

414
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Are they, let me see.

415
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Are the COVID cases snot spiking as much?

416
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Let me take a look.

417
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
No, they are spiking more than ever.

418
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Okay.

419
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That's terrible.

420
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll just have to, I'll just have to.

421
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Like look like weird and people will leave me alone, which I'm very good at.

422
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm very talented in that area.

423
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It might help.

424
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
To an, it might help to an extent.

425
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I feel like it's kind of inevitable if I'm getting on a.

426
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Plane and they're like, if it's with people on it.

427
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
That are next to me, I think it's kind of like.

428
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If one person has it, there's no chance.

429
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
There's a high likelihood that I'm just going to have COVID in Boston.

430
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's, it's a bit out of your control.

431
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah.

432
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Is it worth.

433
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Hmm.

434
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I don't know.

435
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I think so.

436
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I mean, I'm not afraid to die.

437
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Well, I am.

438
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah.

439
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The, the, I don't know.

440
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's.

441
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Geez.

442
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Geez.

443
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's, I don't know.

444
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I don't know.

445
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You know, a, a Nate.

446
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The whole, the, the, the, the, I think it was Nate in particular.

447
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Nate in particular was pushing.

448
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Nate wanted me to just like.

449
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know, Ben, I know you got COVID, but like, you know, you should come anyway.

450
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like we're all prepared to get COVID.

451
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Like we don't care.

452
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Well, not, not exactly.

453
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He, you know, he was like, you know, you can wear a mask, you can social distance.

454
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And I was like, on the one hand, that's nice of you.

455
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm glad that you want me to be there.

456
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And, and that's nice.

457
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
On the other hand.

458
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Terrible idea.

459
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Also, I feel.

460
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Horrible.

461
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I feel sick.

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I want to go to sleep.

463
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So for all these reasons and more, I will not take you up on your kind offer.

464
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

465
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Lamal.

466
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I feel like if there's like.

467
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If there's a saying, oh, you probably shouldn't fly.

468
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I would have to reconsider.

469
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
People start saying you probably shouldn't like if a government thing comes out says you're allowed to fly, but we advise against it.

470
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm not sure.

471
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I would probably go anyway.

472
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm still allowed to.

473
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's, it's, it's like.

474
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I don't know.

475
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
On the plane.

476
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think if you are like.

477
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,000
If you get like unlucky and you probably get seated next to someone who just happens to be contagious, I think you're probably just fucked.

478
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But like.

479
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yes.

480
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Who knows if that will have, you know, you could get it going to the airport.

481
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You could get it in the airport to true.

482
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.

483
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:58,000
First, the most likely scenario if you were to get it while traveling is if you just happen to be seated next to a contagious person, which you have no control over.

484
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes.

485
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Unless hopefully my favorite time in a plane is when it's not full.

486
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And so you can just spread out and go to have a whole little area by yourself.

487
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And I feel like just after Christmas, planes are going to be packed with people going home.

488
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But a little bit after in January, I feel like maybe it'll be a little quieter.

489
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It'll, it'll.

490
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm prepared to get sick.

491
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I am a little worried about what could happen afterwards.

492
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I feel like, I feel like it's, since I'm also boosted, I feel like the worst that seems to be happening for most people who have the double vax and the boost.

493
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The worst is like, oh, you have a fever.

494
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh, you have a cold.

495
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And there's no lasting effects.

496
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And you're fine.

497
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.

498
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I mean, that's what happens to most people.

499
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Some people.

500
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm, I'm part of most people.

501
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You are part of most people.

502
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Congratulations.

503
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Some people, some people develop long COVID.

504
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Some people develop memory problems and permanent loss of sensation.

505
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They're not most people.

506
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And I, and I do think those, I think that the incidence of long COVID is, is, is reduced.

507
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
If you, if you are boosted, if you're vaccinated, I think that's the case.

508
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The, the, the.

509
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But, you know, Omicron just kind of doesn't give a fuck.

510
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Omicron just doesn't really care about vaccines.

511
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So who knows, man.

512
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Uh, uh, uh, I don't know.

513
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know.

514
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know, I mean, if you, if you, if you get sick on your trip, I feel like it'll ruin

515
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
your trip.

516
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know what I mean?

517
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Well, of course.

518
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah.

519
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay.

520
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I mean, the whole point is to see people.

521
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
If I have to hide in a room the whole time, what a waste.

522
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

523
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What, what a waste.

524
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It would be, it would be, it would be even worse.

525
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It would be even worse than just not getting to go.

526
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Frankly.

527
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I don't know.

528
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I would, I guess I, what I'm saying is frankly, I would consider, I would consider rescheduling.

529
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I, I, I mean, I, I, I said, just, just the numbers, the numbers.

530
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Numbers go up.

531
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Look, look, look at this graph.

532
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Um, I don't know.

533
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll think about it, but it's been so long.

534
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It has been so long.

535
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know.

536
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I can't tell you what to do.

537
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Um, and, uh, the, the, the, wait, I want to say, I want to, I want to gripe.

538
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I want to gripe about fear some more.

539
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I want to say that I'm scared.

540
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Um, it's the thing about most people.

541
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Most, most people don't complain about memory loss, brain fog, permanent loss of sensation.

542
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Most people don't complain about those things.

543
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But according to one or two Google results, citing scientific studies, uh, it might be,

544
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I don't know, a lie awake at night.

545
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Think of like, what if, okay, but like, what if those people just don't notice?

546
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
What if those people just did lose, you know, precious brain?

547
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's gone forever, but they just, you know, but it's not serious enough that like they notice it,

548
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
but like it is gone and it is affecting them just in a subtle way that like they, they're not picking up on.

549
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
They are stupider.

550
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
They have lost some cognition.

551
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
They just aren't, aren't noticing.

552
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What if, what if, what if that's like most people?

553
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What if that's me right now?

554
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
What, what, what then give?

555
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What if that's true?

556
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
What if, tell me what if right now?

557
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Tell me what if that happens.

558
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
If you want to find out for sure.

559
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Okay.

560
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You should, you should write on a piece of paper.

561
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Like a, like a, the smartest thing you could think of.

562
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And every day check it.

563
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And if you can still understand it, then you're fine.

564
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I think to myself, you know, Ben, you're pretty stupid already.

565
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So it's fine.

566
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But then I think, is that good?

567
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If I'm, if I'm going to lose a little brain, do I want to be stupid?

568
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If like, if I'm, if I'm already stupider, then does that mean I have less to lose?

569
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And so the difference would be less.

570
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
There'd be less and overall difference.

571
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, man.

572
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I do.

573
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
What if, if I'm stupider, would I have less to lose?

574
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Or do I want to be smarter?

575
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So that I'm, I have more brain so that if it goes, so that if I lose more of, if I lose it, I'm left with more on the net.

576
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You know, which, which one of these is better?

577
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The smartest people are the dumbest people.

578
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Say in the comments, say in the comments, say in the comments whether you would like to have less brains to lose or start with more and be left with, and lose more but be left with more.

579
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Think about it.

580
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Let me know what you think.

581
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Look, if you're going to lose some brain power, lose more, lose all of it.

582
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Get, get it gone.

583
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Dude, be a man.

584
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Do the big brain loss.

585
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You're right.

586
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Why go, why go halfway with anything?

587
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Lose it all.

588
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Lose yourself in the moment.

589
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Lose yourself in the COVID.

590
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You better never let it go.

591
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I don't actually know the words to that song.

592
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I can't, I can't riff it.

593
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This opportunity comes many times every day.

594
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
This opportunity comes.

595
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Oh, if I can time.

596
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This opportunity comes when you're in public.

597
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't know.

598
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Don't wear a mask.

599
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We'll know.

600
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Just, just got to do it.

601
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Just got to do it.

602
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:16,000
If you had one chance to lose all your brain cells with SARS-CoV-19, would you take, would you get it?

603
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Would you catch it?

604
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This is your moment to get COVID?

605
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Once in a lifetime chance.

606
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Dude, those bug chasers must be fucking thrilled at all this, all this COVID.

607
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's that meme of the guy on TikTok offering a trade, you know?

608
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You, you receive SARS-CoV-19.

609
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I receive you lose brain.

610
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yes.

611
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What meme is this?

612
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You know, it's a TikTok.

613
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's of a guy, I don't, I've never actually seen the video, but it's like a guy with long hair in like a suit.

614
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh, it's a joke of the meme that like lose brain and then he's talking insane?

615
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
No, the meme is just, he's a guy in a suit and he's sort of, he's sort of got his hands together.

616
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I know the meme, but like, I don't know what you were saying.

617
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Um, I don't know.

618
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Just because the, the joke of that meme is that you lose, you give something and you get something and that's funny for some reason.

619
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So that, but it's COVID.

620
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I receive COVID SARS-CoV-19.

621
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You receive SARS-CoV-19.

622
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We both have.

623
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We both have both sick.

624
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's a good, it's such a fair trick.

625
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
My, my, I'm, I'm still, you know, I haven't, I haven't tested again.

626
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm going to wait a few days and test again and it's possible that I might be negative or non-contagious soon, in which case I will count myself lucky.

627
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But you know, there's, I think it's possible that I might, you know, you know, some people, some people develop complications.

628
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And those start to show up, you know, soon.

629
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So I'm still worried.

630
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm still like, you know, I woke up this morning like, oh my God, I can't smell.

631
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Oh my God.

632
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Oh my God.

633
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I know the wake up.

634
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I think I'm going to die feeling.

635
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I've, I felt that before.

636
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah.

637
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So the, I don't know.

638
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I mean, optimistically, optimistically, I'm like mostly recovered and I'm going to test negative in a few days and nothing else will happen.

639
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And I'll be like, okay, whatever.

640
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Ha, ha, fine.

641
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Well, if I lost some brain, I guess I wasn't using it anyway.

642
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Lamal.

643
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Lamal.

644
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But, and then you go to fix the bug in Phantom Horn and Phantom Horn's revenge and like, oh wait, I needed those, those neurons.

645
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Oh God, I needed those exact amount of neurons.

646
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
They're gone.

647
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Just, just like with, just like with this conversation when I'm, when I've been, when I've been working on the bug fixes, I keep thinking like any, any time I like, okay, it's so, it's so stupid.

648
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Any time I think like, oh, I lost my train of thought while I was working on this thing.

649
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh, I got distracted.

650
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Oh, I don't know how to, how to do this.

651
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm like, there it is.

652
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It's the brain fog.

653
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It got me.

654
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But then I'm like, I'm all, I'm always like this.

655
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm, I was always just constantly just like, type of, type of, type of, get distracted, you know, just pay attention to something else for like 45 minutes.

656
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And then like, what was I doing?

657
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Like that's normal.

658
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
That's normal for me.

659
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So, so I guess I've already had COVID.

660
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I guess I've just been living the COVID life this whole time.

661
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah.

662
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I am COVID.

663
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, best.

664
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Funny.

665
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Wait.

666
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay.

667
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I have a couple of Christmas gifts that I want to mention.

668
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The funniest Christmas gift that I got was my dad re-gifted me that I have COVID shirt.

669
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So I haven't.

670
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Now you have COVID.

671
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's past from father to son.

672
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yeah.

673
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah.

674
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah.

675
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Although I think, I think he got a false positive or, or he was asymptomatic or something because he like had no,

676
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
basically nothing happened.

677
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
He didn't report like any symptoms at all.

678
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
He said he felt fine the whole time.

679
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So, you know, but I mean, that was before Omicron.

680
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So maybe it was just, he got it, but it was like, he was vaccinated.

681
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So it was like, didn't do anything.

682
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So that was funny.

683
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Nate gave me a George Washington's rules of civility and decent behavior in company and conversation.

684
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Lol.

685
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And this is a, this is a, okay, it's funny.

686
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's not, he didn't write this when he was like an adult.

687
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:12,000
He, when he was, when he was like 14, George Washington wrote down a bunch of rules of like how to be polite and make people like you.

688
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Here, I'll read an excerpt.

689
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'll read an excerpt.

690
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
This is the 70, George Washington's 75th rule.

691
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:33,000
In the midst of discourse, ask not of what one treateth, but if you perceive any stop because of your coming, you may well entreat him gently to proceed.

692
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:42,000
If a person of quality comes in, comes in while you are conversing, it is handsome to repeat what was said before.

693
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay.

694
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So catch them up to speed.

695
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Catch them up to speed.

696
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Don't interrupt.

697
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But only a person of quality.

698
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
These are, these are actually, yeah, some, these, a lot of these are actually pretty good.

699
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Like, a lot of these are like, yeah, I, it would be rude to come into a room where someone is talking and be like, hey, what are you talking about?

700
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But if they like stop to be like, no, no, continue.

701
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Don't stop on my account.

702
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Like that would, that is the polite thing to do.

703
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
That's, I think that's good advice.

704
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
That's true.

705
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Here's another one.

706
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
When you see a crime punished, you may be inwardly pleased, but always show pity to the suffering offender.

707
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh, here we go.

708
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This is another one.

709
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
This is one I have, this is one I disagree, I have to disagree with.

710
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Show not yourself glad of the misfortune of another, though he were your enemy.

711
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I can't, I can't condone that one.

712
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
That's like, that's a classic anti-bensane line.

713
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think, it would, it to me, it would depend.

714
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
For me, it would depend.

715
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Okay.

716
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I mean, I mean,

717
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
What would it depend on?

718
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It would depend on the manner of misfortune.

719
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If it's, if it's a, if it's like a completely unearned misfortune, like if it's someone like gets like run over by a truck or like breaks their leg or like gets covered or something.

720
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I might, I might be like, I might, even if I hate them, I might be like, oh, that's too, you know, I mean, but if it's like, oh, you know, they, they, they, they ruin their own such shit.

721
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They brought it on themselves.

722
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You know, they were an anti-vaxxer and they got COVID.

723
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Then I'm like, fuck them.

724
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You know, so that one's like, I sort of agree with it.

725
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I just made myself laugh thinking of like, ah, but I'd, I'd, I'd enjoy hearing about misfortune of, of like super rich people like Elon Musk.

726
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And then I imagined the headline, Elon Rusk run over by his own Tesla and the image was, it was a little absurd, but it's so true.

727
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
He was in, he was in his own exploding.

728
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
When it exploded tragically.

729
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
No, no, no.

730
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
He was outside of the Tesla and it ran him over and that's how he died.

731
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Um, I have, I haven't, okay, here's, this one's cool.

732
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'm going to read one more of the 36th rule.

733
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Get a load of this one.

734
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Artificers and persons of low degree ought not to use many ceremonies to lords or others of high degree, but respect and highly honor them.

735
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And those of high degree ought to treat them with affability and courtesy without arrogance.

736
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Okay, I don't.

737
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
What's the ceremony bit part mean?

738
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't know.

739
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Okay.

740
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Okay.

741
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
By, by artificers and persons of low degree, does he mean like craftsmen and like blue collar people?

742
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I, I would imagine like lower class.

743
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay.

744
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So they, they don't use ceremonies.

745
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Treat them, treat lords with respect, but don't use many ceremonies as in like being like, oh, your, your highness, your grace.

746
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh, it is my, it is my great esteem.

747
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh, like, don't, don't bother talking to them.

748
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Just get your work done.

749
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I think, I think that's what it means.

750
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

751
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Don't fucking waste my time with this shit.

752
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I mean, if you're a person working, you don't want to have to like bow every time a lord enters the room while you're doing his wall.

753
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You'd be like, you're doing the, doing the, we're going to break it down here through there.

754
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Like a lovely little plaster.

755
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You know what that one, that one sucks.

756
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Let me, let me read another one.

757
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Read, read no letters, books or papers in company.

758
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But when there is a necessity for the doing of it, you must ask leave.

759
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Come not near the books or writings of another so as to read them or give your opinion of them unasked.

760
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Also not, also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

761
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah.

762
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Okay.

763
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Pretty reasonable.

764
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's a work in progress.

765
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Get out of here.

766
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm trying to write.

767
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm trying to, I'm trying to read.

768
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Hey, hey, what you, hey, what are you writing there?

769
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Hey, hey, George.

770
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Hey, George, what are you writing there?

771
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
What are you, what are you writing there?

772
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Ah, leave me alone.

773
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Didn't you read my book?

774
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I said, I said, leave me alone, kid.

775
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm 14 and this is, this is upsetting to me.

776
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm going to write that down in my book.

777
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm 14 and I'm writing here.

778
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm trying to write here.

779
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
All these dang, all these dang artificers as persons of low esteem always coming into my dang study and asking me,

780
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
asking me what I'm talking about and what I'm writing.

781
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Leave me the fuck alone.

782
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Quit using all these damn ceremonies at me.

783
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You fucking, you fucking freaks.

784
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The beauty degenerates.

785
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It's George Washington, like English and he came over or born in America.

786
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I have no idea who he is, but I know he's like early, early American boy.

787
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
He must have been born in England.

788
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
He couldn't, like there wasn't like no, no, no people lived in America.

789
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
No, I'm stupid.

790
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
He was born in America.

791
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's like the colonies had existed for, well, how long did the colonies exist?

792
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Like more than a hundred years.

793
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Well, how long did it take them to build the railroad?

794
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Well, we built the railroad after the war for independence.

795
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Right?

796
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Okay.

797
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, they had the wagons.

798
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
They went around, killed all the natives.

799
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That was later.

800
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
That was later.

801
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That was later.

802
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Kind of.

803
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Well, we never really stopped doing that.

804
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Did America even really exist?

805
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
No, there's no, there's a real question.

806
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Okay.

807
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
He was born in a log cabin in the middle of the sea.

808
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No, I think he was from Virginia.

809
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Right?

810
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Born.

811
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
God, I'm looking at his Wikipedia page.

812
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah, he was born in Popes Creek, Virginia in British America.

813
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah, he was, he was born in the colonies.

814
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So he was American.

815
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay.

816
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I didn't, I didn't know they called it British America, but it makes sense, I guess.

817
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
They call British Columbia.

818
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Oh, well, this one, okay.

819
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Okay, George, I could have told you this one.

820
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Never express anything unbecoming, nor act against the rules moral before your inferiors.

821
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
No, don't, don't say anything, don't say anything bad or do anything bad when people

822
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
can see you.

823
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
When people of lower stature can see you and say, hey, that nobleman deserves a guillotine,

824
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
maybe.

825
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I guess that implies that you can do things that are unbecoming and act against the rules

826
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
moral when you're around your buddies or your superiors, in fact.

827
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So that's a classic, like, hoity-toity thing.

828
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah.

829
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Be not immodest in urging your friends to discover a secret.

830
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
By discover, I think he means, like, reveal it.

831
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Okay, this one seems weird.

832
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,000
In walking up and down in a house, only with one in company, if he be greater than yourself.

833
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Wait, what?

834
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
In walking up and down in a house, only with one in company, if he be greater than yourself,

835
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:35,000
at the first, give him the right hand and stop not till he does, and be not the first that turns.

836
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
What?

837
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Okay, there's more.

838
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Wait, let me finish.

839
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
All right.

840
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And when you do turn, let it be with your face towards him.

841
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
If he be a man of great quality, walk not with him cheek by jowl, but somewhat behind him,

842
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
but yet in such a manner that he may easily speak to you.

843
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Okay.

844
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
This is just sort of like etiquette when walking with a person of greater status to not leave

845
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
him around or to, you know, to be in front of them.

846
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Okay, let him stand on the right, don't stop before he stops, and don't turn before he turns.

847
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay, so be a follower.

848
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
If someone is your superior, fucking like, yeah, okay, let them lead you.

849
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay, well, whatever.

850
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It's funny, because I feel like this is mostly common sense.

851
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Some of it is, some of it.

852
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Like you would learn this like living normally.

854
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Shake not the head, feet, or legs.

855
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Roll not the eyes.

856
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Lift not one eyebrow higher than the other.

857
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Rye not the mouth.

858
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And Badoo, no man's face with your spittle by approaching to near him when you speak.

859
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah.

860
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah, true, Jor.

861
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Badoo, I have Badoo your face with my spittle.

862
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
He's had, he's definitely had a few like annoying people come up to him.

863
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah, he was thinking of, there was someone specific he was thinking of when he wrote that.

864
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Someone coming up who's being so rude, Badooing his face with spittle, raising his eyebrows

865
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and rolling his eyes like, oh, what are you, what are you writing there, George?

866
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Okay.

867
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
What are you, dumb?

868
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Okay.

869
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Are you stupid?

870
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Hey, what are you talking about?

871
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What are you talking about?

872
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
What are you writing?

873
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Okay.

874
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Shake.

875
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Okay.

876
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That before the Badooing with spittle, which is just great.

877
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Shake, that first list of things, it's like things, it's like things you would do if

878
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
you're like being disapproving and like you think someone is an idiot.

879
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It's, these are like a list of things that you would do to someone that you think sucks

880
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and you hate them.

881
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So it's like, yeah, don't do any of these things or people will think you hate them.

882
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Like, you know, shaking your head at someone, rolling your eyes at someone, lifting one

883
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
eyebrow higher than, you know, cocking an eyebrow at someone, making a rye face with your mouth.

884
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
These are like, it's like, don't make a face at someone that looks like you think they're

885
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
moron.

886
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
This is really funny.

887
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
But the idea that he's like encountered these annoying people and 14 years old, he's like,

888
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm going to set the record straight on how you're supposed to be.

889
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Because I hate these people.

890
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
He didn't even like come up with these himself, actually.

891
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Did he not?

892
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Okay.

893
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
George Washington and the father of our country exhibited notable manners throughout his

894
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
life.

895
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Diligence and social matters was common practice in decent society over the world during his

896
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
lifetime.

897
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Unlike, unlike in the modern age, am I right?

898
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Unlike these days, kids these days and society when we live in a society in 1984.

899
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
At the age of 14, George Washington wrote down 110 rules under the title, rules of civility

900
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and decent behavior in company and conversation.

901
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
These rules were drawn from an English translation of a French book of maxims and were intended

902
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
to polish manners, keep alive the best affections of the heart, impress the obligation of moral

903
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
virtues, teach how to treat others and social relations, and above all, inculcate the practice

904
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
of a perfect self-control.

905
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So these were 110 rules that he read in another book that he was like, yeah, these ones are

906
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
good.

907
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Okay.

908
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So he didn't even really.

909
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Ooh, this is number, number one.

910
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Rule number one, every action done in company ought to be with some sign of respect to those

911
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
who are present.

912
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Okay.

913
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Okay.

914
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Number two, when in company, put not your hands to any part of the body not usually discovered.

915
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Meaning like, don't like stick your hands like in your clothes and like touch yourself

916
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
in like weird places.

917
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah.

918
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay.

919
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Don't.

920
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Number three, I like this one.

921
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Show nothing to your friend that may affright him.

922
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Don't scare your friends.

923
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh, spit not in the fire nor stoop low before it.

924
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Neither put your hands to the flames to warm them nor set your feet upon the fire, especially

925
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
if there be meat before it.

926
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Gib, Gib, you gotta give me one second.

927
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Okay.

928
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Gib, you gotta give me one second.

929
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I spilled some shit.

930
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I gotta clean up.

931
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

932
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh, lol.

933
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Sorry.

934
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'll be right, I'll be back.

935
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You know what I'm saying?

936
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Ben St.

937
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
The drink spiller.

938
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
The liquid loosener.

939
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The, uh, the deuce spiller.

940
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Table wetter.

941
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
A few moments later.

942
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Okay.

943
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Gib, you there?

944
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah.

945
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Sorry.

946
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Sorry about that.

947
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What did you spill?

948
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Oh, no, I know what you were drinking.

949
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What was the second bottle that was on the ground that I had forgotten about?

951
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, piss.

952
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,000
So, I am, you know, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to, like, use my Mr. Clean later

953
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
to prevent bugs.

954
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
All right.

955
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Anyway, so that's enough of, uh, so that's enough of George Washington's rules of whatever.

956
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Rules for life.

957
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yeah.

958
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
They're, they're George Washington's 110 rules for life.

959
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah.

960
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Okay.

961
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Okay.

962
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Well, the other funniest gifts.

963
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So those, those were the, those were the, uh, two very funny gifts and then another one,

964
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
which I feel the need to show.

965
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Uh, I'm saving, I'm getting it from, uh, another folder right now.

966
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Okay.

967
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Michelle, right?

968
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Michelle made me this and this is so awesome.

969
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I can't even, I can't even really, I don't, I don't really have the words to express how

970
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:17,000
great this, this is, uh, this is, um, a painting of a scene from, uh, T-Bap Phantom Reviews,

971
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
a hearth-swarming Eve.

972
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Uh, she made it for me.

973
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And I think Nate framed it.

974
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I think Nate said, Nate, he put it in the frame.

975
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Oh yeah, that's, there you are.

976
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah, it's the scene of, uh,

977
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Wait, Michelle painted that.

978
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
She did.

979
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Dang.

980
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:49,000
She painted it, uh, um, it's the scene, yeah, at the end of Phantom Reviews, it's Phantom's, uh, fantasy of himself on the, on the equestrian throne.

981
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Uh, and he's got all the, uh, he's got, uh, he's got Luna and Celestia enslaved there.

982
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:04,000
He's wearing the crown of Princess, uh, what's Princess Platinum from the, the old, the ancient Princess of Unicornia.

983
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
He's got all, he's got the elements of harmony there.

984
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
He's got the crystal heart.

985
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He's got Sor, uh, uh, uh, not Soran's horn.

986
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Um, who was that evil pony, the shadow?

987
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Sombra.

988
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah, umbra.

989
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yes.

990
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Sombra's horn, yeah.

991
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That, on the bottom left, I think that's the book from that one episode where Rarity finds the evil book that gives her evil green, like, greed magic.

992
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That would, I thought that was Trixie that did that in that episode.

993
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
No, no, no, no, they, they, she and Spike find a book in a library.

994
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And she goes green.

995
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That was the episode I reviewed where the Gibbon rub face comes from.

996
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Or, I don't actually remember what the episode was about.

997
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
No, you know, that, that might be, that might be like Star Swirl the bearded's journal or something.

998
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's a little hard to tell.

999
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Like, I forget what that.

1000
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Is that cake standard in carbonite?

1001
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yeah, it's cake, cake standard frozen in carbonite.

1002
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
The ultimate prize.

1003
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Um, yeah, so I love this more than I can adequately express.

1004
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Damn.

1005
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Michelle always said she hates artists and yet here she is being.

1006
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And yet here she is.

1007
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
What a, what a hypocrite.

1008
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And yet you participate in art.

1009
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Hmm.

1010
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You criticize artists and yet you painted a thoughtful Christmas present for me.

1011
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You bitch.

1012
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yeah.

1013
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Hmm.

1014
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Hmm.

1015
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So that's delightful.

1016
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Um, and then this is crazy.

1017
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I'll tell one, one more like shocking gift that I received.

1018
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
My, um, who does this?

1019
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
My sister's boyfriend got me and Nate.

1020
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
He just got us both playstations.

1021
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
What?

1022
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Like, that's like, that's like $150 like on eBay.

1023
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Like an old PlayStation one.

1024
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Yeah.

1025
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah.

1026
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Like a, like a PlayStation.

1027
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Like an old PS PS one.

1028
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Like nice.

1029
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Okay.

1030
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Okay.

1031
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Okay, buddy.

1032
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
All right.

1033
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You can play Final Fantasy seven.

1034
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And he also, and he also got me a greatest hits copy of Final Fantasy seven.

1035
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And, uh, wait, what was the other one?

1036
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Uh, Crash Bandicoot Warped, which I think is a racing.

1037
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
No, that's the, that's the third Crash Bandicoot.

1038
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
That's the, that's the best one.

1039
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Have you not played that?

1040
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Wait.

1041
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
No.

1042
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
No.

1043
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Okay.

1044
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It looks like, it looks like he's riding motorcycles and shit in all of these.

1045
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
That there is motorcycle levels.

1046
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And like flying plane.

1047
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
No, I've only ever played the first one.

1048
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Oh, the third one's nice and polished and fun.

1049
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh, wow.

1050
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I didn't even know there was a third one.

1051
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Okay.

1052
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Speeding it.

1053
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Okay.

1054
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The box art, I just noticed that the box art, it's him and, and the girl.

1055
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Wait, hold on.

1056
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I'll post the box art because it's pretty funny.

1057
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Um, uh, they're on motorcycles and shit.

1058
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And in the background, speeding enforced by Sheriff Neo Cortex.

1059
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I guess he's gone from being a mad scientist to a, a highway cop.

1060
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's, it's just like the, like the bad face on every like billboard or thing.

1061
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It's like Neo Cortex is the bad guy everywhere.

1062
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
He's not just a mad scientist on an island.

1063
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Hmm.

1064
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Uh, a cab includes Dr. Cortex.

1065
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I like that.

1066
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Like sort of like, like, like dejected looking dinosaur in the back.

1067
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I never noticed his expression.

1068
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
He looks like I should be the Yoshi of this, but you have a motorbike instead.

1069
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
And a tiger.

1070
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You got a motorcycle and a tiger and like, where does that, and where does that leave me?

1071
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Huh?

1072
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
He's really sad.

1073
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
He looks like, um, you know, the.

1074
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Uh huh.

1075
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Uh huh.

1076
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Uh huh.

1077
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Uh huh.

1078
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Uh huh.

1079
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah.

1080
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Uh huh.

1081
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Uh huh.

1082
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yeah.

1083
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It looks like that.

1084
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Um, so, so the pretty, I don't know, just like a pretty big flex of a gift to just get to

1085
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
of.

1086
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah.

1087
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
He wants, he wants, uh, to get on the good side of your family.

1088
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I guess.

1089
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I guess.

1090
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I guess so.

1091
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, he already is.

1092
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Like he's come to like, well, he didn't come to last Christmas because it was canceled.

1093
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Lamal, but he's come to like a bunch of other family stuff.

1094
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
He's pretty much already on the good side as he needs to be.

1095
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Uh, um, I don't know.

1096
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Crazy shit.

1097
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Crazy shit.

1098
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Um, we did a, um, yeah, we did a, um, we did a sort of a friend's mess, like, like a gift

1099
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
exchange at Munchie house.

1100
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And of course the, the greatest gift of all that we exchanged was of course the Omicron

1101
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
variant.

1102
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Um, but, um, uh, uh, uh, what did I get?

1103
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Oh yeah.

1104
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Munchie got me a, another cop killer shirt.

1105
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,000
We got, we got a new, a new matching cop killer and ratty fucker shirts was my gift.

1106
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Um, there was also, um, for, for someone who, uh, I don't, we don't know, for someone who

1107
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I know locally, I got a, I got a copy of B here now, which is like some like 70s, like

1108
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
missed, like Western mysticism yoga.

1109
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Shit.

1110
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And also a copy of, um, but the, but the spending limit was $20.

1111
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So I found this copy of B here now and I was like, this is weird.

1112
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
This is cool.

1113
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And he loved it.

1114
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It was great.

1115
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Uh, it was a perfect, it was a perfect gift.

1116
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I'm a genius, but it would only, it only cost like $9.

1117
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So I had 11 left over.

1118
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So I had to get something else to fill out the, um, you know, the spending requirements.

1119
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So naturally I did the only reasonable thing and I threw in a secondary gift of a copy

1120
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:20,000
of, um, the truths we hold, the Kamala Harris autobiography, which went, which went over

1121
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
like gangbusters.

1122
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Everybody clapped and cheered and said, oh my God, it's the first woman to hold presidential

1123
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
power while Joe Biden was anesthetized during a routine colonoscopy.

1124
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And I said, yes, queen.

1125
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Classic.

1126
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
That's her, that's her claim of fame.

1127
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It's exactly how everyone reacts whenever Kamala's around future, future of the Democratic

1128
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Party.

1129
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Oh yeah.

1130
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Um, I didn't get much gifts actually this year.

1131
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I got, um, I got like a dress from, from my mom, which was nice.

1132
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And like, uh, like, like, like girl shit, like, like stuff for girls.

1133
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And I was like, that's cute.

1134
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That's fucked up.

1135
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's a little, it's a little epic.

1136
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I tried it.

1137
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It looks weird on me because I'm not used to like wearing a dress like a normal day to

1138
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
day thing, but it looked pretty good.

1139
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Do you not have dresses?

1140
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I have dresses, but like, I don't know.

1141
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Dress feels like a party thing.

1142
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Not like a wake up, like it's a formal, like it's a formal dress.

1143
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's not a little fancy.

1144
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
No, no, no.

1145
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's just sort of, I mean, I have, when you get close at Christmas, or at least when I

1146
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
get close at Christmas, I wear them on Christmas day and then a few days after just to see,

1147
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
you know, how they feel.

1148
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And for the first time, I've been going like, like, I was about to say hardcore girl mode

1149
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and that's not the right phrasing.

1150
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Hardcore girl mode.

1151
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:13,000
But like wearing a dress and leggings and stuff in front of family and it's no big deal.

1152
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So that's, that's a nice, that's a nice feeling.

1153
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Even my dad was just sort of like, yeah, it looks good.

1154
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
So that's a, that's a nice thing.

1155
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Sweet.

1156
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But aside from that, yeah, I don't know.

1157
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I got dreams that PS4 game where you can like make video games and then play other people's

1158
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
video games, like LittleBigPlanet.

1159
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I was going to say, is it like LittleBigPlanet?

1160
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I haven't seen that one.

1161
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's by the same company, but like the, with the PS4, like the, the abilities to make things

1162
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
are like so much greater.

1163
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
You can basically make anything.

1164
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Oh.

1165
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Some people have made like recreations of Spyro games.

1166
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Peter Griffin goes to Bikini Bottom.

1167
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Yeah, you can do.

1168
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That's pretty exciting.

1169
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,000
You can do all sorts of things and they have like very easy to make like platform things

1170
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
like 3D platformers, lots of 3D platformers.

1171
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
People just trying to recreate Spyro and Crash Bandicoot and stuff and Jack and Dexter.

1172
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Yeah.

1173
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Because it's not actually difficult to do that.

1174
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And I'm like, that's, that's neat.

1175
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And then there's like really cringe terrible things that people didn't try very hard on,

1176
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
which is also funny.

1177
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I've been playing that and I think that was about it.

1178
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It wasn't really much of a, like a gift haul.

1179
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And isn't, hasn't been usually because I don't like ask, I don't know what to ask for.

1180
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Whatever.

1181
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Why, why is like this character, one that I see a bunch of images of when I search for

1182
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Dreams PS4?

1183
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
What is that?

1184
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That's a fat person doing like a dab.

1185
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
House of, House of Beavis?

1186
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Dreams PS4 House, House of Beavis.

1187
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Uh, there's a, there's a YouTube video.

1188
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Let's, let's find out, shall we?

1189
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Okay.

1190
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I think this might just be something that someone made.

1191
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But yeah.

1192
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Oh yeah.

1193
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Look at, look at like the amount of stuff you can do.

1194
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You can make a full like fucking 3D game in, in dream, in dreams.

1195
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Little big planet.

1196
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It was like side-scroller or if you fuck around, you can maybe make a top-down thing.

1197
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
But in this, you can do fucking everything.

1198
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Could you make a top-down and a little big planet?

1199
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I don't even remember.

1200
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I only remember side-scrollers.

1201
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,000
In Little Big Planet 2 and 3, they introduced like a, a, a motherboard, like computer chip

1202
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
board thing, item that you can stick to a block.

1203
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And then you can give it like code, like rudimentary code, like and or gates and like line up everything.

1204
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And so you can make it so the gravity doesn't work on a thing.

1205
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And by pressing directions, you can go up, down, left, and right.

1206
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And that you can control the block and you can make yourself invisible.

1207
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So you create like a block that is your character.

1208
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And then you can top-down, you can make the level like that.

1209
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And it's why it's, it's, it's a real big hassle, but it was possible.

1210
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I never actually figured out how to make a top-down level in Little Big Planet.

1211
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I, I played a bunch of levels in Little Big Planet.

1212
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I never really, never really got into like making stuff with it.

1213
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Me either.

1214
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I made like a bunch of levels, but they were like very, like very much not a finished product.

1215
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I got very bored of things very quickly.

1216
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I had like a level that was just one thing, like a slide slams you somewhere.

1217
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Or like I made a car that goes, whew, and it's smashed into something.

1218
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And I was like, I don't, I don't want to build a level for this.

1219
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Fuck it.

1220
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Okay, I'm watching this video and it seems like this is just some art piece level.

1221
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah, you can.

1222
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Where you run around like a weird sort of abstract like museum and look at weird stuff and hear

1223
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Bennett Foddy style, like audio clips of things.

1224
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Yeah, there's no like limits on what a dream is in dreams.

1225
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It doesn't have to be a game.

1226
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Sometimes it's a, it's just like a movie or short film or music.

1227
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Ah, walking simulators.

1228
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
No.

1229
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah.

1230
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But there's plenty of like, there's plenty of, there's plenty of fun and not bullshit.

1231
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
True.

1232
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I did type in Vriska to see what there was and there was like a cutscene of, of Vriska

1233
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
killing Tavros and I was like five seconds.

1234
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Well, this is pretty neat.

1235
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:12,000
This is, this is just the little big planet thing was like, you could make games, but

1236
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,000
it was all like tethered to this like sort of like toy set sort of aesthetic.

1237
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
This just seems like they're just like, fuck it.

1238
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
No, no rules.

1239
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Do whatever you want.

1240
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
There is no, there is no unifying anything.

1241
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Yeah.

1242
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The, you know, the need for, the need for any such.

1243
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Yeah.

1244
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's over.

1245
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
We don't need it.

1246
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Let's do whatever you want.

1247
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
There have been like a number of little games I looked at that were like legitimately could be

1248
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
like indie games on steam.

1249
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Like with the level of polish, like, dang, you could, you could sell this, but it's on

1250
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
dreams, so you can't sell it.

1251
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I don't know what the people do who make these.

1252
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Like the quality level, the quality ceiling is like, you could probably like recreate

1253
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
a AAA game in dreams.

1254
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I, I can't help.

1255
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I'm noticing, you know, I don't know why, but in my, in my search for ps4 dreams, this

1256
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
image was at like the very top of a bunch of my search results.

1257
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And I'm just, I, is this a real video game?

1258
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
What's, what is this?

1259
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Occultic nine.

1260
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That's a funny box.

1261
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Occultic nine.

1262
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Uh, it sure is funny.

1263
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
What is, I, I had, hmm.

1264
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Now not to body shame or anything, but something about this character.

1265
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I don't know.

1266
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
This makes me think this isn't a real video game.

1267
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Occultic nine, anime boobs, boob physics, GIF.

1268
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Okay.

1269
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Is this like a, is it like a supporting game?

1270
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So this character is like, it's, it's a gigantic boob lady.

1271
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And that's her character trait physically.

1272
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Okay.

1273
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Is that what the game's about?

1274
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Is it like a, is it like an ecchi game?

1275
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
That's, I'm a little, I'm a little bit curious.

1276
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Occultic nine, blah, blah, blah.

1277
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Is it Japanese light novel series?

1278
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Yeah.

1279
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Okay.

1280
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
We just found the same result.

1281
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah.

1282
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So this series, and it's a game of it.

1283
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Okay.

1284
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So it's, it's anime, which means it's hyper sexual sometimes.

1285
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, it's by the creator of Stein's game.

1286
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That's more like Stein's pants.

1287
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
You know what I'm saying?

1288
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I do.

1289
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Sadly, I sadly, I know all too well that to which you refer.

1290
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I just like, I'm sorry.

1291
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I can't, it's bold.

1292
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It's bold, bold to make that your fucking box art.

1293
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Like, I'm sure the game has a plot.

1294
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It looks like a, like persona or something.

1295
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
It's about like occult investigators.

1296
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
But the box art is just about a girl with huge tits.

1297
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh my God, that is just the box art.

1298
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I thought it was like a promotional image.

1299
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
No, that's just the box art for the fucking game.

1300
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm looking at an article.

1301
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Well, I got my attention.

1302
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Is, are they going to like, in this article,

1303
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
address the fact that the box art is what it is?

1304
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
No.

1305
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
They're just saying the game is launched.

1306
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Like, it's funny.

1307
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Like, in all the other art, you know, there's a bunch of characters

1308
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
and one of them has huge tits and like, it's fine.

1309
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It's like, it's, you know, it's notable.

1310
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I notice it, but it's not like the main thing.

1311
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I think it's a main thing about her character.

1312
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I can't see anything.

1313
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I can't see anything else.

1314
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I can't see anything else on the screen.

1315
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
That's a deep dive thing.

1316
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm going to look into why that is the way it is.

1317
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Cause I'm sure like,

1318
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Right.

1319
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
For the creator.

1320
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
For educational, for reasons, for academic reasons.

1321
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
No, but for real.

1322
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
That's such a weird thing to put on the box art.

1323
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Okay. I'm not crazy, right?

1324
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I saw that box art and I'm like, why is it like this?

1325
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
This seems unusual.

1326
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
This is, I don't know.

1327
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Well, my first thought was like, do they put like,

1328
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
do they put like a, like Hentai

1329
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
visual novels on the PS4 now?

1330
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Is it a visual novel?

1331
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I mean, the visual novel.

1332
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
No.

1333
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Well, I don't know.

1334
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I don't know what kind of game it is.

1335
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Maybe it's a visual novel.

1336
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But I saw it, it looks like, you know,

1337
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
it looks like a Hentai visual novel.

1338
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Like if I saw it on Steam, that's what I would assume it was.

1339
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It's funny.

1340
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Some images of this character do not emphasize the breasts.

1341
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
She's just sort of like a detective.

1342
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1343
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And she's like.

1344
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
This one.

1345
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
This, this, this yellow one does not really emphasize it.

1346
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But the cover of the light novel doesn't emphasize it.

1347
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah, she's just, she's got an arm in front of it.

1348
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You can't tell.

1349
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
But I guess, damn, I guess they were like,

1350
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I guess they were like, we know what, we know what,

1351
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
we know what sells.

1352
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Like we know what the.

1353
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We know what the most marketable aspect of this series is.

1354
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
The, the Occultic Nine opening movie.

1355
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
No emphasis on the breasts at all.

1356
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I go down to the comments.

1357
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
First comment.

1358
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I'm a simple man.

1359
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I like the cover of the game.

1360
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Yeah.

1361
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
That's why everyone's here.

1362
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
They fucking got me.

1363
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
That's why we're talking about it.

1364
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I've been tricked.

1365
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
They're not even real boobs.

1366
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
They're a fake.

1367
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
This is a fake simulacrum of a human that this,

1368
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
that this mangaka or whatever dreamt up to fucking fool me.

1369
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And.

1370
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
They did the most interesting part about it is like.

1371
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It's not.

1372
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It's not obvious why like obviously sexualizing things.

1373
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Is like pretty normal in Japanese media.

1374
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
But.

1375
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I feel like.

1376
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
This crosses a threshold beyond which is that is like.

1377
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Except can never.

1378
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
We can never.

1379
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Imagine seeing a character like this in like Pokemon or something.

1380
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah.

1381
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah.

1382
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
You could, this would get, this would get censored.

1383
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
This would get, um, this would, this is.

1384
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah.

1385
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
The, the, the, the.

1386
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
The, the posing, the, the brazenness of the posing.

1387
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It's like, it's like remarkable.

1388
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It's, it's.

1389
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It's, it would be.

1390
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
It's, it's remarkable enough that I see it and I think this has to be porn.

1391
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And then to find out like, no, it's not porn.

1392
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It's not porn.

1393
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's actually just a completely, it's, it's just a completely normal.

1394
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
You know, like video game.

1395
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Uh.

1396
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
But.

1397
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah.

1398
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
That's why I want to.

1399
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It's actually, it's dirtier.

1400
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's, it actually makes me feel dirtier.

1401
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Like if it was porn, I'd just be like, yeah, okay.

1402
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But there's like, no, like the fact, like it's not, it's not that.

1403
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I know you thought that, but it's actually not.

1404
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
And I'm just like, well, then you, I, you have failed.

1405
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You have done.

1406
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I feel like it's, it's crass, it's crass of them to art, to, to, to, to.

1407
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Market it that way in a way that looks like porn.

1408
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And then you look at it and it's like, no, it's not.

1409
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
It's like, well, I think that's on you.

1410
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I don't think I'm, I don't think I'm to blame here.

1411
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
That what I want to know is whether like her character design is like

1412
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,000
thematically relevant to her or the events of whatever is going on.

1413
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I want to look into it just to see if there's anything there because if there's

1414
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
nothing, it's just like, it's a character that just happens to have a completely

1415
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
incidental detail.

1416
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Here's, well, here's the thing.

1417
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I was wondering about this a while ago.

1418
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It must be remarked upon.

1419
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Sure.

1420
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Um, like a character would be like, oh my God, that lady has huge boobs.

1421
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Boob lady.

1422
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Boob lady.

1423
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Wow.

1424
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Let's start a mystery team.

1425
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Absolutely.

1426
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Absolutely.

1427
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Get my magnifying glass out, have a look around.

1428
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Let's do some, do some slew thing.

1429
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Yeah.

1430
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But like, I was thinking about this a while ago, like, I had that character

1431
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
scraggity, aggity, the scarecrow.

1432
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah.

1433
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
She's got big boobies.

1434
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Yeah.

1435
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
They're made of like straw.

1436
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah.

1437
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And they're like, they don't have to be like that.

1438
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I just liked it.

1439
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah.

1440
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And I'm like, I'm thinking the, like this is weird to me.

1441
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's, I don't like find it offensive.

1442
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
It's kind of funny.

1443
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Yeah.

1444
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And odd.

1445
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Yeah.

1446
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And I wonder if like, this shouldn't be something that people take issue with

1447
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
like a character just having large breasts.

1448
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Well, I mean, with, okay.

1449
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But she, but she's not a real, but she's not a real person.

1450
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Right.

1451
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
If she were a real person, obviously there would be nothing objectionable.

1452
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You know what I mean?

1453
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Objectionable.

1454
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I don't even mean it's objectionable.

1455
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
There would be nothing to even remark upon, but this is a, this is a, this is a piece

1456
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
of marketing.

1457
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It is remark able.

1458
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Yeah.

1459
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I've seen these, some of these gifts though, and they are like clearly supposed to be,

1460
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I don't know.

1461
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Titalating.

1462
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Titalating.

1463
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Sure.

1464
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
If I post it there, will it be a gift?

1465
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yes, it will.

1466
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Like that.

1467
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Like that's just, that's comical.

1468
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
You know, looking, looking pretty good, looking, looking pretty good.

1469
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Listen, I, I get it.

1470
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I get the appeal.

1471
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Of course.

1472
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Of course.

1473
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It's just, it's just amazing that like you're, you're, you're non, you're, you're totally

1474
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:18,000
you're totally PG-13 detective, like occult detective, light novel game.

1475
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:25,000
You dedicate like a third of the entire box art to the secondary character's boobs is

1476
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
all.

1477
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Is it a secondary character?

1478
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I thought it was the main character.

1479
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I'm not actually sure.

1480
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I kind of thought that the main character was that kid in the yellow trench coat, but

1481
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
this could be the main character.

1482
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I don't actually know.

1483
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Actually, it kind of looks like it's both.

1484
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It looks like it might be both the, this girl and the kid in the yellow coat.

1485
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,000
She strikes me as like super ditzy because she's jumping around like, yeah, something,

1486
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
something happened.

1487
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm so happy.

1488
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Bounce, bounce.

1489
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Doesn't even realize that her tits are bouncing.

1490
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And then all the guys, all the guys are like, oh my God, I can't believe she's jumping around

1491
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
like that.

1492
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I mean, I would be like, I can't believe she's jumping around.

1493
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I can't believe she's jumping around like that.

1494
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
That's what I would do.

1495
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Like if you actually had breasts that big, you would know what would happen if you did

1496
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
that.

1497
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I think so.

1498
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
And you would probably wear more modest clothing usually.

1499
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Unless you were trying to look attractive.

1500
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It's sort of, it's an odd character, like design and personality combo.

1501
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I mean, that's, I think that's, I think that's a pretty standard anime thing.

1502
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I guess.

1503
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:39,000
The girl who doesn't seems completely oblivious to what her own boobs are doing.

1504
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And that's her personality.

1505
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
That's the truth.

1506
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
That's the truth.

1507
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yeah.

1508
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Yeah.

1509
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Girl who is just doesn't, that's the one thing that she's just not keyed into is like what

1510
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
they're doing and where they are at any given time.

1511
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I just think of like, I like things to be thematically relevant.

1512
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And so I look at this and I'm like, surely there's something beyond like boobs on screen.

1513
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
You look at these like, these tits better justify themselves in the story.

1514
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Or I'm going to be mad.

1515
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I mean, they could like, like an attractive character and there's like a young boy who

1516
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:24,000
like, I don't know, sexual feelings because that's normal for a young boy and he sees them

1517
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,000
as like, there's some, him growing up is part of the narrative.

1518
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I don't know.

1519
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Like some aspect of like a character being there, being the way they are.

1520
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
That's funny.

1521
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
That's something to do with the characters.

1522
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,000
There's something funny about like your first go-to example of like, why would big boobs

1523
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:49,000
be relative to a story is, well, what if like a little boy sees them and wants to get,

1524
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and he's horny for them and learns a lesson along the way.

1525
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Like that now that would be a story.

1526
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Well, it's, it's, I'm just spitballing, but like, in, in, like out of, out of like a,

1527
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
like out of, I'm trying to think of the weighted phrase.

1528
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It's not like out of context, but like, were there no context existing?

1529
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
There should be no difference between a character having any given attribute in a story.

1530
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
They can have any attribute they you want that doesn't need to be used in a thematic

1531
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
way to be necessary or allowed or valid or whatever.

1532
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah.

1533
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And I would like it if it was fine for like characters to just have large breasts in

1534
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
and the only place that doesn't seem to happen is in anime.

1535
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Where's the big booby rights?

1536
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
But they only seem to be in anime for like titillation reasons.

1537
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Where's the big booby like not sexualized?

1538
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Well, it's like, it's because it's because if you're, if you're making a piece of media,

1539
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
you know, you're, you're designing the character.

1540
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,000
You know, these aren't, it's not, they're not a real, they're not, they're not a real person.

1541
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
They're crafted by an author.

1542
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So it's not the same as just a person having a body like that in real life.

1543
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No, no, no.

1544
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I understand.

1545
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,000
But like art can replicate life if you could put any body type into a piece of media.

1546
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And like if, if the say, you know how like representation is like skewed in the favor of

1547
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
what the author knows about and is comfortable drawing or making.

1548
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
So there's a lot of white people in Hollywood and have been for years.

1549
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So it's like, okay, representation.

1550
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,000
You, you, you increase the pool of the types of people that can be in movies.

1551
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And that's good.

1552
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It just gets more people work and it's nice to see your own body type or sex or race or

1553
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
whatever be represented in media that you consume.

1554
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So it should be the same for large breasts because people have them to have representation

1555
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:12,000
in media, but it's always, I feel like it's always used for sexual like gratification.

1556
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I think, okay.

1557
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Crazy.

1558
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Here's my crazy, crazy take, crazy take.

1559
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Tell me if I'm insane.

1560
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I think that like you, you, you, the, the, the stereotypically attracted like, like the

1561
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
classically beautiful woman, right?

1562
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I mean, I think like, like, like the Hollywood actress, the like a famous woman like that

1563
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
who we might see on television or in movies.

1564
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
They're, you know, they're, they look a certain way.

1565
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
They have a certain build.

1566
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
They have, they might have breasts.

1567
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
They might even have somewhat big breasts, but they're not that big.

1568
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Like who's like the, like the biggest breasted famous woman might be like, I think Scarlett

1569
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Johansson's are kind of big, but they're not that big.

1570
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Like I actually kind of think genuinely there is sort of not that many women that have like

1571
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
really large ones.

1572
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And I know that that's kind of just because they're sort of just uncommon in general.

1573
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I don't know.

1574
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I think maybe we could stand to have a few that have like abnormally large ones for lack

1575
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
of a better word.

1576
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Why not?

1577
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
You know?

1578
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
So, so like those are not, those are not, those are not considered like Hollywood beautiful.

1579
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Those are considered like porn.

1580
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Those are considered like pornographic.

1581
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
They're not considered like, um, like you should be in movies.

1582
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
You should be a model.

1583
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Beautiful.

1584
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I think it is a little bad.

1585
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And I, and, and, you know, the fact that it would cater to my personal taste is doesn't

1586
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
have anything to do with what I'm saying also.

1587
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
It's even, even, even removed from that.

1588
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I think the point is still true.

1589
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:56,000
What's the, what's the word when pigeonholed, right?

1590
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah.

1591
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
When you're pigeonholed into a role.

1592
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Yeah.

1593
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Women with large breasts can't be a Hollywood actress.

1594
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
People.

1595
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You have to be the, the large breast woman.

1596
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yeah.

1597
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
If there is something like that.

1598
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,000
People say, um, you know, um, you know, big, big boobs, like, ha, ha, they're, they, you,

1599
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
you, you're, um, you're, I don't know.

1600
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
What do they say about that?

1601
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Like, you know, they, they're like, I don't know.

1602
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
They're like, they don't, they're the luckiest, I guess.

1603
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Or like they're like, like they don't, there was that one episode of, um, king of the hill

1604
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
where Peggy gets like tricked into being like a foot fetish model.

1605
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:43,000
And, um, she tries to explain what she's doing to Bobby by saying that like she's helping

1606
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:49,000
like equal the playing field for women because like now it's not just like women with big

1607
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
boobs and big butts that like men like now they like women with big feet too.

1608
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And, um, and Bobby's like, I don't get it.

1609
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
How does this help the woman with big boobies?

1610
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And she, and Peggy says, believe me, Bobby, they don't need any help.

1611
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And it's like, you know, it's like a good thing.

1612
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
It's not like, like, yeah, they don't need any help.

1613
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Like it's not a bad thing.

1614
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
But I think, yeah, but you never, you know, there's a certain, I think there is a certain

1615
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:23,000
size threshold that you don't really see anyone in like mainstream media going over

1616
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
unless it's like a comedy character, right?

1617
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
They'd be like a fan.

1618
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Unless it's a comedy character, unless it's a comedy character or if it's an anime where

1619
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Yeah, an anime is different, obviously.

1620
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
It's, it's like, it's a way more common because you can draw them.

1621
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
You don't have to find an actress.

1622
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I guess.

1623
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
You know, having, having mulled this over and all that.

1624
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
During this conversation, I started, I started representation.

1625
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
We do.

1626
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That's where I'm getting.

1627
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Like at the, at the outset, I still think a cult nine is doing like the classic big boob,

1628
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
but only because sex, sexual appeal and not because it's just happens to be a character.

1629
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
No, this is, this is not, I would not call this representation.

1630
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
No.

1631
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
So in some sense, it's, it would be fine and cool.

1632
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:23,000
In fact, if she just has breasts for no, like large breasts for no reason in the game,

1633
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
but the way she's portrayed in the media is like a meta.

1634
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Like the reason is that like people who like big boob will click and will be interested

1635
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
in the marketing.

1636
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
You're saying that she has, if she just had big boob, but it was not like the point of

1637
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
the character and it wasn't like.

1638
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
If it wasn't so big on the buck side.

1639
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Right.

1640
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Like the fact that it was done as like a media, as like a marketing choice is unfortunate,

1641
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
but it would you.

1642
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Yes.

1643
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Yeah.

1644
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I mean, it would be really funny to play the game and for her to have giant hits and

1645
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
for no one to ever really comment about it.

1646
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That would be really funny.

1647
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And I would like that.

1648
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I mean, I would say it could be, it could be commented upon.

1649
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It could even become relevant in some way, but it's like.

1650
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But it doesn't have to be.

1651
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
But if it was not the point.

1652
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Yeah.

1653
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Not being not the point of the character.

1654
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I don't know.

1655
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Maybe maybe I'm jumping to conclusions about this.

1656
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Maybe.

1657
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Maybe if we actually read the fucking light novel or whatever, maybe we would find that

1658
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
that is the treatment that the character gets in the story.

1659
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It's just the marketing material.

1660
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Yeah.

1661
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It's just like fuck that.

1662
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Like, yeah, sure.

1663
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
We got to sell this garbage.

1664
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Nice, good representation of all body types, please.

1665
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Sure.

1666
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
All body types, all sexualities, all people.

1667
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Right.

1668
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I note like, what's his name?

1669
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Scott's roommate from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, the movie.

1670
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Oh, not young Neil.

1671
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Fuck.

1672
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
The other guy.

1673
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
The guy with stubble.

1674
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah.

1675
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I forgot his name.

1676
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yeah.

1677
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
But he's like a good example of gay representation.

1678
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Because him being gay is not like, I mean, he does have a few like jokes where he's like

1679
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
floating with other guys.

1680
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
But it's not like, I mean, it's based on a comic.

1681
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But like, usually or not usually, but it used to be in Hollywood, you have a gay character.

1682
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
They're flamboyantly gay.

1683
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
They talk about sex constantly.

1684
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Right.

1685
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I mean, how else would you know?

1686
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
How else would you know their gay?

1687
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
They're always talking about a guy's dick specifically.

1688
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And it's like, okay, that's not, that's that's stereotyped.

1689
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
That's not representation.

1690
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And that's why the best gay representation of course is always be Albus Dumbledore,

1691
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
who never mentions being gay in any way.

1692
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Almost, you might even think he wasn't.

1693
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
You might even think that maybe he was never meant to be.

1694
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And it was just a complete afterthought that was like decided upon after the fact later.

1695
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
But but it's not obviously that would be silly, but it's good.

1696
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
But it's good representation because you would never know because he because he's a good,

1697
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:23,000
he's one of the good ones and he doesn't talk about it.

1698
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Well, that really, that really activates my coronavirus.

1699
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
That really gets my Omicron's going.

1700
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
That really gets my Omicron's raging in my hippocampus.

1701
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Oh, there we go.

1702
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I can feel them.

1703
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Lost another lost another lost another the micro leader of gray matter there for sure.

1704
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
No question.

1705
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
All right.

1706
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
What else?

1707
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
What else are you talking about here?

1708
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Well, Christmas Christmas.

1709
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I mean, we kind of talked about gifts and stuff.

1710
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I didn't have a Christmas.

1711
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I was robbed of the holiday.

1712
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Yes.

1713
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Did you have a tree?

1714
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
No, not in my you did decorate and all that.

1715
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Yeah.

1716
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:20,000
When I went for Thanksgiving, we decorated me and my dad decorated the tree in their house.

1717
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So I did that.

1718
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
You didn't get to see the fruits of your labor on the big day.

1719
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
No, no, I didn't.

1720
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I had to fucking it was so so depressing.

1721
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
They like those my family got came.

1722
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
They drove by my house and like they dropped my you know, we met out in the parking lot

1723
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
and they dropped my stuff off and they helped me carry it in.

1724
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
They dropped my gifts off and I carried it into my house and I put it in my room.

1725
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And then on Christmas, like I called them in the evening and like I opened them up like on the phone.

1726
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I was like, ah, geez.

1727
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
But it's OK.

1728
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
It was fine.

1729
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Still got my sweet phantom horn painting so can't complain.

1730
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So got my PlayStation and my copy of Crash Bandicoot warped.

1731
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
What more could a boy ask for?

1732
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
If you're OK when I come over, we should play that.

1733
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
We should do a let's play.

1734
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Oh, sure.

1735
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Of you.

1736
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Three.

1737
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Sure.

1738
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Yeah.

1739
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Why the heck not?

1740
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Yeah, I've played.

1741
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I think I think I've only played the first one.

1742
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I might have played the second one.

1743
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Maybe at some point.

1744
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I don't know.

1745
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Definitely never played this one though.

1746
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I will put it.

1747
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yeah, I've got a I've got a PlayStation now.

1748
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So that's kind of that's that's pretty neat.

1749
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I think it came with all the cords and stuff needed to hook it up pretty pretty base.

1750
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yeah, that was anyway, that was my Christmas.

1751
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
There's nothing more to it than that.

1752
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I had our family trying to sleep.

1753
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Our family had the the the traditional Christmas Eve party where we get a bunch of our friends over.

1754
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And just drink about stuff, talk and drink.

1755
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And last Christmas, it was canceled because lockdowns and stuff.

1756
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
This Christmas, we were allowed to but people were scared still.

1757
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
So not that many people showed up.

1758
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
And we had a bunch of food that we prepared and still there is so much food.

1759
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
We couldn't eat at all.

1760
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:46,000
But some people did appear and yeah, I was determined to get all fucked up a little wasted.

1761
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Because I have been tired and stressed out all month trying to get the secret project done.

1762
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Realizing that it wasn't feasible to get it done before the end of the year.

1763
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Trying to trying to like feel happy because the holidays are happening and not feeling happy maybe feel guilty about it.

1764
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And I was just I was just getting all like worked up over really nothing.

1765
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I should have been just relaxing.

1766
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I think you may have seen on my Twitter.

1767
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I said fuck Christmas it sucks.

1768
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I hate it and I'm sad and that was good because I felt like it's the holidays.

1769
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:32,000
You owe it to other people to be happy and I wasn't feeling it and it was really stressing me out.

1770
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,000
So saying fuck Christmas on Twitter allowed me to unwind a bit and then getting drunk was great.

1771
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And we played like I played a guitar.

1772
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I played like getting drunk is great getting drunk is great.

1773
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I played guitar and my dad was on drums and his friend played bass and we played some played some AC DC just fucking around.

1774
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
That was good.

1775
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And that was it.

1776
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
That was a good time and then I got hungover.

1777
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Sounds good.

1778
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Sounds like the kind of fun and low key time I probably would have had if I had gotten to go to my parents house and hang out with everybody.

1779
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
But I didn't.

1780
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Sad.

1781
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I never get to see.

1782
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I like never get to see Nate and Michelle and my sister and her boyfriend.

1783
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
So that's maybe I'll see them again in like spring or summer or something.

1784
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That's pretty cool I guess.

1785
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I'm sad about it.

1786
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I'm sad about it.

1787
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Yeah.

1788
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I hate the Corona virus.

1789
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I don't like Omicron.

1790
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I guess that was Christmas.

1791
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
What are you going to do for New Year's if you're feeling better?

1792
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Well, I don't know.

1793
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Since everybody fucking in the Munchie house is infected, maybe we'll maybe we'll do like if I if we feel better maybe we'll do like a New Year's thing over there.

1794
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I haven't really asked about.

1795
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
We were we were going to do a New Year's thing, but then COVID happened.

1796
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
But then it's like, well, if we all have COVID, like fuck it.

1797
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
You know, assuming we all feel better together.

1798
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Like, you know, like I said, I'm feeling better and hopefully I will continue to feel better.

1799
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
And if that's true, then I feel like I will be all right for that by New Year.

1800
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So maybe we'll do something for New Year's.

1801
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
I don't know.

1802
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I'll have to see how everybody feels about it.

1803
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Oh, somebody.

1804
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Okay.

1805
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So despite the glitch, despite the glitch, the glitch that I have not fixed yet, the first the first person just beat the beta crow is crow is looking on discord.

1806
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Just beat the phantoms revenge beta.

1807
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Congrats.

1808
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
First one.

1809
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Wow. Yeah.

1810
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Oh, they're talking.

1811
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
They're talking about they're talking about how he did it.

1812
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Oh, they're talking shit.

1813
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Oh, he figured he figured out he figured out that okay, he figured out the method.

1814
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
And I think that now that he's figured out the method other people will be like, oh, okay.

1815
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And they'll kind of figure out how to do it because I think a lot of people were not.

1816
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
There's sort of a trick to it.

1817
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
There's a there's a couple tricks to it, actually, and you once you know it, I think it's like, all right, I know what I have to do.

1818
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,000
But before you think of it, it's it might it's like, you might just never think to do it.

1819
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And you might be just be like, what am I doing wrong?

1820
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Lots of people, a bunch of people were DMing me like, Ben, what am I doing wrong?

1821
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
What am I doing wrong here?

1822
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And I refuse to refuse to give anyone any help.

1823
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But I'm surprised because I see maybe I'm forgetting wrong.

1824
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I see I feel like it was the same trick in the in the alpha.

1825
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I think the alpha had kind of the same trick to it.

1826
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So people should have remembered, right?

1827
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Like I think so, unless I'm stupid, but I was like certain that it was basically the same trick.

1828
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And yet people that beat the alpha seemed unable to beat the beta, maybe because the glitch stopped them.

1829
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I don't know.

1830
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I should check check on that.

1831
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
What was it in like Wreck-It Ralph, the glitch they say going gamer?

1832
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
What do they say?

1833
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
When you when you go from one game to another.

1834
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Oh, is it?

1835
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Is it just called going glitch?

1836
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
No, no, no, no, the glitch was like.

1837
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It was that guy.

1838
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
No, it was the girl. She was the glitch.

1839
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
No, was the wasn't the racer guy?

1840
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
No, that was the bad man.

1841
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,000
He was the one he was the original guy who went gamer and went into a different game.

1842
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And his fucking around caused the glitch.

1843
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
That's caused of an LP to be a glitch.

1844
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Oh, yeah, I.

1845
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Yeah, I remember what you're talking about.

1846
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I don't remember shit.

1847
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I don't remember what it was called.

1848
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Is it just called like it's not called like going rogue or going.

1849
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It could be that it going indie would be a really funny word for it.

1850
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
No, it wasn't that funny.

1851
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
It was just sort of like I like going gamer.

1852
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
That's funny.

1853
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:52,000
So maybe a little glitch was going gamer and got into your game.

1854
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And it fucked it up with some people.

1855
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,000
There's like a little cake standard going around like fucking up the game from the inside.

1856
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Oh, wow.

1857
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Okay.

1858
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Crow is looking has figured out everything.

1859
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Crow is Crow is looking has completely cracked it.

1860
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
He has not.

1861
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Okay.

1862
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I'm looking at the at the log and the thing he he not only beat it.

1863
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:26,000
There is a there is a secret objective you can achieve in the game in the beta.

1864
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,000
If you play it absolutely perfectly if you play it completely 100% don't fuck up anything

1865
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
do everything 100% as optimally as is possibly to do it.

1866
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:45,000
There is an extra thing you can you can beat the game with and he has not done it.

1867
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But he has correct.

1868
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
He has correctly identified the means of doing it.

1869
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I feel I feel like I'm giving away too much by even saying that but oh well.

1870
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I'm I'm impressed.

1871
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Okay.

1872
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
So I guess that's progress not my it's not my progress on the game.

1873
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
It's other people's progress on the game.

1874
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
But I got to fix that glitch.

1875
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I got to fix that glitch and then I added them.

1876
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I added features like I added the ability to change the window size because apparently

1877
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
on like a high res monitor it's very small.

1878
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
My monitor is not that great.

1879
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So it seemed normal to me but like on cracks monitor it's like tiny.

1880
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:36,000
So I added the ability to change the window size and stuff like that.

1881
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So I'll release I'll release the patched version with the bugs fixed and that added as beta version 0.02.

1882
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:49,000
And then I'll alpha will come after I got I got to start drawing.

1883
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Fuck I got to start drawing comics again.

1884
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I got to start drawing slime and punishment to actually get that done.

1885
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Oh, I got to make an itch page.

1886
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So hard suddenly suddenly so many things.

1887
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Not suddenly I've known I'd have to do all this shit for a while.

1888
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
It's just a it's not suddenly so many things.

1889
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:21,000
It's just like always so many things and no matter how many things I do there's always a big list of things that need doing.

1890
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Ain't that the truth.

1891
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Ain't that the truth.

1892
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I am very excited.

1893
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I mentioned at the beginning but I'll say it again I'm super excited for New Year's when I can announce my other thing.

1894
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
My other my other funny thing.

1895
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'll announce on Twitter and then the next week I'll say it on here.

1896
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
My secret secret thing is going to be it's going to be it's going to be a blast.

1897
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
It's going to be a who everyone's going to have a good laugh about it.

1898
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And some people will probably give me some money for it.

1899
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
So every everyone wins.

1900
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Very exciting.

1901
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Another thing I did.

1902
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I don't know if people know but I have an art website which is just sort of a collection of images from years of art that I've done.

1903
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:24,000
It's called Gibb and Take Art and it's a Google site which I didn't know about a while years ago but then I found it.

1904
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
It's just like Google documents Google spreadsheet.

1905
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You just make a website in like Google Drive.

1906
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And I did and it was really easy.

1907
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:40,000
The only thing is that it's like it's got a dot site dot Google site.

1908
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,000
It's sites dot Google dot com slash view slash Gibb and Take Art slash home.

1909
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I'll just post that link.

1910
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Go in the description and see the art I made.

1911
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I did one now for 2021.

1912
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I got a page.

1913
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
It's art I made.

1914
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
There's some not-safe-for-work stuff in there this time.

1915
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Oh wait I saw you posted this on.

1916
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Is this a new site?

1917
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
This has been around for a few years.

1918
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I usually just talk about it on Twitter.

1919
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Oh wait I have seen this once or twice.

1920
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I feel pretty happy despite my not drawing quite as much this year.

1921
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I feel pretty happy about what I have to offer.

1922
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
What I have done.

1923
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I'm pretty good at drawing.

1924
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
The queen is pretty good.

1925
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Of queen saying Lamal based.

1926
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Yeah that's like a good.

1927
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
The anatomy is really solid on that one.

1928
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Yeah I feel like I've gotten a lot better at just quickly doing an arm or a leg that just looks right.

1929
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Yeah.

1930
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I don't really need to think about it.

1931
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Yeah you have.

1932
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
A lot of these.

1933
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
A lot of these just have.

1934
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Pretty good anatomy.

1935
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Yeah these are.

1936
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Yeah this is.

1937
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yeah.

1938
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Looking at all these.

1939
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
You know I already knew this but looking over it again.

1940
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Yeah you've definitely improved in art this year for sure.

1941
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Thanks.

1942
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I only really drew.

1943
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
No that's not true.

1944
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I drew doodles all through the beginning of the year.

1945
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
And then the like the porn stuff.

1946
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It's never like nude but it is like large boob.

1947
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
And that's that's something you can't you can't tell the children about.

1948
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
As we saw from occultic nine.

1949
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
If you have huge boob.

1950
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
It's and you'll get.

1951
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
You'll make people like us mad.

1952
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
No we'll be on your side because we'll want.

1953
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Boobs to exist in media.

1954
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I should I should make.

1955
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Perhaps something that has like big as the main character.

1956
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
But she's like overtly like a sexual being.

1957
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Because I've made her as the porn character I draw.

1958
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
What if what if she was just having a normal day and she just happens to be really big.

1959
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
She just happens to be fucked up.

1960
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Really hot in every way.

1961
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
That would be super fun.

1962
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I would lose my fucking mind.

1963
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
If that happens.

1964
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
But yeah you can look you can look back in this website.

1965
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I've got art going back to 2012.

1966
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Where I had like a few pony things.

1967
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Compare 2021.

1968
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I'm gonna compare to 2020 just real quick.

1969
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
2020.

1970
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I mean 2020 was Lord of Ghosts and Clarissa.

1971
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Which is insane still.

1972
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I can't get it.

1973
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
I can't get my head around how much stuff I did that year.

1974
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I'm still I'm looking I'm looking I'm looking.

1975
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
What the.

1976
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
What is this.

1977
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I don't remember seeing this one.

1978
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Oh that that was part of like a.

1979
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Like a draw together with friends online website thing.

1980
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And I drew Aliyup and what's her face.

1981
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
She's the character from Rayman Legends.

1982
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
She's the.

1983
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Fuck why can't I remember her name.

1984
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
But till it knows not but till.

1985
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Shit.

1986
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I gotta find out I gotta find out.

1987
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Oh god I never saw I never saw this image of endless expansion.

1988
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I never saw this one.

1989
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Yeah.

1990
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Endless expansion is like a dome because of course.

1991
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
You know you know I saw this I actually I just happened to see.

1992
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I was looking on Twitter and I saw.

1993
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I was looking at an NSFW artists page their feed and they had recently retweeted.

1994
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
An image it was like an iceberg image.

1995
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
But it looked like this it was like a big ball with a nipple on top it was a big.

1996
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Spherical breasts with a nipple on top and it was like an iceberg.

1997
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And it was supposed it was like cut off not cut off but you know there was a line through it.

1998
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
At the nipple and it was like the big huge breast ball was like.

1999
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
The art you don't see and then like the nipple on top was like the art you do see.

2000
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Yes.

2001
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And it was like exactly like this.

2002
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Okay yeah so there you go.

2003
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I don't think I copied it this was this is 2020.

2004
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
That was I don't know when that other thing was.

2005
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,000
But the name is Barbara of that character Barbara the barbarian.

2006
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I think the construction I think your your construct your character construction and anatomy is like.

2007
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Markedly better in 2021.

2008
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
You think.

2009
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I think so yeah I do.

2010
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
It could be that I chose badly but I wouldn't say I haven't improved.

2011
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Maybe it was choice maybe it was partially just choice of subject.

2012
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
No I would say definitely.

2013
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Like I need to try less hard to get better images done in 2021.

2014
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I think try 2020 was like when I when I just started to draw big in trip trip pants.

2015
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Yes that image of the trip pants you like be good.

2016
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
What is this shirt was that just the shirt that that that emo girl that I posted was wearing.

2017
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Yeah some sort of a red dragon thing.

2018
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Can't wait to get my copy of the Lord of Ghosts comic book.

2019
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
I got to get around to that.

2020
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Yeah I've been trying to relax but then I forgot to like stress.

2021
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I've been thinking I've been thinking I really want you know I have to draw a bunch of stuff for slime and punishment to finish up the comic for the game.

2022
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I really don't want to like draw it out too much.

2023
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I have I really am thinking about like how can I how can I like pretty quickly like move this shit along.

2024
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I had started to draw a few more pages one time during like 2020 before I had like not decided I'm not going to draw anymore before I make finish the game.

2025
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:16,000
And then I and that was like it was discord sort of giving some like narration.

2026
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
It was a bit of like discord narration about like and then and this and these were the the fallout of these events.

2027
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Right.

2028
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And then the last I have I've long I've long had some scenes in my mind of like how Phantom goes from New Los Angeles City to Equestria back to to go back to find Nightstar to seek his revenge.

2029
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So I have a couple of scenes of that that I have to draw that will hopefully I don't I don't think I need to spend too many panels on them.

2030
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Even though some of them are a little some of them are a little complicated but that you know the whole the whole ethos of slime and punishment is doing it really sloppy and not giving a fuck.

2031
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So we'll just do it like that and it'll be great.

2032
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:16,000
And then there's a few scenes I will actually take me a bit of work because I want to draw I want you to pick some things happening to Phantom in Equestria before he gets to Nightstar.

2033
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And it's annoying because drawing Ponyville is like sucks like I hate drawing Ponyville like the houses in Ponyville are really annoying.

2034
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It's very detail heavy in a very specific way that I have to like like I can't like I can't ignore and I've never liked drawing Ponyville but I have to just just for a bit just for a few pieces bits and pieces here and there.

2035
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Oh well anyway I will hopefully get it done really fast and then I can worry about making a book and then I can worry about formatting a book and making a book out of it and that'll be fun perhaps.

2036
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Is this is this flower heads Canon color scheme.

2037
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Yeah he's he's got yellow pedals.

2038
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Oh okay.

2039
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Nifty.

2040
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:21,000
That's about the only thing I really know about his character color scheme and the sort of dull gardeners green.

2041
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Yeah.

2042
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Cloak the sort of tarp color.

2043
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
That's what all I thought of.

2044
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
It's like yeah.

2045
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I like the idea of him having a very bright cute pastel color for for a head.

2046
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Despite despite his dour depressing angst.

2047
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Based based.

2048
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Well is there anything else or do you think it's voicemail time.

2049
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I guess not.

2050
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I guess the only other thing I've been thinking about is like how I like looking at people do lists of the top something or other games of the year.

2051
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
But I didn't play any games this year that came out this year.

2052
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I just like the idea of me doing one of those.

2053
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
But I don't know how.

2054
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:22,000
So I guess I won't.

2055
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I like year roundups.

2056
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
What did you play.

2057
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I also I played like Noida and like hardly anything else.

2058
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I played Minecraft.

2059
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I played Kenshi.

2060
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I played balloons tower defense.

2061
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Of course.

2062
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Wait what's Kenshi Kenshi.

2063
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I think I've talked about it before but it's like a post apocalyptic squad based micromanagement macro management RPG where you control people in like a post apocalyptic Japanese sort of wasteland.

2064
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Did you say you were playing it with your brothers.

2065
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
No.

2066
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Oh that must have been something else that you said you were playing with your brothers at some point.

2067
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Okay.

2068
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Never mind.

2069
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I think I played Hollow Knight.

2070
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Oh yeah yeah I played games during the streams that I did for the Lord of Ghost kicks that I played Hollow Knight and I beat that on steel.

2071
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
So that was fun.

2072
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Right.

2073
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I remember that.

2074
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I remember that and that was amazing.

2075
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
So that was hype.

2076
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
That was hype.

2077
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Gaming moments.

2078
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I guess I won a stream.

2079
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
That was a heated gamer moment.

2080
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It was only heated in the tension.

2081
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I was not angry.

2082
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,000
In fact I was glad because it all went swimmingly.

2083
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Yeah.

2084
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Yeah I want to get back into a bit of streaming.

2085
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I'm going to do like a New Year's Eve stream.

2086
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:57,000
So actually if this episode is coming out on New Year's Eve I might be streaming or I might already have been streaming.

2087
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Because I like to stream as the New Year ticks over and then the stream is like I don't know what year I'm in.

2088
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Does it do that?

2089
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
No it always goes into the next year like the first of next year I think.

2090
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Actually I don't remember but anyway.

2091
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I like doing those.

2092
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So I'll play some games.

2093
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I don't know.

2094
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,000
You said I should probably wait for the final version of Phantom's Revenge before I play that.

2095
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Well.

2096
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I don't know.

2097
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
It's not that big a deal.

2098
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I don't really mind.

2099
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
What if I get the glitch?

2100
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
What if I can't eat it?

2101
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
It would be super embarrassing.

2102
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
It would be a little embarrassing.

2103
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
But it's fine.

2104
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I mean it's in beta.

2105
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And I mean I'm hoping to have that glitch fixed in the next day or two.

2106
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I need to hunt it like urgently.

2107
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
It's like the most urgent thing I have to do actually.

2108
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So I will probably be doing that as soon as this podcast is over.

2109
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Or I should have done it yesterday.

2110
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
So that's what I'm going to be doing.

2111
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Use the New Year's stream.

2112
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Come check that out.

2113
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I don't know why I'll be playing but it's always nice.

2114
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Oh right.

2115
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That'll be this evening, the day this podcast comes out.

2116
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Yes.

2117
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Right.

2118
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
This evening in Britland time so earlier.

2119
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
So it'll be 7 p.m. for me.

2120
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Right?

2121
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Around about there.

2122
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Around about.

2123
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I'll double check.

2124
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I'll double check.

2125
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
6 p.m. probably is midnight for me.

2126
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,000
So it'll be like 5 p.m. or earlier that I'll be streaming.

2127
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
And then I'll go over to next year.

2128
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Where it'll be like 8 p.m. for you.

2129
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
That's about roughly.

2130
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Wait, did you say what you were going to play already?

2131
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I don't know yet.

2132
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Usually it's just like something.

2133
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Just any sort of game I feel like playing.

2134
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Last time I think we played 24 the game.

2135
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Which like with Jack Bauer.

2136
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
And it was really, it was, it was all right.

2137
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
But it was kind of jank.

2138
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Did you play it because of like the countdown aspect?

2139
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

2140
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I think we just played it because we had it and it was new.

2141
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Yeah.

2142
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
It was a new game that we had and it was funny.

2143
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Tectonic Improv did a Christmas, I think it was a Christmas, shit.

2144
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I think it was Christmas Eve.

2145
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Super Metroid speedrun.

2146
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I mean it wasn't, he's not like a, he's not like a pro speedrun or anything but you know.

2147
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I think he beat it in like an hour and a half.

2148
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Which is, you know, it's actually pretty good.

2149
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Actually now that I say it out loud, like, I don't know how long speedrunners beat it in,

2150
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
but like it's way faster than I could beat it.

2151
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Cybershell also showed up to the chat and that during that stream, which was pretty fun.

2152
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
That was pretty cool.

2153
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Yeah man, New Year's, New Year's stream.

2154
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Good, good shit.

2155
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Yeah, my stream is on Gibb and Take on Twitch.

2156
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Should be easy to find.

2157
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I'll check it out.

2158
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I'll be there.

2159
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I'll be there.

2160
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I'll pop in.

2161
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I'll be around, I think.

2162
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Sick.

2163
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I don't know what I'm gonna be doing.

2164
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I don't know what I'm gonna be doing for New Year's.

2165
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:36,000
It depends on whether and how sick I am by then.

2166
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Hopefully I'll be fully recovered.

2167
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
You know, they say, what do they say?

2168
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:46,000
The guidelines were a little confusing, but I think the...

2169
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:57,000
It's like 10 days since either you first developed symptoms or you tested positive

2170
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:09,000
and three days, no less than three days after you stopped having a fever or something.

2171
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:14,000
But also if you test negative, that means you're fine.

2172
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
If you test negative on the antigen test, that means you're not contagious.

2173
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:24,000
So theoretically, even if you just started having symptoms yesterday,

2174
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
but you got over, you felt better and then you tested negative,

2175
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
you would theoretically be non-contagious.

2176
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
So I don't know.

2177
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I have one test left.

2178
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
The tests are kind of expensive.

2179
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:42,000
There's like 25 bucks for a set of two tests, which is a bit shit, but oh well.

2180
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
That's okay.

2181
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:53,000
It's just helping me rack up more spend towards my sign-up bonus on my AmEx Blue business cash, baby.

2182
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So it's okay.

2183
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Anyway, my point is that that's what depends on what I do for New Year's.

2184
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Oh no, the brain fog.

2185
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Ah, the brain fog.

2186
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I'm getting confused.

2187
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
All right, voicemails?

2188
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Yes.

2189
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Okay.

2190
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Let's see what we got here.

2191
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
All right, the first voicemail is an image.

2192
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Let's take a look.

2193
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
The Phantom Eve.

2194
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Oh, this is a roller coaster called The Phantom's Revenge,

2195
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:49,000
which someone else has pointed out to me that there is a roller coaster called The Phantom's Revenge.

2196
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I see Nate there in the bank.

2197
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Nate just hunched over their little plastic garden chair.

2198
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Is that just a whole...

2199
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
No, that must be someone else.

2200
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
It must be someone else, and it's Nate's hood, yeah.

2201
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Why am I here twice, and one of me is like, oh, a soy face looked behind me, and the other one is like, no!

2202
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Well, am I happy about this?

2203
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Maybe one of them is the rowdy...

2204
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
No, not the rowdy fucker, the cop killer, and the other one is Ben St.

2205
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Oh, yeah.

2206
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
That's true.

2207
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Bearded Ben is always like, hell yeah, and clean shaven Ben is always like, no, why?

2208
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I shaved my beard again a while ago, but I've been growing it back, and it's starting to come back again, which is good.

2209
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:59,000
It's kind of at the level where, if I trimmed my neck beard, it would almost be not a beard beard, but an actual feature of the face, and not just an accident.

2210
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So that's pretty cool.

2211
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Next one is a video.

2212
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
A YouTube video.

2213
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Five real...

2214
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Jesus caught on camera and spotted in real life.

2215
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Oh.

2216
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
It's crazy.

2217
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Hey, should we play it?

2218
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I'm playing it.

2219
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
It's three minutes, okay.

2220
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Creatures.

2221
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Oh, I'm skipping around.

2222
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Cut on camera.

2223
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Number five.

2224
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
This video is recorded from the Spain.

2225
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Oh my god, the Jesus winked.

2226
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Oh my god, the cloud looked like a face.

2227
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Wait, there's a guy like shitting in the woods, and they think it's Jesus, because it's got a white cloak.

2228
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I think this is a joke video?

2229
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I mean, it's called five real instead of four real.

2230
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Or maybe it actually means like five.

2231
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Is it called five real?

2232
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Viral, top five, fifth.

2233
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:20,000
English does not seem to be this guy's native language, so I'm not sure if he would get the pun about four real, five real.

2234
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Five times real creepy crawler.

2235
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Creepy crawler?

2236
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Look at this.

2237
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
It's so obvious.

2238
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
The cloud is so obviously like CG.

2239
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
This video is recorded from New Jersey in the USA.

2240
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Five times real creepy crawler.

2241
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Look, there she is.

2242
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Well, voicemailer, thanks for bringing my attention to all these times Jesus showed up.

2243
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I'm gonna change my wicked ways.

2244
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Okay, let me get the first actual voicemail here.

2245
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:06,000
The number is nine three three nine six two.

2246
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Here we go.

2247
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
This one is called hi guys.

2248
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
And there it is.

2249
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
All right, three, two, one, go.

2250
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I was listening to an old episode in which you guys talked about changing the show's name as part of the rebranding.

2251
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I assume you guys aren't actually considering that, but nonetheless I want to say that it would be a bad decision.

2252
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Most name changes are stupid, because often the thing itself hasn't fundamentally changed, like Facebook changing its name to Meadow or DG Bro turning into Yeeks Studio.

2253
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
It's the same shit with a different name.

2254
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I'm not comparing the PCP to those things, but the same logic applies.

2255
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,000
The PCP hasn't fundamentally changed.

2256
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It is still a group of friends talking about their interests.

2257
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
There just happens to be three of them now.

2258
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:02,000
The only thing a name change would accomplish is that former viewers who want to return to the show would fail to find the channel.

2259
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
What do you think?

2260
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
It's it's fair.

2261
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
That's probably why we haven't voted.

2262
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I think I agree.

2263
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Yeah, I think it.

2264
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:19,000
If I wanted to mount a counter argument, it would be I would say that like the change in who is on is fundamental enough that a rebrand was called for.

2265
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
And that was why we were thinking about it in the first place.

2266
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
But I think you're right.

2267
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I think I agree with you.

2268
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,000
It hasn't fundamentally changed enough that it's like we need a new name.

2269
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Yeah.

2270
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
So yeah, agree, agree.

2271
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Okay.

2272
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
The next one is just a link to a Trixie tweet.

2273
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Oh, but I belong to which I even be able to see this.

2274
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Okay.

2275
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,000
The tweet is the tweet has been deleted.

2276
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Unfortunately.

2277
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
What was the tweet?

2278
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
You should have left a voicemail saying it.

2279
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Yeah.

2280
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
That's too bad.

2281
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:09,000
I'm curious.

2282
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I'm curious now.

2283
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
When was this voicemail six days ago?

2284
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Six days ago.

2285
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I'm a little bit.

2286
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I'm a little bit curious.

2287
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:31,000
What was she tweeting six days ago that someone felt the need to post about to us.

2288
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Yeah.

2289
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
So that it's the 27th.

2290
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:48,000
So this would have been on the 21st or thereabouts.

2291
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
She wasn't really tweeting much this month.

2292
02:13:51,000 --> 02:14:00,000
It's all just a bunch of like weird anime, anime art retweets.

2293
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Yeah.

2294
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I don't know.

2295
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I don't see anything and I feel like I'll never, I don't know.

2296
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
If anyone knows what this was, feel free to let me know.

2297
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Yeah.

2298
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
But yeah, the tweet's deleted, so I can't respond to it.

2299
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Sorry.

2300
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I'm on my mom voicemails.

2301
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Right.

2302
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:23,000
So this one is called Happy Holidays PCP.

2303
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
They're posting it right there.

2304
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
There we go.

2305
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Happy Holidays PCP.

2306
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Three, two, one, go.

2307
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Hey guys, I know that this will only be played on the episode after Christmas, but was just

2308
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
calling in to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

2309
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Hope you all had a good time with your loved ones, your families, and hope to see you in

2310
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
the new year.

2311
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Hope none of you die of COVID.

2312
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Bye.

2313
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I wonder this guy didn't even know.

2314
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
This guy didn't even know when he made this voicemail.

2315
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
How appropriate.

2316
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Well, you know how my Christmas was, but thank you for the wishes.

2317
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I hope yours was good as well.

2318
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I hope everyone, I hope all our listeners had a Merry Christmas, especially the Jewish ones.

2319
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I hope they all converted before Christ returns.

2320
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
It's coming.

2321
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,000
It's coming.

2322
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Can you do a frame perfect, like a religion switch, and you'll be found.

2323
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Frame perfect, yeah.

2324
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Well, you know, actually when you, every Christmas, your religion data is stored in a variable

2325
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,000
that is accessed.

2326
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:47,000
So if you convert one year, all you have to do is celebrate Christmas once, and then the

2327
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Christian variable, the flag is turned on, and then all you have to do is you have to

2328
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
execute a wrong warp when Christ returns.

2329
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Yeah, it's frame perfect, but with practice you can do it.

2330
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:06,000
And then there was a good video.

2331
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:12,000
There was a good video that I saw the other day from a channel that does nothing but post

2332
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
videos about Final Fantasy 7.

2333
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:20,000
I think they're called 4-8 Productions, Final Fantasy 7, wrong warp.

2334
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,000
The video was about the Final Fantasy 7 wrong warp.

2335
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Yeah, it is, 4-8 Productions.

2336
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Final Fantasy 7's ultimate glitch, the wrong warp, and explain how in the PC port of the,

2337
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,000
which is not even really a port, it was basically developed like almost as its own game.

2338
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,000
They didn't just port the old game, they basically made them at the same time.

2339
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:49,000
But yeah, for the PC version of Final Fantasy 7, there is a wrong warp that existed in the

2340
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:54,000
game for like 20 years before anyone found it.

2341
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:59,000
And it's a very interesting, like it was found in other versions.

2342
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,000
There was a version of it that was found earlier that was not useful, but then like later developments

2343
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,000
made it into something you could use to basically warp to the end of the game.

2344
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I love that shit.

2345
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I love fucking speedrunning bullshit videos.

2346
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
4-8 Productions is a very funny channel.

2347
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
It's not very big.

2348
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Well, it's 82k, which is, you know, respectable.

2349
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
But it's a very humble little channel.

2350
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:33,000
They don't do anything other than Final Fantasy 7.

2351
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Well, that's not true.

2352
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:40,000
They're doing a Final Fantasy 9 Let's Play marathon.

2353
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
But nobody watches that.

2354
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I don't know.

2355
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:51,000
They're just a humble little channel that like two years ago they had some hit videos explaining

2356
02:17:51,000 --> 02:18:00,000
like, you know, speedrunning tech in the Final Fantasy 7 and other stuff like explaining

2357
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:06,000
like fully going through like every material and like explaining like how they work stat-wise

2358
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
and stuff like that.

2359
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
And they were just like, well, we're just going to make videos about Final Fantasy 7.

2360
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Final Fantasy 7 are our gig now.

2361
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,000
They made a Patreon and I'm just like happy for you guys.

2362
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:26,000
They're not big enough that I have to be mad at their success.

2363
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Yeah.

2364
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:35,000
So next voicemail is, oh, it's called Penny Packer.

2365
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
It's another one.

2366
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Posting it.

2367
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Here we go.

2368
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Three, two, one, go.

2369
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Hey guys.

2370
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,000
You know, after listening to your response to my voicemail last week and the week before

2371
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
that about me misgendering and whatever, you know, I think you're right.

2372
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I think so.

2373
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I think you guys are right.

2374
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I think he's going to troll us.

2375
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I guess I was just being an asshole.

2376
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I was being a fuckface.

2377
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Yeah, it got me thinking a little bit and yeah.

2378
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
15 seconds left.

2379
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Yeah.

2380
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
You're right.

2381
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:16,000
And I just want to sincerely apologize for it.

2382
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I guess I'll think twice before saying retarded shit.

2383
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:29,000
See ya.

2384
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:37,000
The twist there is that he says the R word, which is, I mean, I have quit saying it.

2385
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I have quit saying it myself pretty much.

2386
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,000
It doesn't bother me that much, but yeah, it's not a good thing to say.

2387
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:52,000
It doesn't bother me personally, but I don't say it, but I do tolerate it in others.

2388
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Other people say it and I don't scold them or anything.

2389
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:06,000
So I can't really be offended that he said it because I let people get away with it.

2390
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I hope that was sincere.

2391
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I guess I can do nothing but accept this seemingly sincere apology.

2392
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Thanks.

2393
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Yeah.

2394
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Yeah, okay.

2395
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Okay, next voicemail is called Mr. Boop.

2396
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I wonder what it could be in regards to.

2397
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Three, two, one, go.

2398
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:40,000
So I've had Mr. Boop open in a tab ever since you all talked about it that one time.

2399
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Really?

2400
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
And I just found the time to read it.

2401
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,000
It's not that long.

2402
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Read through the whole thing.

2403
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
There we go.

2404
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
And that was fucking stupid.

2405
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Tab for like a year.

2406
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
I mean, that was completely retarded.

2407
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
There was nothing funny, entertaining, or interesting about it.

2408
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Really?

2409
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Thanks for nothing.

2410
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Really?

2411
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Hmm, what do you think about that?

2412
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Do you think that maybe it's not as good like if you just binge read the whole thing?

2413
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I think certain funny moments are still funny.

2414
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Just like the panels of like, you read it and you're like, man, this guy is drawing Betty Boop as his wife.

2415
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:30,000
And he's talking about how it's like the meta story that conjured in your head.

2416
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Is that of a cartoonist who is enacting his fantasies of having a woman who loves him unconditionally.

2417
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And that he gets to tell his friends about how hot his wife is all the time.

2418
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
And they're like, yeah, and there's nothing else to the comic.

2419
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
And then you get a sense of what the author is like.

2420
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,000
That's where the meta comedy sort of elevates it.

2421
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
And then it's just funny on that level.

2422
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
And then it escalates.

2423
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I feel like if you don't like the first part, then you're...

2424
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:02,000
It doesn't get any better than it starts.

2425
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Yeah, I think the funniest part is that meta of the author being like, this guy.

2426
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:16,000
That brief moment where you're like, is this guy serious or is this a joke?

2427
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
And you're having like a little bit of a...

2428
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I'm not sure for a second now.

2429
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Do you think the fact that this guy had heard us talk about it and already discussed like that?

2430
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
And so like he knows like, you know, obviously it's all a bit.

2431
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Do you think that that kind of kills the comedy of it?

2432
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Perhaps.

2433
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I think that maybe there's something too.

2434
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Like if you don't know what it is, but you see it on Twitter and you look at it and you're like, what is this?

2435
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I kind of think that's the initial...

2436
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Maybe that initial intrigue adds something to the whole Mr. Boop experience that this guy was robbed of.

2437
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Maybe.

2438
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I feel though that like some of the like strips are really just funnily worded and can be enjoyed out of context of the entire thing.

2439
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Yeah, some of it is...

2440
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Some of it's gotta be funny, no matter what.

2441
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
There were some fucking...

2442
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I'm Dr. Sonic the Hedgehog, no relation.

2443
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Come on.

2444
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Come on.

2445
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Nothing funny in it, really?

2446
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I don't know.

2447
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I don't know, dude.

2448
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Okay.

2449
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Well, the next one...

2450
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Alright, there is a voicemail, but there's also a link to a fast upload, so I guess I'll just do both.

2451
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I don't know.

2452
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Here's the voicemail.

2453
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Three, two, one, go.

2454
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
It's Keto.

2455
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Very nice.

2456
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:11,000
It's very strained rhyme on revenge there, but it's okay.

2457
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:17,000
The AI couldn't like do the extra work needed to make it fit.

2458
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Wait.

2459
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Okay, I'm stupid.

2460
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:24,000
So, well, I won't play it again, but Eleazar used this one.

2461
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:29,000
This is the same message, but without the shitty static, so use the better version.

2462
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Oh, I see.

2463
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

2464
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
But I understood it perfectly fine.

2465
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Very good.

2466
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Very droll.

2467
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Thank you.

2468
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Thank you for the poem.

2469
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I hope to have Phantom's Revenge, not just in the Christmas stockings of those at patreon.com.

2470
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:56,000
But in the home of every hard-working American before too long.

2471
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Right on.

2472
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Next one is called X6.

2473
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Let me get it here.

2474
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Here we go.

2475
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
X6.

2476
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Three, two, one, go.

2477
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:19,000
He is not ejaculating, but he is coming nonetheless.

2478
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Okay.

2479
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I don't know what that means.

2480
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:30,000
The last time someone was coming, someone was coming, maybe to get us or maybe just coming.

2481
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Oh, I see.

2482
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,000
It's building.

2483
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
It's a building narrative.

2484
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,000
There's a building narrative here.

2485
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I forget.

2486
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Was the last one called X6 or maybe was the last one X5 and this is X6?

2487
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I don't know.

2488
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Man.

2489
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Nobody knows.

2490
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Maximum tension would be counting down to zero.

2491
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I guess when he gets here, we'll find out.

2492
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Yeah.

2493
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Okay.

2494
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Next one is...

2495
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
It's a vocary.

2496
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
It's a vocary.

2497
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I'll download the...

2498
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
It's called...

2499
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'm stupid.

2500
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:14,000
It's called Song for January Sad from Dry Dump December at DustyDumps.com.

2501
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Three, two, one, go.

2502
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Fall out of the asshole

2503
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Still filled with that juicy moisture that the body craves

2504
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Which you needlessly dump away

2505
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Now it's January

2506
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
My ship will fly like dust in the wind

2507
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Yes, my dried up sandy feces must flow with the breeze

2508
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:07,000
And I would have liked to kept you, but you were just a cry

2509
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:12,000
The moisture is all gone now

2510
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Now the dry should send us flying

2511
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Dry Dump December

2512
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Never forget

2513
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:33,000
It's a very nice song.

2514
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Can we put that at the...

2515
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Can we make that the theme song for the episode?

2516
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I think that's a fitting intro for this episode.

2517
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Dry Dump December.

2518
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Yes, that's good.

2519
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,000
This will be...

2520
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
If you're listening to this, alright.

2521
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,000
So the plan for New Year's is this episode of the PCP will be out on the 31st.

2522
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And then at midnight British time, Gib will be streaming.

2523
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:08,000
And then the clock will turn over from Dry Dump December to regular dump January.

2524
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Regular ass January.

2525
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
So regular ass January.

2526
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:21,000
And so at the stroke of midnight, I think we should all be in Gibstream releasing our pent-up Dry Dump.

2527
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
All is one.

2528
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Diarrhea January.

2529
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Diarrhea January.

2530
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
It kind of works a little bit.

2531
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I think it sounds good.

2532
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Dry Dump December.

2533
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Diarrhea January sounds like a one-piece character's name.

2534
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
God.

2535
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:47,000
God, I hope not.

2536
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:51,000
He ate the poopy poopy fruit.

2537
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Oh no.

2538
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,000
It wasn't a devil fruit, it was just poopy.

2539
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
It was just poo.

2540
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
He ate poo.

2541
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
It made him sick.

2542
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
He has permanent diarrhea now.

2543
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
It was not...

2544
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Nothing magical is going on here.

2545
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Suddenly I'm really hungry.

2546
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Suddenly I really want to go and get a frickin' Egyptian frickin' shawarma wrap.

2547
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Since I'm not feeling too sick anymore, I might double mask up and go do that after this is done.

2548
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
But anyway, for the moment, next voicemail is called...

2549
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Nope, not that one.

2550
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Next voicemail is called Voice Grail Reparations.

2551
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Here we go.

2552
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Two, one, go.

2553
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Hey, now that we're in the business of Voice Grail Reparations,

2554
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,000
how about getting one to good ol' Cringis Mingus?

2555
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
He definitely deserves it.

2556
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I made this song for him and everything.

2557
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I love that man.

2558
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Did we not do that?

2559
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Cringis for Voice Grail.

2560
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Now, please.

2561
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Yeah, I thought we already had.

2562
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I'm surprised we didn't, but I wouldn't be that surprised if we didn't.

2563
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
But yeah, if he's not already in there...

2564
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Yeah, Cringis Mingus for Voice Grail.

2565
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:23,000
No argument here.

2566
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Alright, next one is a text...

2567
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Is a pay spin.

2568
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
The pay spin.

2569
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Text post.

2570
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Okay, I'll read it.

2571
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Suppose there's a guy called John.

2572
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
John murdered my mother.

2573
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I despise him for having murdered my mother.

2574
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Someday, John changes his name to Michael.

2575
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:42,000
He is really serious about his new name, oh god,

2576
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
and gets mad every time someone calls him by his old name.

2577
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
After learning that fact, I start calling him John

2578
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,000
because I want to make it clear that I don't respect that person.

2579
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Is this a valid justification for my action?

2580
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Alright, I'm gonna say...

2581
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I think I know that this is an allegory for trans people.

2582
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I'm gonna say...

2583
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:09,000
But you cannot equate somebody's change in their gender.

2584
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Well, here's what I think.

2585
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Oh no, they're just saying you don't like someone.

2586
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Well, here's what I think.

2587
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
I'm gonna say...

2588
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
It's gonna sound goofy.

2589
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,000
I'm gonna say no, it's not justification,

2590
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
but with the caveat of like,

2591
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:29,000
okay, maybe you're not justified in not respecting their name change.

2592
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Like, who cares compared to the fact that this guy is a murderer, right?

2593
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Like, these two things are not comparable.

2594
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
So, sure, yeah.

2595
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Okay, yeah, Mr...

2596
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I hate these fucking questions.

2597
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Like, okay, Mr. Fucking Genius, yeah, sure.

2598
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:51,000
What would you not call a trans person their dead name

2599
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:54,000
if I was holding a gun to a baby's head and I said you had to?

2600
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Well, no, I guess I would, sir.

2601
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
You got me.

2602
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
It's just sort of like the murderer thing.

2603
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Like, the dead naming is like...

2604
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,000
It's a bigoted action, right?

2605
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Like, it's disrespecting someone,

2606
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:22,000
but specifically because of their, like, status as a trans person.

2607
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I would say...

2608
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,000
It's not about what they did, it's about who they are,

2609
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
and you're trying to get at them like that,

2610
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:32,000
but you are doing a bigotry by doing that.

2611
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I would say that you're not really just...

2612
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
There are better ways to, like, I don't know.

2613
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Yeah, I would say you're not really...

2614
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I would say that regardless you're being a bigot,

2615
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,000
but like, fuck the person who was a murderer as well,

2616
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,000
so I don't...

2617
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Right.

2618
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I wouldn't, like, cancel you for doing that

2619
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
because it's somebody who murdered your mother.

2620
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Yeah, I would...

2621
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
But you are doing a bigotry.

2622
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
That's unambiguous.

2623
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I mean, I would say you have a...

2624
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Yeah.

2625
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Um, so...

2626
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,000
I would say you're not really justified in not respecting the name change.

2627
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
It's just such a small thing that it doesn't matter.

2628
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
But, like, you know...

2629
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
If you're like, oh, oh...

2630
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
What, Michael?

2631
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Oh, you mean John, the guy that killed my mom?

2632
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
You know, okay, you say that,

2633
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
and I, you know, debate lord that I am.

2634
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I come...

2635
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And I'm gonna...

2636
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I stroll in...

2637
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Oh, my God, it was the brain fog.

2638
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Um, I stroll in, and I sit down on a chair,

2639
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
and I turn the chair backwards, and I say,

2640
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,000
hey, so...

2641
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Hmm, are you saying that you don't respect anyone's name changes?

2642
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
You know, John went through the legal processes,

2643
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
like, you know, he changed his name in the courts,

2644
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
you know, it's Lee, like, do you not respect anyone

2645
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
to change their name?

2646
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
And you're like, well...

2647
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
No, it's just this guy killed my mother,

2648
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
and I'm like, well, oh, okay.

2649
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Well, uh, so I guess that, you know, by extension then,

2650
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
you know, because this guy killed your mother,

2651
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
that means that you don't respect anyone's legal name change at all.

2652
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
What's your criteria for a real name?

2653
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Does it have to be given by the parents?

2654
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
What if the person's parents were dead?

2655
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,000
What if they were adopted?

2656
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Do their adopted parents get to name them?

2657
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Would that what you call them

2658
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
if they never met their real biological parents?

2659
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Da-da-da-da-da.

2660
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Okay.

2661
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Um, so yeah, I think it's true.

2662
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I think it's true you're not justified

2663
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:13,000
in not respecting their name change.

2664
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Fuck you.

2665
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Uh...

2666
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Yeah, that's it.

2667
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
It's just like, you know,

2668
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:22,000
in a situation where a person changes their name,

2669
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
it's not the same as someone changing their gender

2670
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
and having a dead name, exactly.

2671
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
What this question is?

2672
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
What this question is?

2673
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
I know, like, it, like,

2674
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
they're...

2675
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
The only reason they're asking the question

2676
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
is because they want to

2677
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
try and, like, logic

2678
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
around

2679
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
calling someone a dead name

2680
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
because you don't like them

2681
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
as being okay.

2682
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
And I just think it will not be okay

2683
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:52,000
because it's, like, inherently a bigoted action.

2684
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,000
What this question boils down to is,

2685
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
like, okay.

2686
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
What if, okay, you say

2687
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I shouldn't do something

2688
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
because it's, like,

2689
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
it's not really, because it's not justified?

2690
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Well, okay.

2691
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Well, what if something made me

2692
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
really, really mad and upset?

2693
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
What if something really bad happened

2694
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
and made me really upset

2695
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
and made me really want to do the thing

2696
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
that isn't really justified?

2697
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Wouldn't it be justified then

2698
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
because of how mad and upset I am?

2699
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
No.

2700
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Well, not, I mean, not, not really.

2701
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
An obvious, an obvious thing

2702
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
to say is, like, if it were a black person

2703
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
and you said the n-word,

2704
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
it's like, well, I'm really mad at them,

2705
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
but yeah, that's still, like, a racist thing to do.

2706
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Well, yeah, but he killed my mother.

2707
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
You can hate him.

2708
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
You can be really mad.

2709
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
I understand why you would say that, you know.

2710
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
But it's, like,

2711
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
the, the, the action

2712
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
is still a racist act.

2713
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
All right, all right.

2714
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
There's no, I don't know,

2715
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I don't know what you want, I guess.

2716
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Do you want to just say bigoted things

2717
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
and not get in trouble for it?

2718
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I think he, I think he's just trying

2719
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
to get our goat, and I think he did

2720
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
because we've spent this long on it.

2721
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Well, I mean, it's, it's an interesting

2722
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
question to, like, try and figure out

2723
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I guess, you know what, I guess,

2724
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
to poke and prod.

2725
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Like, I don't know what this guy,

2726
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
maybe he has, like,

2727
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
sincere intentions.

2728
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I'm just, I'm just so used to

2729
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
getting this question

2730
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
about Chris, in my fucking

2731
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
YouTube comments about Chris.

2732
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I got another, I got another,

2733
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
I got another shitty smug

2734
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
comment about, like,

2735
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
and I won't,

2736
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I don't even remember the whole thing,

2737
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
but it was another one, it's like,

2738
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
okay, obviously

2739
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
none of us are against

2740
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
trans people, but

2741
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
but bro, obviously

2742
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
we're not gonna respect Chris Chan's gender

2743
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
because

2744
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
of things.

2745
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
And it's like

2746
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I get the same, I get the same

2747
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
comment every fucking time

2748
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
and it's always the same, and they all

2749
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
think they've figured

2750
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
something out. They're all, they're all, like,

2751
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
they've all hit, like, the most

2752
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
basic, like, grade

2753
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
school realization.

2754
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
They've had the most basic grade school thought

2755
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
in their head and they think they're a fucking genius

2756
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
and they think they've, like, cracked it

2757
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
and, like, they have an undefeatable argument

2758
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
that beats me. And they all

2759
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
have the same attitude about it.

2760
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
The main thing that, like,

2761
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
differentiates, like, doing

2762
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
a bigoted thing or a racist thing

2763
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
or whatever

2764
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
in, like, a, in a

2765
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
potentially justifiable, like,

2766
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
state of anger or, like,

2767
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
revenge or whatever

2768
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
it is.

2769
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
The reason it's always not okay

2770
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
is because

2771
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
the bigotry hurts people

2772
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
who are not involved. There's a

2773
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
collateral damage

2774
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
like, caused

2775
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
or perpetuated

2776
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
by the

2777
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
the insistence of using

2778
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
bigoted language

2779
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
to hurt people

2780
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
and you could just punch them in the face

2781
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
and that's direct and personal

2782
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
and that's different. Right. Sure.

2783
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
And it's like punching someone in the face

2784
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
because they're a murderer.

2785
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Why not simply exact vengeance?

2786
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
It does not cause collateral damage.

2787
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Why not simply avenge them

2788
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
yourself upon them and drink their blood

2789
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
in victory?

2790
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Yeah, it's just, it's

2791
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
it's lazy to go

2792
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
for the bigot stuff.

2793
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
And if you insist

2794
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
on using the bigoted words, then

2795
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
it's just sort of, like, weird.

2796
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Like, are you

2797
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
you, I don't know

2798
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
what you don't need to

2799
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
use those words. You can just

2800
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
gender them correctly and call them a piece of shit

2801
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
and say

2802
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
they should, you know, be locked up

2803
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
forever. It's, it's not

2804
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
difficult. Yeah.

2805
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Yeah. Okay.

2806
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Yeah. All right.

2807
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
I agree.

2808
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Next one

2809
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
is

2810
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Nate's real nobody name

2811
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
from a real Kingdom Hearts fan.

2812
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Thank God.

2813
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Finally got one. Finally.

2814
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Did you see, wait, before we play this

2815
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I retweeted a really good

2816
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
tweet on the PCP account

2817
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
the other day, or it was on Christmas

2818
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I think.

2819
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
It was like, you know what, I'll just read

2820
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
it because it's, it

2821
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
cracked me up.

2822
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
A piece going to the PCP

2823
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
account.

2824
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Let me look at it. I'll read it verbatim.

2825
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
It was

2826
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
the X

2827
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
in Xmas isn't meant to replace

2828
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Christ. X is the Greek letter

2829
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
for, for key

2830
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
pronounced key. Jesus

2831
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
was a vessel with no darkness meant

2832
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
to battle Vanitas a being of pure darkness

2833
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
to create the key blade a weapon

2834
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
of ultimate power to open the true Kingdom

2835
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Hearts.

2836
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Yes.

2837
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
You know, like

2838
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
it's a funny juxtaposition because

2839
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
you think it's going to be about

2840
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
real history, but then

2841
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
there's

2842
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
the Kingdom Hearts.

2843
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Woo, I love me a good juxtaposition

2844
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
of concept.

2845
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Isn't that a bait and switch, not a juxtaposition?

2846
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Yeah, I guess it's both.

2847
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
You would call it a bait and switch setup.

2848
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Yeah, it is. No, it is a bait and switch.

2849
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
That's true, for sure.

2850
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Okay, but anyway, Nate's real

2851
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
name. Three, two, one,

2852
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
go.

2853
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Every single one of you

2854
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
is stupid. Yes. Yeah.

2855
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Nate's nobody name is

2856
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Texan.

2857
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
You're not the first one to say that,

2858
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
but he's not from Texas. It's got the

2859
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
N-A-T-E.

2860
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Yeah, it's a funny

2861
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
name.

2862
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
You're also stupid.

2863
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
It would be funny if his name was

2864
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Texan, but that doesn't sound like a nobody name.

2865
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Yes, also he's not from Texas.

2866
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
That's the joke up.

2867
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Although he does like to use the cowboy hat emoji.

2868
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
God bless him.

2869
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
So, I mean, that's gotta

2870
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
mean something.

2871
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
It's gotta.

2872
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Next one is unapology.

2873
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Three, two, one, go.

2874
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

2875
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
I called you all stupid, everybody.

2876
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I don't know what got into me.

2877
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I was like into the bit and

2878
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
I don't know.

2879
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
That's okay, dude.

2880
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I'm so stupid.

2881
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Yeah, you are so fucking stupid.

2882
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
You're so fucking dumb that you would say that.

2883
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
You fucking idiot.

2884
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Next one is called

2885
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
I'm posting it.

2886
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
It's called web comics.

2887
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Three, two, one,

2888
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
go.

2889
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Alright, my last voicemail was too negative.

2890
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Mr. Boop, I thought it was gay.

2891
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Maybe you like it, whatever.

2892
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
What I thought was cool was Scoob and Shag.

2893
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Have you ever heard of that one? No, really?

2894
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
It's another web comic along the lines of

2895
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Tails Get Strolled and Mr. Boop.

2896
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Not really. Because you got Scooby,

2897
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Shag, Kermit, Mickey Mouse,

2898
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Yosemite Sam, Fred Flintstone.

2899
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
All the characters.

2900
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
And this one has like awesome action.

2901
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Okay, maybe you were looking for

2902
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
the wrong stuff in Mr. Boop.

2903
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Scoob and Shag, check it out.

2904
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And I also read Clarissa Gunsmoke,

2905
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
which was really fun and cool.

2906
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
One's the next chapter.

2907
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
I read...

2908
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I'm not...

2909
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I'm not caught up with it,

2910
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
but I did read some Scoob and Shag.

2911
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
I was caught up with it as of maybe

2912
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
like two years ago or something.

2913
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
So I've read a bunch of it.

2914
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
And like, I think Scoob and Shag is...

2915
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
It's good.

2916
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
So I think a lot of people call it cringe.

2917
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
A lot of people think it's lame.

2918
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
And I think, and I understand why.

2919
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Because it's very like...

2920
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
It seems basic.

2921
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
It seems like a basic version of

2922
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Tails Get Strolled.

2923
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Yeah. Like normal, like normal

2924
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
nerds can get into.

2925
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
What does Scooby do when Shaggy

2926
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
was so like showed in battle

2927
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
mango anime?

2928
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Sort of. I mean...

2929
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I've heard people sing his praises as well.

2930
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
But like...

2931
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
That's the general gist.

2932
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Is that it's pop culture

2933
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
characters

2934
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
that go from

2935
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
just a normal comic that you're just enjoying.

2936
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
And then it becomes more serious.

2937
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
And it's funny because

2938
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
you wouldn't expect Shaggy to be serious

2939
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
in a shounen battle mango.

2940
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
But that's what it becomes. And it's like, that's the extent of it

2941
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
as far as I understand.

2942
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Maybe it's more in depth than that.

2943
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I think it kind of starts as like a...

2944
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
It's sort of like a regular

2945
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Scooby-Doo

2946
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
fan comic. But it's

2947
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
drawn kind of like weird.

2948
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
The way Scooby is drawn

2949
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
is weird.

2950
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
And the fact that he draws

2951
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Scooby that way is sort of like

2952
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
the running gag.

2953
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
He always keeps drawing him

2954
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
that weird way. Even as

2955
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Scooby becomes like the most

2956
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
important character in the universe

2957
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
and stuff. And all these

2958
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
shounen battles.

2959
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Scoob and Shaggy is genuinely

2960
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
good in a technical way.

2961
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
The art is really good.

2962
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
And a lot of the battle...

2963
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
I think a lot of the battle...

2964
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
There's a lot of shounen power stuff.

2965
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
And some of it is kind of interesting.

2966
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I don't think any of it is as

2967
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
like, whoa,

2968
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
that's kind of unexpected

2969
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
cool as the neutrals.

2970
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Yeah.

2971
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Some of it is good.

2972
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Some of it is pretty good, but I don't think

2973
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
it's any of it is as good as the neutrals.

2974
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
It's um...

2975
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
But like if

2976
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
I think if this guy

2977
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
was like, read Scoob and Shag

2978
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
and saw Mr. Boop, and it was

2979
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
also incorporating other characters,

2980
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I would say that the scale

2981
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
of Mr. Boop

2982
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
is not the same thing. And maybe

2983
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
he was like waiting for it to go

2984
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
further than it did.

2985
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
What's a little bit more...

2986
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
It's not really about that, but...

2987
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Yeah.

2988
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
What's a little...

2989
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
What I think makes Scoob and Shag

2990
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
a little lame in my opinion is that

2991
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
it's not just like

2992
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Tiltgates Troll has all these characters

2993
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
and sometimes they refer to

2994
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
the cannons they exist in.

2995
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Like they do...

2996
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Bugs Bunny is canonically a loony tune

2997
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
and he does...

2998
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
He puts up signs for duck season

2999
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
to trick Elmer Fudd and whatever.

3000
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
But um...

3001
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
That's totally not relevant

3002
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
to what they're doing.

3003
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Scoob and Shag, the story of

3004
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Scoob and Shag is about

3005
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
these cartoon characters are

3006
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
from... It's basically like Space Jam

3007
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
logic. Like these cartoon characters

3008
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
are coming from the cartoon world and they

3009
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
did like a...

3010
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
There's some kind of weird plot about how they were

3011
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
escaping their cartoon homeworld

3012
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
to come to

3013
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
the real world or something like that.

3014
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
It takes itself a little more seriously

3015
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
in a way that I think is

3016
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
not funny.

3017
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Uh...

3018
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I still haven't read much of it

3019
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
so maybe there's more to it.

3020
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Mr. Boop doesn't take itself seriously at all.

3021
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Mr. Boop is just fucking around.

3022
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
It's like so stupid.

3023
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Mr. Boop takes itself maybe even less seriously

3024
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
than Tails gets trolled because like

3025
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Tails gets trolled...

3026
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
In Mr. Boop like do they even...

3027
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
I guess they do probably...

3028
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Mickey Mouse does still belong to the Disney Corporation

3029
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
and like...

3030
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
You know...

3031
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
The Homestuck

3032
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Trolls are...

3033
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
They do sort of exist in their...

3034
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
I would say it's pretty comparable.

3035
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Like the amount

3036
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
of like this character's

3037
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
backstory and like canon matters to the story

3038
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
is pretty similar in like Mr. Boop

3039
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
and in

3040
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Tails gets trolled.

3041
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
In

3042
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Scoob and Shag it's bigger.

3043
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Um...

3044
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Sort of. Kind of.

3045
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Yeah.

3046
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
I fell off Scoob and Shag and I kind of was like

3047
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
yeah I kind of get it.

3048
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I think the best thing about Scoob and Shag is the art

3049
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
actually because like a lot of it's really good.

3050
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Um...

3051
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Obviously that's not really true

3052
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
of Tails gets trolled and

3053
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Mr. Boop.

3054
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
But oh well.

3055
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Uh...

3056
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
So that's based.

3057
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
That's based. I want to see the end of Clarissa.

3058
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Uh...

3059
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
2022 is going to be the year

3060
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
of doing

3061
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
a bunch of shit.

3062
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
It's just going to be the year of continuing to do a bunch of shit

3063
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
as much as I can.

3064
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
So I will definitely

3065
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
plan to finish Clarissa.

3066
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Um...

3067
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
At least the story that's currently happening.

3068
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Um...

3069
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
What's Scoob and Shag is

3070
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
it's like the sort of the comedy of

3071
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Scoob and Shag is in that

3072
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
like...

3073
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
It's the comedy of the fact that it takes

3074
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
itself 100% seriously.

3075
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Like the whole like melodrama.

3076
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Yeah.

3077
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
It's...

3078
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Yeah I think maybe I'm being a little hard on it.

3079
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Um...

3080
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
But like the whole melodrama of like these people are from like another dimension

3081
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
and they came to a new universe

3082
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
and like a lot of them lost their memories

3083
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
and they're brainwashed and they're

3084
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
rediscovering this like

3085
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
ancient truth about their people and whatever.

3086
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
It's like...

3087
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
It's all delivered with 100%.

3088
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
I think...

3089
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Which is...

3090
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
The way to go in a very different way.

3091
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
The way to go with a

3092
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
thing like a premise like that is

3093
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
is to go as extreme as you possibly

3094
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
can into

3095
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
what a cartoon character situation

3096
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
would not be like. Where

3097
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
characters are bloodily killed

3098
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
and the neutrals. And in Tales of Gets

3099
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Trolled they go so fucking

3100
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
intense with some of those scenes.

3101
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
They do in Scoob and Shag too.

3102
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Sure.

3103
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
I haven't seen enough to know.

3104
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
But like that would...

3105
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
That's what you would need is that it would need to be

3106
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
it would need to be like as depressing as

3107
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Berserk to be like a peak.

3108
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Scoob and Shag is.

3109
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Of that joke.

3110
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
That is basically what Scoob and Shag is.

3111
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
So like there's definitely some...

3112
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
It's definitely going for something and it's

3113
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
achieving it. For sure.

3114
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Also I remember there's one shot of

3115
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
um... This is a bit of a spoiler but

3116
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Bugs Bunny turns out to be like a big

3117
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
villain.

3118
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
And when he reveals his power. Cause basically

3119
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
every cartoon character has like a

3120
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
sort of like one...

3121
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
It's sort of like a stand. They have like one

3122
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
like power that is unique to them.

3123
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
That they have. And Bugs Bunny

3124
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
is like the ability to

3125
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
I think it's like

3126
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
he can like erase things from reality

3127
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
and the way that he does it is he controls

3128
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
like TV static.

3129
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Like he can generate like TV static

3130
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
around himself that can like erase

3131
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
stuff. And

3132
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
it's awesome.

3133
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Like the the the the the panel

3134
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
of him like

3135
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
revealing the power and like all this static

3136
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
is like exploding out of him. Like looks really cool.

3137
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
And that's the that's the image

3138
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
that stuck with me the most

3139
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
uh from

3140
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Scoob and Shag.

3141
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Yeah so

3142
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
very different reading experience

3143
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
uh yeah

3144
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
um

3145
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
anyway

3146
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
next one is

3147
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
me failing oh god

3148
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
me failing drugs. Was it

3149
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
webcomics? No that was the one

3150
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
we just listened to. Okay so I've been sort of

3151
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
clicking on them on the website

3152
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
half. Oh yeah. Clicking

3153
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
in the discord half. I don't know which one

3154
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
we should listen to. Yeah that was just

3155
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
webcomics that we just listened to. The next one

3156
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
is me failing dry dump December

3157
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
uh three two

3158
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
one go.

3159
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
I'm not listening to this.

3160
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I'll listen.

3161
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Oh here grunting.

3162
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Grunting.

3163
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Grunting.

3164
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Grunting.

3165
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
No that's dry.

3166
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I'm I'm I've muted it.

3167
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Grunting.

3168
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
You didn't get me. Oh god

3169
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
I think he's going to be bleeding after this.

3170
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
It was very dry.

3171
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
It did almost sound like sand so congratulations.

3172
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Man

3173
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
you were so close. All you had to do was hold on

3174
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
um another like well this

3175
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
was two days ago so another like five days

3176
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
you were so close. So close.

3177
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
That little bit of moisture that

3178
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
was left that would have made it into sand

3179
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
you know you lost it and now you'll never get it back.

3180
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Tragic.

3181
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Stupidest joke ever.

3182
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000

02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
with a character

3203
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
brain fog in the game

3204
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
that was

3205
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
what was it doing

3206
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
what was it doing

3207
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
it was doing something

3208
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
oh I remember it was like

3209
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
it was um

3210
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
I guess

3211
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
so I'm meant to be so I'm meant to be

3212
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
shamed right by this

3213
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
uh yes

3214
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
I don't

3215
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I don't get it like yeah

3216
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
I didn't get to the point

3217
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
in 40 seconds

3218
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I don't yeah I stammered a bit and I was trying

3219
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
to remember something

3220
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
I mean yeah if you're trying to remember something

3221
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
it'll take a while

3222
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
I was kind of awkward when I like

3223
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I don't say anything in between

3224
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
but I don't really know what to say

3225
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
a lot of the time

3226
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
I was conveying information

3227
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
in this clip like I conveyed that it was

3228
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
something about a character

3229
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
doing something

3230
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
and then I was trying to like fill in the details

3231
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
as I went so I don't know man

3232
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
this one doesn't I don't know what we can really

3233
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
learn from this

3234
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
would it be better if I never stammered

3235
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
never paused always knew

3236
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
exactly what I was going to say well sure

3237
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
of course of course

3238
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
um next one

3239
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
is a video

3240
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
the seven seconds long

3241
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
the eight seconds long

3242
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Anthony Fantenna reviews

3243
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
the procrastinators

3244
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
podcast

3245
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
the procrastinators

3246
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
podcast is a skeleton of

3247
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
what it once was I'm feeling

3248
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
a light to decent for on this thing

3249
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
yeah

3250
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
okay so this is

3251
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
an Anthony Fantenna voice

3252
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
modulator

3253
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
it's not a very good one

3254
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:15,760
I like saying that. I don't know what they're called. Yeah, it's not a very good one. Yeah.

3255
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:21,120
The Dr. Wolf and Applejack ones were much more convincing.

3256
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:28,800
Maybe because those are cartoon characters, so I'm just like more easily more easily convinced by

3257
02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:37,520
them. That's not the fault of the cartoon character. Well, even well, I mean, he kind of is he has a

3258
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:43,840
animated little character. Yeah, but like Anthony Fantano has way more footage of him talking

3259
02:54:43,840 --> 02:54:49,920
in a microphone on the internet than Dr. Wolf, I would think. Well, what a draw from it should be

3260
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:57,680
smoother. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I think it's a slap job for sure. Yeah, you're right. I think this

3261
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:03,280
but it did you know what message received message received the melon thanks we're

3262
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:11,360
thanks for slipping. So we got to, I don't know, do something about that, I guess. Next

3263
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:22,560
one is called Nate heads. Putting it here in the chat. Okay, Nate heads three, two, one, go.

3264
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:29,200
On episode 273, someone asked why best guy of his fans are called Nate heads and not something

3265
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:33,680
that rhymes like Nate mates. Well, that's simple. It's because they're always sucking Nate's dick.

3266
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:42,160
Because because they give a Nate head. No, I mean, Nate mate would also would also be like a sexual.

3267
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:49,440
It would be. Well, that implies like they're equal partners in their sexual intercourse.

3268
02:55:50,560 --> 02:55:54,960
But that's not acceptable. That's not that's not that's simply not the case.

3269
02:55:55,440 --> 02:56:00,160
When I'm a fan of something, I give it head. That's that's how it works.

3270
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:06,560
Anything? Yeah, if I'm a fan of Minecraft, I'm a mind head.

3271
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:13,600
That's what giving head means, right? As you call yourself a head after it. Yeah.

3272
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:18,080
I'm giving my head a silver platter.

3273
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:22,720
What? I don't know.

3274
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:29,040
A silver platter? Like if like, like decapitated myself.

3275
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:34,160
Oh, I'd be giving it a head. But like, whatever, stupid.

3276
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:40,000
No, I get it. No, I get it. Okay. It was a bit. It was a bit of a leap, but I got there.

3277
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:48,240
Um, next, this is the last one with the last voicemail and my eyes and nose and throat are

3278
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:57,840
feeling pretty dry. So hoping my hoping my not my hemoglobin, my Oh God, brain fog.

3279
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:01,040
What's the word for the part of the brain? Sarah, not the cerebellum.

3280
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:06,400
No, part the part of brain. I said it earlier.

3281
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:15,840
Part of brain, smell, memory, hippocampus. I hope my hippocampus has survived this long.

3282
02:57:16,480 --> 02:57:19,520
I mean, I guess it's good that you've been doing dry dump December because you need

3283
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:25,040
all that extra moisture, it seems like. More now more than ever. Now more than ever.

3284
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:34,480
I can't afford to defecate. Next, this one is called a special guest calls in to respond

3285
02:57:34,480 --> 02:57:43,200
to Ben's football take three, two, one, go. Football sucks. It's a garbage sport for toilet people.

3286
02:57:44,240 --> 02:57:50,640
Boo. What was that for? Sorry. I feel like I've heard that video once.

3287
02:57:51,520 --> 02:58:00,160
Um, I don't remember. I may have heard that line before, but I definitely don't know what video

3288
02:58:00,160 --> 02:58:07,040
it was from. Fuck X. Did Jesse ever make a video that was just called fuck football?

3289
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:14,240
No, I don't think so. Yeah. Oh, well, that's it. That's all the voicemails.

3290
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:22,960
Yeah, that is it. All right, well, I should hopefully order some more groceries.

3291
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:28,480
And then I might just try to, I don't know. I'm not I'm not sick enough anymore that I'm like

3292
02:58:28,480 --> 02:58:35,600
need to just like try to sleep all the time. What time does the PCB like come out in America?

3293
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:45,760
Usually two PM is the normal time for two PM and Friday. So somebody watched it when it came,

3294
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:51,840
when it comes out, they would have time to prepare for the end of the year and have a good

3295
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:57,600
New Year's Eve. Yeah, I mean, we could always put it out earlier in the day if you wanted.

3296
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:03,840
Uh, no one's like, you know, that's a usual time, but no one's like super married to it or anything.

3297
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:10,320
Well, in the off, on the off chance that people are like not busy and had the time to listen to

3298
02:59:10,320 --> 02:59:16,640
the episode before the New Year, a happy New Year. Every listener. Right. Yes, happy New Year.

3299
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:20,160
You know, by the time they're done, by the time they're done listening to it, though,

3300
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:26,560
it will be three hours after that. So they may have, well, so it would be five PM.

3301
02:59:27,360 --> 02:59:30,960
Yes, that's time. Well, which would still be, which would still be time. Yeah.

3302
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:37,920
Okay. Yeah, Merry Christmas for all the happy, happy holidays, everyone.

3303
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:41,840
Don't get, oh, don't be like me. Don't get Omicron.

3304
02:59:44,880 --> 02:59:52,160
See you in the New Year. Yeah, it's the last, last one before 2022. 2020 was bad. 2021

3305
02:59:52,880 --> 03:00:00,000
was not the best, but maybe the trajectory will continue upwards. 2020.

3306
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:08,720
The fact that 2021 had the vaccines is a relief because going into 2021, they didn't exist yet.

3307
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:16,240
Yeah. All right, that's true. I'm feeling a bit down on 2021 lately because of, you know, the

3308
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:23,920
current spike and how my Christmas went. But overall, it was definitely an improvement.

3309
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:31,920
But that's what I'm saying. It's a big spike, but it's good that the vaccines are there to make

3310
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:38,880
it not fatal for the vast majority of people who are getting it. Yeah, although, you know,

3311
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:44,320
Omicron doesn't, I don't know, Omicron doesn't... Gank COVID is not fine, but like...

3312
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:50,720
It does help. The death toll and like the need to be on ventilators are like minimized.

3313
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:56,320
I'm not saying it's fine. I'm just saying the vaccine is not, is significantly less effective

3314
03:00:56,320 --> 03:01:04,000
against Omicron. So that's unfortunate. Maybe they'll come up with a reformulated boost that

3315
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:08,080
will affect Omicron. It is effective. It is effective against it because people who have not been

3316
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:15,040
vaccinated refuse to get it. But it's... Yeah. They're getting on ventilators. They're dying.

3317
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:19,920
Those are the people who are anti-vaxxers are getting hit hardest with all this.

3318
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:33,200
Well, sure. And it does. I guess it does, yeah. It is sad when people die, even if they

3319
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:37,680
brought it on themselves by being foolish. Yeah.

3320
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:50,080
Man, well, anyway, all I'm saying is here's to a good 2022. Let's keep the good times and the

3321
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:57,120
vaccines rolling, baby. Let's stick them up. Let's fucking pump our veins full of whatever

3322
03:01:57,120 --> 03:02:10,160
Dr. Fauci wants us to. Let's get high on that 5G. Yeah. The year of 2022 will be the year that

3323
03:02:10,160 --> 03:02:16,560
my secret project comes out and Clarissa Gunn's vote will be finished and the Lord of Ghost stuff

3324
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:23,600
will be sent out. And Lord of Ghost Chapter 3, the final one, I mean, the final act of Lord of

3325
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:27,760
Ghost will also be finished. Aside from that, I don't know what I will be doing, but that'll

3326
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:35,200
keep me occupied, I'm sure. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. It will be the year... I think

3327
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:44,240
I can expect that I will do the Slime and Punishment book this year in 2022. That's good. It will be

3328
03:02:44,240 --> 03:02:51,440
the year that... It'll be the year when my secret secret project get to be revealed. I'll reveal it

3329
03:02:51,440 --> 03:03:01,360
soon. It will be happening, going out, available, which will be very funny and cool. I'm going to

3330
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:09,520
say it will be the year when all of the Radcon 4 content is finally released. I feel very confident

3331
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:15,680
about that. I suppose. It's not entirely up to us now. It's not. Bulls are in other courts at the

3332
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:24,640
moment. That is true. Nevertheless, I feel confident about it. But anyway, all that's pretty good

3333
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:32,880
stuff. That's not enough to fill me in. I don't know what I'm going to do this year. I have a few

3334
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:40,640
things on my to-do list and I don't know what order I want to tackle them in, or maybe if I need to

3335
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:48,640
change tactics, change gears, and maybe come up with some new things in the near future. But I

3336
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:57,680
I don't know. We'll talk more about that in 2022, I guess. I think it's going to be...

3337
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:04,320
Not to be cheesy or anything, but I think it's going to be a good year. I think I see big things

3338
03:04:04,320 --> 03:04:11,840
happening. I think I see changes on the horizon. I think it's going to be good. I'm excited.

3339
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:21,200
We can only hope. Yeah. All right. Are we done? Yes. The end. All right. Well, love you all listeners.

3340
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:32,400
See you next year. Peace out. Have a good one. Goodbye. Goodbye.
