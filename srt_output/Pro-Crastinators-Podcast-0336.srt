1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello boys and girls.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to the big top.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we'll circus around here and there's no cheesy though.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a real, nah he unfortunately took his own life after that.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't know, that's not funny, that's not funny, that didn't happen.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
After you bullied him.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, not after the Kickstarter failed, after I bullied him and said he was bad at math.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
RIP.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good morning, I guess it's not morning for you Gibb.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No it's not.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But I'm tired, just like I am tired every day.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Cause life is tiring.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can think of another way to say that.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well let me tell you what I'm sick and tired of.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Mega man.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, more nonsense with the stupid video.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's not my fault, I swear it's not my fault this week, it really should have been at this week.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
To briefly sum up why it's not out.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I finished rendering it, I uploaded it, and then I watched it through.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And there were a couple of small errors in it, but there were three really small errors that I noticed.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But they were all so small that I was willing to be like I don't care.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm gonna release it in its current state, fuck it.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But it has been, you know when you upload a video and it has to process and first it processes the video in standard definition.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then it processes it in high definition, right?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, yes.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, it's been processing it in high definition for I think like four and a half days now.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Which just doesn't seem right.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think it's just stuck.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sometimes it just gets stuck and I don't know why.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean, I would imagine it just takes a while.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How long does it take to upload fully?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Only like eight hours, ten hours.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, I don't know how encoding is different, but like maybe it will just take a number of days.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Maybe.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I mean, I wasn't surprised.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I was expecting it to take a while because like it's in 1440p.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So it's gotta process it.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I mean, standard definition is 360p, but then it's gotta process it in 720 and 1080 and 1440.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I was like, okay, it's a big video in a bunch of different resolutions including one of the highest res is available.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I'm not surprised it's gonna take a long time.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But four days just seems excessive.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is 1440p 2K?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, it's 1440 by 2560, which is the highest resolution that my camera could film in.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And also supposedly, yeah.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And also supposedly YouTube like compresses 1080p differently than 1440 and like 1440 looks better.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not just because it's higher res, but because like 1080 looks worse than 1080 on YouTube,

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
but 1440 supposedly does not look worse than 1080.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is what I read somewhere.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know if it's true.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Like YouTube compresses 1080 more?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, like YouTube specifically compresses 1080 more is what I read.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But anyway.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I don't know.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I guess it could just still be processing just because it's big and like maybe either way.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I started another render like like a day into the upload, I started another render because I was like,

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I found those small errors and I was like, well, those are really frustrating.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I might decide to re upload.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let me start another render.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I started another render with the errors fixed and now it's been a couple days and that render is halfway done now.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is that a smaller render without 2K?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, it's the same render just with the errors fix.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I'll tell you what the errors were.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There was one line that I said that got garbled because I accidentally I tried to correct for the volume and I accidentally shifted the clip like by half a second.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I like say a word and then like I say I say the word like twice overlapping each other and it just sounds a little weird.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not even very noticeable.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then there were two other times I meant to censor every instance of the word.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I shouldn't say only a few minutes into this video.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I shouldn't say the S word and the F word.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you know those?

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not aware.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I won't admit the man.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I won't tell you.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I tried to censor every instance of those words and I missed two S words.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I mean, I actually think it mattered very much.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is why I was I was willing to ignore these.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't care.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was going to release it except that the processing hasn't been done.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So but I started another render and it's now halfway done.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I'm thinking like I want to release it on a weekend.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So maybe the move now is just since I have to upload a new version anyway, because I think the HD processing is just stuck and it's not going to finish.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I might as well just let this render finish and then upload that version and then release that this weekend.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think what I'm going to do is release it on Saturday, probably at noon.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Probably like the day after this episode goes live is my is my plan unless more of this same nonsense continues to happen.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I mean, but eventually eventually this must resolve.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Eventually I will have a week where I don't say, oh, it's coming out this week and then I'm proven wrong.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, it'll know like it's becoming a meme at this point.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, I know.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's been like I realized six weeks.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, six weeks ago I posted on my Patreon.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I posted a Q&A update wherein I said the video is almost done.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now, I didn't mean that it was like coming out that week.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I thought there would be like a few more weeks left.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I thought maybe two or three more weeks from that.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, you know, and it's been six.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But anyway, the other thing, the other thing that's it's sort of amusing, but it's also a bit annoying is that a couple of people have seen the video already.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I guess the reason why this happened is because I clicked that I wanted to automatically add it to a playlist.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And it did add it to the playlist and I thought it wouldn't add it until it went public.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But no, it, you know, unlisted videos can be part of playlist as well.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So there are maybe like 30 or 40 people saw it in this playlist and have seen it.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And there's like some comments on it now, even though it's unlisted.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will, I will unfortunately, I think that's funny.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I kind of wish I could keep those.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But since I want to upload the fixed version, I will probably have to lose those comments when it goes when I when I publish the fixed version.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So sorry about that.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Early viewers, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I really do.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, but they had to watch it in 360p, which looks, it looks terrible.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You can't even like see what's on the board behind me at 360p.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Unacceptable.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It is. It is unacceptable.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's why I wouldn't release it.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Like otherwise I might have just like released it in SD and then waited for the HD processing to finish.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But like, I think, I think it's unwatchably bad.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I mean, if you're just listening to it, then it's fine, obviously.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But if you're trying to watch it, you can't watch it at 360p.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So that's, that's what's up.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's, that's what's up.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
For my week, I guess at the beginning of the episode, we just sort of like, we sort of settle on like you talk about what's been going on.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I talk about another Mega Man lecture.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I did it there.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then it's, I mean, the only thing I've really been doing last week, well, there's a couple things, but it was a lot of not safe for work stuff.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I'm like, well, I mean,

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You mean drawing?

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, drawing.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I did draw for cheesy a,

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, alien girlfriend.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Alien girlfriend.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I saw that because I am a patron of cheesy.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, I saw that update on Patreon.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah. So that'll be coming out when it comes out.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And that was fun.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And yeah, I've just been drawing a lot of dicks and tits and stuff.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's commissions, right?

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
One of them was a commission.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There was a, there was another one that was similar.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But I've just been just, I just felt like it.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I just been drawing things that I want to see.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's not really like a topic conversation unless you've seen them and want to say anything about them.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Are you posting them on big girl squish?

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you, do you look a bit?

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, there you go.

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sorry.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Go to big girl squish.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you want to see, I just finished this little like drawing of a five way between Vriska,

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Kanaya, Rose, Terezi and June Egbert.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Cause like this, the John Egbert ghost trans is June Egbert fan thing, which is a cool idea.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They're all lesbians.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Vriska, Kanaya, June, Rose, Terezi and June.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Vriska, Kanaya.

165
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Give that's fucked up.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's incest.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Huh?

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All trolls have the same mom.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You freak.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They never had any problem with it before.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you draw any trolls can't have sex because they all come from the same incestuous slurry.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is established in Canon.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They're just kissing.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Disgusting.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And their dicks are out, but that's all.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Disgusting.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, I don't know.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I feel pretty happy with my progress on that front.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I haven't made a lot of progress on Clarissa just for various reasons.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Other things have been taken priority.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to get that done.

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's so close.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I haven't really worked on it for two weeks at this point.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, it's not going to get done at that rate.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's the truth.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry if that hurts your liberal snowflake feelings.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sorry.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sorry if that.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sorry to bring harsh reality down on your tender little millennial head.

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Participation trophy.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where is my medal?

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I drew like nothing for two weeks.

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Exactly.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Soft.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Generation is soft.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Not enough lead.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Speaking of soft, did you see that selfie I took?

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was pretty happy without how I looked in that one.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, I think I did.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think I did see that one.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You look like you just got out of the shower.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I just got out of bed and I was like, oh, cool.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Nice.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's called liking the way you look and taking a picture of it.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's a nice new thing.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's crazy.

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's crazy, darling.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You ever done that?

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You ever seen yourself and said, hey, cool.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Once or twice.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hell yeah.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, end of discussion.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It sucks sometimes when I'm like, I don't really have any like conversations to bring

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
or like things to talk about.

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's been a bit of a running theme plus few weeks.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know about that.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I feel like it's been fired, but you know, for me, I don't know.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Other than like, I have this week, I didn't do much more work on slime and punishment.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's the two things I've been working on is getting this stupid video published and

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
getting the slime and punishment book layout completed so that I can actually order the

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
test copies.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I didn't do that much on slime and punishment this week.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was mostly, honestly, it wasn't even really working on the video because like the video

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is done and all I had to do was watch it through again and make a couple of small corrections.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's mostly just been ringing my hands and like just like sitting in like, you know, anxious

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
anxiety and stuff about like, I can't believe the video is not out yet.

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I said the video is going to be out.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When is it going to be done?

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Is it done in HD processing today?

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

240
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, now what do I do?

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now how do I modify my plans?

243
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Someone called Crow is looking in my patron discord advised me on some tips and said like,

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ben, you should make a trailer.

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You should make a trailer and then premiere the video as a premiere.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I think that's what I'm going to do.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's what that's what patrician TV did this week.

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This week, the 20 hour analysis of Skyrim came out and he like released a video advertising

249
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it as well as like set it as a premiere.

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And like, so like the premiere was set to release and while the premiere was set to release

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
this ad came out being like, it's coming this week.

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I think that's like kind of like bad for a 20 hour video.

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why?

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because like, I mean, I would assume there's like sections that you could skip to if you're

255
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
interested.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But if it's premiering, you have to wait 20 hours before you can start skipping through

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the video to see the parts you want to listen to.

258
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean, I guess, I guess, I mean, yeah, that's fine.

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like, I'm sure people liked it.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think that's a long time to wait before the video is over.

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's the one thing I don't like about premieres is the fact that you can't use them as a video

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
like any other video.

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's like a worse version of any other video on YouTube.

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I mean, on a practical level, that's true.

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That actually I also like I checked out the premiere as it was happening and I well, I

269
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
like wasn't interested in watching it live.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I kind of like scrolled back to the beginning, which you can do.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You can you can rewind a premiere and watch it from the beginning if you catch it midway

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
through, but you can't fast forward past where it is in its air.

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So I didn't have the time at the moment.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So I didn't I didn't watch it as it was airing, although I could have if I had the free time.

275
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's a it's a not a big deal.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I am and they're they're good for hype.

278
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So whatever.

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I think so I think I'm going to do that.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think I'm going to set it as a premiere.

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then I think I'm going to release some a some some like trailers that will hopefully

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
get people like notified.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And I'm pretty sure I mean at this time, like I really think I'm not lying this time is

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that it's going to be this Saturday the day after this video goes out.

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think that's when I'm going to do it.

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I've been fucking around.

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We're far enough into the video that I can say the F word now.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I've been fucking around with the making the trailer and I just can't settle on which

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
classic Mega Man theme to use as the music, as the musical backing for my trailer.

291
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hmm.

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's so difficult.

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
As a non Mega Man fan.

294
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The obvious first choice for me would be the title screen of Mega Man 2 because that's

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the most iconic to me.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Titles.

297
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mega Man 2.

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait a minute.

299
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is that the same?

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hold on.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hold on.

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is that also the Wiley boss song?

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Hang on.

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hang on.

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You know how like it starts slow and then it goes up and there's that intro bit of the

306
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
song.

307
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

308
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And then Mega Man appears at the top of the building is like it's all cool.

309
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah.

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, it's not the same, but it's very it's similar.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think they share like I never thought about this before, but when you were humming it right

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
there, I was thinking that sounds like the Wiley's Castle song.

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I think they share sort of a motif.

314
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think they're like a pitch shifted versions of each other now that I think about it.

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I never noticed before because that one of the ones I was considering was the Wiley's

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Castle one song from Mega Man 2.

317
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Also Metal Man theme is really good.

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Also the intro song from I think I think Mega Man 4.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I think it's 4 was the one.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Snake Man theme is good.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Also, I was also considering there's a couple of songs from Zero that I think are pretty

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
good, but like they're not they're not like hype.

323
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
They're not like hype and fun in the way that Mega Man songs are.

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They're sort of like somber or mysterious, which is sort of a different vibe.

325
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I kind of think that would work in its own way.

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah.

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So, you know, I like airman stage.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've heard that in a lot of YouTube poops.

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, that one's fine.

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's not it's not one of my favorites.

331
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's not my favorites.

332
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Also, it's it's really funny.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I was I was going through the the song listings this week for this reason and it's really

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
funny how shit the music from one is like Mega Man one is like pretty bad.

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Honestly, the music sucks.

336
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then suddenly you get to two and it's like classic after classic.

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah.

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How does I'm trying to think because I know like at least cut man stage got burned into

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
my brain because I kept losing.

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I forget how it goes though.

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So I guess not.

343
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't remember because it's not that good.

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's just not it's just not that good a song.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Also, I was talking to Tech Tonic Improv about the X series music and we I think we agreed

346
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
X2 is just is just bad.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I mean, it's not bad, but it's just way X1 and X3 just have like far and away better music

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
than X2 in my opinion.

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The same composer.

350
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know.

351
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think so.

352
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You know, I don't actually know.

353
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But like three has all the music in three sounds like a hair metal like screeching like electric

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:25,000
guitar like and and but it's iconic but it's iconic.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Good good good stuff.

357
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Good stuff.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's been so that having that decision to make has been an excuse was an excuse for me to

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
spend like a bunch of yesterday just like going through Mega Man music and listening to it

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and being like, yeah, that's a cool song.

361
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's a cool song.

363
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So that was fun.

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Still haven't made it.

365
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Still haven't made a decision.

366
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Okay.

367
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay.

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I guess that's all I have to say about it.

370
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Unless unless you want me to post the MP3s of the of some of the more offbeat picks that

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I've been going over and I can tell Eleazar to play them in the episode.

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah.

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's have a listen.

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
All right.

375
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You know what?

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't know too much about Mega Man music.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You know what?

378
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll do it because I can.

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Let me see here.

380
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let me see.

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay.

382
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
These are the I'll show you the classic.

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
No, not the classic one.

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The ones from the ones from zero that I think are a little are a little weird as choices,

385
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
but I think I kind of like them.

386
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Where did I post those?

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, it's processing just like the YouTube video.

388
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's still processing.

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay.

390
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There it goes.

391
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's called X the Legend.

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Three, two, one, go.

393
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's like Dark Hyrule Castle.

394
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I think this would be funny.

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think this is kind of funny and a trailer for the lecture with this music sort of implies

396
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
that like this lecture is like a big deal.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is like the ultimate fucking Mega Man lore.

398
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like, are you fucking kidding me?

399
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Are you handle?

400
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Are you?

401
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you afraid of all this content?

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes, like dark clouds and thunderbolts and like big techs flying in like all coming soon.

403
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Exactly.

404
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Exactly.

405
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Coming soon.

406
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You are not prepared.

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay.

408
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Here's one.

409
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Here's one.

410
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This one's called Cyber Elf.

411
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That is sort of, well, three, two, one, go.

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This one's sort of like, what is this?

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What is this going to be about?

414
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What is it?

415
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What experience am I the viewer going to have?

416
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There's a certain like noisiness to the console with this music.

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This is the Game Boy Advance.

418
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, yeah.

419
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Definitely.

420
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There's such a sort of like a noise on like, I mean, that's just what Game Boy Advance music

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
sounds like.

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I was a little disappointed going through.

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I wanted to pick some music from zero, but going through the tracks like not that many

424
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
of them are iconic.

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There's a couple.

426
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's a couple that are iconic, but a lot of them just sound like kind of muddier than

427
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
like classic games and X games.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I kind of think just the music on the GBA was just not as good.

429
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It was quite good for a handheld.

430
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I think it sounds a lot better when it's coming from the actual device.

431
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's probably true, yeah.

432
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Like they managed to get, because those are on cartridges and they managed to get quite

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
a lot of like dynamic range into the songs on a GBA cartridge.

434
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Definitely compared to a Game Boy.

435
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Here's a good one.

436
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is Flame Mammoth's theme from X1.

437
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Three, two, one, go.

438
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And this one's kind of like get hype for a video.

439
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Coming soon to a YouTube near you.

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You pig.

441
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Get ready to get hype to consume your sloppy fucking slave.

442
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Actually, there's that screechy guitar.

443
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This isn't even an X3.

444
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
X3 is even screechier guitars.

445
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, I thought it was supposed to be a trumpet.

446
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I hear a guitar.

447
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Actually, I'll play one more.

448
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll play one more.

449
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This is the one that I'm leaning most heavily towards at the moment.

450
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
This is the intro to, I think it's X4?

451
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Not an X4.

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I think it's a classic four or five.

453
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I don't even remember which one this is the intro to.

454
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Three, two, one, go.

455
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh, I've heard this one before.

456
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Which one is this?

458
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I think it's, is it five?

459
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Because it kind of sounds like blues.

460
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And blues is like the Deuter, not the Deuteragonist.

461
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The secondary antagonist of five.

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah, this is a good one.

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I think this is pretty iconic.

464
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I had forgotten about this one.

465
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I was going through the list.

466
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I was going through the games and I heard this one.

467
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I was like, oh my God, I forgot this song existed.

468
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh my God.

469
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
How does such beauty exist in eight bits?

470
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They just try really hard.

471
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I guess they just tried really hard.

472
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And you know what?

473
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You did it.

474
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But a musician, composer, could you just try a little harder, please?

475
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay.

476
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes.

477
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes, I went to school to the piano.

478
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I went to school to try hard at such things.

479
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And so I am prepared for this request.

480
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Mr. Boss Man of Capcom, sir.

481
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Mr. Inafune, my lord.

482
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Are you going to be like speaking or is it just going to be like text?

483
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's going to be, there's like a funny clip of the intro because I edited the intro.

484
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So like the video starts with a little Mega Man 2 like boss intro jingle.

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And then I like teleport down into the screen like Mega Man teleporting into the level.

486
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And then I say a funny line and then it immediately cuts to like black screen with text.

487
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And there's like a progression of text message being like premiering, you know, this Saturday,

488
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
an eight hour lecture.

489
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And then so it's sort of like a cut, like a hard cut to like music and black screen text.

490
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Also, I think I've decided, and this was the process of like a long iterative process for me to decide the title of the video.

491
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I think the title of the video is going to be Every Mega Man Games Lore Explained in Obsessive Detail.

492
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And I had to choose that adjective obsessive.

493
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I considered many other adjectives.

494
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I did like excruciating.

495
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I like excruciating.

496
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I probably overthought this, but to me excruciating implies that like the video is painful.

497
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And I don't want to send these subconscious messages to people that like you will suffer if you watch this video.

498
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Obsessive is self-deprecating.

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It makes me sound like a nerd, but it doesn't necessarily imply that you will have a miserable time as a viewer.

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Also, it's more commonly known.

501
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's a more common word than excruciating.

502
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Spork pointed out that some people might not know what excruciating means, and I think that's probably true.

503
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, I think obsessive seems too soft though.

504
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You think so?

505
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think if you're like obsessive, it's not like exaggerated enough.

506
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Maybe if you said insane, like insane detail, you're still self-deprecating.

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah.

508
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, the one about Pretty Little Liars was unhinged.

509
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The Pretty Little Liars video calls itself unhinged.

510
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, that's a pretty good one.

511
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The Carrie Can Read video calls itself desperate.

512
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
A little freak talks about Mega Man.

513
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A little freak talks?

514
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I saw Carrie posted, when she made another sort of similar video later, and she posted it on...

515
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
She doesn't really use Twitter that much, but she made a Twitter update to announce that new video.

516
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And the Twitter announcement was just like, hey guys, I made a new unhinged video, lol.

517
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You know, the unhinged genre of video.

518
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I've made a new one in that genre, and here it is.

519
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I love those.

520
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh, hell yeah.

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I mean, I do.

522
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I mean, I do love those.

523
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's a brand.

524
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah.

525
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But unhinged.

526
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Her video was not unhinged.

527
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That was Mike's video was unhinged.

528
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Anyway, I put a lot of time into considering such things, and I just wish it were over.

529
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I just wish the nightmare were over.

530
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
As I say, I would have released...

531
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Errors and all, I would have released the video already if YouTube had simply let me, but it fucked up, I think.

532
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I think it fucked up.

533
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I think it should not have taken this long.

534
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't know.

535
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So it's not my fault.

536
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It is 2K in eight hours.

537
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I feel like it's not that unusual.

538
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm not too surprised by being multiple days, but I guess I'd have no experience with it.

539
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Well, I'll tell you what.

540
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I mean, if Saturday rolls around...

541
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Ooh, oh no.

542
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Because now I have to choose one of...

543
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I was going to say I could just see what happens, and if this one does finish processing, I can just release this one.

544
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But if it doesn't, then it's an error.

545
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I could upload the other one, and I could set that one to release.

546
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But if I set one to release, and then I tell people, oh yeah, here's the premiere, and then I can't just decide, oh well shit, it didn't work.

547
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I got to release the other version.

548
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Can you not...

549
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
They'd be linked to the wrong file when it doesn't actually end up erroring.

550
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Can you not set a premiere after it's ready?

551
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah, I mean you can.

552
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But I'm saying that if I release the trailer, or the ad for it, and then I switch which file, the link would be to the wrong video.

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Or the one that had been up on my channel, showing as premiering in two days or whatever, that would then be the wrong video.

554
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Because I would switch it out at the last minute for a different upload.

555
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It just seems bad.

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Can you just change the link in the description or whatever?

557
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, I mean I guess I could.

558
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't know what the problem is.

559
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I mean you don't see a problem with like, you know, on your channel and your recent uploads, the most recent upload will be like premiering, it'll be a link to a video that's like premiering in two days.

560
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And then when the countdown ends, like sometime before the countdown ends, you like take that video down and put up a new one to premiere.

561
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, but it's a different video technically.

562
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I mean just anyone that had clicked that link would find themselves, you know, not linked to anything.

563
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Right, but like I'm saying like...

564
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I mean I guess it wouldn't be that bad.

565
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Wouldn't you just like wait to see if both of them work and then choose which one to premiere?

566
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah.

567
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Because if the one...

568
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I mean don't do that unless...

569
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I feel like that's the point where you make the decision on which one you want to show.

570
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Well that's, I mean that's what I'm gonna do.

571
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
When this render is done, which should be another like two days I think, I will upload this version and then see if it processes any more quickly.

572
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And if it does, I'll just use this one.

573
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But if it doesn't and like the other one is still processing, then I'm like, well I have to wait for one or the other finish.

574
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Um.

575
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Hum-num-num-num-num-num.

576
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Hum-num-num-num-num-num.

577
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
No.

578
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
My goal this week is to try not to worry about it too much and just kind of let it play it.

579
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Let's just kind of let it process or let it upload or let it be however it's gonna be.

580
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And in the meantime, get back to the slime and punishment book because I was making progress on finishing that.

581
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Finishing those files up and that was good a couple days ago.

582
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I guess I did work on it earlier in the week.

583
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Haven't for the last couple days though.

584
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Ugh.

585
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, you know how like Twitter people saying it's gonna be destroyed and all that?

586
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah.

587
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I've considered like where I would go to post stuff.

588
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't really like any of the possible options.

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah.

590
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I made a Tumblr the other day and it sort of immediately sucks.

591
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Well, as a viewer, you can't find anything.

592
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It sort of puts you in a bubble almost immediately.

593
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Click some things you like and then it just shows you those three things over and over again until you start searching for specific different things.

594
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You mean tags?

595
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Tags or genres of things.

596
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They don't seem to show you a lot of new stuff to get interested in.

597
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Because I clicked on like, I was like, I just want to see Ryska.

598
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Who's on Tumblr making Ryska drawings?

599
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I searched that, I clicked like on a bunch of things and then I'm only getting home stuck on my 4U section.

600
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, yeah, I mean, what do you expect?

601
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, yeah, but like that, like, I feel like the algorithm's a little too like pushing the thing that I've, like, I haven't put, given it enough inputs yet.

602
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Like, why would it not be trying to show me new things?

603
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You think Twitter shows you more un-requested stuff?

604
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't know. It's just, as a new user, it feels like an uphill battle to find stuff if I don't already know what it is.

605
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I probably will not use Tumblr for that reason unless I stay there for ages and do all the backbreaking labor of doing my own algorithm.

606
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm the algorithm. I have to find everything myself. I don't know.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I mean, I don't have a backup plan for besides Twitter. I did have an old Tumblr that I guess I could use if I wanted.

608
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I remember deleting my old give and take or give and tumble, I think is what it was called.

609
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You did?

610
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, I deleted it at some point.

611
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Why?

612
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't know. I think I was, my mind, my thought process was if I really want to stop looking at this and checking it all the time, I need like a hard cut, like no more sort of thing.

613
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So I took the ultimate plunge and deleted my account. It wasn't really out of any...

614
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Why did you want to stop looking at it?

615
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I think for productivity reasons. This was like a long time ago at this point. I can't really remember.

616
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm like, I got to work harder and I always go to Tumblr every day all the time.

617
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Got to turn that off and I couldn't.

618
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But I made a new account and it's boring. I don't care.

619
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah, I mean, I kind of want to, I think I've been saying I sort of want to be on Twitter less and I think I have been, I mean, I haven't been tweeting as much.

620
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I mean, I still look at it, but not like, I don't know, I just look at it like a couple times a day.

621
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It doesn't take too much time, I guess.

622
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, I use it quite a lot, honestly.

623
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Well, I still use it, but I think I use it less recently, which is good.

624
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And it's a trend that I think I want to continue because nothing good has ever come from it.

625
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Hey, did you play any more Inscription?

626
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You know, oh, I DM'd you, but we didn't talk about it on the show.

627
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, you did? Yeah, we did talk in DMs a little bit.

628
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I got a little frustrated with Inscription and it was generally, here's my hot take and I know I'm wrong.

629
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay.

630
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But it's just sort of my emotional reaction because the core gameplay is roguelike sort of essentially like you have a good run and you do what you can, but most of the time you're not going to win.

631
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And I'm a little brat and I don't like that.

632
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I don't like it when I have a bad run, when I get the wrong cards offered to me.

633
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Right.

634
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But you know, that's a genre of game I'm just not into.

635
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But I was frustrated because I liked the card game, but I felt like early on, at least, it wasn't telling me the extent of the card game.

636
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Every time I died, something new would happen, something extra would be revealed in the mechanics.

637
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And now I'd be like, okay, fine.

638
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So I wasn't supposed to get very far because I wasn't able to, I didn't know about bones or I didn't know about this item.

639
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And I'm like, okay, so the more times I die, the more gameplay elements will be revealed, I guess.

640
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And I just got, it's sort of annoyed me because it was like, how many times do I have to die before I can play this game?

641
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I ended up just killing myself a few times and being like, okay, finally, some story is happening.

642
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And I think I know all of the game mechanics now, finally I can start the game.

643
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And I just lost over and over again.

644
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I mean, there's things you have to do by playing the game.

645
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You got the caged wolf, right?

646
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah.

647
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I mean, you got to uncage that wolf in the game.

648
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I did.

649
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You got to make that.

650
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So I mean, it's not just about like, you just got to die a bunch of times.

651
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Right.

652
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't know.

653
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And you found the eye, right?

654
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, I found the eye.

655
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You told me you found the eye.

656
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah, stuff like that.

657
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You got to make it happen.

658
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah.

659
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I guess it just gets a little, it's a little tough, the game.

660
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm not very good at it.

661
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Well.

662
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I get to the angler and I just, I don't have a good deck built up.

663
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Maybe I chose the wrong path to get here.

664
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And when I, you know, on some of the things I was unlucky, I chose the wrong card out

665
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
of the three that wouldn't have helped me.

666
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
My totem sucked or like, you know, whatever it is.

667
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And then I get there and I'm like, I'm unprepared and then I lose.

668
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And I'm like, you know what?

669
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Fuck it.

670
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I just got frustrated.

671
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

672
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I mean, I get it.

673
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I mean, that's how you get better is you, you, you lose a bunch of times and then you

674
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
think to yourself, hmm, why did I lose?

675
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And then you don't, don't do that again.

676
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah.

677
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

678
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Like I said, I know I'm wrong, but there's a lot of variables as to my failure.

679
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I feel like in any other type of game, like, oh, it's a Mario.

680
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Why did I lose in Mario?

681
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Well, I jumped too early and I fell down.

682
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's very clear what happened.

683
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And I should think about my timing of that particular jump better next time that, you

684
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
know, my, my problem is very clear.

685
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The goal is very clear.

686
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And I know how to approach improving when it comes to a inscription.

687
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I don't know whether I could have done any better with the lack of the draw or whether

688
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
like, like what, what exactly did I do wrong?

689
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't know.

690
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I drew, I didn't draw the right card.

691
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So my deck should be smaller or bigger or have less of one type of card and more of

692
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
another.

693
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
There's just too many, too, too many different little things that it could have been that

694
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't really know what I'm the hell I'm doing the next time I boot it up.

695
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So I'm like, okay, I guess I'll just hope to be luckier next time.

696
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I don't feel like I have like a clear goal of how to improve myself as a player.

697
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And that's, that's the frustrating part.

698
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay.

699
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But I mean, you know, as you say, you know that that is not correct.

700
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah.

701
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah.

702
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah.

703
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That's why I hate roguelikes though.

704
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This is like it.

705
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I just want to know.

706
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I just, I don't like thinking about it.

707
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

708
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah.

709
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, uh, yeah, I, I mean, that's like the, the, the, the goal is to figure out through

710
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
trial and error, how trial and error is so much.

711
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay.

712
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Okay.

713
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay.

714
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So that's why I hate it.

715
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I hate it because, uh, when you go into, uh, like on a high difficulty setting,

716
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
what do you mean it's the reason you hate uncharted?

717
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's not similar.

718
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
No.

719
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's the slightest, the, the, the fighting, the shooting segments in uncharted, at least

720
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
uncharted one, often rely on a lot of trial and error.

721
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You don't know exactly where is the best location for you to be where the next wave appears.

722
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The, the next wave can appear behind you.

723
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,600
They can appear in such a way that if you haven't moved at a certain time, you're

724
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:45,000
fucked and it's like, you have to play and in uncharted the scenarios, you know, the

725
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,600
waves appear in the same places, the same types of guys every time.

726
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,600
So you learn by dying over and over where you should be.

727
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
And I hate that so much.

728
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
That's totally an unfair comparison.

729
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,600
I just know it's just the concept of trial and error piss me off.

730
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,600
It makes me mad in inscription.

731
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I mean, it's trial and error.

732
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
I'm not saying that they're equivalent.

733
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm just an example of a different type of trial and error.

734
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,100
The difference is that in inscription, like, yes, you do have to learn the rules and you

735
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,600
do learn the rules by losing and asking yourself, you know, what, what made me lose?

736
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
How can I avoid losing in the future?

737
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:30,600
But your eventual loss or victory is the sum total, you know, it's brought about by the

738
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
sum total of the decisions that you made.

739
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,600
It's not, you know, you're suddenly presented with a new scenario and, you know, you know,

740
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
you got to choose.

741
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Do I go left, right or center and, you know, right or center will kill you and left is

742
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
how you win.

743
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,600
So, I mean, stick my neck out for inscription a little bit.

744
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
You know what?

745
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,600
I learned and I was, I learned this and I was like, yep, makes total sense.

746
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Inscription was made by the same guys that made Pony Island.

747
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
Do you remember Pony Island?

748
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I remember us hearing about it.

749
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Pony Island sucks.

750
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Pony Island was an idiot game made by rubes for babies.

751
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,600
It's got the same sort of general premise, doesn't it?

752
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,600
It's got a surface level game and then a sub game that is secret and mysterious and ooh,

753
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
you got to find the clues.

754
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
A little.

755
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
I mean, I'll be honest.

756
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Aesthetically similar.

757
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:31,600
It is aesthetically similar in ways that I feel like it's.

758
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
I'd want to not spoil anything about it.

759
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,600
I still haven't gotten to whatever big spoiler there is.

760
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:45,600
There are some thematic and like meta-fictional similarities between Pony Island and inscription

761
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,600
in a way that makes me go like, yep, I totally see how the same guy made them.

762
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
But it's funny.

763
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:59,600
There are some things that I think are a little dumb about inscription.

764
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,600
And those are the things that made Pony Island really dumb and made me hate it.

765
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
So I don't know.

766
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,600
I just thought that was made me nod and go, yep, I see it.

767
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
Yep.

768
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
I see it.

769
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:22,600
I think fundamentally in a game what I like is having all the pieces to the puzzle.

770
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
I love puzzles.

771
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I love point and click adventure games where I can have all of the items in my inventory

772
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,600
and try and think what I need to do.

773
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,600
And the most frustrating thing in a point and click adventure game is not having clicked

774
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,600
on something that doesn't look like you can click on it or like I thought I already did

775
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,600
and you didn't have a piece to the puzzle that is the piece you need.

776
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,600
That's the most annoying thing.

777
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Yeah.

778
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,600
And so when I feel like when I start a new inscription game, I'm like, well, I lost,

779
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,600
but like, I don't know how to proceed.

780
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,600
I guess I will just, like, I don't know.

781
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
I just feel like I don't know all the time.

782
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I don't feel like I'm getting better by losing.

783
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,600
I feel like, well, I don't, obviously I will.

784
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,600
You don't feel like you're getting better by losing?

785
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,600
I feel like I will eventually, but it's the sort of thing where I need to die like 50

786
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
times before I'm like, okay.

787
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Okay.

788
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,600
I'm not smart.

789
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,600
I'm not smart like that.

790
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,600
You have, you have not made it past the Angler?

791
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
No.

792
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Okay.

793
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,600
I fought them like maybe five times.

794
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
There's not that many.

795
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,600
That's not that, that's not, that's not very many.

796
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
No.

797
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:41,600
I died, I died a lot more than five times against the next big guy after the Angler.

798
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:49,600
So, I have a lot of, I have a lot of patience.

799
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,600
I have a lot of patience for stuff.

800
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,600
You know, the fact that like I felt like I was learning something every time I played

801
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Inscription really like made it not that painful to lose.

802
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,600
I mean, when there was a run that I felt like, yeah, I lost it because I just didn't draw

803
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,600
what I wanted to or the game just didn't give me like good map choices.

804
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,600
And it didn't give me the choices that I wanted to build the deck that I wanted to build.

805
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
I did have runs like that.

806
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
And yeah, those are really frustrating and discouraging.

807
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
But I don't know.

808
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,600
I guess most runs, usually there was something I could be like, oh, okay.

809
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Well, at least now I know not to do that or like, oh, well now I know that if I do that

810
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,600
it's good or I should keep my eye out for this in the future.

811
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:41,600
I think it was, it was just like, I got a bit of a bad first impression of what the cards

812
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,600
in the game were like, because Gek was like the first rare card I got after beating the

813
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Prospector for the first time.

814
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
And Gek costs nothing.

815
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,600
And that led me to believe that sometimes cards can cost nothing.

816
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,600
And so I was always disappointed when a card cost anything.

817
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,600
I'm like, dang it.

818
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,600
How do I play this?

819
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,600
My deck was full of things that need, like I'm always low on like, bones and blood.

820
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,600
And I don't know how to make that be better.

821
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,600
I mean, well, you made a death card out of Gek with a zero cost, right?

822
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I haven't seen him.

823
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,600
Oh, unlucky.

824
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,600
Do the death cards stay even after you die multiple times?

825
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,600
Yeah.

826
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
Oh, well, I guess I have been unlucky.

827
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,600
Which is, it's a mixed blessing though, because if you make a really good one, then like, you

828
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,600
aren't guaranteed to see it in the next game.

829
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,600
It might not come up for a while.

830
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,600
And like, as you make more death cards, like, you know, the pool gets diluted.

831
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,600
So if you have a really, if you have a really shitty run, you might have really shitty cards

832
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
and make a really shitty death card.

833
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,600
There's like five cards called Fuck You already.

834
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:02,600
You usually death, usually you can make a pretty good death card there.

835
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,600
Death cards tend to be better than normal cards.

836
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Yeah, I remember like one of my first death cards, it was like a zero cost, like four, six,

837
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
with like double strike.

838
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
That's amazing.

839
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,600
Yeah.

840
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,600
And then I got it like the next run and I was like, I'm kicking ass with this.

841
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
I'm invincible.

842
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,600
But then because I kept making more death cards, it got rarer and rarer for me to see that one.

843
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
I was like, no, I want that one.

844
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Just give me that one.

845
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
I could win with that one.

846
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,600
Well, that's super discouraging then, because I'm going to die like way more than the average player.

847
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,600
But the other death cards, the other death cards are also good.

848
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,600
They might not all be as like, as broken as that one.

849
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,600
But like, in general, they're pretty good.

850
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:52,600
You can you can pretty much always make a card that's better than like baseline.

851
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,600
I guess that's true.

852
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,600
I never picked Gek.

853
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,600
I never picked Gek because it's like, what do you it's like it's just a one one.

854
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Like what do you what do you want that for?

855
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,600
I did I realized that like, yeah, it's it's humble.

856
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,600
But if you can boost it and it can become very valuable because it's free.

857
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:25,600
I mean, I know the value of a one one when like, you just need to do one damage to stop something from killing you.

858
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,600
And the fact that it's free means that like, I could always play it no matter what's happening unless my board is full.

859
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
Yeah, like the low cost is really useful.

860
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:42,600
It is I've realized the value of Gek, but I don't yeah, I don't think I ever played it as I was like working towards getting my first win.

861
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Just because I was like the stats just aren't very the stats aren't very high.

862
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:59,600
No, but a free a free a free cast is like actually really good, especially if you are like having like pay if you're like running out of blood.

863
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:13,600
Like if you're if you're having blood struggles and like you can't pay for anything, then a free cast is like, OK, that gives you one turn where you can basically like get to blood in one turn.

864
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
And that's good.

865
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:25,600
That's really good if you want blood blood.

866
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:31,600
I've been playing a little bit of Casey's Mod just here and there, not as much as before.

867
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:46,600
I'm almost I think I've almost like 100% like beat everything that like Casey's Mod has to offer, not quite, but I'm pretty close.

868
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
What have been going for an hour?

869
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,600
54 minutes.

870
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,600
50 minutes.

871
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,600
OK.

872
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,600
I don't know.

873
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,600
Wow.

874
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,600
How are we so bad at doing a podcast after all these years after all these episodes?

875
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Well, I mean, it's just because same reason I'm same reason I'm just bad at everything.

876
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:21,600
Same reason that I just suck in general is that I just don't do enough to talk to have things to talk about.

877
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
True.

878
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,600
True.

879
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Oh, I guess I could talk about this, although it's a little it's not that personal, but it's like it's vocal training, like voice feminization.

880
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Sure.

881
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:47,600
I've been avoiding it because it's sort of weirdly like scary and frustrating just in concept.

882
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:58,600
I've looked into it a little bit here and there and I'm like, do these exercises for like four months and eventually you might start to sense something is different.

883
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,600
And yeah, I think I want to do it.

884
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,600
I'm going to try my best to do some stuff.

885
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Every day like larynx raising exercises and going or whatever you do and stuff like that.

886
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:37,600
But I think the most frustrating thing about it based on what little I've done so far is that I have no idea if I'm doing it right because it's hard to judge that when I'm listening to a YouTube video do it.

887
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:43,600
I try to copy it and they just don't go into enough depth as to what it sounds like when you're doing it wrong.

888
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,600
What it sounds like when you're not doing it right.

889
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,600
What it sounds like when you know how it should feel like I just need more information.

890
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
Well, you just got it.

891
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,600
You just got to lose.

892
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:59,600
You just got to lose and learn what you did wrong.

893
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
I got to lose over and over again.

894
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
I got to trial and error it.

895
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,600
I guess.

896
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,600
I don't know.

897
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,600
I hate that so much.

898
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,600
Yeah.

899
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Yeah.

900
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
Yeah.

901
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Well, what do you just like just starting that?

902
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,600
I mean, I'm not doing anything at the moment.

903
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Like how I'm speaking now is just how I'm speaking normally anyway.

904
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:39,600
And I think over months and years, I've naturally spoken a little higher than I used to.

905
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:48,600
I think some people have noticed if you go back to older PCPs, I did speak with a lot more bass in my voice.

906
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,600
But I still, I don't sound like that feminine.

907
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,600
I don't think I want to do something about that.

908
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:12,600
And it's really, it's really, I don't know, it's just hard to approach because it's one thing is that it's difficult to stick with something when I don't know whether I'm doing it right or not.

909
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:18,600
I just have to trust that whatever exercises I'm doing are not stupid and I'm fine.

910
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:28,600
And eventually I'll see some results, but also making silly noises and trying to sound feminine makes me feel like an absolute fool.

911
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,600
And it's sort of embarrassing even when I'm by myself.

912
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Yeah, I understand.

913
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,600
It's like some gender weirdness.

914
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
But I want to try it.

915
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
I want to try and get better at that.

916
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:49,600
It's just like going to the gym when you're a scrawny weakling and it's like, oh, it's so embarrassing.

917
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,600
I'm so weak.

918
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:59,600
I look like such a loser lifting the bar with no plates on it.

919
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,600
All the beef cakes are going to make fun of me.

920
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,600
And then they do.

921
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
That's the worst part.

922
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:21,600
The worst part is that it's true. It's all true. All the worst things you imagine.

923
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:27,600
So I'm not going to talk about it every week because I don't want it to be like a running like, how's your voice this week?

924
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
How's your voice stupid?

925
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,600
I don't want to do anything like make a big deal of it.

926
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:41,600
But hopefully, slowly and surely, I will sound more femme in my regular speech.

927
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,600
I suppose it remains to be seen.

928
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Oh, I did watch the evermore video.

929
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,600
I forgot what you said about it last time.

930
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
Yeah, it's good.

931
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
It's good.

932
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,600
Yeah, it's good.

933
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
It's good.

934
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
It's a good video.

935
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,600
Interesting.

936
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,600
I don't know.

937
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Yeah, what else can I say?

938
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,600
The Vampire Diaries video hit 10 million views.

939
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Yeah, I saw that actually.

940
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
It's been recommended.

941
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,600
Oh, you saw it recommend.

942
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,600
I saw she made an announcement for about 10 million views on Twitter.

943
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,600
That's a lot of views.

944
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
That's a lot of views.

945
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,600
That's a lot of views.

946
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
I don't know if you've seen that one.

947
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
I mean, it's good.

948
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,600
I think I clicked on it once and I didn't know anything about Vampire Diaries.

949
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
Yeah.

950
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,600
And I was like, maybe I don't care.

951
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,600
Maybe I'm gone.

952
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
How long is that video?

953
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Like two hours?

954
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
It's hours.

955
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,600
It's not even that long.

956
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,600
No.

957
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
Evermore is longer.

958
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Yeah, but Evermore gripped me.

959
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,600
I know what the medieval fantasy is and the idea of a park doing all that stuff.

960
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,600
Wow, that's so cool and imaginative.

961
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
There's no way it could go right.

962
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,600
The Evermore one, it's really uncomfortable.

963
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Especially the parts where they're like,

964
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:14,600
what really stuck out to me is the parts about the actors being way too intimate with the guests

965
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:20,600
and the sort of live-action role-playing element being way too personal.

966
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:26,600
I thought it was the other way around, the guests were being too personal with the actors.

967
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:32,600
I remember there's the part where that one podcaster,

968
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,600
that Evermore podcaster is kneeling before that one woman

969
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,600
and the woman is yelling at some other actor who's playing her husband or whatever

970
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
and she's like, what would you have me do, my lord?

971
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
Would you have me go to bed with him?

972
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,600
And it's like, is this like a kid's theme park?

973
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:56,600
There's a lot of incongruity with the subject matter being dark fantasy D&D

974
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
and a family outing place.

975
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
It doesn't really work.

976
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,600
It's just very uncomfortable.

977
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Remarkable stuff, though.

978
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,600
Um...

979
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,600
Uh...

980
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,600
I um...

981
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:21,600
It makes me wish that I had more autistic hyper fixations.

982
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,600
Oh yeah, they're fun. It's fun to have those.

983
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Yeah, I wish I felt some sort of compulsion to pursue some extremely niche interests

984
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:43,600
so that I would have some very obscure facts to turn into content.

985
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,600
That would be cool.

986
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,600
Do you not have that in obscure weirdo webcomics?

987
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:57,600
Not really. I mean, I know a few of them, but I'm not out here discovering more very often.

988
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,600
I mean, I guess I could.

989
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Maybe.

990
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:07,600
Has it turned out that Ben Saint is the least autistic of the PCP and he regrets it terribly?

991
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:13,600
As I've said before, my brain does work.

992
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,600
But to what end?

993
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,600
I'm pretty sure I'm neurotypical as far as I'm aware.

994
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,600
You've got a normal head on your shoulders and you're sad constantly.

995
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,600
It's a classic tale.

996
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,600
And it's just not doing me any favors, man.

997
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:37,600
It's not working. Something's got to change.

998
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,600
You've got to go down the neurotypical path and become a landlord or something.

999
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:52,600
You've got to get six figures and then drink wine and go to the football.

1000
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,600
I mean, I guess those are things that some people do.

1001
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,600
I associate having lots of money with being neurotypical.

1002
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,600
With having lots of things neurotypical people do.

1003
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:08,600
Watch football, drink wine and have lots of money.

1004
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,600
Yeah.

1005
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,600
They have like a pad and they have a barbecue and they invite their normal friends over.

1006
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:24,600
Different kinds of neurotypical people do all of those things in different measures, I suppose.

1007
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,600
I should have just stayed in academia.

1008
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,600
I should have just gotten my PhD or something.

1009
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,600
That's what should have happened.

1010
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Is that impossible to go back and do that?

1011
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,600
It's not impossible now.

1012
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,600
I mean, I guess I could do that.

1013
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,600
It's daunting. It's hard.

1014
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,600
Even then, I would be faced with the, well, what are you going to write your thesis on?

1015
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,600
I would say, I don't know.

1016
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Nothing matters, man.

1017
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,600
I don't care about anything.

1018
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:10,600
So it's truly, I'm truly doomed.

1019
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,600
No matter what.

1020
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Do you let yourself get vulnerable a lot?

1021
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
What does that mean?

1022
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Putting yourself up with, I don't know, like vulnerable facts.

1023
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Like in general?

1024
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Yeah. I feel like a lot of creativity comes from vulnerability.

1025
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:47,600
Like putting yourself out there in a way that you would feel cringe about or otherwise be afraid of people knowing.

1026
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,600
Um...

1027
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Are you a closed off individual, Ben Saint?

1028
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,600
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I guess a little bit, yeah.

1029
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,600
Yeah, I feel like that would be a good place to start if you want to start feeling stuff.

1030
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:13,600
I don't even know how I would do that.

1031
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,600
It's a little difficult.

1032
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:25,600
I've recently learned a good way to understand yourself like that is to think of what truly terrifies you,

1033
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,600
but where the consequences are not actually life-threatening.

1034
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:37,600
Like for an example, I am scared of wearing a dress.

1035
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,600
For example, this is a gender thing. I'm scared of being judged for it.

1036
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,600
Wearing a dress is not going to do anything bad, so my fear is not in the dress itself.

1037
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:54,600
It's the vulnerability, you know, the sincerity with which I present myself and the judgment that could come from that.

1038
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,600
That's where the fear comes from is being vulnerable.

1039
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:06,600
And so when you're afraid of opening up about something, like really afraid,

1040
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:13,600
it's probably because that's something that you really want, sort of an innate sort of feeling.

1041
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:18,600
And that's how you know if you think about how you feel about things.

1042
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
That's how you would be able to point to something and say,

1043
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,600
okay, I probably want to do that, and then you could pursue it.

1044
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:33,600
Hmm, okay, okay.

1045
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Just a thought.

1046
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,600
Thinking, all right, all right.

1047
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:46,600
I'll process that a little and get back to you, I guess.

1048
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,600
One of those things, I mean, I felt very like open more recently.

1049
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,600
It's been nice.

1050
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Let's see, you're having a good time on Twitter.

1051
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Yeah.

1052
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,600
Imagine that.

1053
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Yeah, it's hard.

1054
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:09,600
It's hard to understand.

1055
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Oh, well.

1056
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,600
Kill the part of you that cringes, et cetera.

1057
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

1058
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,600
All right, let's just go to voicemails.

1059
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,600
God, I gotta fucking download them.

1060
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,600
No, it's not voicemail.com, it's speakpipe.com.

1061
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,600
Slash PCP voicemail, right?

1062
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Yes.

1063
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,600
Leave us a voicemail if you got something to say that nothing comes out when they move the lips.

1064
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,600
Just a bunch of gibberish.

1065
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
They forgot about Dre.

1066
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Okay.

1067
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Dre Lamau.

1068
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Let's see.

1069
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
There's a message here.

1070
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
It said mjirlink, what do we got?

1071
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,600
Hang on, which page are we on?

1072
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Page one.

1073
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,600
Oh, my God.

1074
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,600
This is cool.

1075
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,600
Regiflex.

1076
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Regiflex.

1077
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,600
See, this works.

1078
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,600
Although, what's different about this versus normal type?

1079
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Like, what isn't normal type?

1080
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Do normal types not have muscles?

1081
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:33,600
The way I understand normal type is, like, thematically, they are critters who are not jacked.

1082
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,600
That's a little scrawny.

1083
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
That's so unscientific.

1084
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,600
I know.

1085
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Pokemon is weirdly, well, not weirdly, it's like, it's not scientific.

1086
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,600
It tries to be in some things, but a lot of it is just sort of like vibes.

1087
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
There's no real difference.

1088
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
It's true.

1089
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,600
It's too vibe-based.

1090
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,600
It's too vibe-based for me.

1091
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Fighting beats normal because fighting is the Chad and normal is the Virgin.

1092
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,600
It's the Virgin.

1093
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,600
That makes sense.

1094
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,600
I can understand that dynamic easily.

1095
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,600
I'm trying to think, what is fighting weak against?

1096
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,600
It is weak against psychic.

1097
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
No, it's not weak against dark.

1098
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,600
It's strong against dark.

1099
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,600
It's weak against psychic.

1100
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,600
It's weak against flying and fairy.

1101
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,600
I think that's it.

1102
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,600
Yeah.

1103
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:26,600
It's funny how normal is not weak against flying, even though the assumption you would make is

1104
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
that fighting is on the ground.

1105
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,600
They're strong muscles, but they're not able to attack something that's like dive-bombing them.

1106
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,600
But normal is also on the ground.

1107
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,600
It's also on the ground.

1108
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,600
It's just weaker.

1109
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Yeah.

1110
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,600
But they're fine, actually.

1111
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,600
Yeah, it's a bit shit, I guess I would say.

1112
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Hang on.

1113
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
Are there more pictures in this album, or is it just the one?

1114
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
It's just the one.

1115
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,600
I think?

1116
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,600
I'm double-checking.

1117
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,600
Yeah, it's just the one.

1118
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,600
Okay.

1119
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,600
Okay.

1120
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,600
Well, let's check the next one.

1121
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,600
It's another Imgur link.

1122
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,600
Oh boy, what could it be?

1123
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Yeah.

1124
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:17,600
Yeah, I'm a cuck, crazy, unhinged cop killer.

1125
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:24,600
I like that they're using a pretty normal photo of you, but your teeth are gold.

1126
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,600
My teeth are gold, yeah.

1127
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:33,600
I got that sinister red glint in my one eye.

1128
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,600
This rules.

1129
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,600
This owns, I don't know.

1130
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,600
Yeah.

1131
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,600
Yeah.

1132
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:47,600
All I can do is say how I appreciate it for being good, and that's what's happening.

1133
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,600
Next one is called Two Best Friends.

1134
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,600
Three, two, one, go.

1135
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,600
Hey Ben, would you say Gibb is your best friend?

1136
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,600
Same to you, Gibb.

1137
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,600
Would you say Ben is your best friend?

1138
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,600
Don't put us on the spot like that.

1139
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,600
You're definitely a very good friend.

1140
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,600
Yeah.

1141
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:15,600
I mean, do I have to choose between you and every other friend that I have?

1142
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Yeah, it's not, best friend is, it's a very like, like child, like term.

1143
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,600
Like when you're on the playground, you have like a bunch of people you like, but there's

1144
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,600
one that you like most, and that's your best friend.

1145
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
Your best friend, yeah.

1146
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,600
But that's only because when you're at school, that is your entire world.

1147
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,600
You don't really go other places and meet different groups of friends in other places.

1148
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,600
I would say that like a best friend implies that like you're together like a lot, like

1149
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,600
you hang out like a lot of the time.

1150
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
Yeah.

1151
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,600
I don't really have any one.

1152
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,600
Essentially.

1153
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,600
Yeah.

1154
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,600
But like, you know, I mean, we don't, I mean, do podcasts once a week.

1155
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,600
I don't know.

1156
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,600
To me, a best friend is like you're over like every day.

1157
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
Yeah.

1158
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,600
You're over every day, you know, drinking wine, watching the, going to the football game.

1159
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,600
And having lots of money together.

1160
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,600
And then talking about your properties you own.

1161
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,600
My dad has a best friend.

1162
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:18,600
Like him and his best friend since childhood, you know, they like, they own a boat together.

1163
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
They go sailing together.

1164
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:27,600
And like, you know, they're like, they're like peas in a pod, like lifelong chums.

1165
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
There's a quite a number of people.

1166
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
I would never own a boat with you.

1167
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
I'm sorry.

1168
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
No, that's fine.

1169
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,600
There's plenty of people in my life that I would consider very good friends, but no one

1170
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,600
single one that is like a pea in a pod situation.

1171
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Yeah.

1172
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,600
I do like to keep to myself quite a lot.

1173
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,600
Yeah.

1174
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,600
Yeah.

1175
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,600
Okay.

1176
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Well, I'm glad we're, it would be so awkward if I was like, nah, not really.

1177
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
And you were like, yeah, absolutely.

1178
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,600
How much would that suck?

1179
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,600
Yeah.

1180
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Okay.

1181
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,600
I'm glad we're on the same page.

1182
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Next one is listen first bonus meme days.

1183
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,600
How shower you long without.

1184
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,600
Okay.

1185
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Three, two, one, go.

1186
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,600
Ben saying keeps on saying, ah, the eight hour mega man feed is the other mega man feed.

1187
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,600
Where is it?

1188
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,600
Where is it?

1189
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,600
Give it to me.

1190
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,600
I want the mega man eight hour video.

1191
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Is it, is it even real?

1192
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,600
Is it in the room with you, Ben?

1193
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,600
This guy.

1194
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,600
This guy is having.

1195
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
It literally is.

1196
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
It is what?

1197
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Real?

1198
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
No, he said like, is it in the room with us?

1199
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,600
Like, yes, it literally is.

1200
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,600
It's in the room with you.

1201
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,600
It kind of is.

1202
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,600
It's on your little computer there.

1203
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,600
On my little computer here.

1204
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,600
This guy's having the appropriate reaction.

1205
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,600
More people should be yelling at me about it not being out.

1206
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,600
Everyone's just much too polite.

1207
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,600
Mega polite.

1208
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,600
Mega.

1209
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,600
But I did, I did, I did already, I did already say what's up with it.

1210
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,600
So I won't go into it again.

1211
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,600
Days how shower long you without depends.

1212
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,600
I mean, I'll be, I'll be honest if I'm not going out, if I'm not leaving my house or

1213
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:18,600
seeing anyone, I will just not shower because like, what does it matter?

1214
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,600
So sometimes I go a little while, but I don't, but I don't let myself be seen in

1215
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
that state.

1216
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,600
No, absolutely.

1217
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
I'm going out.

1218
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,600
It's time to scrub.

1219
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,600
Yeah.

1220
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:38,600
I think I go like maybe two days though without showering just because my hair needs to be

1221
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,600
wetted and it's just the easiest way to do that.

1222
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,600
I mean, otherwise it gets way too frizzy.

1223
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,600
I don't wash it every, every shower, but I need to wet it every few days.

1224
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,600
They say it's like, they say it's like bad for your hair to wash it too much.

1225
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,600
Yeah.

1226
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,600
You wash all of the natural occur naturally occurring oils out of your hair.

1227
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,600
The point of washing your hair is to get rid of all the dirt that's accumulated, not to

1228
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,600
get rid of the oil because that's, that's important.

1229
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:16,600
So, so they say that's what the conditioner is to replace the oil, replace the oil while

1230
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,600
your natural oil comes back.

1231
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,600
Right.

1232
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Yeah.

1233
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,600
That's what they say.

1234
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:31,600
A shampoo conditioner is a scam because like the point of the shampoo is that it strips

1235
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,600
the, it strips the oil off.

1236
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,600
So, like, it doesn't make any sense to like have, oh, a thing that puts oil on the hair,

1237
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,600
but also the shampoo that strips it off.

1238
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Yeah, it just doesn't seem to do much.

1239
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,600
Yeah.

1240
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
All right.

1241
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,600
The next one is another Imgur album.

1242
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:55,600
Oh, it's another, I think someone sent the same thing last week.

1243
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Vat of slime in the new Sonic.

1244
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
I mean, it looks pretty cool.

1245
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,600
I haven't seen this last week.

1246
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,600
This maybe is a discord or something you saw.

1247
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
Maybe, maybe it was.

1248
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
Yeah.

1249
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,600
No, no, no, I think it was on discord.

1250
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,600
Someone sent me this.

1251
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:13,600
It wasn't this same picture, but it was a picture of one of these tanks in the new Sonic.

1252
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,600
Looks like pretty good slime.

1253
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
Pretty slimy.

1254
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,600
Pretty slimy.

1255
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,600
Pretty nuclear.

1256
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,600
Damn, look at that.

1257
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,600
Look at that reflection in the, in the ground.

1258
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,600
I've heard the Sonic game is pretty empty and kind of janky.

1259
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,600
I have, I haven't seen that much talk about it.

1260
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,600
The little talk that I have seen has been like people being like, ooh, should I get cautiously

1261
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,600
optimistic?

1262
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Oh, should I be cautiously optimistic about the release of this game?

1263
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Since the release, I've seen people saying like, yeah, it's bad law.

1264
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
Whoops.

1265
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,600
Yeah.

1266
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Yeah.

1267
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,600
Breath of the Mild.

1268
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,600
I'm sure that's been done.

1269
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,600
Oof.

1270
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,600
Oof.

1271
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Oh, right.

1272
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,600
It's open world, right?

1273
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
That's like the thing about it.

1274
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
Yeah.

1275
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:09,600
What if you could go in every direction and, and it was not a curated experience?

1276
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Or at least not as curated.

1277
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:20,600
Oh, I think that, I think the same person also sent another slime that they just, they just

1278
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,600
sent two of them.

1279
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,600
Let's, let's take a look.

1280
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,600
Oh yeah.

1281
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,600
Now we're talking.

1282
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,600
Oh, it looks so small.

1283
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,600
Yeah.

1284
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:40,600
I think the back stone there, I thought was like a curb and then there was dirt and this

1285
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,600
was like a little 3D model that had been 3D printed, but then that's in game and that's

1286
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
real Sonic.

1287
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Yeah.

1288
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,800
This looks like, this looks like we're looking at like one foot of space here and Sonic is

1289
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,600
like an inch tall.

1290
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,600
It's something very toy like about it.

1291
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,600
Um, I just be like the consistency of the dirt.

1292
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,600
Like that just looks like any rough dirt.

1293
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,600
It's like, it looks like a little garden patch.

1294
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,600
Anyway, uh, next one is called Manchigo Mitch.

1295
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,600
Uh, three, two, one, go.

1296
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,600
Hey, it's me, Manchigo Mitch.

1297
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,600
Yes, another beloved character.

1298
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,600
Fredo, you owe us money and you know what's going to happen if you don't pay an artist

1299
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,600
the money, we're going to draw your kneecaps broken.

1300
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,600
We're going to artistically render your kneecaps broken.

1301
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,600
If you don't pay us the money.

1302
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
No, that would be so embarrassing.

1303
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,600
Capiche.

1304
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,600
That's a very, that's a Chris Chan threat.

1305
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,600
I like that.

1306
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,600
The only two examples were the same example of the kneecaps.

1307
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,600
I mean, what else?

1308
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,600
I mean, what else?

1309
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,600
We're going to break your kneecaps in drawn form and we're also going to paint them drawn

1310
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,600
kneecaps broken.

1311
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,600
This is, this is like a Chris Chan threat.

1312
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,600
If you make Chris mad, she'll like put you in the comic and draw you being executed

1313
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,600
by firing squad.

1314
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,600
And you don't want that, do you?

1315
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,600
Uh-oh.

1316
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,600
Uh, next one is called Paneer Pauly.

1317
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,600
Three, two, one, go.

1318
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
Where is my money, Cheesy Manfredo?

1319
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,600
Yep, yep, yep.

1320
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,600
That's right, it's me, Paneer Pauly.

1321
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,600
I'm with the mozzarella mafia and you owe us money.

1322
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,600
I don't know what the words mean.

1323
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,600
Paneer is a cheese.

1324
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,600
Let me tell you what we're going to do to you.

1325
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,600
We're going to take you.

1326
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,600
We're going to age you.

1327
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,600
We're going to stick you on a shelf.

1328
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,600
We're going to flip you over for six months.

1329
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,600
And then in six months time, you'll be six months older.

1330
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,600
See how you like that.

1331
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,600
No.

1332
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,600
Twice before you screw us over again.

1333
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,600
Out.

1334
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,600
Paneer Pauly, out.

1335
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,600
God.

1336
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
We're going to age you.

1337
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,600
We're going to put you in a meat smoking rack.

1338
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,600
You're going to get fucking smoked.

1339
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,600
Terrifying, terrifying.

1340
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,600
Don't fuck with these guys.

1341
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,600
You better get them their money is what I'm picking up.

1342
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,600
Uh, next one is called Return of the Kring Us.

1343
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,600
Three, two, one, go.

1344
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,600
What's a PCP?

1345
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
It's me.

1346
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,600
Kring is the third.

1347
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:41,600
I cringed at the cheesy for making a cringe kick starter.

1348
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:50,600
And now I'm banging cyberpunk edge runners and chainsaw man.

1349
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,600
They're very good.

1350
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
Cool, man.

1351
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Keep, keep biggin.

1352
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,600
Keep on biggin.

1353
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:08,600
I think I might have mentioned last week that I mean to read chainsaw man at some point.

1354
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
I still haven't done it.

1355
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,600
It's the big zeitgeist anime of the moment.

1356
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
You got to do it.

1357
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,600
It's the moment anime.

1358
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
I guess that I hate the moment.

1359
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,600
I'll wait until it's not popular anymore and maybe then I'll read it.

1360
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,600
Uh, cyberpunk edge runners, I have no interest in.

1361
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,600
I mean, I didn't play the game.

1362
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,600
I've heard that it's good.

1363
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,600
I mean, everyone hated the game, but people say the anime is good.

1364
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
So I'm sure that's fine.

1365
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,600
I'm sure me not playing the game would be no impediment to me enjoying it.

1366
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,600
I'm a little confused.

1367
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,600
I haven't looked into it at all.

1368
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,600
So the cyberpunk 2077 is different from whatever the anime is based on?

1369
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Well, 77 is the game.

1370
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,600
The edge runner is, I think, I don't think it's, I'm not sure if it's like the same characters,

1371
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
but I know it's set in the same world.

1372
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,600
That's pretty much all I know about it.

1373
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,600
But is it also a game?

1374
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,600
No, it's an anime.

1375
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,600
No, it's an anime.

1376
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,600
But like, is so people are playing the cyberpunk game?

1377
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,600
No.

1378
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,600
They're watching the anime called edge runners.

1379
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,600
But edge runners has a game?

1380
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,600
I thought it did.

1381
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,600
Cyberpunk 77 was the game.

1382
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,600
And then cyberpunk edge runners is the anime.

1383
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,600
Spin off, I guess?

1384
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Spin off, I guess.

1385
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,600
Spin off? Well, spin off, King.

1386
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
But I don't know.

1387
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,600
It doesn't look great.

1388
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,600
Nothing about it appeals to me much.

1389
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
So I'm probably not going to watch it.

1390
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,600
Next one is Im...

1391
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,600
It's another freaking Imjurling.

1392
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,600
Wait a minute, did I download that last one?

1393
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,600
Yes, I did.

1394
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,600
Let's post the link, boy.

1395
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,600
Let's do it.

1396
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,600
Ew.

1397
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
Oh, it's Ben Garrison.

1398
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,600
It's Ben Garrison.

1399
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,600
Oh, my God.

1400
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,600
There's a little Ben Saint on there.

1401
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,600
Hey, this is great.

1402
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Hey, this rules.

1403
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Endless War is...

1404
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,600
Slimecorp is squeezing the teats of Endless War to get slime.

1405
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,600
Yep, I mean, yeah, that's...

1406
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,600
The slime cow.

1407
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,600
The slime cow.

1408
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,600
This is amazing. This is fantastic.

1409
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,600
Yeah, it's so true.

1410
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,600
It's so true, it's so true.

1411
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
It's sad but true.

1412
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,600
This is our society when you think about it.

1413
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,600
Scary. Look at his scary face.

1414
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,600
Oh, my God.

1415
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,600
Oh, there's dollars. Look, there's a couple of bucks.

1416
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,600
There's a couple of bucks.

1417
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,600
Oh, there's dollars underneath the slime in the bucket as well.

1418
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,600
Oh, yeah.

1419
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,600
Oh, yeah. Slime is money.

1420
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,600
Slime is money, as they say.

1421
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,600
Yep.

1422
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,600
I hope I never said that before.

1423
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,600
Next one is...

1424
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,600
Oh, God.

1425
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
Endless War says map, right?

1426
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,600
Why did... Oh, because you retweeted it as Endless War.

1427
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,600
Right. This was...

1428
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,600
KillerDog tweeted this in response to JK Rowling,

1429
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,600
which was really funny.

1430
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,600
I like this response a lot,

1431
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,600
so I retweeted it on a bunch of different accounts.

1432
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Endless War liked it.

1433
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Endless War liked it and retweeted it.

1434
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
That's an endorsement.

1435
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,600
Retweets are endorsements.

1436
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,600
It's funny. It's good.

1437
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,600
No apologies.

1438
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,600
Ben's Weekly Reminder, play Delta in Chapter 2.

1439
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,600
Okay. Ben's Weekly Reminder, catch up to one piece.

1440
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Okay. Wait, was it last week that I said that I actually should do that,

1441
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,600
so we could talk about it on the show?

1442
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,600
Yeah, it was.

1443
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,600
We could talk a little bit about that one piece as a corner,

1444
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,600
as a little corner of the podcast.

1445
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,600
Yeah. I was right that I should do that,

1446
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,600
but nevertheless, I didn't.

1447
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,600
But soon, perhaps, I should...

1448
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,600
Maybe this week I'll do it, if I don't forget.

1449
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
It's on my to-do list.

1450
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,600
Next one is called You, 3, 2, 1, go.

1451
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,600
I mean...

1452
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,600
I wonder who he's owing it to.

1453
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
Is it us?

1454
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,600
Yeah, it's the PCP, so it's the time of your life.

1455
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Oh, well, I'm glad you had the time of your life watching the PCP.

1456
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,600
Every single week you have the time of your life, right here,

1457
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,600
on the Procrastinators podcast.

1458
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,600
I know I'm having the time of my life.

1459
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,600
Yeah, because my life is being timed.

1460
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,600
My life is passing me by, so I'm having time of my life taken.

1461
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,600
No, is it?

1462
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,600
Okay, all spoilers.

1463
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
Favorite character from inscription?

1464
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
Oh, the butler.

1465
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,600
The penguin.

1466
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,600
I have an answer, but...

1467
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,600
Can you speak in tongues so I don't understand?

1468
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,600
How can I say it?

1469
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Okay.

1470
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,600
No, I can't really say that.

1471
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,600
That would give too much away.

1472
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,600
It's the big green monster.

1473
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
With the teeth.

1474
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,600
It was you all along, the player.

1475
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,600
You're the monster.

1476
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,600
There's a dragon.

1477
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,600
There's a little gremlin.

1478
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,600
The blue one.

1479
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,600
I know what that is.

1480
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,600
That's a smurf.

1481
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
That's all I'm saying.

1482
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,600
My favorite one is the blue one, and I'm not going to explain why.

1483
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:26,600
The game is run by little Jinjos from Banjo-Kazooie.

1484
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,600
Okay, next one is called the funniest fart you've heard.

1485
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:42,600
In the fart compilation where it made Jerma cry tears of pain from laughing so hard.

1486
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Sounds like it must have been a real humdinger.

1487
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,600
He was trying to do like a bit while...

1488
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,600
He was doing a bit where he's playing the part of a gym guy at the gym,

1489
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,600
but he's got headphones in his ears, and headphones are blasting really loud music.

1490
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,600
Somebody said, do a fart compilation, so he tried to act like the gym guy saying,

1491
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,600
hey, you need a spotter?

1492
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,600
But he's got the loudest fart compilation you've ever heard blasting out of his headphones

1493
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,600
so the camera could pick it up, and he couldn't do it without laughing,

1494
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
and he ended up crying on stream.

1495
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,600
It was very, very, very funny.

1496
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,600
Oh, sad. Oh, sad. Couldn't do it. Pitiful.

1497
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,600
He tried. No, he got pretty far.

1498
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,600
Cringe. I could have done it. I could have done it easily.

1499
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:34,600
Okay, next one is, Ben, prove you are a good ally right now.

1500
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,600
Give, give, a compliment.

1501
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,600
His hesitation is saying so much.

1502
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,600
It's too hard. It's too hard.

1503
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,600
You can do it, Ben. You can be a good ally.

1504
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,600
You don't want to get canceled, do you?

1505
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,600
No, I don't, no, I don't want that, so...

1506
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,600
What's, I mean, what's a good one?

1507
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,600
That's a good one. God ask me.

1508
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,600
Yeah, okay.

1509
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,600
Give your, your very...

1510
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,600
Try to think of a rule. Okay, you're, you're a...

1511
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,600
You're, you're, you're very sincere.

1512
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,600
You're very sincere with your, when you,

1513
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,600
when you emote or express a feeling,

1514
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,600
I just, it's very, it's, you always do it with sincerity,

1515
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,600
and I think that's cool.

1516
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,600
Well, thank you.

1517
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,600
That's a good quality for a person to have, in my opinion.

1518
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
Yes.

1519
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
So there.

1520
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,600
No, fuck you.

1521
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,600
Next one is called, an idea.

1522
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,600
Three, two, one, go.

1523
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,600
Okay.

1524
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,600
So a video of Ben jump-scaring Nate shitting his pants

1525
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,600
is the way to get Nate back on the PCP.

1526
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,600
Was, was that the point?

1527
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,600
Is that this is how to get Nate back on the PCP?

1528
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,600
Yeah, that's what they started with.

1529
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,600
Oh, well, I mean, it would add him to the content

1530
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,600
and that it would be a video of him being scared

1531
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,600
to the point of pissing and shitting himself.

1532
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,600
So, I mean, it, yeah, it would be against his will,

1533
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,600
but I mean, it would work.

1534
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,600
Yeah, I see no, I see no downsides.

1535
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,600
I think he's cracked the code.

1536
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,600
Oh, next, next one is called, another idea.

1537
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Three, two, one, go.

1538
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,600
Put Ben in the walls.

1539
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,600
Okay.

1540
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,600
Oh, okay.

1541
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,600
I mean, I think it would, I think it, I think it might work.

1542
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,600
It's just crazy enough to work.

1543
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,600
So a little plush of Brony Curious.

1544
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,600
We need one of those.

1545
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,600
Yeah, that's the part that's hard.

1546
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,600
That's the part that might be impossible.

1547
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,600
I don't think I've ever seen a fan made Brony Curious plush.

1548
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,600
I do not recall such a thing.

1549
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,600
Well, we'll just have to do it ourselves.

1550
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,600
When life gives you lemons.

1551
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,600
You make Brony Curious.

1552
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,600
You make Brony Curious.

1553
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,600
Next one is called, did I download that one?

1554
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,600
No, I downloaded, last one I downloaded was 34.

1555
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,600
So I got to download an idea and I got to download another idea.

1556
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,600
Okay.

1557
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,600
Next one is last very, very, very important idea.

1558
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,600
Three, two, one, go.

1559
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,600
Here is how we bring back all the other PCP members.

1560
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,600
We don't.

1561
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,600
Thank you.

1562
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,600
Yeah.

1563
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,600
I'm clapping.

1564
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,600
Next one is called, at my wit's end, three, two, one, go.

1565
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,600
It's insanity.

1566
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,600
It's insanity.

1567
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,600
How could anyone think the earth is around?

1568
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,600
There's no evidence.

1569
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,600
There's no proof.

1570
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,600
He's right.

1571
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,600
It sounds like you're at your wit's end.

1572
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,600
There's no proof.

1573
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,600
Oh, you've seen the curvature of the earth.

1574
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,600
Yeah.

1575
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,600
Well, how do you know?

1576
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
How do you know that that picture?

1577
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,600
What's the evidence that this picture is real?

1578
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,600
You see, I like curvy women and so I get a bono whenever I look at the earth.

1579
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,600
So, you know, that's my evidence.

1580
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:03,600
What's the evidence that all those photographs of the earth from space showing it being round

1581
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,600
are real?

1582
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,600
Prove that those aren't just fake.

1583
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,600
You can't.

1584
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,600
Nobody can.

1585
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,600
Oh, no.

1586
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,600
How do I know?

1587
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,600
I mean, how do I know that some demon is not living in my mind manipulating my brain in

1588
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,600
order that I simply experience and see evidence of the roundness of the earth?

1589
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,600
But how do I know that it's not just being manipulated by a malicious demon in my mind?

1590
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,600
You can't do it.

1591
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,600
Well, what if the demon isn't so bad after all?

1592
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
No, he's bad.

1593
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,600
No, he's bad because Democrats put him there.

1594
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,600
That's the demon talking.

1595
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,600
Your mind is compromised.

1596
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,600
Your opinion of the demon is incorrect.

1597
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,600
Exactly.

1598
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,600
The demon would want you to think.

1599
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,600
The demon wants you to think that it's good that he has made you want to get vaccinated

1600
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,600
against the coronavirus.

1601
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,600
He wants you to think that that's OK, even though it's clearly not.

1602
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,600
Next one is called a real genuine voicemail.

1603
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,600
Finally.

1604
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,600
Wow.

1605
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,600
Finally, a real voicemail.

1606
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,600
Three, two, one, go.

1607
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,600
We've been had.

1608
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,600
He played on our expectations.

1609
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,600
Fuck.

1610
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,600
How could we have been so blind?

1611
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,600
Is he going to twist at the end?

1612
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,600
He's just clearing his throat.

1613
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,600
Don't worry about it.

1614
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,600
OK, no.

1615
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,600
No.

1616
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,600
Yeah, he's just clearing his throat.

1617
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,600
He's just building up to like a really amazing.

1618
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Oh, no, it's over.

1619
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,600
OK.

1620
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,600
Next one is called me.

1621
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,600
Three, two, one, go.

1622
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,600
Do you think having a passion is necessary for a good life?

1623
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,600
Yeah.

1624
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,600
Yeah.

1625
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,600
I mean, what else are you going to do if you don't have one?

1626
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,600
You're just going to be miserable like me.

1627
01:33:53,600 --> 01:34:03,600
If you got all the time in the world and like money, passion is like what makes you feel

1628
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,600
like doing anything.

1629
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,600
Yeah.

1630
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:14,600
So like, oh, you're really like pomegranates, got a passion for those, not passion fruit.

1631
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,600
You got a passion for pomegranates.

1632
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,600
So you wake up in the morning, you get yourself for pomegranate.

1633
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,600
That's a passion.

1634
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,600
That's something you would live for.

1635
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,600
Hypothetically.

1636
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,600
Just like in Hades.

1637
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,600
Yeah.

1638
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,600
Yeah.

1639
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,600
That's why they use that.

1640
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,600
Yeah.

1641
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,600
Yeah.

1642
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:40,600
If you don't have passion, then you'll be dispassionate about everything you do.

1643
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,600
You could see every single fruit and you would just say whatever.

1644
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,600
Yeah.

1645
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,600
And that's not a life.

1646
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,600
That's when you're a skeleton, you do that.

1647
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,600
Yeah.

1648
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,600
Because you can't eat them.

1649
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,600
Yeah.

1650
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,600
Yeah.

1651
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,600
All right.

1652
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,600
There we go.

1653
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Question answered.

1654
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,600
This one is called VVV the comic.

1655
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,600
It stands for Vinny VVV.

1656
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,600
My favorite part of the week.

1657
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,600
We'll see.

1658
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,600
We'll see.

1659
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,600
Okay.

1660
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,600
Okay.

1661
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,600
Okay.

1662
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,600
So I'm playing the guitar.

1663
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,600
You're playing the guitar.

1664
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,600
My guitar.

1665
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,600
I'm saying Ben.

1666
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,600
Ben, you're vaping like a lot.

1667
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,600
Ben.

1668
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,600
It's too much.

1669
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,600
I've missed making gummies with his ingredient.

1670
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,600
I enjoyed for the first time in months.

1671
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,600
I think it's 13 ingredient and I'm overjoyed for the first time in months.

1672
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,600
Also, your teeth.

1673
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,600
What are you doing?

1674
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,600
I'm smiling.

1675
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,600
I'm smiling so hard you can see my gums.

1676
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,600
Oh my God.

1677
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,600
I've never seen you smile before.

1678
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,600
No.

1679
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,600
You wouldn't have.

1680
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,600
This is what it looks like.

1681
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,600
Tragically.

1682
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,600
Tragically.

1683
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,600
Yeah.

1684
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,600
Okay.

1685
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Okay.

1686
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,600
And then we've got.

1687
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,600
Shit.

1688
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,600
Wait.

1689
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,600
Who's the driver is?

1690
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,600
Error.

1691
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,600
Error.

1692
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,600
Yes.

1693
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,600
That's right.

1694
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,600
That's right.

1695
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:09,600
With the hogs.

1696
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,600
Yes.

1697
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,600
Ben expels a lot of vapor like a lot.

1698
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,600
You good now?

1699
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,600
Whoops.

1700
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,600
That'll be your deposit.

1701
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,600
Dang it.

1702
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,600
What?

1703
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,600
Just because I vaped a lot?

1704
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Just air it out.

1705
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:23,600
You vaped so much that you dissolved the roof and it fell off.

1706
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,600
Oh.

1707
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,600
Bummer.

1708
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,600
Bummer.

1709
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,600
I'm not.

1710
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,600
I'm not.

1711
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,600
I'm nonplussed about this.

1712
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,600
And I'm sad trombone.

1713
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,600
Look at my face.

1714
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,600
Look at my chin.

1715
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,600
Look at that pig.

1716
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,600
He's looking back.

1717
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,600
He's blushing a little bit.

1718
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,600
What's he thinking about?

1719
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:47,600
I think he's embarrassed for me.

1720
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,600
In the next one, are you holding a little pink mushroom?

1721
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,600
I think that maybe I'm doing makeup.

1722
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,600
I'm looking in a mirror.

1723
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,600
Oh yeah.

1724
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Yeah.

1725
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,600
You're.

1726
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,600
Yes.

1727
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,600
That's right.

1728
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Putting on eyeliner or something.

1729
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,600
Yeah.

1730
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,600
You can see it in the next one.

1731
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,600
It's a mirror.

1732
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,600
Oh.

1733
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,600
And then what are you doing, Gib?

1734
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
I'm drawing on my eyebrows.

1735
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,600
Why are?

1736
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,600
You melted them along with the roof.

1737
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,600
You silly freaking billy.

1738
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,600
Oh my bad.

1739
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,360
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1740
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,360
I wouldn't say that.

1741
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,360
Fuck you.

1742
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,360
It's so out of character.

1743
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,360
Yeah.

1744
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,360
I know.

1745
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,360
And I'm not mad.

1746
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:27,360
It's just the wind blowing on me causing me to put more effort into keeping it looking

1747
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,360
good.

1748
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,360
You do look good.

1749
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,360
No.

1750
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:35,360
You've done it.

1751
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,360
You got him.

1752
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,360
Thanks.

1753
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:42,360
You made it look so easy being yourself and doing what feels natural.

1754
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,360
Where is this going?

1755
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:48,360
I do have to steal myself against my fear of rejection.

1756
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,360
Rejection from society and all that.

1757
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:54,360
Being myself in earnest and having that dismissed or thrown back in my face.

1758
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,360
That hurts more than what it used to.

1759
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,360
I'm going to throw up.

1760
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,360
Yeah.

1761
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,360
It's the choice to put it out there.

1762
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,360
Oh God.

1763
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,360
There's another panel like this after this.

1764
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,360
I get it.

1765
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,360
I respect the hell out of it.

1766
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,360
I'm just kind of absorbing it.

1767
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,360
The earnest vibe from you.

1768
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,360
It's cool.

1769
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:17,360
I wish I hadn't complimented you on being sincere.

1770
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,360
I wish I'd picked something else.

1771
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,360
Oh, okay.

1772
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,360
The dialogue continues.

1773
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,360
Oh, speaking of cool things.

1774
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,360
I've been experimenting with some goth makeup styles.

1775
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,360
Goth gib, huh?

1776
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,360
Lol, yeah.

1777
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,360
I haven't taken pics of myself.

1778
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,360
It was just like things I've said or anything.

1779
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:41,360
But I've been looking at different things I could do.

1780
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,360
I love the goth look.

1781
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:47,360
I never entertained the idea of buying makeup and doing it though.

1782
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,360
I brought some makeup.

1783
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,360
Would you be willing to let me put it on you?

1784
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,360
Well, I wouldn't do that.

1785
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,360
Yeah.

1786
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,360
I've always wanted to look like a cool goth guy.

1787
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,360
I've never had the confidence to do it.

1788
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,360
Haha, I got you Ben.

1789
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,360
Lol, what are friends for?

1790
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,360
Lol magic.

1791
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,360
It certainly is.

1792
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,360
It's so cringe.

1793
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,360
Haha, yes.

1794
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,360
Okay, all right.

1795
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,360
Getting off the highway.

1796
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,360
Thank you, Irarre.

1797
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,360
Thank you, Irarre.

1798
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,360
Here's where I'm dropping you off, fam.

1799
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,360
You're welcome, gib.

1800
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,360
I'll send you the receipt, Ben.

1801
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,360
Your pain.

1802
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,360
Your pain where Ben St. lives.

1803
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,360
Sure.

1804
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,360
I forgot to draw the dialogue bubbles.

1805
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,360
I started to have fun drawing the darkness wherein Ben St. lives.

1806
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,360
In the darkest main.

1807
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,360
So here's what it said in the last panel.

1808
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,360
Ben, we're a few blocks down from where I live.

1809
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,360
I'll guess we'll have to walk it.

1810
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:52,360
Irarre, I would have driven us to your house had you not dissolved the carriage.

1811
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,360
Yeah, probably.

1812
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:02,360
Well, this is the saga continued.

1813
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,360
The saga fucking continues.

1814
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,360
People tuning.

1815
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,360
Keep it up.

1816
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,360
Viewership skyrocketing as people tune in to the cliffhangers of what's going to happen

1817
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:13,360
in the next VinnyVinny VG comment.

1818
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,360
Where's this going?

1819
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:20,360
Truly a mystery.

1820
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,360
Thank you again.

1821
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,360
Thank you for another installment, Vinny.

1822
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:28,360
I am on the edge of my seat.

1823
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,360
Let's see.

1824
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,360
Have we gotten any more?

1825
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,360
Okay, the next one is the last one.

1826
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:37,360
It's called a complaint from a very disgruntled fan at RFCK.

1827
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:41,360
Three, two, one, go.

1828
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:48,360
On episode 334 of the Procrastinator's podcast,

1829
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:53,360
Given Take mentioned building a tower all the way up to the moon

1830
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:57,360
and then jumping out of it and landing on the moon.

1831
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,360
And I cannot believe.

1832
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:06,360
I simply cannot believe that Ben Shane would not bring up the fact that this exact

1833
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:13,360
concept has already been carried out in season three of RFCK Endless War.

1834
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:20,360
When N1 of the slime corp industry went to the top of this big tower,

1835
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:28,360
the slime corp HQ tower and jumped out and landed on the moon and got the red change.

1836
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:33,360
Ben Shane, I will destroy you.

1837
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,360
Fine.

1838
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,360
Thanks.

1839
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,360
Thanks for the voicemail.

1840
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,360
Yeah, what was that?

1841
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,360
That's right.

1842
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,360
That did happen.

1843
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,360
I'm sorry.

1844
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,360
I was thinking about Mega Man.

1845
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:53,360
I was thinking about Mega Man and how the orbital elevator through the Jacob project in X8.

1846
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,360
That was just the first thing that came to mind.

1847
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:03,360
I kind of miss knowing all of the lore of Endless Wars, like many cool things that happen.

1848
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:12,360
I remember there was something going on at some point with like the ends of slime corp and 7 and 1, whatever.

1849
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,360
I think that might be, yeah.

1850
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:20,360
They were fighting something or maybe I imagined it, but there was some sort of event and it was cool,

1851
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:22,360
but I didn't really pay attention to it.

1852
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:27,360
Yeah, I think that was the season three finale.

1853
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:31,360
I think that's what this disgruntled caller is talking about.

1854
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,360
There was, gosh, yeah.

1855
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,360
I'm probably not the best person to explain it, but I understand.

1856
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:42,360
Yeah, N1 went to the moon and got the red chains.

1857
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:50,360
And I think N1 turned out to be another death furnace himself.

1858
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,360
Or maybe that was N0.

1859
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,360
Ah, shit.

1860
01:42:52,360 --> 01:43:01,360
There was another death furnace that like sort of, I don't want to get it wrong.

1861
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:05,360
I remember there were red chains and there was another death furnace and he was one of the ends.

1862
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,360
It was either N1 or N0.

1863
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:14,360
And I think, yeah, there was like an ARG thing where I think players had to like ascend the tower and like battle him.

1864
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,360
I think that was it.

1865
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:21,360
I hope I'm not making a fool of myself.

1866
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:26,360
I mean, there's more to it, obviously, because I was not like following it super closely.

1867
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,360
I just kind of heard about it after the fact.

1868
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,360
The devs like did it all on their own.

1869
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:39,360
Yeah, I remember like every so often there would be like a broadcast by one of the end operatives.

1870
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:44,360
And I think it was a girl who has glasses, scientist girl.

1871
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,360
Yeah.

1872
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:53,360
And she said stuff and then there was like the little twink boy with the yellow hair or something.

1873
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:57,360
Yes, the one with like the colorful outfit.

1874
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,360
Yeah.

1875
01:43:58,360 --> 01:43:59,360
Yeah.

1876
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,360
They would have like cryptic things talking about stuff and things.

1877
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:09,360
And I think around the time I was considering like extending and finishing like Red Noir,

1878
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:15,360
I was trying to think, how do I incorporate all of this stuff into Red Man's stupid mystery show?

1879
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:20,360
But I couldn't figure it out because there's ARG stuff and I'm like, I'm really bad at ARGs.

1880
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,360
I'm not patient at all.

1881
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:35,360
At the moment, the shit, I hope I'm not behind, but I think the current meta is about like relics.

1882
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:41,360
It's about like uncovering like ancient relics, like excavating them from the ground or something.

1883
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,360
Actually, that was a while ago.

1884
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:48,360
There might have been more developments on that front that I have not.

1885
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:54,360
The last I remember hearing was we're uncovering ancient relics.

1886
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,360
That's the thing.

1887
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,360
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1888
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,360
Disgruntled, disgruntled caller.

1889
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,360
That was the last voicemail.

1890
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,360
Oh, no.

1891
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,360
Wait, no, that is.

1892
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,360
I re-spreshed, but it did a thing.

1893
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:27,360
I definitely had passion in those days when Endless War was just getting off the ground and we were getting it going.

1894
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:34,360
I was waking up every day being like, yeah, time to work on the Endless War code.

1895
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:40,360
Yeah, time to work on getting Season 2 launched.

1896
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:43,360
Time to work on adding slime oids, lol.

1897
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:49,360
Everyone's going to think this is so silly when this feature's done.

1898
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:53,360
Those were the days.

1899
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,360
Those were fun days.

1900
01:45:55,360 --> 01:46:01,360
Yeah, those were good times.

1901
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:07,360
Well, anyway, that's the show.

1902
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:10,360
I think days like that could come back.

1903
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,360
You think so?

1904
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,360
Yeah.

1905
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,360
Yeah.

1906
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,360
Maybe?

1907
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,360
I don't know how.

1908
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:22,360
I don't know how.

1909
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,360
I don't know how to reach that.

1910
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,360
You've got to do what Mufasa says.

1911
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:32,360
You've got to do the remember who you are, Simba.

1912
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,360
Look in the clouds.

1913
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,360
Look in the reflection.

1914
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:37,360
It's you.

1915
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,360
It's Ben Saint.

1916
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,360
Remember who you are.

1917
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,360
Yeah.

1918
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,360
And then also do something about it.

1919
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,360
That's the part that Mufasa didn't mention.

1920
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,360
I think I remember who I am.

1921
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,360
I think so.

1922
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
I don't know what to do about it.

1923
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,360
I don't know how to deal with that problem.

1924
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,360
Yeah.

1925
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,360
It's not really my place to tell you exactly what to do.

1926
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:12,360
I don't really know.

1927
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:16,360
This is the...

1928
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:23,360
The soon to be concluded Ben Depression arc is...

1929
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,360
Next week it'll be over.

1930
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,360
Oh, no, don't say next week because it will never be next week.

1931
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,360
No, it'll be the end of the month.

1932
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,360
End of the month it'll be over.

1933
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,360
The dramatic conclusion.

1934
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,360
Everything changes.

1935
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,360
The total status quo.

1936
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,360
Shake up.

1937
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:46,360
It's coming and...

1938
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:52,360
Unless something really terrible happens to screw up the schedule.

1939
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:54,360
Like, yeah, no, it's basically done.

1940
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,360
No, it's basically done.

1941
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:04,360
I think I'll feel a weight off my shoulders when the video is out.

1942
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,360
For sure, yeah.

1943
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:12,360
We'll see how I feel after that.

1944
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,360
Premiering...

1945
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:25,360
If you check my channel for a trailer that will announce when it's coming out,

1946
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,360
I'm expecting that I will probably release it on Saturday tomorrow,

1947
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,360
the day after this video is live.

1948
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:36,360
So if you're free tomorrow, maybe check out the premiere of my Mega Man video

1949
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,360
that I keep saying is coming.

1950
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,360
Well, one of these days it will and I think this is it.

1951
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,360
I really think we're there.

1952
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,360
I think we've arrived, so...

1953
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,360
Oh, yeah.

1954
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,360
Just fucking watch it.

1955
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,360
Fucking watch it, leave a comment.

1956
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:52,360
Puts my Patreon.

1957
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:55,360
And push the procrastinatorspatron.com

1958
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,360
and also the procrastinators.

1959
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:00,360
And of course, pledge the procrastinators Patreon.

1960
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,360
We should do another bonus episode.

1961
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:03,360
Yeah, what about...

1962
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,360
Hey, you know what was fun?

1963
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:05,360
Hey, I don't know.

1964
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,360
You know what was fun?

1965
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,360
Streaming this week.

1966
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,360
Streaming was pretty good.

1967
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:09,360
Yeah.

1968
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,360
That was nice.

1969
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,360
Had a good time.

1970
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,360
We should...

1971
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,360
Oh, we didn't even talk about that.

1972
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,360
I guess there's not that much to say,

1973
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:21,360
but yeah, we did stream for the first time in like two or three months, I think.

1974
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,360
Yeah.

1975
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:27,360
It had a little bit of an internet hiccup with like weird settings that...

1976
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,360
But like it was quite stable other than that.

1977
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:31,360
My...

1978
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,360
You know, my internet.

1979
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:39,360
Well, supposedly someone came and looked at my internet yesterday.

1980
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:45,360
So, I mean, I guess we'll see going forward if my connection is better and more stable

1981
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,360
and it's not as...

1982
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:49,360
And it will stop fucking up.

1983
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:54,360
I can't say with certainty right now, but maybe.

1984
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:58,360
Anyway, we should stream more because it was fun.

1985
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,360
Had a good time.

1986
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,360
Make a main video.

1987
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,360
Anything else?

1988
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,360
I don't know.

1989
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,360
A big girl squish.

1990
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,360
Okay.

1991
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,360
Twitter.com.

1992
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,360
Yeah.

1993
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,360
Based.

1994
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,360
Based.

1995
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,360
Based.

1996
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:15,360
Based.

1997
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:18,360
Okay, I guess that's the end of the episode.

1998
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,360
Do we even make it two hours?

1999
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,360
We're not even at two hours?

2000
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,360
You know what?

2001
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,360
It's the good old days.

2002
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,360
It's the good old days of the PCP.

2003
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,360
One hour episodes.

2004
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:30,360
One hour 54 minutes is equatable to one hour.

2005
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,360
It rounds down.

2006
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,360
Yeah, it rounds down.

2007
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,360
All right, that's it.

2008
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,360
Short episode, but I hope you enjoyed it.

2009
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:42,360
I won't belabor the point any longer.

2010
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,360
See you next week.

2011
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,360
See ya, everybody.

2012
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,360
Peace out, goodbye.

2013
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,360
Goodbye.
