1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
It's The Pro Crastinators Podcast starting. It's starting. It's me and Tom. It's Ben Saint

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,280
and Tom Oliver.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
Yo!

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,280
The boys!

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
We're here. We're back.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,680
The boys are back in town.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
Never forget.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
The boys are back in town.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,840
Never forget who didn't leave you hanging in these trying times.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,000
These trying times. I feel so sad in these trying times, Tom.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Dude, I feel like-

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I feel like he's trying Tom's because you're trying my patience right now.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You know, that's fair. That's fair. I have that effect on people.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Shape up.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Shape up.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll do my best.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we're back. We're back for another week of whatever this is. What do we want to touch

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
on?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We want to talk about-

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We have a full docket of exciting high energy topics to talk about this week. I'm sure.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just bursting at the seams with adrenaline-powered discussion.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do we want to comment on the ongoing frustration in the comment section?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Maybe we should. Maybe we should say something definitive, if not descriptive, if that makes

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
any sense.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Right. I kind of don't want to. I feel like we already did this, but-

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The comments were particularly-

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There was a lot of jokes. There were a lot of joke comments last week that I appreciated.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Indeed, indeed.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But people continue. It's like people continue to want to know why isn't Nate and Digi and

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
whoever else on the podcast.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's strange because there really is no further answer. There's no mystery about it. The answer

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is- Ask yourself, why is X not on the podcast? Why is it on the PCP? And no matter who it

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is, the answer is because they don't feel like it.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It really is.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's it.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There's a lot of conspiracy theories starting to pop up in the comments.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, what could have happened?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This huge thawing out.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ben and Nate are brothers, right? So they can just text each other if there's something

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
wrong, but they're clearly-

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why don't-

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They must have had a falling out. They must hate each other. They must be ready to shoot

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
each other in the face.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why don't they know? Why won't they talk about it? Why won't they just answer the question?

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's the mystery? What are they hiding? I don't know.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not that exciting, unfortunately.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's really not.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We don't have any high-energy gossip that we're hiding behind our lethargic facade of this

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
podcast. It's just not true.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know how to explain any more simply than that.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a beyond whenever you want show, and if someone's not showing up, it's just because

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
they don't feel like it, and that's it.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I mean, Nate just said he doesn't feel like being on the show right now, and that's all

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we know.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He did.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's all that really needs to be said. There's no feud.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He's still, because Nate does all the finance stuff.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He runs the pay calculations and everything.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, he's still doing the spreadsheet stuff to calculate pay and whatever.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He just messaged us yesterday talking about how we need to get some stuff in for the

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
diss track. He's still working on the diss track and the music video and everything.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There's not a schism.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nate is still around. He's still talking to us.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We are still working on all the Radcon content that is still in the other.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I had actually wondered about, there's some Radcon stuff that I know the status of, and

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
there's other stuff that I didn't know the status of.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was wondering about what Nate mentioned yesterday to Hippo asked about it a while

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
back.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Should we say the diss track?

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is that a spoiler to say, or do people know about that?

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do I care at this point?

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I feel like it's been so long since Radcon that the joke is kind of old now and that

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
when all this comes out, it's going to be like, okay, that's cool.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This has been dealt with.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You know, it'll just be for the real OG fans.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's true.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you're an OG, PCP head, I feel like it's going to be evergreen.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you're not, then our Radcon in-jokes probably wouldn't have landed with you no matter when

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
they came out.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's going to take so long.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We're going to get to the point where we finally drop it and we're going to get a bunch of

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
comments complaining.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's all this high energy content coming out?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I thought the Procrastor's podcast was a relaxing chill vibes, no fucking drama shit.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're going to shed our whole audience and then, yeah, if more people start being on,

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
people will be like, why is every episode such a clusterfuck?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is not the PCP that I remember.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I started listening to the PCP around the same time I got my first gaming console, the

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
PS5, and I don't understand what this means.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Dude, that's something we could talk about, the fucking PS5 and the new Xbox and all that

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
shit and how all that's being announced and the new graphics cards.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gaming's getting so much more complicated, guys.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's expensive.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They're upselling us.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Games are $70 a pop now, confirmed.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have only, I don't keep up with it because I don't ever intend to purchase a console

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
again, but I have been seeing a lot of shit about the $70 price tag.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It is a nightmare.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And some shit about the PS5 will come with a version that does not accept physical discs

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
or something like that.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's $400 for the digital version.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And if you want to pay $100 extra, you too can get an optical drive that was advanced

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
technology 15 years ago.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh boy.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's almost like they're trying to kill the used games market so they can have everyone

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
buy only digital and reap all the sick 30% cut they get for every digital purchase through

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
their storefront.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What?

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What?

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What?

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Weaponize and capitalism against the pro terriot?

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What?

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wait a minute, Tom.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you telling me that the AAA gaming industry is engaging in anti-consumer practices?

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do I have a name for you?

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Check out.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You should watch some guy named Jim Sterling.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He'll set you straight.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And pop into him every once in a while and watch his latest few videos and go, yep, gaming

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
still looks like shit.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I haven't watched any of his videos in like half a year because YouTube just stopped recommending

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
them to me and I unsubscribed from like every channel that wasn't like a blender tutorial.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So now like all my old subscriptions and like recommendations are just gone now.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's very strange.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, I had watched him before and I watched him again recently and it's-

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's still the same thing.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Nothing's changed.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The more things change, well, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now there's a new kick about how like Ubisoft is not only, you know, terribly anti-consumer

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and a bad company and evil.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's also like stacked with like, you know, sexual abusers and people that covered for

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
them.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I guess to Jim, this is a problem or whatever.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's made this a big deal or something.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
God.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's the new, that's the new, the new goss from over there.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In case you didn't want to go and catch up yourself.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Are you telling me video games are not made for the love of making interactive entertainment?

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you telling me the single biggest entertainment industry on the planet does not come from a

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
place of passion?

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Say it ain't so.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, it does.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The groundlings, the groundlings doing the labor probably do love games.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, absolutely.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But Bobby Kotick doesn't like video- Bobby Kotick's not a gamer.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How?

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is why these fucking commies don't understand, as they tweet from their iPhones that capitalism

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
made, by the way.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You know, the capitalism's bad.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't they understand that if we didn't have monopolies or conglomerates like Ubisoft,

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
then the only people making games would be like just human beings that like them and not

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
like a multinational conglomerate that, you know, does all this bullshit.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That packages their games.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you imagine if every...

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What would we do if we didn't have Ubisoft to siphon off the surplus labor value of the

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
people who love making games for us?

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If all the video games that came out were just shitty fucking indie titles like Undertale,

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
imagine a games market where everything was like Undertale instead of like a bloated microtransaction

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
infused nightmare.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't remember, I don't remember ducking behind cover to regenerate health in between

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
rounds of firing my gun.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ben, Ben, you don't fire a single gun in Undertale.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What a failure of a video game.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You can't even play with your friends.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can't even put...

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What is the point if I'm not playing a virtualized sport, playing the same three maps over and

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
over again in 20 minute chunks while I'm throwing money at skins?

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What's the point?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like you just read.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like half of what you do in Undertale is just read words.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Cringe, bro.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Cringe.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What does that mean?

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't buy a $600 PlayStation to read books, you fucking idiot.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Toby Fox, what a hack.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, okay.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No, no.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Video games, bad.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is Among Us an indie?

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Among Us looks indie.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's gotta be indie.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It looks so indie.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AAA developers, they don't make 2D games anymore.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That doesn't sell to fucking normies.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I'm gonna pick up Among Us and give it a try.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It looks titillating.

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It looks like a lot of fun.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I like the idea of a game where you lie and betray your comrades.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Among Us is $5.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There is no way this is not an indie game.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Really?

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, wow.

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's pretty good.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's cool.

206
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
All right.

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's probably gonna be $5 well spent.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I could play that for like an hour and it would be $5 well spent.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So that's pretty good.

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Speaking of, oh man, speaking of a deal, of a deal and a half, do you want to know about,

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
do you want to know about my gummy shit?

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Please tell me more.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I saw your tweet and I demand clarification.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, so let's...

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Right.

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, to briefly recap, the ingredient that I use, isomaltoligosaccharides, a fiber derived

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ingredient from tapioca is...

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They don't seem...

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't find it on Amazon anymore.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So, I went to Alibaba, the place that I was looking...

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That I'm getting the pins made and stuff for the RFCK Kickstarter.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And I looked there and lo and behold, yeah, they have it there.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's actually a whole bunch of distributors that sell isomaltoligosaccharides.

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It turns out that it's actually like mostly made in like China and Japan and around...

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
In the East or whatever.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, yeah, and it's a one kilogram bag that I bought from Amazon cost me like $12.

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A kilogram over there from a lot of these places costs like $150 to $2.

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So, amazing, right?

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What a deal.

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The only catch though, is that these are like industrial suppliers and I mean, I'm still

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
looking but it seems like a lot of them have a minimum order on the order of maybe like

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
100 kilograms, which is like 220 pounds.

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But I bought like 20 pounds of the stuff, about 10 kilograms on Amazon before and that

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
cost me like $200 because it costs so much more per pound.

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, if I buy 200 pounds of it from Alibaba, it'll still cost me only maybe like two or

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
300.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're up by a factor of 10.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It won't even cost that much more.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're getting 10 times more for your money.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, and I'll have it forever.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll have it forever.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So, I don't know.

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm thinking I might do it even if I have...

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean, I might find someone who will sell me less.

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I would ideally only like to buy maybe like 10 or 20, like maybe 10 kilograms, 20 kilograms

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
tops, but if I have to buy 100, I mean, I'll probably do it and I'm really hoping that

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it shows up in like a big like barrel or oil drum or something and I just like keep it

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
outside because it doesn't fit my house.

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can imagine the joy the mailman will feel rolling a giant oil drum covered in Chinese

252
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
text in the middle of a pandemic over to Ben's house.

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I made a batch with an alternate form and a fructo-ligosaccharide and it's bad.

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It not only has a weird taste to it, but it gives me gas and I hate it.

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know.

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's like bad for you or something.

257
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's like not...

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's edible, but it's like, no, don't do it.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I was thinking...

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was thinking about RFCK gummies again and I was thinking about how I would make them

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and I was looking at Amazon because I'm like, oh, I ordered a big block.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I ordered like a full kilogram of sheet gelatin and like a kilogram of sheet gelatin is like

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
a lot because a little bit of sheet gelatin goes a long way because it's highly concentrated.

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I spent $60 on a full kilogram of sheet gelatin because sheet gelatin is superior

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in every way to the powdered.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I'm going to get that.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I got that and now I'm going to have all this.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm going to have all this IMO, isomaltoligosaccharide and I'm like, well, I'm going to have to

269
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
do something with all this.

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So I was thinking about RFCK gummies and I was thinking about how I would make them and

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I thought it would be actually kind of easy because RFCK has fruits.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Do you know about crops?

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Do you know about RFCK crops?

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know anything about RFCK.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
RFCK exists.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, juvies can farm all these crops and there are a whole bunch of them.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There are blood cabbages, a purple killer flower is a popular one, pink rowdishes,

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
suganma nuts, razor nuts, joy beans, bright shade.

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm going to forget.

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Pulp gourds, paw paws, an American classic.

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So there's all these fruits that they have over there.

282
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What are the functional differences between them gameplay wise?

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can mill them and milling them gets you different things.

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You get different colored dies from milling them and I think other things too.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm not exactly sure what each one gives.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But yeah, you mill them at the mill to get stuff.

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I'm thinking, hey, oh, and dire apples.

288
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You can't forget about dire apples.

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I'm thinking, okay, all I would need to do is buy fruit shapes and then just color them differently, flavor them differently.

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So I could just have a blue apple and make a dire apple.

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Easy.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
All I could do, oh, black limes.

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I could just have a lime-flavored gummy, a lime-shaped gummy, diet black.

294
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Make it lime flavor.

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Sell it.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Bam.

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I could sell them in bags of a pound to the incredibly small market that I'm sure would be in.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But there would be a small but incredibly dedicated market that would probably be all over it.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You got the whole following thing on lock.

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You really should be quintuple dipping into that.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's what I'd be doing.

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So I was looking on Amazon for fruit-shaped gummy molds and they're all crap.

303
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They're all terrible.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They all have pineapples and I don't want pineapples.

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I want a pear shape.

306
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I want an apple shape.

307
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A generic berry would be fine.

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A citrus.

309
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was simple.

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Simple, but they're very limited.

311
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There's very limited things on Amazon.

312
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Maybe I should check eBay.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I could expand my search on eBay.

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You got to go back to Alibaba.

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Or even Alibaba.

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Or yeah, or even Alibaba, which has proven to be a better source of literally everything that I have checked it for.

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
People are sleeping on Alibaba.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Seriously.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I use AliExpress and Banggood all the time.

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I use Banggood just because it has a hilarious name.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And I love shopping on there.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Is AliExpress related to Alibaba?

323
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was going to ask you if you know, because I'm not sure.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I've never dug deep, but I would assume they have to be some sort of related thing, right?

325
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
One could just be a knockoff of the other.

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I mean, it's China, so it's very possible.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They have no protection for those things.

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
All I know is they're both pretty good.

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Wait, sorry.

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Some idiot said something wrong on Twitter and I have to kill them.

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, no.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Live.

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Live.

334
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We're watching it happen live, everyone.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Or I am.

337
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You guys are listening to this a week after it happened.

338
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Some fucking moron just deliberately misinterpreting something incredibly clear that I said.

340
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So Twitter is usual.

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What else is there?

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's just Twitter and Twitter.

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're not used to it by now?

344
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It doesn't just bounce off you?

345
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It doesn't.

346
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No.

347
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I am used to it, but it doesn't bounce off me.

348
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I still get mad.

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I see your problem.

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So, yeah.

351
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So that's the gummy update.

352
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to know immediately when the 200 pound oil drum shows up at your house.

353
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Honestly, honestly, I hope.

354
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I kind of hope that I do end up just buying 100 pounds because like fuck it, you know,

355
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that'll keep me in gummies for years.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The memes alone will make it worth it.

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm going to make them for years.

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm not going to give up and stop making them.

359
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've put in all this work.

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not just going to stop.

361
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's true.

362
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's not even a waste.

363
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will literally use all 100 kilograms of it.

364
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Lamal.

365
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Some of them have a minimum order of a metric ton.

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What the fuck?

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, presumably you would sell it to a factory or something.

368
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean, I guess.

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
An industrial manufacturer.

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's not for plebs like me, but I want to get in on the market.

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You say that now, but once it becomes a burgeoning business.

372
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, a year.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, a year.

374
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
All of a sudden a metric ton.

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's just like, that's my minimum order to you.

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You know, business is booming.

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's, you know, speaking of buying in bulk, I've been fulfilling the vapor's orders.

378
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have sent out basically all of the ones that don't involve like a, a sketch or a signature.

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm putting in like pretty, like I'm putting a lot of detail into the reward drawings.

380
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Like I'm coloring them and everything.

381
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So it's taken me a while, but hopefully it's worth it.

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But I'm actually getting pretty close to being out of copies of chapter one.

383
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Because I had lots of leftovers from book one from the first Kickstarter.

384
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So the idea was that I would just sell them again during this Kickstarter, which I did.

385
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And I don't think I'm quite going to run out.

386
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But I think if like everyone who ordered, but has not like signed up, put their information into their reward survey.

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think if everyone did that, I would in fact run out and have to order like another shipment of it.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then it's like, ooh, well, would I order another 500 because there's a price break or would that be wasteful?

389
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe I should just get like 100 or something.

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I guess it depends on how many you need.

391
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you need like four, I would just say just go down to Kinko's and get four made.

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah.

393
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah.

394
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You know what?

395
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If it's like, if I was going to do another like mass Kickstarter or something, then maybe I would order another few hundred.

396
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But like, no, in this case, it would probably be like 20 or 30 that I would need extra tops.

397
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So yeah, okay.

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's actually, that's what I should do.

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Problem solved.

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Glad I could help.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Thank you.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Thank you very much.

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Gummies, gummies and vapors, and vapors too.

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's what I've been up to.

406
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So like, hold like last two months of your life.

407
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you pretty hardcore?

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah.

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah.

410
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.

411
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay.

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I got to mention one more thing.

413
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's got me very excited.

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's another RFCK thing, but we had the War on Quickville contest, you know.

415
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In Retribution for the Bicarbonate Rain, you know, we had to go after, after, you know,

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the Slime version of Lock-a-Com moved from the Beta Prime Timeline to the Alpha Timeline,

418
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and Slime was restored to Dimension C197.

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You know, obviously there was nothing left to do but go to war.

420
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So we did.

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And me and Gib judged it.

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And boy, oh, fucking boy.

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It was like, like right until before the judging, there were like no, there were like less than

424
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
10 entries.

425
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There were like so few entries and they were mostly small.

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
There was like an image or like, you know, like one, like written a text story or whatever.

427
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I was like, oh God, nobody's entering this one.

428
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is like, this is a complete bust.

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But then like an hour before the contest judging, like 30 people just like bombarded it with

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
entries.

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And we had possible, I would say possibly some of the most, some of the most legendary entries

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
that I've heard.

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Some of the most, some of the funniest ones.

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We had like this, this song, Oreo Sama made this, he wrote this song.

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It was called Blood.

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Was it Pissed Blood and Shit?

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Fuck, I might be mixing around the order.

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But we were fucking, we were fucking, or we are split, where our sides were split.

439
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:37,000
RoboDobo wrote this, this like really long story about Paradox Crocs and Sonic the Hedgehog.

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Sonic the Hedgehog and Crocs both want to be the one to defeat Christine.

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So they have to fight one another in order to, you know, the winner gets to go on and do that.

442
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And I don't know.

443
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm not going to explain it because it wouldn't be funny if I just told you like what happened.

444
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But oh my goodness.

445
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh my goodness gracious.

446
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I could not, could not breathe.

447
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Was that the winner of the contest?

448
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was a winner.

449
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There were multiple winners.

450
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Both of those were.

451
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We named six different winners.

452
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Because we were very, very generous.

453
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I just want to, I don't know.

454
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
RFCK, thanks for, this goes out to all you kids out there.

455
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Thanks for, thanks for making that a real fucking banger of an event, I guess.

456
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It was, it was truly epic.

457
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Fantastic.

458
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Very, very good.

459
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Very good.

460
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

461
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay.

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So that's been my week.

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
How's your week been?

464
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's been interesting.

465
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I mean, I went to a hotel for like four days from like Sunday to Thursday.

466
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Because I was just like.

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why?

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Because I've been trapped in this house doing nothing because, you know, back pain slash COVID.

469
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I was like, I can't stand it.

470
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I need to change a scenery.

471
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is driving me nuts.

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm just going to go to a hotel.

473
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Really?

474
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Just, just to get out.

475
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You just, you just booked a hotel just because.

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Just because.

477
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Just because I felt like it.

478
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I was like, I just need to break.

479
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I need, I need to change a scenery.

480
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm whatever.

481
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll not do any work.

482
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'll stop working.

483
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll just like chill and do nothing, whatever.

484
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And so I did that.

485
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And I just went to a hotel for a little bit and it was kind of gay.

486
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I was, I was hoping it would be like a change of scenery and like stop working.

487
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Would allow me to like recharge my batteries and kind of like recenter myself and like,

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
all right, this is like what I'm going to do.

489
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Just kind of like lame.

490
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Just kind of sucked.

491
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Just kind of dumb.

492
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I guess it's cause like the only time I go to hotels is like go to conventions and hang

493
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
out with people.

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And so I had like meant to leave and like hotels are like, cool.

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But when you there by yourself, it's just the worst.

496
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's just crap and dour.

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And it's cause of COVID, like they didn't even have free breakfast, which is like half

498
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the reason to go to a hotel is to get free breakfast.

499
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They didn't even have that stinks.

500
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The best thing is they had a fucking vending machine that had like ice cream bars, like

501
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
go get ice cream whenever I wanted with no effort.

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And that was pretty cool.

503
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But other than that, it was like a dollar.

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The dollar's fine.

505
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I can handle a dollar.

506
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No, I mean, I mean the hotel.

507
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
No, the prices are pretty low.

508
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It was like to stay there for like five days.

509
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I think it was like $330 or something.

510
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's not a huge deal.

511
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's, I mean, that's more, that's more than I would spend.

512
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's more than anyone should spend.

513
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You must have, you must have been, you must have really wanted to get out of it.

514
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It was, it was very bad.

515
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The desire to leave was very strong.

516
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It was a very, not a premeditated decision.

517
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was just like, fuck it, gone, done, by, and I left.

518
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So that was cool.

519
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But, um, yeah, not, not great, not super fun, but I just kind of like,

520
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
dick around and just like, okay, I'm here.

521
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, did you just dick around like on the hotel grounds

522
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
for like three days or how many days?

523
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This is like four nights or something like that.

524
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I just kind of was just like watching TV or just going around,

525
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
like going around the town because like I went like one town over

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and just kind of like doing stuff around there.

527
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Do you, do you want to say what the town was or is that?

528
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It doesn't matter.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's the, it's the middle of nowhere in Massachusetts.

530
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They're all kind of blend together once you get outside of Boston.

531
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's all the same thing.

532
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Um, yeah, sure, sure, sure.

533
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But yeah, so it's just doing that.

534
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And then on the last day, I like hurt my back again.

535
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Uh, so I came home and then I was in bed for two days and I just

536
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
watched more cartoons and it was great.

537
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I watched like all of the Owl House, which I've been meaning to watch.

538
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That was really cool.

539
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I watched all of season one of Amphibia.

540
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That was really cool.

541
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I watched all of Infinity Train, which is amazing.

542
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I saw you tweeting about Infinity Train.

543
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's so good.

544
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's, it's, it doesn't, it doesn't look good.

545
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't want to watch it.

546
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The art style is not good.

547
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And that's the reason I didn't watch it, uh, back before.

548
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Cause it's like, oh, this looks ugly as sin.

549
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then my sister, what I object to about it is just that it looks

550
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
like every other fucking cartoon these days.

551
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's like, it just, yeah.

552
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It looks like a worse version of every cartoon out these days.

553
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's just like a very generic art style.

554
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And so I was not invested in it at all, but the story is really cool.

555
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And the way it's told is, it's like, did you watch over the garden

556
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
wall from like five years ago?

557
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I watched it, um, like a couple of years after it came out,

558
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
but I did eventually watch it.

559
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

560
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Infinity Train reminds me of overgarden the wall in terms of tone.

561
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The story and everything is nothing like it, but like in terms of

562
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
just like being kind of like vague and like not really understood,

563
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
not knowing exactly what's going on and not being sure what's

564
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
going to happen next.

565
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Infinity Train does that as well.

566
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The story.

567
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Is it, is it an ongoing series?

568
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It is ongoing.

569
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Um, but the cool thing about Infinity Train is that each season

570
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is its own story.

571
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So, and then the next season, there's a new protagonist.

572
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Uh, that's one of the, one of the.

573
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
One of the minor characters from the previous season.

574
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So every season you're like, hmm, I wonder which random person

575
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
that only showed up for like a small segment is going to have

576
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
an entire, their own story next season.

577
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's a really interesting concept.

578
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
How many seasons are there three so far?

579
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And the reason why I want to bring up Infinity Train specifically

580
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
is it's going to get canceled because everything is bad.

581
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Uh, the guy who makes the show is like, yeah, I had eight seasons

582
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
planned because like eight is like an infinity symbol.

583
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Haha.

584
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm clever.

585
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But he had like, he had like eight seasons he wants to do.

586
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And like there's like, he's building to something bigger.

587
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I guess there's like an underpinning thing that they've been working

588
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
towards.

589
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And, uh, HBO is just like, this show is like too complicated

590
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
for children, even though we're fucking HBO.

591
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Uh, no, we don't want to make this anymore.

592
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And so like they haven't been renewed for season four,

593
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
which really sucks.

594
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Why did they make it in the first place?

595
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't know because like that's the dumb thing is because the

596
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
first two seasons were on Karch Network, then HBO bought it to

597
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
put on HBO Max and they're like, actually, we were wrong.

598
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
This is dumb.

599
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And now they're trying to get rid of it.

600
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm like, you fools, you Neanderthals.

601
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Cause like the third season was the first one on HBO.

602
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And so they're like, oh, we don't have to make it just for

603
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
children.

604
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And it got like way darker and cooler and like could do more

605
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
things.

606
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Uh, and then they're just like, what if we didn't do these

607
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
anymore?

608
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm like, oh, you fucking, you rubes, you morons.

609
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Uh, it makes me really mad because it's so fucking cool.

610
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's so good.

611
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Uh, like the concept is that like huge, like random people just

612
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
end up on this train that goes on for infinity.

613
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
There's like a million different cars that like go forever.

614
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And you get like a number on your hand and that number represents

615
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
like, uh, how bad whatever fucking problem in your life you

616
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
need to deal with this.

617
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And you're just trapped on this train until you can figure out

618
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
how to deal with your shit.

619
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And once that number goes down to zero, you get off the train.

620
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Uh, and each character has their own things they're dealing

621
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
with.

622
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And like these cars are just like randomly generated by a

623
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
machine algorithm to like, uh, help them like deal with their

624
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
shit.

625
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And it's really fucking cool.

626
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And it's, it's just like really mysterious on how everything

627
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
works.

628
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And, uh, it's great.

629
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And it's a 10 out of 10.

630
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I recommend it super highly.

631
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Watch infinity train.

632
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The episodes are short.

633
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The season is short.

634
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
There are 11 minute episodes.

635
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And that was going to be my next question is how long is the

636
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
season?

637
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
How long is an episode?

638
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's like, it's like 10 episodes a season, 11 minutes a pop.

639
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's like watching a short little movie.

640
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You're in and out and done.

641
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Not even.

642
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's good.

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's not even that bad.

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay.

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's super good.

646
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I think it might maybe give it a little, a little look.

647
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The first season's first season's like at eight.

648
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The second season is like a 10 and the third season's like

649
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
another 10 or a nine.

650
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They're, they're really good.

651
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Um, okay.

652
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

653
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I see.

654
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I see.

655
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Definitely, definitely recommend that.

656
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then our house and amphibia are both really good too, but

657
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
they're much more, I don't want to say generic, but like they're

658
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
basically just following the gravity follows formula.

659
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Like if you've seen gravity follows, you've seen amphibia and

660
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
owl house.

661
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
They're the exact same thing.

662
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's, it's like hygiene.

663
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So the comedy's written like exactly the same way.

664
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's like, wait, wait.

665
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You're comparing.

666
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Wait, what is the same thing as what amphibia?

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What is amphibia?

668
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Amphibia.

669
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't know what that is.

670
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Amphibia is like a show where this like girl gets isochided to

671
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
a world of like amphibians, like a fantasy kind of world with

672
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
like, like frogs and toads and newts and stuff.

673
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And, uh, that came out last year.

674
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then owl house is where, uh, a girl see owl house is about

675
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that like, no, I'm thinking of loud house.

676
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Sorry.

677
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No, I don't know anything about owl house.

678
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah.

679
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Owl house is about a girl who gets isochided to a world of

680
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
like sorcery and shit.

681
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And they're basically the exact same kind of premise.

682
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
They have the exact same kind of comedy as gravity falls and

683
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
they follow the same sort of structure.

684
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I, I just hate how fucking cartoons look these days.

685
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't know.

686
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I hate, I just looked up amphibia.

687
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, look, it looks the same.

688
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going to, I'm going to look up owl house.

689
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think owl house.

690
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Is it going to look the same?

691
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It looks a bit better.

692
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I think owl house is probably the best looking one out of all

693
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the ones I've been talking about so far.

694
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, it's, it's close enough.

695
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't like it.

696
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I like, I like owl house.

697
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I mean, aesthetically, they all look very similar, but like the,

698
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I guess the good thing about be having like a simplistic art

699
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
style is they're all animated pretty well.

700
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Like the animation is really smooth and stuff.

701
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's not that I don't understand why they look like this.

702
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I understand the advantages.

703
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I just, I mean, I'm with you.

704
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I made a whole video complaining about how like modern cartoons,

705
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
they're like very stylized, but they all use the same kind of

706
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
stylization where like when you become that like, uh, uh,

707
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
yeah, vague and like not representational, you have so much

708
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
more room to play with shape and stuff.

709
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And most of these cartoons don't.

710
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And it's sad.

711
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah.

712
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Cause like the, the what, like the American cartoon industry is

713
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
very like, uh, nepotism.

714
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't know if that's the right word, but like it's basically

715
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
like, like Alex Hirsch is the voice of like one of the main

716
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
characters on the owl house because like, I think he,

717
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
like someone who worked on gravity falls is now the lead of

718
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
that show.

719
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And then he was working on another show before we got gravity

720
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
falls.

721
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's like, they're all just kind of giving their friends shows

722
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and like that's how all these things get made.

723
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So they're all pulling from the same continual pool of talent,

724
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
uh, which is like, that's why they're all, they all feel the

725
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
same.

726
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Like all these shows are written exactly the same way.

727
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Like gravity falls has like, you know, these like.

728
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Just.

729
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It starts with like a lot of like one off kind of character

730
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
things, but then you have this older mentor character who has

731
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
like a dark secret and like more complicated past.

732
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And as a story goes, it gets more complicated and the owl

733
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
house and amphibia both do exactly the same thing.

734
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And it's just like, these are good characters and they're good

735
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
stories.

736
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I recommend the both.

737
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I mean, to an extent there's the like, you know, there are only

738
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
like seven different stories you can tell.

739
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
But when like Disney puts out three of the shows.

740
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's the same people.

741
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Within five years and they all follow the exact same beats to

742
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
a T.

743
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's just like hot pop from amphibia.

744
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
He like knows what's really going on with Anne and like where

745
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
she came from and she, he's like keeping it a secret and

746
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
they're slowly.

747
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Hinting at it.

748
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's like, oh, so just like fucking grunkle stand.

749
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And then it's like an owl house.

750
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's like, Eda, the old witch, she has like this dark past and

751
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
knows more about the shit than she's letting on.

752
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And the story is getting more complex as it goes on.

753
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm like, oh, so just like grunkle stand.

754
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's like the exact same thing.

755
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm like, like this is fine.

756
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Like it's good.

757
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And like I'm, I'm, I'm able to turn off my brain and enjoy these

758
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
shows and have a good time and they are fun.

759
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But at the same time, I am just watching two more versions of

760
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Gravity Falls again.

761
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And like, I get it.

762
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm fine with that.

763
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But at the same time, come on, mix it up a little bit.

764
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Mm hmm.

765
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Um, but Infinity Train is its own thing and it's fucking based.

766
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's why they're going to cancel it.

767
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And these other shows are going to keep going until they're done

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
because that's.

769
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Is it confirmed?

770
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Are they definitely canceling it?

771
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's not confirmed, but they haven't been renewed yet.

772
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And a bunch of the staff has been moved to other projects.

773
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So like it's all but confirmed.

774
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh God, they'll have to fucking Indiegogo it or whatever.

775
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Or they'll just get like someone to keep, keep it going as a comic

776
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
something as a lot of these shows do.

777
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh yeah.

778
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Sure.

779
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah.

780
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah.

781
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
There's always that.

782
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
There's always the, uh, the incredibly lucrative comics market

783
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
you could break into.

784
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Hey, you know what I'm saying?

785
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

786
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
They can, they can join me.

787
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They can join me in the clouds.

788
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Indeed.

789
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Get that, get those kick starters going.

790
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's, that's where the real money is.

791
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Um, oh fuck.

792
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That reminded me of something.

793
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Fuck.

794
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh no, it's gone.

795
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh no.

796
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That was like.

797
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I was, uh, oh.

798
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Gotta take note spend.

799
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You gotta be ready to go.

800
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I should have written it down.

801
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh no.

802
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Wait, what, what, what were they doing?

803
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What was I doing this, this week?

804
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
There was some show.

805
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Oh.

806
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh, I remember.

807
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I watched another.

808
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Cause you know, I watched them, um, the, uh, who's afraid of Virginia Wolf.

809
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes.

810
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Two weeks ago, I think.

811
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I asked on Twitter for recommendations for, um, another other movies like that

812
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that are just about people talking.

813
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And, uh, there, I got a lot.

814
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I got a lot of recommendations actually.

815
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And, uh, I picked one.

816
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I picked one at random and I watched it.

817
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And I feel this, someone, someone said like, I love this.

818
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I love the genre of movies about people talking.

819
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's a good, uh, and then they listed some of their favorites and I picked one and I

820
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
watched it and I feel bad because I didn't like it.

821
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh fuck.

822
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I hate to call this person out and say, Hey, your favorite.

823
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It sucks.

824
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But, uh, I'm.

825
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You gotta do it anyway.

826
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm going to do it anyway.

827
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This was a, this retro PK recommended cat on a hot tin roof and guess who's coming to

828
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
dinner.

829
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And I had not seen either of them and I watched guess who's coming to dinner, which is about

830
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
a, um, uh, it is, uh, about a, a, uh, a girl, uh, uh, visit her parents, uh, and is like,

831
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm getting married, but uh-oh, she's getting married to a black guy.

832
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What the fuck are we going to do about this?

833
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Parents cope with this shit or will they have a fucking problem?

834
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Uh, uh, and it wasn't, I mean, I wouldn't say the whole thing was, I didn't hate all of

835
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
it.

836
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There was a lot of like pretty good dialogue throughout a lot of the movie.

837
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Um, there's a lot of like, you know, there's, there's pretty good, there's some intrigue,

838
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
like, you know, the, the, the guy, he's like, he talks to the dad and he's like, they, they,

839
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
they, they make all these ultimatums.

840
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
He's like, listen, I want the daughter's like, I'm getting married to this guy.

841
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
No matter what you say, I just wanted to, you know, introduce you before and we're going

842
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
off to get married, like, you know, in a week from now and then later and then privately,

843
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the guy is like, hey, listen, you're her dad.

844
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Well, I'm going to tell you, even though she wants to get married, no matter what you say,

845
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I will not marry her unless you say it's okay because I don't want, you know, problems in

846
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
my life.

847
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It'll be too complicated.

848
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And then like later on, they're like, and the dad's like, oh, well, I just need some

849
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
time to get figured out by this.

850
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

851
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, maybe in a, before the week is up, I can, I can come to terms with it, but then

852
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
they're like, oh no, the timetables moved up.

853
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Now we're going tonight.

854
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Dad, you better, you better give your blessing tonight or the wedding's off.

855
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's like, ah, fuck, you know, and that's, it's fine.

856
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That's all fine and all.

857
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's good.

858
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And, and also racism's bad.

859
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So I, I agree with the general thrust of the movie, but I was deeply, deeply annoyed at

860
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the way that basically the main character of the movie is the racist dad.

861
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And like the movie is very sympathetic to this old racist white guy who's having like

862
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
a real big problem with the fact that he's always marrying a black man.

863
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's very sympathetic.

864
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's very, which is, it's not the worst thing in the world.

865
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like I get it.

866
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's okay.

867
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And you know, he does in the end, he just decides, you know what, I also think racism's bad,

868
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but it's really annoying because all the black characters in the movie, except for the guy,

869
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
except for the fiance, all the other, and his mom, I guess, but all the other black characters,

870
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
like the, the maid and the dad are all portrayed as like, sure, this white guy is kind of racist,

871
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but these black people, like they're really racist.

872
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Like they're the real racists.

873
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
They're like way against it and they won't even be dissuaded.

874
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And the final scene of the movie, the white guy, he stands up and he just, he delivers

875
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
like what I think is meant to be like a big like moving speech, but the moving speech

876
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
is he basically just recounts the entire plot of the movie as though I hadn't just watched

877
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
it and then like pronounces to all these characters how like he's decided that actually racism

878
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
is bad.

879
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And it's okay for my daughter, Mariah Blackman, and the, and the black dad who thinks his

880
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
son should marry a black girl just like doesn't even say anything about it, just meekly accepts

881
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
it.

882
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's the end.

883
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The white guy has said it, he's, now that he's accepted that racism is bad, the movie's

884
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
thesis is proved, and we can all sit down and have the titular dinner.

885
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Alright.

886
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I thought that was so irritating.

887
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Would you say this movie was a victim of its time?

888
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Is it?

889
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm sure it was, I'm sure it was seen as extremely progressive in its day and I guess to a degree

890
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it's good, the movie's about how racism is bad, but the way it's framed is like real,

891
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
real annoying.

892
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
There's still some vestigial racism in the characterization.

893
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, just in some of the choices, just in some of the choices that they make and how

894
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
they choose to present it and how the conflict is resolved, it's like, I don't want to sympathize

895
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
with this guy, fuck this guy.

896
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, yeah, I mean I guess I can understand that.

897
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I guess I'm assuming the point is that it's trying to show this, it's a flawed character

898
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
growing, but when you-

899
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah, no, yeah, I'm being a little hard on it, I'm being a little hard on it, I get why.

900
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I get that it's like, I mean the movie is made, I'm sure the movie was made with a mostly

901
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
white audience in mind, right?

902
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm sure.

903
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's like an old Hollywood movie and it's, you know, there's a whole, I mean there's a

904
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
whole subgenre of movies that are about how racism is bad, but they're all, they're framed

905
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
through the context of some kind of, this white guy, you know, this white protagonist,

906
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
yeah, he's kind of racist, but you know, he's got a good heart, he's a fundamentally good guy,

907
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and then he, you know, meets a black guy who's like, oh, you're not like those other black guys,

908
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
you're different, oh, that's the other thing.

909
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The way the parents are like, they come around to the guy marrying their daughter, but it's

910
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
this guy is like an insanely quality, he's like hyper over competent qualified, he's like a,

911
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
he's like this famous like, like biomedical professor or something, he's like,

912
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
he's not like a normal, they really don't decide like, oh, racism is wrong.

913
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
They decide like, okay, this like one like super qualified famous black guy, like he's

914
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
alright, they're not all bad, you know?

915
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Like that's what it takes to get them to be like, maybe it's okay for her to marry him,

916
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
sorry retro PK for sitting on your on a movie you really like, I'm sorry, sorry.

917
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't know if I don't know if they're even listening, but maybe someday.

918
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But I'm going to keep, I'm going to keep going.

919
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm going to keep watching movies about nothing happening.

920
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Man, if you want to watch a movie about nothing happening and every people just talk,

921
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
can I recommend a little movie called Colerx?

922
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't know if you ever heard of it.

923
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's a small indie film.

924
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I have, I have never actually seen clerks.

925
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
What?

926
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Wait, wait, wait.

927
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
No, yes, I have.

928
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's in black and white.

929
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

930
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah, no, I've seen clerks.

931
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You're my age.

932
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You've definitely seen clerks.

933
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Everyone, everyone 31 has seen clerks.

934
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You say that, but I feel like clerks was a little bit before our time.

935
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Like clerks was was cool.

936
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Like clerks was new when like, Gen X was like teenagers, right?

937
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Maybe.

938
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't know.

939
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Everybody, everybody I grew up with was like, clerks was so fucking cool.

940
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You got to watch clerks.

941
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So maybe it was just my social circle, but it made me feel like clerks was like a cultural

942
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
important thing of our time, our age.

943
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I think Kevin Smith was a little bit.

944
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I think Kevin Smith's heyday was like a little bit before you and me.

945
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But, but, but like it's a little enough.

946
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah, by a little enough that it bled over.

947
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I did.

948
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
My, my circle was not like, we didn't talk.

949
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Clerks was not like a thing we were super excited about, but somebody mentioned it.

950
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And I watched it at some point.

951
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's the one where the lady is like the professional like jerks off the animals for

952
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
semen or something.

953
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Like as a vet thing.

954
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's the part I remember is like the lady jerks off dogs for artificial insemination

955
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
or something.

956
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And there's the thing about snowballing.

957
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah.

958
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Am I?

959
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That's that's incorrect.

960
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah.

961
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

962
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Good stuff.

963
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Good stuff.

964
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
My girlfriend's 37 dicks in a row.

965
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That's the part I remember.

966
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Doesn't the guy, doesn't the guy like die in the bathroom?

967
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
A guy does die in the bathroom.

968
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yes.

969
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And the lady fucks him because she doesn't know he's dead because it's dark and like

970
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
rigor mortis.

971
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
She thinks.

972
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
She thinks it's.

973
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Boilers for clerks.

974
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

975
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You've never seen clerks.

976
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
They're the fucks wrong with you.

977
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You idiots.

978
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

979
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
She thinks she thinks it's Dante.

980
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The main character goes into the bathroom and fucks a dead guy because she thinks it's

981
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
her boyfriend.

982
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Right.

983
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Cause cause the dick.

984
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Cause the hard rigor mortis dick.

985
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah.

986
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah.

987
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
What a classic.

988
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
What a what a what a time to be alive.

989
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

990
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

991
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Spoilers.

992
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I never saw clerks too.

993
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I never saw clerks too.

994
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That's what I'm thinking of.

995
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Clerks too.

996
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is okay.

997
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
There's some funny.

998
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
There's some funny moments.

999
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's not as good as the first one.

1000
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
As one would expect.

1001
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's weird.

1002
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's weird that I'm like have like watched two movies.

1003
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I like never watch movies.

1004
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,000
The last movie I watched was a before like this month was um fucking um what was the new

1005
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
um Mad Max.

1006
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Fury Road.

1007
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Just Fury Road.

1008
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Which I watched in fucking like last November.

1009
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I thought you meant like when it came out and like that's like five years ago.

1010
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You haven't watched a movie in five years.

1011
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
God damn.

1012
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
No.

1013
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's not that bad.

1014
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's okay.

1015
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yeah.

1016
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah.

1017
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,400
Um I've been watching a lot of Godzilla movies because me and Jack Saber doing a podcast

1018
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,000
going through every single Godzilla movie called Squadzilla.

1019
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's pretty good.

1020
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Oh, it's pretty.

1021
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's pretty good.

1022
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's pretty cool.

1023
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's a pretty good theme for a podcast.

1024
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That'll be that's a much that's a much better theme than the.

1025
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's really weird being on a podcast with like topics to discuss.

1026
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's it's strange.

1027
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Never never done it before now, but you know it's an interesting change of pace.

1028
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You know, you know, when I when before we started the PCP, I was like the PC.

1029
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I was like if we're if we're all going to start a podcast, there should be a theme.

1030
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
We should have a theme like like for instance, you know, watching every every whatever about

1031
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Godzilla, whatever, Tokusatsu.

1032
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Wait, is Tokusatsu a different thing?

1033
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That's just like the live action special effects genre.

1034
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So yeah, Godzilla movies would fall into the Tokusatsu genre.

1035
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh, okay.

1036
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah.

1037
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Like watching every like I pushed for something like that, but I didn't have any specific

1038
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
nobody had any specific ideas, so we didn't do it.

1039
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So we decided to just do different topics.

1040
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I mean, to be fair, in most of the conversations since that initial one about topics, I have

1041
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
championed that idea along with you that like if we're going to like do something with topics,

1042
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
we would need to niche down.

1043
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's like how you make a podcast successful is like you attract an audience around something

1044
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
people are already interested in.

1045
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And yeah, which is like like that, like that was what I thought a podcast should be.

1046
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I had just I think around the around the time we were starting the PCP, I had just finished,

1047
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I had been binging the Oh, fuck, what's it called the worst idea podcast, the one where

1048
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
every every week they watch grownups to and then they record a podcast talking about grownups

1049
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
to they did like they do like a hundred episodes.

1050
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I only I only watch the first I only listen to the first one.

1051
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well, fortunately, I didn't make it all the way through season two.

1052
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The fact the fact that they can even get 50 episodes out of that is amazing.

1053
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Well, after after a while, I mean, they do they do keep noticing like weird little things.

1054
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But after a while, they start like they start talking about like the personal lives of like

1055
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
all the different like the most minor actors.

1056
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And like they start, I guess, one of like the jocks in like a party scene or whatever is

1057
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, Arnold's son.

1058
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And, you know, they come and I guess and I guess Patrick Schwarzenegger was dating like

1059
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Taylor Swift or something for a while.

1060
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And so they have this they create like a little segment, the Patty Schwartz party time where

1061
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
they like have like a week of a weekly update on like the goings on in the life of Patrick

1062
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Schwarzenegger, talk about his relationship with Taylor Swift and how that's progressing

1063
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and all that, which, you know, was great.

1064
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
But, you know, but if you want, if you don't want to have your podcast be about something

1065
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
as specific as that, that's fine.

1066
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But and and yeah, my and my thing about topics is just as I've always said is like, if the

1067
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
podcast can just be about whatever topic, then like all you got to do is just show up and

1068
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
mention whatever topic you want to talk about it and we'll talk about it.

1069
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We don't have like not you.

1070
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't I don't see the utility of like deciding ahead of the episode was like, OK, this episode

1071
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
of this podcast is going to be about some, you know, Godzilla movies and then next week

1072
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
it'll be about whatever the fuck, you know, you talk about Godzilla if you want to talk

1073
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
about I think the idea is just to corral the conversation and keep the entire episode on

1074
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
point for marketing purposes.

1075
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But I would just say go the extra mile.

1076
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
If you're going to do that for the whole podcast.

1077
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah, if you're going to do that for marketing.

1078
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, I don't think I don't know if it works that well unless you go all out with it and

1079
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
make the whole thing.

1080
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's like because nobody's going to say like, oh, have you heard about this podcast?

1081
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, they did an episode about such and such thing.

1082
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I mean, maybe.

1083
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But they're more you're more likely to just get word of mouth.

1084
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's like, oh, have you heard about this one podcast?

1085
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's all about like it's a whole podcast about us to topic that I'm interested in.

1086
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, grow about grownups to or about, you know, welcome to night.

1087
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I mean, at this point, the procrastinators podcast is a personality driven show.

1088
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And that's like the other side of the spectrum we've always been talking about in our inside

1089
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
baseball meetings is like it either needs to be about us personality wise or about a

1090
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
specific topic being in the middle is just like the worst of both worlds.

1091
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And yeah, the discussion never really grew past that point, unfortunately.

1092
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
But, you know, but, you know, I mean, I wouldn't mind being on like another like some podcast.

1093
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
If someone is saying, Tom is if someone invited me on to a podcast that was strongly themed

1094
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
around something, I'd love to be on.

1095
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But no, I'm not talking about the Godzilla one because I've literally never watched the

1096
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Godzilla podcast in my life.

1097
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But if but that sounds like something that I would be interested in if I were a fan of

1098
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the genre.

1099
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So I wish that great success.

1100
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We just we just need to.

1101
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You said you inject you inject me Jackson.

1102
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, Jackson Sabrespar because me and Jackson are big Godzilla guys and we've watched all

1103
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
the movies multiple times and Sabres only seen the new American ones.

1104
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So we're basically bringing him through the whole series and forcing him to watch all of

1105
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
them.

1106
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yeah.

1107
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah.

1108
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
The only the only one I think same the only Godzilla movie I've ever seen was like Godzilla

1109
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
2000, which I saw in theaters.

1110
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I did too.

1111
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It left no impression on me.

1112
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It gave me a giant erection because I loved it.

1113
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It was incredible.

1114
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, I really it's super cheesy and super bad and they butchered the dub horribly that

1115
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I found out years later.

1116
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But at the time I was like, oh my God, they have really bad looking CGI missiles.

1117
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah.

1118
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Godzilla 2000 in theaters was dubbed to my dude.

1119
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Wait, no, it wasn't.

1120
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It had like fucking it's not it's not even called Godzilla 2000 in Japan.

1121
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's called Godzilla Millennium.

1122
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No, didn't it have like an it had like American action stars in it, didn't it?

1123
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Or not action.

1124
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So you're talking about Godzilla 98, the fucking one that had Godzilla look like a fucking

1125
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
lizard man.

1126
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And they killed him on a bridge with six missiles and he hatched a bunch of eggs.

1127
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I need you to blow up Madison Square Garden.

1128
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And it was really set in New York and was raining all the time.

1129
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's the it was it was the worst movie of all time that left.

1130
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm talking about I'm talking about the one that had like the little guy running

1131
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
around like Godzilla 98.

1132
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
We don't talk about that movie.

1133
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It's a living nightmare.

1134
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Oh, OK.

1135
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Two thousand was a quick dub of a the first Godzilla movie that came out like after

1136
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
the the high side or hayside or hayside series ended.

1137
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And they just for some reason brought it over to America and dubbed it and ruined it horribly.

1138
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But it was still the best thing I ever saw because it was two years after that horrible

1139
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
98 American movie and it was back to form and it was cool.

1140
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And I liked it.

1141
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
What is what is the that's like the movies that came out in the 90s.

1142
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So like it started with like Godzilla Returns in 1984.

1143
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And then it went through like a bunch of like the classic old monsters redone like Godzilla

1144
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
versus Mecca Godzilla and Godzilla versus Space Godzilla and King Ghidorah and stuff.

1145
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Like they're they're like groups.

1146
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
They group the movies until like whoever is like Emperor at the time or something.

1147
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Like there's like a name for each of the show a series.

1148
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, just back in like the 60s and 70s.

1149
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So then there was the Millennium series which is started with Godzilla 2000.

1150
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And then there's like a new era now that's called like the Rewa era or something.

1151
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't know.

1152
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm not.

1153
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Is is the Emperor of Japan.

1154
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't know the shit.

1155
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I bet did you know it's animated Jason enough that she might she may know.

1156
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Maybe maybe maybe.

1157
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I guess I guess we'll have to ask who knows if only she connected corrected my

1158
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
pronunciation to Hey say I believe because I didn't know how to even pronounce it.

1159
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So she must know someone this knowledge.

1160
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Fascinating.

1161
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Wait, what's that?

1162
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
What's that?

1163
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
What's that podcast called?

1164
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That we do.

1165
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It's just called Squadzilla.

1166
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
There's some channel on YouTube.

1167
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Oh, you already said it.

1168
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
There's a channel called Squadzilla already on YouTube and they have nothing to do with

1169
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Godzilla at all.

1170
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And it's really stupid.

1171
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And like for the longest time the related video on the first episode of our podcast was

1172
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
MLB versus like some fucking like like video game or something like major like baseball

1173
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
crossover, like a chart thing.

1174
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Like this looks like the cringiest channel of all time.

1175
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
What about what about what about BLM versus Godzilla?

1176
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Like who would win, right?

1177
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Like Antifa or or or.

1178
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I mean, when you think about it, who does more property damage than Godzilla?

1179
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
He's a card carrying Antifa member.

1180
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I mean, Antifa set the whole West Coast on fire, Tom.

1181
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Godzilla.

1182
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Can Godzilla even breathe fire?

1183
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Does he have like radiation breath or something?

1184
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
He can destroy everything.

1185
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That's why that's what made Godzilla.

1186
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That's his power.

1187
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
He can destroy it.

1188
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That's what made the end of Godzilla 2000 so cool.

1189
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
They had this really cheesy dub line at the end where it's like, why does Godzilla keep

1190
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
saving us from evil monsters all the time?

1191
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And then like the main character in the movie is like me because there's a little bit of

1192
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Godzilla in all of us.

1193
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And you're like, oh God, what a crappy ending to this movie.

1194
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But but then it cuts to Godzilla.

1195
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I don't know.

1196
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
But then it cuts to Godzilla like doing this like 360 nuclear flame attack and destroying

1197
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
all of Tokyo while the theme starts right after he says that as if to say fuck you.

1198
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And it was the best ending to a movie ever.

1199
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Super cool.

1200
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
10 out of 10.

1201
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Godzilla Millennium's based.

1202
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Watch it.

1203
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Hi.

1204
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh my god.

1205
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm I'm I'm checking out squadzilla.

1206
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
You've got the you got the it's got like a nice little animated intro here.

1207
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh my god.

1208
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
This looks great.

1209
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, we have Saber Spark has a million subscribers.

1210
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
He has money.

1211
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
He has he could pay people to do things and make stuff.

1212
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh, sure.

1213
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, sure.

1214
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

1215
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I guess that's got that big YouTuber money.

1216
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Was it was this a saber saber spark venture?

1217
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It was I think it was either my or Jack's idea because we were just talking about Godzilla

1218
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
in like, you know, discord calls and stuff like we should do a podcast about this.

1219
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And here it is.

1220
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So the new episode should probably be out by the time this podcast is out.

1221
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Only episode three.

1222
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yeah.

1223
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
King Kong versus Godzilla the original 1962 or 64.

1224
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Something like that.

1225
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I think it came out.

1226
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Wow.

1227
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

1228
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Nifty.

1229
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Hey, just in time for Kong versus Godzilla remake coming out the end of this year.

1230
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Someone someone in the audience with a million subscribers.

1231
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Invite me onto a highly specifically themed podcast with a cool animated intro.

1232
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Why?

1233
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Why don't you?

1234
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Right.

1235
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
At me at me on Twitter.

1236
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I mean on Twitter.

1237
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah.

1238
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Hook me up.

1239
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Please.

1240
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Please.

1241
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
DMs are open.

1242
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yes.

1243
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Actually, they are now.

1244
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
They were not.

1245
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I had my DMs close.

1246
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah.

1247
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I don't know why I didn't like deliberately do this.

1248
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I had my DMs closed.

1249
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But someone wanted.

1250
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I guess the Pym fell out of their Vapors like envelope and I was like, okay, DM me your

1251
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
address or whatever.

1252
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So I can like, like, what's your what's your name on Kickstarter?

1253
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And so I had to open a DMs on Twitter so I could get their info.

1254
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And I was like, why did I have these?

1255
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Why did I have the DMs closed?

1256
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I had had it open only to, you know, people that I was following or mutuals or whatever.

1257
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I don't know.

1258
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I don't know why that was.

1259
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There's no reason.

1260
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
No reason for that.

1261
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Twitter has a lot of really dumb settings that are set on initially.

1262
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Like, have you ever gone to the settings and realized that like for a lot of the times

1263
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
only show high quality responses is on?

1264
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
What?

1265
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It'll like filter out certain people that it thinks are low quality or something.

1266
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh, shit.

1267
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Just not show you notifications.

1268
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
What?

1269
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
What?

1270
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Yeah.

1271
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Go to settings, notifications, and then quality filter is usually on.

1272
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Oh, my God.

1273
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
No, it's on.

1274
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Oh, no, it's on.

1275
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Isn't it dumb?

1276
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Why would you have that on by default?

1277
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I'm just like, I want to see all the responses.

1278
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't care if you think they're low quality.

1279
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Fuck you.

1280
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Don't judge people that way.

1281
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't know.

1282
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Like now I have to wonder, like whose tweets has it been filtered?

1283
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, that's the whole thing.

1284
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Whose tweets has it been filtering?

1285
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
What have I been missing?

1286
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Like how much of an asshole have you been to people who have been like trying to talk

1287
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
to you and you just never saw it because Twitter decided they were low quality.

1288
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Fuck you, buddy.

1289
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, you still get like notified from like ads and stuff, right?

1290
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You must.

1291
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I don't know.

1292
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It doesn't say what that means.

1293
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
There's a learn.

1294
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This won't filter out notifications.

1295
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay.

1296
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It won't filter out notifications from people you follow or accounts you've entered.

1297
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So it might filter notifications from people that if I'm not following them or if I have

1298
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
an interview, that sucks.

1299
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
No, I want to know when I get added.

1300
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yes.

1301
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Oh God.

1302
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Oh God.

1303
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Ah, cripes.

1304
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Twitter continuing to be a great platform.

1305
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
What a fucking nightmare.

1306
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I hate it.

1307
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Man, Twitter fucking.

1308
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh, hey, okay.

1309
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Hey, how do we feel?

1310
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
How do we feel about Ruth Badger Ginsburg?

1311
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I don't know.

1312
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh God, yeah.

1313
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I don't know if there's much to say about it, but...

1314
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Not yet, at least.

1315
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It'll be interesting to see what happens if we get some hardcore hypocrisy going on.

1316
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
We're gonna.

1317
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We're absolutely going to.

1318
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I mean, yeah.

1319
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah.

1320
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
There's no...

1321
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
This is the kind of thing.

1322
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
This is what Republicans...

1323
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
This is what Republicans base their...

1324
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Scrabble and lie and do all their power-grubbing shit for.

1325
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Like, waiting for an opportunity like this.

1326
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
This is the time to cash in all their chips, you know?

1327
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Do you...

1328
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I mean, okay.

1329
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I agree with you, but do you honestly not think that if the tables were turned, the

1330
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Libs wouldn't be doing the exact same thing?

1331
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Okay.

1332
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
This is just politics.

1333
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Okay.

1334
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
This is just how the game is played.

1335
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
To a degree.

1336
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
To a degree.

1337
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Oh God, well...

1338
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I do think that the Dems would rush to fill the seat.

1339
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yes, obviously.

1340
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But the hypocrisy is that the Republicans went to such lengths and were so shitty about

1341
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
they blocked and blocked and blocked Obama's nominee.

1342
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Right.

1343
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So, yeah, I guess.

1344
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I guess they probably would do the same thing, but the difference is that the Democrats are

1345
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
not going to, in like the name of like bipartisanship or whatever, they're not going to pull out all

1346
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
the stops in order to like block the Republicans' nominee.

1347
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
They're too, I don't know, they're too complacent or they're complicit or like they don't give

1348
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
that much of a shit or whatever.

1349
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Or whatever their fucking problem is.

1350
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,000
They just aren't going to like resist it in the way that the Republicans would.

1351
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That's the asymmetry.

1352
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Maybe.

1353
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
We'll see.

1354
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah.

1355
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
They're just...

1356
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
There's just nothing to talk about this like, yeah, because nothing's really happened.

1357
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It's just like...

1358
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah.

1359
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We'll have to wait and see what they decide to do.

1360
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It's all just talk at this point, yeah.

1361
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah.

1362
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Which is, I guess, kind of good.

1363
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Because the longer they don't do anything, the better chance it is that like, you know,

1364
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
the precedent that they set will continue to be a thing.

1365
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I don't know.

1366
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yeah.

1367
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Because there's only a couple of weeks.

1368
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
There's only a couple of weeks left, really.

1369
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Well, there's only a couple of weeks until the election, but then there's the...

1370
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Trump is still the president for the rest of the year, even after the election.

1371
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah, until January.

1372
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So it could happen then, too.

1373
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I mean, that would be...

1374
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I feel like any chance you would have to even wiggle your way through without issue,

1375
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
like if Biden is elected, and then December 14th, Trump's like,

1376
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and the sky's in.

1377
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
That's when you're really fucked at that point.

1378
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
The blowback would be astronomical.

1379
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I don't know.

1380
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know if they're worried about blowback.

1381
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
What would be the consequence to them if there was blowback?

1382
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I don't really know.

1383
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Like, the Republicans would be angry that they pushed it through,

1384
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
but they already hate the Republicans.

1385
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
The Republicans would be happy that they pushed him through, you know,

1386
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
just because they're already on their side.

1387
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't see this as a thing where the Republicans stand to lose very much.

1388
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The only thing they stand to lose is if they were to fail to push a nominee through.

1389
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Well, I guess that's what I mean.

1390
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
They would be attempt to push, and there'd be a lot of pushback to prevent it from happening,

1391
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and they get a lot of, like, bloody their nose for no real gain.

1392
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Because I feel like as soon as the process would start,

1393
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
because I would assume there's still some checks and balances.

1394
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I'm assuming Trump can't just be like, that guy, and then it's done, right?

1395
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Like, there has to be more to it than that.

1396
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Democrats just care more.

1397
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Democrats care more about decorum than Republicans do.

1398
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Democrats will fail to act if it's like, oh, no, that's beneath me,

1399
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
even if it's something really important, like blocking Trump's judiciary nominee.

1400
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
The Republicans wouldn't give a shit.

1401
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
They don't care if someone calls them a hypocrite.

1402
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's like, yeah, sure, fine, but I'm gonna do it because I want it,

1403
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and my constituency demands it, and I'm afraid of my constituency.

1404
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,000
When the kind of precedent was set with Obama,

1405
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:24,000
is that just like a unwritten rule, or did that become part of law?

1406
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Which precedent do you mean?

1407
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
The precedent that you can't appoint a judge during an election year.

1408
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Is that on the books now, or is that just kind of like a gentleman's agreement?

1409
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
No, that's not a real precedent.

1410
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Okay, now I'm no expert or anything, but my understanding is that

1411
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
that was basically just the Senate, which was controlled by the Republicans then as it is now.

1412
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Like, just simply refused to convene to vote on a nominee.

1413
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That's right, but like...

1414
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It wasn't like a legal precedent.

1415
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Right, but my understanding as well is that like, in order to justify doing so,

1416
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
they try to make it, they try to set an official precedent with that maneuver going forward.

1417
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I mean, they would say anything.

1418
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Well, that's my point.

1419
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Was it just bullshit, or was their actual legislation put down in response to this,

1420
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and is it on the books now?

1421
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You know, I don't know for sure.

1422
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
My gut is that it was just complete bullshit.

1423
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That's my feeling as well.

1424
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But it was complete bullshit that worked, and...

1425
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's very strange that it worked.

1426
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It completely worked because Democrats are not willing to get their hands dirty

1427
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
in the way that Republicans are.

1428
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
They're not willing to like get down in the weeds and like...

1429
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I don't know.

1430
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I know...

1431
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
There's a video about this specific thing by Innuendo Studios.

1432
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It's called, They Go Low, We Go High, and it's about how Democrats like won't fucking...

1433
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
won't get their hands dirty with shit like this, even when it's important.

1434
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So I don't remember exactly what the circumstances was,

1435
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but I know that there were things that Obama could have done in order to force the issue

1436
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
because the Senate was going...

1437
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It was...

1438
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's extra constitutional...

1439
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
To put it nicely, it's extra constitutional for the Senate to simply refuse to convene on the...

1440
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's not that they even held a vote and voted against the nominee.

1441
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
They simply refused to even hold the vote, which is like...

1442
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I guess there's no rule that they can't do that,

1443
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
but it's definitely not the spirit of the law that they should be able to do that.

1444
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's like finding a loophole.

1445
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And Obama probably could have found some kind of similarly extra constitutional means to force the issue,

1446
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
which would have been just turnabout.

1447
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
But Obama sort of...

1448
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
He would tweet.

1449
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Every so often, he would tweet like,

1450
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
hmm, 150 days with no vote.

1451
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Hmm, 300 days with no vote.

1452
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
He's like passive-aggressive.

1453
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Obama handled this like we handled YouTube cancelling our channel.

1454
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yeah, he's exactly right.

1455
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Exactly.

1456
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That's the Democrats.

1457
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
They just crossed their arms and they'll go,

1458
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
hmm, those Republicans sure are bullying me right now.

1459
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
But it's okay because this is a bad look for them.

1460
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And there's going to be huge blowback for this.

1461
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This is really going to cost them down ballot.

1462
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And meanwhile, the Republicans are like, I don't care.

1463
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
This is the time for me to exercise power.

1464
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
There's no point holding power unless I exercise it.

1465
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
This is the time, even if it costs me my office, it's worth it.

1466
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Like, fuck everything.

1467
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Republicans are sounding kind of based right now.

1468
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
They're making them sound kind of cool, Ben.

1469
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
They have the will to power in a way that the Democrats simply lack.

1470
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
It's just a shame that they are monsters and do bad things with it.

1471
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Lamal.

1472
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:57,000
But yeah, so my expectations are that this RBG situation will shake out

1473
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
probably in the worst way that it possibly could.

1474
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's probably a nightmare for civil rights.

1475
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Dab.

1476
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Yeah, it'll be interesting.

1477
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I can't wait for what's his name, fucking Lindsey Graham or whatever.

1478
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
There's like a clip floating around on Twitter of him being like,

1479
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
use my own words against me if this ever happens the other way around.

1480
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And now it is happening and it's pretty funny.

1481
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You say Lindsey Graham and I think of Graham Linnum.

1482
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I don't even know who that is.

1483
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's the guy who, he was one of the co-founders or makers of the IT crowd

1484
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and he was like the big Twitter transphobe.

1485
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
No, I got nothing.

1486
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
He was a TV writer who got fired from all his TV jobs

1487
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and these days he's known as the top dog of Twitter transphobes

1488
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
before JK Rowling de-throned him.

1489
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Lamal.

1490
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah, I guess that's not the circle I tend to associate.

1491
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
What a time to be alive.

1492
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What a sentence.

1493
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Oh, boy.

1494
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh, man.

1495
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Actually, speaking of JK Rowling, one of the big things they revealed,

1496
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
no, no, no, this is funny.

1497
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
This is good.

1498
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Okay.

1499
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
One of the big things they revealed at like the PlayStation digital event

1500
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
a couple of weeks back was the new Harry Potter game,

1501
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
like this Hogwarts game, the big RPG that looks pretty good.

1502
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, I think I know where you're going with this, but yeah.

1503
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And they made sure to go out and make very clear JK Rowling

1504
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
has nothing to do with this game.

1505
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And everyone got like their shits from that.

1506
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That was pretty funny.

1507
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And I just thought, wouldn't it be great if they just didn't have a gender option

1508
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
when you make your character in this Hogwarts game?

1509
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I just think that would be the funniest fucking thing in the world

1510
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
and they should totally do it.

1511
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Sure.

1512
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I don't know anything about the game, but yeah, be funny.

1513
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It's set in like the 1800s or something.

1514
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So it's like a way, way, way prequel to like Harry Potter,

1515
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
but it's just like you're a dude at Hogwarts doing your thing

1516
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and like you fight monsters and stuff.

1517
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And it's like an excuse to make an action RPG in a popular IP to make money.

1518
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Like that's the whole point of it.

1519
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But I mean, the thing about that is that, you know,

1520
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
for marketing purpose, because there's all this blowback against JK now,

1521
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
they'll say that, but the reality is that maybe she might not be involved in making it,

1522
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
but like she still owns the company and is profiting.

1523
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
She's still getting paid massively.

1524
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So, you know, if you were going to boycott the game,

1525
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
you know, still do it, definitely, I guess.

1526
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But yeah, I mean, I'm not going to buy a fucking Harry Potter video game.

1527
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,000
No, I mean, under any circumstances, even, even the best of circumstances.

1528
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
The Harry Potter comparisons to RBG have been pretty cringy.

1529
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Wait, what?

1530
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Have you seen like the article from Vice saying that she was like the Dumbledore of real life?

1531
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
What the fuck?

1532
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Yeah, like that's like their big, like Vice's big article celebrating her,

1533
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
her legacy was saying that she was like our version of Dumbledore.

1534
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm like, can we please stop being this pathetic?

1535
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah, that is, um, that is like peak, that is like peak millennial horseshit.

1536
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1537
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Oh God.

1538
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It was really bad.

1539
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And then like that other, there was another tweet where someone is it Ruth Kanda?

1540
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I don't know.

1541
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Oh, OK.

1542
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
What do you, what do you think?

1543
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I saw one that's like some, some quote unquote journalist or whatever,

1544
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
some fucking blue check mark is like, I told my daughter about Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1545
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and she, and she cried.

1546
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And then she did the Wakanda pose and said Ruth Kanda forever.

1547
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah, I said that too.

1548
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Like you're such a liar.

1549
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
No, she fucking did it.

1550
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Right.

1551
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's so dumb.

1552
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Like, who do you think you're fooling with these like blatantly transparent

1553
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
attention bait tweets?

1554
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I mean, on the one hand, it's a lie, which is bad.

1555
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And on the other hand, like, why would you make a story like that?

1556
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Why would you say that thinking that like, if that happened, it would be cool.

1557
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's not, it's not cool.

1558
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It's like a fail on multiple levels.

1559
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I don't, I don't understand.

1560
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I don't understand these fucking Twitter check marks.

1561
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
What are they thinking?

1562
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
There was someone else who was like, who's like, like, um, RBG going to heaven

1563
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
and seeing Chadwick Boseman and she was like.

1564
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Oh, queen, queen.

1565
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yeah, queen.

1566
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah.

1567
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Just like, come on, man.

1568
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I did see that one.

1569
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I didn't see.

1570
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What are you doing?

1571
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It's so, I don't know.

1572
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It's just very strange how like there's like a whole group of people like, oh, I

1573
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
almost like the bulk of like an entire generation.

1574
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I guess you could argue that like have just conflated fiction with reality to the point

1575
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
where like making statements like that or saying that like, she's the Dumbledore of

1576
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
real life, have some sort of like deep meaning when it just makes you seem like a child.

1577
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah.

1578
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,000
When you say a card carrying man child, say you're acting like a child, you've really

1579
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
sunk fucking low.

1580
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I mean, I feel, you know, I feel a little bit, I feel a little called out sometimes when

1581
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,000
like people say like, oh, fucking millennials, like saying some cringy shit about Harry Potter,

1582
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
because I mean, I grew up really liking Harry Potter, you know, it was, I really like the

1583
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
books.

1584
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I didn't, I didn't care for the movies that much, but I was really into the books.

1585
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So, like, I kind of get it.

1586
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,000
But, you know, it's in situations like this when like something of like, something of

1587
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
like real like geopolitical importance is occurring, like something that's really gonna like affect

1588
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
people is happening and some fucking, and some fucking idiot who called, whose Twitter

1589
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:51,000
bio says cat mom, like make some fucking comparison to like, oh, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was like, you

1590
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
know, I don't know.

1591
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Who's that?

1592
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Who's that?

1593
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Candace Owens is like the Dolores Umbridge of something where it's like, fuck off.

1594
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Like, shut the fuck up.

1595
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It just, it just comes off of like your, your frame of reference in life.

1596
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah.

1597
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So small and so limited that you have to retreat back to like your small pocket of pop culture

1598
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
references in order to make comparisons to reality.

1599
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It's one thing to have reverence for a piece of fiction because we all do.

1600
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
We all have pieces of fiction that an entertainment that have really affected us.

1601
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But like, the real world is the real world.

1602
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It doesn't need to constantly be referenced back.

1603
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It's like, I can.

1604
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
To Harry fucking Potter.

1605
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I actually don't need to contextualize the, you know, I don't know, the war in Iraq or

1606
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
whatever in the like, but like, oh, was McCain was, McCain was like, he was like, you know,

1607
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
a Snape basically.

1608
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Like, you think he's a bad guy, but he was actually kind of good.

1609
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And then, you know, I don't know.

1610
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Fucking the other guy was some other shit.

1611
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I can't even, I can't even think of enough Harry Potter characters off the top of my

1612
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
head to complete this analogy.

1613
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It's just very bad.

1614
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What's the point?

1615
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
What's the point?

1616
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It's just embarrassing.

1617
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It really is.

1618
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It's embarrassing for me as a, as a, I don't, I don't know if I, I don't know if I'd go

1619
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
so far as to call myself a Potter head.

1620
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I'm, I'm certainly not an active Potter head.

1621
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I just like the books as a kid.

1622
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You don't, you don't have your house and your Twitter bio.

1623
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Like what's wrong with that?

1624
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Ravenclaw though.

1625
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,000
In case, in case anyone's curious, just put that out there.

1626
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Man, oh fucking man.

1627
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Yeah.

1628
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Well, that was, that's what a week.

1629
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
That's what a fucking week.

1630
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Do you want to go to voicemails?

1631
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Let's go to voicemails.

1632
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
We got a bunch of them.

1633
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Okay.

1634
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Right.

1635
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Our first, our first voicemail of the day is from probably just depression.

1636
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Sounds accurate.

1637
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Three, two, one, go.

1638
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And what else do you like this?

1639
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I have no backbone to defend shit.

1640
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I like, I like, I've always loved Scotch people.

1641
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
This was a teenager.

1642
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But now if everyone comes to attack, I just, you know, yeah, I guess it is a,

1643
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I guess it is a white boy fantasy.

1644
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I guess it is a bunch of fucking video game references and some outdated hipster shit.

1645
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I guess.

1646
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Yeah.

1647
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I guess pretty gay.

1648
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Yeah.

1649
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I will kill myself.

1650
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah.

1651
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Wait, wait, what was that about?

1652
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I missed the beginning part.

1653
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I'm going to listen to the beginning again.

1654
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And what else do you like this?

1655
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Um, I have no backbone to defend shit.

1656
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I like Scotch people.

1657
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I've always loved Scotch people.

1658
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
There's like a little audio clip that's like, cuts out the key word to that first sentence.

1659
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Honestly.

1660
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yeah.

1661
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I can't quite make out what he's saying there, but I guess he's talking about killing

1662
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
himself.

1663
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And, uh, I don't know.

1664
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I don't, whatever.

1665
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Don't do it.

1666
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah.

1667
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I guess, I guess I'm obligated to say don't do it.

1668
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
The world sucks right now, but it sucks for everybody.

1669
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Not, it's not you.

1670
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
It's the world.

1671
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yeah.

1672
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's, that's really the lesson to take away from 2020.

1673
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I think maybe, maybe there's some, maybe there is some, some, some comfort to be gleaned

1674
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
and that like, if you feel, if you feel bad right now, it's probably this, it's pretty

1675
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
close for me.

1676
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
If you feel bad right now, like, like, of course you do, right?

1677
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Like you can tell that like it's not your problem.

1678
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Uh, uh, everybody, everybody feels like that.

1679
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Clearly at this point in history, we can all acknowledge that like the problems are

1680
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
external to ourselves.

1681
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Right.

1682
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Unless you're.

1683
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah.

1684
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Unless not to say you don't have personal problems, but like there's a baseline where all fucking

1685
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
right.

1686
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
It's rounding in right now.

1687
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And, uh, I don't know.

1688
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You have that camaraderie with everybody around you is that everyone's dealing with

1689
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
shit.

1690
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Yes.

1691
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Take.

1692
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I don't know, dude.

1693
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We can all feel bad together.

1694
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Yeah.

1695
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Misery loves company.

1696
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You know, we can all, we can all just, uh.

1697
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Read Harry Potter again, because that's all that really matters in the world.

1698
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You, you who sent this voicemail, you know, us on the podcast, all our shitty commenters,

1699
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
you know, all, all of us are united in, in how, in how bad 2020 has been for us.

1700
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So, you know, take, take heart.

1701
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Um, the next, the next one is a, is a YouTube link, but let's listen to the voicemail.

1702
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Maybe it'll explain what this deal is.

1703
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Three, two, one, go.

1704
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Hey, lads.

1705
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I made a little funny video about a certain best guy.

1706
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's a little too long for a voicemail.

1707
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So I'm leaving you a link.

1708
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Enjoy.

1709
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Oh boy.

1710
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
The video is called Mr. Best Guy.

1711
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And, um.

1712
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Oh God.

1713
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
It's five minutes long.

1714
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It is a five minute long video.

1715
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And.

1716
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
All right.

1717
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
You know.

1718
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It is.

1719
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
It is, it is five minutes long.

1720
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I mean, I, I see some, I see some Nate criticism in here, uh, you know, early on.

1721
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And then there, there's more and I don't, I'm, there's, I don't get it.

1722
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But I'm sure that I'm sure there's more to it.

1723
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Uh, link in the description, I guess.

1724
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I don't know.

1725
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I guess I'm obligated to put the link in the description.

1726
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Uh, if you're interested.

1727
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We brought it up for this long.

1728
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yes.

1729
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Leave them there.

1730
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Leave the, leave this man your opinions about that if you would like.

1731
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Next one.

1732
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Prol Jester in love.

1733
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Oh God.

1734
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's a minute 22.

1735
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Jesus Christ.

1736
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Three, two, one, go.

1737
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
This is a hell of your own creation.

1738
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Violence from no beginning is tyranny.

1739
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Impress me.

1740
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But with the backdrop of revenge, no one would even blink.

1741
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Have you even considered the violence that we have suffered by so-called elites?

1742
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Their vile shadow has covered all of their sins, shrouded in deceit.

1743
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
But the truth is clear.

1744
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Their actions do wreak.

1745
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Many hadn't got one.

1746
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I was the, yes, me, that they refer to this hidden violence as federal policy.

1747
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Their crimes are masked under a flimsy guise.

1748
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Rip it off from their faces.

1749
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Come on now, you guys.

1750
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Now, I have to give my thanks towards your expression of myth and consideration to my message.

1751
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Truly, I was humbled by your participation in my craft.

1752
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Also, I was arrested for acts of violence and I was wondering if you could pay my bail.

1753
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
My gesture, rather, and have set up a GoFundMe at gofundme.com slash Ben St.

1754
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I had to perform a mean palatio to get this message out.

1755
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So thank you truly for your time.

1756
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I hope gofundme.com slash Ben St. forwards to patreon.com slash Ben St.

1757
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Abolish prisons.

1758
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Free this man.

1759
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Thanks for the funny poem.

1760
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
No problem.

1761
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Okay, next one is called Bad Voice Mail.

1762
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I appreciate the honesty.

1763
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I can't wait.

1764
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Three, two, one, go.

1765
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So, it's Thursday.

1766
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, that's right.

1767
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I haven't even seen the episode yet.

1768
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It's not even out.

1769
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I have a few predictions to make about this week's episode.

1770
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I mean, last week's episode.

1771
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Number one, Nate will not be there.

1772
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Number two, Ben St. will be there.

1773
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Number three, I have a vision.

1774
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
You've already talked about some degenerate leftist topic.

1775
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Yes, I can see it.

1776
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yes, you've done it.

1777
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It's in my brain.

1778
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And if you haven't talked about it yet,

1779
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
just take this voice mail as a jumping off point

1780
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
to talk about some degeneracy.

1781
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Don't.

1782
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Well, you titled the voice mail accurately,

1783
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
so I'll give him that.

1784
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Is that your phone ringing in the background,

1785
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
or was that his phone?

1786
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
That was his phone.

1787
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Well, yeah.

1788
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah, we talked about the most degenerate thing of all,

1789
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
the Supreme Court and Harry Potter, Der.

1790
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Well, I was a little better than bad, I guess.

1791
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Just slightly.

1792
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I mean, it was very obvious.

1793
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Like, if you're going to make some predictions,

1794
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
that's like the most flaccid predictions of all time.

1795
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
You've got to be specific.

1796
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
You've got to be like, you've got to predict, you know,

1797
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
which American city is going to have a mass shooting this week,

1798
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and then be like, oh, yeah, they're going to talk about that

1799
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
on the PCP.

1800
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That would be impressive.

1801
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Next one.

1802
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You would have been wrong, because we didn't.

1803
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Right.

1804
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

1805
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But if you, you know, what if he called the mass shooting,

1806
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
but was wrong that we didn't talk about it,

1807
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and then we're just like, ah, this guy, idiot.

1808
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I would just assume he was the shooter.

1809
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:27,000
He's like, I predict that I'm going to go out to fucking, you know, cowards.

1810
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
He just really wanted to be talked about on the PCP, you know.

1811
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
He's like, oh man, I bet the PCP guys will get a real kick out of this mass shooting.

1812
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
He's going to go out and all yell, I'm the reason people are dying.

1813
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
He's like, this, this will get me noticed by the PCP for sure.

1814
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And you know what?

1815
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I think I'm contractually obligated to say that if someone, if that happens,

1816
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we will not discuss it on the show.

1817
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Definitely not.

1818
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It's, it's not, it's not, it's not up for discussion.

1819
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
We do not endorse violence in any way except against the state.

1820
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Except against property, violence against property for sure.

1821
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Private property, not personal property, the kind owned by capital.

1822
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You understand, you know, you've, you've all read the bread book.

1823
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Okay, three, next one is called registered call number 0870443.

1824
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Three, two, one, go.

1825
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
This is a call from the state voice and attendee.

1826
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
This call will be monitored.

1827
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Please hold.

1828
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Hello, Samurai-san.

1829
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
In the voice jail.

1830
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Hippo-chan.

1831
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
This guy.

1832
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Fuck off.

1833
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Last week.

1834
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Vote for jail.

1835
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Not gorilla.

1836
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
But Samurai forgiveness.

1837
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Steal rubber hippo-gibbo-chan.

1838
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Samurai-kran.

1839
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Choosey tuboremu.

1840
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Beno-san.

1841
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Fuck you.

1842
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Beno-san.

1843
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Samurai.

1844
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
In the jail.

1845
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Because.

1846
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Oh.

1847
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
No.

1848
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
No.

1849
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
No.

1850
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
No, no.

1851
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Voice of Selmeto.

1852
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
From a voice of Aryan Gangu.

1853
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
He have erect penis.

1854
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
No.

1855
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
No, no, no.

1856
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
No, no, no.

1857
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
No.

1858
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
No.

1859
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
No.

1860
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Damn, that's what she, that's what happens.

1861
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That's what happens.

1862
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
That's what happens.

1863
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
You should, you should have just let, let well enough alone.

1864
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You should have left those sacred scrolls.

1865
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I, I, I, um, the Samurai, Samurai's been showing up like in streams and stuff.

1866
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Samurai's been, Samurai's been harassing me.

1867
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
He's been bullying me online.

1868
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
We give the people in voice jail internet access.

1869
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
He showed up in my discord.

1870
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
He's a, I mean, he's everywhere.

1871
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
He's like, he's got, he's got, he's got spies in the walls.

1872
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
God damn.

1873
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't escape his, his various Jutsus.

1874
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
That sounds vaguely ninja-esque.

1875
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
This is a Samurai.

1876
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I, some, I think I, ever since I left the clan, I conflate the two sometimes.

1877
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
It's so hard, so hard to remember which is which.

1878
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Um, but, uh, sucka.

1879
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Uh, next one is from an urgent bulletin from the news at thegovernment.com.

1880
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So this will be important.

1881
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Not.gov.

1882
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I think this might be fake.

1883
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Three, two, one, go.

1884
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Wow.

1885
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
If it's fake, how does it have a music stinger?

1886
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Konnichiwa.

1887
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
You're right.

1888
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Welcome to Samurai News Network.

1889
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I am a host, hentai Hiroshi.

1890
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Top story today.

1891
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Kawasaki, Samurai Karano Rida.

1892
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
In no voice jail, and no possibly repovictim.

1893
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Rido Suspect, Samurai Tretaru.

1894
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Ben no Sentosa.

1895
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
We will stay with this story.

1896
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I was watching, guess who's coming to dinner at the time, it couldn't have been me.

1897
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
But until next time, sayonara.

1898
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I don't, I don't know.

1899
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
The bit that just won't die.

1900
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I think this, it was, it was fake news though.

1901
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
That was, that was the definition of fake news.

1902
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Indeed, it did.

1903
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Next, next, I have an alibi.

1904
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Next one is from, uh, Xander.

1905
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Three, two, one, go.

1906
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
How do they're PC penis people?

1907
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Um, Ben, you might recognize me from endless war because I designed those pins of you and Munchie.

1908
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Um, I wanted to ask you guys what do you think about.

1909
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Enjoying content, enjoying content mindlessly or like just enjoying something because,

1910
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
because recently I watched Devilman Crybaby and you know, it was a pretty good show.

1911
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I enjoyed it, but, um, storytelling wise, kind of mad, kind of flat.

1912
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I didn't care about any of the characters and I watched it and I was like, um, okay, cool.

1913
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
But then after that, I just started liking the, just Devilman in general.

1914
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Like I started, I read the original manga, which I don't know if it's better than Crybaby.

1915
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm not sure yet.

1916
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I haven't thought about it.

1917
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
But like, I've just sort of been enjoying Devilman and like Devilman Crybaby, it's the same show.

1918
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It didn't get better, but now I like it way more now for some reason.

1919
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Is this, is this what, is this what normal people do?

1920
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:30,000
They just enjoy things because it good and then, and they don't have to analyze everything like story structure wise.

1921
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Um, yeah.

1922
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
End of voicemail.

1923
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Send.

1924
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Um, I'm not, uh, I mean, he started out saying enjoying mindlessly,

1925
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
but I feel like what he was describing was not mindless enjoyment.

1926
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Oh, actually, the first thing he said was enjoying Kant,

1927
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
which has been a completely different voicemail than enjoying content mindlessly.

1928
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah, that's, um, you know, the,

1929
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
It's like a hard left right there.

1930
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I don't, yeah, I don't, I don't know if I agree with the categorical imperative,

1931
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
which is, is that Kant?

1932
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I'm like 80% sure that's Kant.

1933
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Okay, fuck, never mind.

1934
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Um, uh,

1935
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Eleazar, cut that out.

1936
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Eleazar, if that's not correct, cut that out.

1937
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Insert whatever guy it was.

1938
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It wasn't, it definitely wasn't Hegel.

1939
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I don't think it was Hegel.

1940
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
He was the dialectics guy.

1941
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Um, but, uh, I mean, I enjoy mindless things all the time.

1942
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Like I fucking, I'll put on those fucking, uh, identifying luck in Mario Party videos

1943
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
and just let them auto play for like six hours.

1944
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And I have a great time.

1945
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Um, and that's, and that's nothing.

1946
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That's just noise.

1947
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Um, about, it seems like he was saying like, uh, uh, enjoying something just

1948
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
because you're familiar with it.

1949
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
All right.

1950
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I guess so.

1951
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Which, in which case, um, I,

1952
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Enough the power of franchises.

1953
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
That's why like Hollywood and stuff abuse franchises so much.

1954
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That is the power of franchises.

1955
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And it's, it's a real thing.

1956
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And like it's just, it's not,

1957
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I totally understand why it happens because like, I mean,

1958
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I was just talking about Harry Potter before and like, you know,

1959
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Well, I don't know if that's a great, it was like, I don't,

1960
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I don't watch any of the like extended Harry Potter shit.

1961
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I'm not, I didn't go out and see fucking fantastic beasts or whatever.

1962
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Uh, so maybe that's not a great example, but like,

1963
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I get the appeal of a franchise and like, oh, this is a thing I'm familiar with.

1964
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
That's why, that's why I don't,

1965
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It adends all of you, it adends all of your previous experience with the

1966
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
entries in the franchise or whatever new thing they're trying to do.

1967
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And that's why they work so much better.

1968
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I, that's why I avoid media in general because I don't,

1969
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I don't want to get, uh, to, to an extent I'm being a little facetious,

1970
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
but I'm, I'm being serious too.

1971
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Like I kind of don't want to see anything new because if a new franchise were to

1972
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
begin and I'd seen it, that would give it like fucking power over me.

1973
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
That would, they would be able to entice me to go and like see their new movie

1974
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
or whatever.

1975
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And I don't want, I don't want them to have that.

1976
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I don't want to be, like God, imagine if like I gave a shit about Star Wars

1977
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
and like think of all the fucking movies I'd have had to go see,

1978
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
like in the past couple of years, like Jesus Christ.

1979
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
New movies made everyone hate Star Wars.

1980
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Nobody liked Star Wars anymore.

1981
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
That's deranged mental people.

1982
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That's true.

1983
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I mean, yeah, maybe.

1984
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I mean, imagine, okay, well imagine, like if I, if I gave a shit about Marvel,

1985
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I would have had to go and see, like over the last decade,

1986
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I would have had to go and see like 30 fucking movies.

1987
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I had that.

1988
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I had a good time.

1989
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
No, no, you didn't.

1990
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
You're wrong.

1991
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Um, so I guess, I guess my point is that I, I try, I just like kind of go out of my

1992
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
way not to do that, not to enjoy things in that way or any other.

1993
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I think I'm just embarrassing myself.

1994
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Sounds about right.

1995
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah.

1996
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It's pretty, it's pretty base.

1997
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
You should try it.

1998
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Try it sometime.

1999
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I just, I just think like you have to, you have to keep a critical mind.

2000
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Right.

2001
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's so easy to like get pre-programmed and be like, oh, I'm going to enjoy this

2002
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
because it's like my thing.

2003
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Like, like PlayStation and Xbox fucking drones, you know, and just like,

2004
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I'm going to get the new PlayStation.

2005
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Cause the last one was good and like, fuck you for liking Xbox fucking console

2006
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
warship.

2007
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So cringy.

2008
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
$70.

2009
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I mean, gaming is an expensive hobby.

2010
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
What do you expect?

2011
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I'll pay anything.

2012
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
You just have to like, you got to differentiate like all of your experiences

2013
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and understand like another good thing is like, uh, studios, you know, like people

2014
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
are just like, oh, like Bioware.

2015
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I love Bioware.

2016
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It's like, that's just a name.

2017
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
That's just a logo that people involved in working at these studios are

2018
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
different than who they were 20 years ago.

2019
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
And like that, that logo is there to confuse you and to trick you into thinking

2020
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
the things that you liked back then still exist when you have to be able to

2021
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
examine each piece of content individually on its own merits and divorce

2022
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
your feelings of nostalgia for the brand in question and be like, what is this

2023
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
thing?

2024
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And that's hard and difficult because like our brains are like pre-programmed to

2025
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
do as much intellectual shorthand as possible.

2026
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And that's what capitalism preys on.

2027
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's like, it's like, like Homestuck.

2028
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Like, um, the new, like Homestuck 2, it's, I mean, it's called Homestuck.

2029
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And I guess Hussey is technically somewhat involved in it, but like it's not,

2030
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
it's not being made by the same guy.

2031
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So I'm not going to like, or like, or like any, I don't know, any fucking like

2032
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
company, right?

2033
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Any fucking, yeah, I like the point about like, you know, the name of the brand is

2034
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
just like, like it's the people that made it that is the important thing.

2035
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And like, I guess if like, they sell it under like a Bioware name, it's like

2036
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
the implication is like the same people made it, but it could have been like,

2037
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
they could have just sold that name to some other people and like they released it.

2038
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I mean, they do that all the time.

2039
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

2040
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And it's like, hmm, weird.

2041
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
That's weird.

2042
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I mean, they did that with Star Wars.

2043
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Like they sold Star Wars to Disney and people just went because it had Star Wars on

2044
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
it, even though none of the original people involved with Star Wars, even George

2045
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Lucas was involved.

2046
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It's just like, this is just part and parcel of like, intellectual property in general.

2047
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Yeah.

2048
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
If you want to be fans of anybody, you should be fans of individual creators.

2049
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Yeah.

2050
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Because there's a very clear one to one through line between person and product.

2051
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah.

2052
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You know, that's um, if Vapors three is garbage, you know, it's Ben's fault because

2053
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
no one else is involved.

2054
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Good luck, Ben.

2055
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Fuck yeah.

2056
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Um, base.

2057
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Uh, okay.

2058
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Yeah.

2059
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Good.

2060
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Good.

2061
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Good.

2062
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Uh, I don't have anything else to say about that.

2063
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Yeah.

2064
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Next one.

2065
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I don't, I want to skip this next one.

2066
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That's fair.

2067
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I don't like, I don't like it.

2068
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Okay.

2069
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Okay.

2070
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
No.

2071
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Okay.

2072
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
You talk me into it.

2073
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
It's called, it's called based Tom.

2074
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Sounds like, sounds like, sounds pointless, but we'll give it sounds like propaganda.

2075
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
All right.

2076
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Three, two, one, go.

2077
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
You know, the Dick sucker last week was saying that the commentators are too cowardly to call

2078
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
in and give their opinion.

2079
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
You know, I'll give my opinion.

2080
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I really don't think it's you three that, that the people are frustrated with.

2081
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
The podcast is fine.

2082
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
You know, it's good background noise.

2083
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
It is what it is.

2084
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
It's just, we have this Nate cloud all over everything and it's just, it's another game

2085
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
grumps thing.

2086
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It's the John and Aaron all over again.

2087
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
People don't know what's going on.

2088
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
People have been, you know, uh, part of this community and all of a sudden a major member

2089
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
just disappears and we have no reason or no explanation why.

2090
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And I think that's actually what people are frustrated about.

2091
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You guys would just bring it out in the open.

2092
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Maybe this can begin to heal.

2093
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Otherwise it's just going to be the no Nate, no watchers crying, the Nate heads crying.

2094
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
It's just going to continue like this.

2095
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
So I think as soon as it's brought to light all this, we can move on, you know.

2096
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
This is, this is exactly what we were talking about at the beginning of the episode.

2097
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
There's this, there's this sort of.

2098
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I mean, maybe, maybe, I mean, I, I thought we did talk about it, but maybe we didn't

2099
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
talk about it enough.

2100
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Maybe it's our fault for inviting this kind of speculation by not spelling it out.

2101
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But yeah, this, this expectation that like there must be some sort of some, some kind

2102
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,000
of some sort of like reason and like, no, just doesn't feel like it.

2103
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
That's, that's the reason.

2104
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
When there's no official comment and very specific detail, people will fill in their

2105
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
own fan fiction as, as the internet works.

2106
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I don't know what that had to do with me being based by appreciating.

2107
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
That wasn't even about Tom, but okay, that's fine.

2108
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
All right.

2109
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
All right.

2110
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Fair enough.

2111
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You know, hopefully we've, we've dispelled this at this point.

2112
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And, and, uh, oh, oh, the next one, I hope this guy bought the shirt.

2113
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Oh, wait, I, I feel like maybe we, I don't know.

2114
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I feel like maybe there's something to say about the shirts from last, last episode.

2115
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I released the shirts before the episode came out.

2116
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I did.

2117
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And, and everyone thought they sucked because am I flattering myself to, am I flattering

2118
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
us rather to say that like, oh, that's just because they hadn't heard the episode and

2119
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
they didn't know the context.

2120
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I feel like they probably still suck, but not as much if you have context.

2121
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Uh, maybe.

2122
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I mean, I thought they were like, when we were, when we came up with them, when, when

2123
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
we, when we were talking about it on the episode, I thought it was pretty funny.

2124
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So I thought, I mean, it was funny in the moment for sure.

2125
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I felt some good, some, some good feels in my heart when crack was like base states,

2126
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
a good pun even before the episode was out.

2127
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
And it's like, yes.

2128
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Crack got it.

2129
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And then someone else said like, ask, like, oh, is the COVID joke that like, if you wear

2130
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
this, you won't get COVID cause no one will come near you.

2131
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And I was like, yeah, more or less.

2132
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So like a couple of people like were able to infer.

2133
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Um, few galaxy brains out there.

2134
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Thank God.

2135
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But, uh, okay.

2136
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And so I'm looking, I'm looking at the analytics and no, nobody, nobody bought either shirt.

2137
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
So, you know, you could be, that just means that you could be the first you listening at

2138
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
home right now.

2139
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
You could be the one and only owner of an I have COVID shirt.

2140
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Uh, you know, if you're, if you have the courage.

2141
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Um, but anyway, voicemail from I have COVID three, two, one go.

2142
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:26,000
So the PCP lately has been a little sparse for lack of a better word.

2143
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And, um, so I was thinking, maybe you guys should get a guest or something.

2144
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,000
And, um, there's just really cool YouTuber guy you should have on the podcast.

2145
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
His name is, um, Cotherix the dragon.

2146
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
He's really cool.

2147
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And I think, uh, he would make a really good, um, member of the podcast.

2148
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Sure.

2149
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Do you know who that is, Tom?

2150
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I have no idea who that is.

2151
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
He is, he is a blue dragon.

2152
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Um, I don't, I guess I don't really know his deal.

2153
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I guess he seems okay.

2154
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,000
There's like a, um, he's got like a couple of videos that went pretty viral.

2155
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
There's one that's like, oh fuck, what is it?

2156
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
It's like, I think he might have like a, hold on.

2157
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I want to remember what, what the big one is, like the one that I found him through.

2158
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Um, uh, Cotherix, what's, what's his biggest video?

2159
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
There was one that like went pretty viral.

2160
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Uh, and I had to click it because like, what the fuck is this?

2161
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Um, I don't see, I don't see.

2162
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Oh, it was why we should bring back child labor.

2163
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I think that was, that's not actually his biggest one, but he had this one about how like child labor was good.

2164
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And he, he basically gives this like, this like shitty, like a NCAP explanation of why the free market and whatever.

2165
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
But he goes like, he goes pretty, by the end of it, it's clear that it's like a parody or whatever.

2166
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
He talks about like, you know, kids could like lose their limbs and machinery.

2167
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
But like, if we had like a better workforce, like we could invent like auto mail, like in full metal alchemist.

2168
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And then all these kids could have all these cool robot arms.

2169
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
They would be sick.

2170
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I don't know.

2171
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I'm picking up what he's putting down.

2172
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Yeah.

2173
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
So I think Kothric seems fine.

2174
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:25,000
So what I'm saying is, yeah, he, he should probably be the next member of the, of the, of the PCP, I think.

2175
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Well, we were talking before the episode started about trying to get some guest scones.

2176
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
We were talking about trying to get some guest scones.

2177
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I'm not opposed to guests.

2178
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I just, I don't, we don't know anybody or I don't know anybody.

2179
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
You know people, but that's, I know some people.

2180
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Maybe instead of trying to get someone with a million subscribers on you onto their podcast,

2181
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
we seem to get Saber with a million subscribers onto this podcast.

2182
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I mean, I mean, that's one, that's one way to do it.

2183
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Then, then he can do an episode called what ruined the PCP and finally answer the question for everybody.

2184
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I got it.

2185
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I figured it out.

2186
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
We're good.

2187
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
All right.

2188
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I'm going to start, I'm going to start sending some DMs right now.

2189
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
We're going to get this.

2190
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
We're going to get this going.

2191
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
It's going to be great.

2192
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
That's, that's, that's pretty good.

2193
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
That's, that's pretty okay.

2194
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
We can do that, I think.

2195
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I don't, yeah, I just, I don't really like know any other like YouTube or internet people outside of the PCP.

2196
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
So I get, I, hmm, do I?

2197
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:32,000
No, I only, I only have like the most cursory of like business relationships with like,

2198
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I've been on a podcast with like one or two people and that's like it.

2199
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I slid it ourselves too early in our career and now we're a pariah.

2200
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I mean, Tom, how do I, how do I become a well connected internet, internet, the face of the internet like you?

2201
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:01,000
You just have to get in on the ground floor of a fandom and then everybody who's in that fandom goes on to become incredibly successful due to market trends that you yourself don't understand and can't capitalize on.

2202
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
That sounds pretty gay though.

2203
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I mean, my life is pretty gay, so you're on point.

2204
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Is there a better way?

2205
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Hmm.

2206
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Be personable, I guess.

2207
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
No, that's out of the question.

2208
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Look at me.

2209
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Look who you're talking to.

2210
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It's fair.

2211
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
All right.

2212
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
No, I'll figure something out.

2213
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
You got to, you just got to do the tried and true artist tactic, Ben.

2214
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:28,000
You got to find somebody who's relatively popular, make them lots of free fan art until they become your friend.

2215
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Because they feel indebted to you for giving, for you giving them all this free stuff.

2216
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I can't do that.

2217
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I can't do that.

2218
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
You're your own worst enemy then, Ben.

2219
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I'm hearing a lot of I can't.

2220
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I can't do that.

2221
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
It's too, it's too degrading.

2222
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
It's too demeaning.

2223
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
That's why I don't do it either.

2224
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And that's why we're both on this podcast and nothing else to our names.

2225
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I can't, no, I will, I don't want to fucking curry favor with someone who's higher on the totem pole than me.

2226
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I want to just fuck the totem pole.

2227
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I want to knock it down.

2228
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I don't grovel and be like, ooh.

2229
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Now you're talking about a totally different goal than what you just initially asked.

2230
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Ooh, Mr. Someone with six digits, someone with six digits subscribers.

2231
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Ooh, I made you a, I made you a, the, the, the closest I ever came was I did like one piece of fan art for a couple of the artists on a, on a strip search.

2232
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I did one and then never again.

2233
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And I never looked at their Twitter feeds or anything.

2234
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I don't interact with them because I, some of them are like smaller than me, but like I'm, they, they even, even those ones won't acknowledge me.

2235
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Because I'm just, I'm just too much of an insignificant ants for even other insignificant ants.

2236
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Don't care about me. Hmm. Hmm. Cringe.

2237
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Um, so anyway, that's, that's that problem, problem solved.

2238
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I don't know.

2239
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Uh, whatever.

2240
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Imagine if we could have internet famous, uh, YouTuber, uh, six digit subscribers, Nate Bestman.

2241
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
If you could get him on the podcast and we could start going places.

2242
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:02,000
If only, if only we could get, if only we could get Digi, Digi-nay, formerly Digi Bro on the podcast.

2243
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
That would just be, that could be our big break.

2244
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I even think, you know, that, that's like a whole audience.

2245
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
I'd really turn the show around.

2246
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Yeah.

2247
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Very true.

2248
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It's impossible though.

2249
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
It's impossible.

2250
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
God damn it.

2251
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
No, I, I am important.

2252
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I was on the pizza party podcast.

2253
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I found the podcast and then I went on it.

2254
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
When are we going to have pan pizza on the show?

2255
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
I, I don't think pan pizza is a human being.

2256
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Um, I don't,

2257
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I have a connection through Paleo Steno who knows Jim, uh, Jim Gisrael who's on the podcast with pan.

2258
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Is he the tall guy?

2259
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I have it in.

2260
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
He's, yeah, he's the big tall guy.

2261
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
He was, he was not on the episode that I was on, but okay.

2262
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Damn it.

2263
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Yeah.

2264
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Jim is unironically.

2265
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Jim is base.

2266
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Jim is cool.

2267
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
No.

2268
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I love talking to Jim.

2269
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:54,000
He was just me, cheesy, uh, pizza man, uh, uh, Nolan and Izzy.

2270
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And, uh, yeah.

2271
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
The only one I know from that show is Jim and he's actually really cool.

2272
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I see.

2273
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Lol.

2274
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Um, Paleo knows Jim.

2275
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Okay.

2276
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Yeah.

2277
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Get fucking, get fucking, I mean, did I, I probably talked about it that like pizza is,

2278
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,320
is like a weird automaton pizza was like, I like said a bunch of like, I made a bunch

2279
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:21,780
of like weird jokes and just set a bunch of weird shit and like cheesy, just like talk

2280
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:27,320
shit to him like right to his face and did, and pizza just had like no reaction whatsoever.

2281
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,840
It was just like, okay, anyway, let's talk about this cartoon news.

2282
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,120
Let's talk about this new pilot of whatever released on the Disney channel or whatever

2283
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,120
the fuck.

2284
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,440
He's like completely undeterred from his goal.

2285
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,600
He's perfect for the internet.

2286
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,560
Just like the criticism just bounces right off and just keeps, keeps attacking that target

2287
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:46,560
demo.

2288
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,800
Yeah.

2289
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:48,800
Completely.

2290
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,360
It's admirable in its way.

2291
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:59,080
But um, no, we, we, we really do need to cross pollinate the PPP with the PCC, PCP.

2292
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,920
I mean, I mean, I tried, but it didn't, it didn't happen.

2293
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,680
So we're going to have to have another go.

2294
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,120
Somebody else is going to have to find the podcast.

2295
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:10,080
I'll extend my social tendrils as best I can and see if I can trap anyone in my web and

2296
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,080
pull it back.

2297
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,880
Oh, who is it?

2298
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:15,720
People were saying, oh, since we're on the subject of guests.

2299
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:20,840
I kind of want to ask, um, this is someone who I didn't know, but I saw a bunch of people

2300
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:27,640
talking about him, um, because he mentioned my lectures in a recent video, his name.

2301
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:28,640
Oh my God.

2302
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:33,720
I can't believe I'm blanking on his name because I fucking watched like all of his videos this

2303
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,720
past week.

2304
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:40,160
Uh, it was, um, Cybershell, this guy, do you know, do you know Cybershell?

2305
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,160
Yes.

2306
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,160
I had never heard of them, but I watched.

2307
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,680
I haven't watched any of their stuff, but we were talking about this before the show

2308
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,680
started.

2309
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,680
Oh God.

2310
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,680
That's right.

2311
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,520
I can't even fucking remember what I, and you're like, Hey dude, uh, we should have

2312
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,520
a Cybershell in here.

2313
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,520
I'm like, that's cool.

2314
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,800
And then you're like, do you know anything about Sonic?

2315
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,040
I'm like, I'm a pretty hardcore fan of some adventure and could geek out about it.

2316
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,800
And you're like, go, right, right.

2317
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,800
Cybershell talks about Sonic and I personally don't know anything about Sonic, but cyber

2318
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:11,320
has seen my son at you lecture and my tales of its trolled lecture and mentioned them

2319
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,880
in a recent video about tales gets trolled, which was pretty cool of him.

2320
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,680
I would love to have Cybershell on.

2321
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,000
We could open our hearts together about Sonic and maybe we could live and learn a bit from

2322
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
each other.

2323
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,480
Uh, Cybershell, his, I, I watched through his catalog and his, his best video to me,

2324
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,760
he has like an hour long video explaining like, what's the deal with Chow?

2325
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,760
Like how do they work?

2326
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,760
And I, that's like,

2327
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,120
That's some deep lore.

2328
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,120
That's some deep.

2329
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:39,720
Like, yeah, like, yes, please give me an hour long video.

2330
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,720
Okay.

2331
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,720
Yes.

2332
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:46,120
Please give me an hour long video of some guy just explaining some like weird shit in

2333
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,640
an old video game for, for a while.

2334
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,960
Like, yep, that's, that's what I want.

2335
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,480
Uh, so that was pretty based.

2336
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,480
Uh, okay.

2337
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,480
Okay.

2338
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,560
We've, that's, that's enough about that.

2339
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:04,520
We've got another voicemail from I'm Just Being Cool, three, two, one, go.

2340
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:10,480
So the other day I was at, uh, Walgreens getting some extra large condoms and the employee

2341
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,920
came up to me and was like, Hey man, you got to wear a mask in here.

2342
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:22,360
And I was like, Hey man, I'm just being cool and he was like dumbstruck by this statement.

2343
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,680
I turned 360 degrees and walked out without paying.

2344
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,680
That's what it does.

2345
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:27,680
It was pretty good.

2346
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,680
Fuck yeah.

2347
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,240
I'm glad we have our first testimonial that this is an effective strategy to getting through

2348
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,240
life.

2349
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,920
And if that hadn't worked and they'd like called the cops on you for shoplifting, you

2350
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:41,320
could have just told the police, Hey, I'm just being cool.

2351
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:42,760
And they would have instantly left.

2352
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:48,080
Why don't you know, I think really think we could help like people of color avoid like,

2353
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,600
you know, uh, a quote unquote police involved shootings.

2354
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,040
You know, I think they just need to tell the police that they're just being cool.

2355
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:58,600
And you know, then I kind of think it there, it's their own fault really that always please

2356
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,720
violence happens because they don't just tell them they're being cool.

2357
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,680
Like that's what they should have done.

2358
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,120
And like, it's their own fault if they don't, frankly, at this point, at this point, when

2359
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:11,600
everyone should know better, okay, well, you know, that sounds, that sounds like a fact

2360
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,600
to me.

2361
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,960
And as they, as they say, facts don't care about your feelings, speaking of which, yes,

2362
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,520
our next voicemail from facts don't care about your feelings.

2363
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,520
Here it is.

2364
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,200
Three, two, one, go.

2365
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:31,680
Look, I'm not sexist or anything, but the weakest need to destroy the strongest killer

2366
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,120
in a fight in real life.

2367
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:36,920
Wait, wait, it's just biology.

2368
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,920
They're just stronger.

2369
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:43,200
Um, Ben, please defend yourself.

2370
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:46,280
Did he say that a rowdy would defend, would kill the strongest?

2371
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,280
Who did he say?

2372
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,600
Yeah, he said, he said that rowdies were physically biologically stronger than killers.

2373
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,920
And that's just a biological fact.

2374
01:49:53,920 --> 01:50:00,160
I mean, this is just the, it's, it's simply the, it's the Batman versus Superman debate.

2375
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:06,920
Like, yeah, like Superman is stronger, but like with prep time Batman wins because he

2376
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,720
can like, you know, he knows the weakness that he can attain.

2377
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,080
The killers, killers work out at the library.

2378
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:15,080
Killers will use their superior tactics.

2379
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:19,360
Killers can bring killers would, you know, they would, they would, they would create

2380
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,640
like a, a, some kind of anime scheme wherein they would, they would mine up a bunch of

2381
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,960
like red chateau a night or something and like play, you know, from, from the dimensional

2382
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,600
rift to Trestle Mystan or something.

2383
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,280
And they would like place that all around the battlefield and detonate it before the

2384
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:38,800
fight even began, you know, like, like they, like killers, the thing, like the thing about

2385
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,280
fighting a killer is that a killer doesn't even enter the battlefield unless the stage

2386
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:48,360
has been set for a completely unfair fight, uh, that they, that they cannot help but win.

2387
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:54,400
So it's, it's like, it's, it's factually, it's like, um, it's, it's, it's unthinkable.

2388
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,400
It's unthinkable.

2389
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:56,400
It's unthinkable.

2390
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,040
A fight, a fight that a killer would lose simply wouldn't occur.

2391
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,120
They wouldn't allow it.

2392
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,240
So that's my answer to that.

2393
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:05,960
Uh, uh, uh, it's simple, it's simple logic.

2394
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:06,960
Next one.

2395
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,000
I don't like the, I don't like the name of it, um, but I guess I'll play it.

2396
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,040
It's called, it's called trunes.

2397
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:18,520
So that's, that's bad, uh, three, three, two, one, go.

2398
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:23,200
You guys ever noticed that like half like the trannies you see online are like not even

2399
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,200
real trannies.

2400
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,420
They're just like fetishists.

2401
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,920
I think it's really gross.

2402
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,520
What do you guys think?

2403
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:35,440
I don't, uh, I don't, I don't know if we should, I don't want to paint in such broad strokes.

2404
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:39,960
I don't know if we want to be generalized enough to answer that question one way or the

2405
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,960
other.

2406
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:41,960
So I'm just going to let it be.

2407
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,960
I don't know.

2408
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,720
I don't feel about that.

2409
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,720
Okay.

2410
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:46,720
Next one.

2411
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:49,760
Uh, uh, it's called not racist, just don't like them.

2412
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,760
Oh God.

2413
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,760
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't,

2414
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:57,400
yeah, here we go, here we go, three, two, one, go.

2415
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,400
Like yeah.

2416
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,800
I'm an anti-Semite.

2417
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:04,840
No, I don't support a group of people who ritualistically mutilate their children.

2418
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:11,840
You got a problem with that, buddy?

2419
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,600
Something, something, Adrena Chrome blood libel.

2420
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:22,520
Uh, uh, next one's called Yup, three, two, three, two, one, go.

2421
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:30,520
Okay, so that last voicemail was pretty good, huh? Can I get a voice grail? Yeah. Yeah.

2422
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:35,520
I'm getting a voice grail for sure. Ha ha, beast.

2423
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,520
Maybe if you dabbed, but he didn't do it. He didn't pull the trigger.

2424
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,520
Well.

2425
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,520
Alright.

2426
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,520
So close.

2427
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:51,520
You know what? I gotta say, I gotta say, I don't agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death.

2428
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:57,520
You're right to say it. And, you know, the more I think about it, the more I think that maybe you've made some,

2429
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:05,520
hmm, maybe made some good points here today. Maybe I should go look up a YouTube video touching on some of these topics you've raised

2430
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:12,520
and just kind of let the algorithm autoplay me some more about them afterwards and just kind of see where that takes me.

2431
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,520
Hmm. Hmm. Sounds like an adventure.

2432
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,520
Don't try this at home, kids.

2433
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:25,520
Next one is 29. Three, two, one, go.

2434
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,520
Alright, I called in last week and Ben St. said, and I quote,

2435
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:35,520
Oh God, this guy must be so powerful. And I am here to say, no, my friend, you are powerful.

2436
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,520
Also, sorry for possibly contributing to the samurai's loss of voice grail.

2437
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,520
Until next time, sayonara.

2438
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:56,520
Okay, can you summarize that for me because, and I don't know, I'm embarrassed to admit this, but my utorrent software started playing an ad for Wendy's

2439
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:02,520
while that was playing, and I don't know how to stop it.

2440
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:07,520
So instead of that, I just heard an ad for Wendy's.

2441
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:16,520
Well, he just said that you called him, he was too powerful last week about something, and he's like, he's not too powerful.

2442
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:20,520
And he's sorry that he might have fucked up the samurai getting voice grail.

2443
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,520
Why would you be sorry for fucking up the samurai? That guy's a fucking asshole.

2444
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:31,520
I have no idea. Also, Ben, uninstall utorrent immediately, get qubit torrent, it's ad free, you fool, you absolute rude.

2445
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,520
Utorrent fucking sucks, it used to be good.

2446
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:39,520
Yeah, but now, qbit torrent, get it, open source, free, no ads.

2447
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:40,520
How do you spell that?

2448
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,520
Just qbit torrent.

2449
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
I will look into that.

2450
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:55,520
Yeah, utorrent used to be good now, every now and then it plays an ad, and it makes all these like clicking noises.

2451
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:04,520
Like, sometimes it just makes noises like a mouse is clicking in the background of my computer, and it's like very weird and gross.

2452
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,520
Yeah, I hate it.

2453
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,520
No, no, no, qbit torrent is silent and doesn't do any of that shit. It's just good. It's just good.

2454
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:18,520
Thank you for the tip. Much better.

2455
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,520
Alright, next one is from Encouraging Words.

2456
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,520
Alright.

2457
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,520
3, 2, 1, go.

2458
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,520
No, Nate.

2459
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:30,520
Yes, watch. See you next week.

2460
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:34,520
You left that comment in the comments, and he was so-

2461
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,520
I'm glad to hear the audio version.

2462
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:40,520
And you're so proud of it that he had to put it in a voicemail.

2463
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:44,520
Well, it's an obvious pun, it could have been somebody else who knows.

2464
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,520
No, it was the same.

2465
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:51,520
I know who left this, and I know his comment.

2466
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,520
This is that guy. This is voicemail god.

2467
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:59,520
I've revealed that I do not know the community as well as I should. Shame.

2468
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:11,520
Are you aware that that really racist guy, that transphobe guy before, was the same as a keto kitchen or whatever?

2469
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,520
Take a bite, change your life.

2470
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,520
Now that you mention it, they are like the same voice.

2471
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,520
What was the name of that? Was it Keto Kitchen? Keto Cooking?

2472
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,520
Was there more to it? Fuck.

2473
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,520
Do you remember?

2474
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,520
I don't remember the exact phrase.

2475
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,520
I just remember take a bite, change your life.

2476
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,520
I do remember that as well.

2477
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,520
There's just so many bits. It's hard to keep track of all these bits.

2478
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,520
There's been a lot of bits.

2479
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:45,520
I guess we've been doing voicemails still feel like a new thing,

2480
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,520
but I guess we've actually been doing them for a pretty long time now, haven't we?

2481
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:52,520
What we're going to have to do is, one, we inevitably completely run out of gas.

2482
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:55,520
We're just going to have to do the recap episode of the PCP.

2483
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,520
We'll just have one of the best voicemails.

2484
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:09,520
We just send in audio clips of our own show to ourselves to listen to and then comment on.

2485
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:11,520
We should do...

2486
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,520
That's a good bonus episode.

2487
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:18,520
What if we did for a bonus episode?

2488
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:27,520
What if we did a commentary track for old PCP episodes?

2489
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,520
I like this idea.

2490
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,520
I said that like a joke, but as I was saying it, I was like, I kind of think it's a good idea.

2491
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:38,520
Go back to episode two and just...

2492
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,520
Yeah.

2493
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,520
Yeah, I think that would be funny.

2494
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:43,520
Okay.

2495
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:46,520
All right, we'll put that on the burner.

2496
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,520
Put that on the maybe pile.

2497
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
Yeah, we should do that at some point.

2498
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,520
Anyway, thanks for watching Nate or No Nate.

2499
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
We're Rain, Wind or Shine.

2500
01:57:56,520 --> 01:58:00,520
Next one, just your friendly neighborhood snowman.

2501
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:03,520
Three, two, one, go.

2502
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:09,520
So as a Northern Norwegian that uses words like she for clocks and he for cars all the time,

2503
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:17,520
I am perplexed by you saying that English has gender imbued in its language.

2504
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:24,520
But then I realized right at my doorstep, there is this little language called Finnish,

2505
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:28,520
which doesn't even have gendered pronouns to refer to people.

2506
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:32,520
So you just say it to girls and it to boys.

2507
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:42,520
Which is, you know, that's something to add to your ideas about gender and language, I think.

2508
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:55,520
And how their gendered system worked in society before they got too influenced by the Swedes and the Russians.

2509
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,520
So get on that, people.

2510
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,520
I'm not really into that, but hey.

2511
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:11,520
Unironically, I think that's like a huge barrier to like the gender kind of conversation in general,

2512
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:15,520
is that they're creating more complexity instead of simplifying.

2513
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,520
And I think people just have a general aversion to more complexity.

2514
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:23,520
Instead of creating like dozens and dozens of pronouns that you have to ask for,

2515
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:28,520
make one, just like get rid of gendered pronouns all together and just have a singular pronoun

2516
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,520
that refers to everybody that covers all the bases.

2517
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:36,520
And that would have made it so much easier and caused so many jokes to no longer be effective.

2518
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:41,520
I mean, we literally, we have that, we just have they, we have singular they.

2519
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,520
Right.

2520
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:46,520
Yeah, like, I don't know.

2521
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:52,520
People, you know, people that are people that that are like all these neo pronouns.

2522
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:57,520
Like if we had just gone in that direction for the beginning, there'd be no attack helicopter meme.

2523
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:03,520
None of that would would work because it's just like, oh, it's a real word that already exists and we're simplifying language

2524
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,520
instead of making it more complex.

2525
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:10,520
Gender critical people or whatever, you know, they say that like, oh, I don't know.

2526
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:14,520
I think they see it as like, oh, all this, all this trans shit, all this gender shit.

2527
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
Like, why is it so complicated?

2528
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:19,520
Like, gender is like these people whole identity or whatever.

2529
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:28,520
But yeah, like, no, I think it makes more sense to think of it as a reaction to, you know, an overly complicated like social system we have.

2530
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:37,520
You know, why do we need to have, why, why must our language be constructed in a way that one must specify gender when referring to someone by a pronoun?

2531
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:38,520
There's no need for it.

2532
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
It didn't have to be that way.

2533
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:43,520
Yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty good.

2534
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,520
Finish on what's up.

2535
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,520
It's pretty cool.

2536
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:48,520
I didn't, I didn't know that.

2537
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:51,520
I wonder if there's probably other, there must be other languages to do it.

2538
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,520
There can't just be some.

2539
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,520
Yeah, for sure.

2540
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,520
Yeah, for sure.

2541
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:55,520
Okay, next one.

2542
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,520
Elmo's got a gun.

2543
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,520
Oh, oh dear.

2544
02:00:58,520 --> 02:00:59,520
All right.

2545
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,520
Three, two, one, go.

2546
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:16,520
And the power they took from the people will return to the people.

2547
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:20,520
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

2548
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:26,520
Too bad the technological singularity is coming when we're going to defeat death.

2549
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:29,520
Yeah, I hate, I hate that.

2550
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,520
Definitely not looking forward to that.

2551
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:37,520
What did that have to do with Elmo?

2552
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,520
I don't know.

2553
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:39,520
Was that a quote from someone?

2554
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,520
I like, I feel like I'm,

2555
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,520
what's that, what's that movie fucking?

2556
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,520
Oh my God, it's from a movie.

2557
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,520
I'm trying to remember which one it is.

2558
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,520
Give me a hint.

2559
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:53,520
I'm blanking on everything.

2560
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,520
I can see, I can see the clip of it in my brain.

2561
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,520
Were the worlds?

2562
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,520
No.

2563
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,520
Citizen Kane?

2564
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:01,520
No, yes.

2565
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,520
No, not citizen Kane.

2566
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
I don't, I don't remember.

2567
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,520
Is it Charlie Chaplin's the dictator?

2568
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,520
It might be.

2569
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,520
I think that is what it's from.

2570
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:10,520
Huh.

2571
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,520
I think so.

2572
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:16,520
That is the movie I was thinking of, but I could be wrong about my reference.

2573
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:17,520
You know, I said that as a joke.

2574
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,520
It's like the speech in that movie is,

2575
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,520
wait, I haven't actually ever seen it.

2576
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:25,520
I feel like the speech is from Charlie Chaplin,

2577
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:29,520
like in character as Hitler, or as like a Hitler analog.

2578
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:32,520
And I don't feel like that's something that you would say if you were trying to be Hitler.

2579
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,520
I haven't seen the movie, but my understanding,

2580
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,520
my understanding is that the, isn't at the end of the movie,

2581
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,520
there's like a speech where like breaks character,

2582
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,520
and like it's like a kind of an offlifting thing.

2583
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,520
I'm not sure.

2584
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,520
Maybe I'm wrong.

2585
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,520
That might be right.

2586
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:47,520
That might be right.

2587
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:48,520
I don't know.

2588
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:49,520
I haven't seen it.

2589
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:50,520
Well, give it a week.

2590
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,520
We'll find out in the comments if we're completely botching this.

2591
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,520
I hope so.

2592
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,520
I would appreciate it.

2593
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,520
I appreciate knowing.

2594
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,520
Let us know in the comments.

2595
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,520
Not in a respectful, corrective way,

2596
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:01,520
but in a you fucking idiots kind of way.

2597
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:05,520
I mean, honestly, honestly, just like insulting us for,

2598
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,520
with that, like I would be, that would be.

2599
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,520
It's fair.

2600
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,520
It would be fair.

2601
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,520
It would be refreshing to be insulted for something that like,

2602
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:16,520
we genuinely fucked up, you know, you know, you're right.

2603
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:17,520
I'll take that.

2604
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,520
That's an improvement as uncomfortable as it would be.

2605
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:21,520
Okay.

2606
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:24,520
Next one is we no longer hear technology.

2607
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:27,520
Three, two, one, go.

2608
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,520
Booms and busts are built under the pillars of capitalism.

2609
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,520
There will always be people who starve and there will always be people

2610
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,520
who kill themselves because of economic depressions.

2611
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:36,520
Money is debt.

2612
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:40,520
The internet shows us how hopeless human beings can be when they are unlucky

2613
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,520
and find themselves with beliefs.

2614
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:46,520
Like the hyper object called the economy is worth more than human lives.

2615
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,520
They weren't so stupid.

2616
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:52,520
We could instead build an economy at its core that cared about human lives.

2617
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,520
But that's capitalist realism.

2618
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,520
And now Mark Fisher and David Graber are dead.

2619
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:00,520
I'm going to go back to playing anti-platformers,

2620
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:03,520
hugging my pillow and listening to Jungle Now.

2621
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:15,520
Some real shit.

2622
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,520
That was some real shit.

2623
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:20,520
Resource-based economy now.

2624
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,520
I didn't know Mark Fisher.

2625
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,520
Mark Frisco was based.

2626
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:25,520
Rest in power, my dude.

2627
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,520
Mark Fisher must be the guy who wrote capitalist realism.

2628
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,520
I didn't know he was dead.

2629
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:35,520
David Graber debt the first 5,000 years and many other good books.

2630
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,520
Also dead recently.

2631
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,520
Nobody knows of what actually.

2632
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:40,520
Nobody knows.

2633
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:43,520
They haven't released what was his cause of death.

2634
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,520
They said it was like lung related.

2635
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,520
So I thought it might have been COVID.

2636
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,520
But I think they're saying that it's not.

2637
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:53,520
They say David Graber died of natural causes.

2638
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,520
They say don't worry, it was natural.

2639
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:57,520
But I don't know what that means.

2640
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,520
That sounds like someone who killed them.

2641
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,520
Not naturally would say.

2642
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:03,520
Oh jeez.

2643
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:06,520
Let me say it like that.

2644
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,520
When you say it like that, it sounds a little sinister.

2645
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:09,520
Oh god.

2646
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:12,520
You're saying that by not releasing the official story of what happened,

2647
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:15,520
we're going to start creating fucking fanfics.

2648
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:18,520
I mean, I just...

2649
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,520
We've been played.

2650
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,520
We've been played by the world.

2651
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:24,520
Someone who opposed the...

2652
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,520
I don't see how someone who spent his life opposing the interests of capital

2653
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:32,520
would have had any enemies that would have wanted him dead.

2654
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,520
That just seems like a ridiculous thing to say.

2655
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:36,520
And you should apologize.

2656
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:37,520
I'm sorry.

2657
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:41,520
I'm definitely speaking irresponsibly.

2658
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,520
Thank you. That's big of you.

2659
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:46,520
I'm going to go check on my stocks right now.

2660
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:48,520
Next up, Cross.

2661
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
Arlo was right.

2662
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:53,520
3, 2, 1, go.

2663
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,520
I just got Super Mario 3D All Stars and as a zoomer,

2664
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:59,520
that means I was playing Super Mario 64 for the first time ever.

2665
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,520
And Jesus Christ, Arlo was right.

2666
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,520
The sideways somersault jump is amazing.

2667
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:07,520
I come every time I use it.

2668
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:09,520
What do you guys think of Super Mario 3D All Stars?

2669
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,520
If you have it and also fuck the commenters,

2670
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,520
no Nate, yes watch.

2671
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,520
Fuck yeah.

2672
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,520
No Nate, yes watch.

2673
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:19,520
No Nate, yes watch.

2674
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,520
No Nate, yes watch.

2675
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,520
Let's get a chant going in the comments.

2676
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,520
No Nate, yes watch.

2677
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,520
That's our new mantra.

2678
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,520
Should I make a fucking t-shirt of it?

2679
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:37,520
Maybe, maybe I just fucking will.

2680
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,520
I'm feeling a little mischievous.

2681
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:41,520
Feeling a little mischievous today.

2682
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,520
Can't wait to sell zero copies of that shirt too.

2683
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:45,520
Yeah, but you know what?

2684
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:47,520
It'll make our catalog look nice.

2685
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,520
That's true.

2686
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:53,520
Super Mario 3D All Stars, was that the one?

2687
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:56,520
Yeah, they released it for Switch last week.

2688
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:59,520
It's Mario Galaxy, Mario Sunshine and Mario 64,

2689
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,520
all ported for the Switch.

2690
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:03,520
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

2691
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,520
I have a bone to pick with Mario 64 on that.

2692
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
They took out Solange Bowser.

2693
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
Oh, I saw that.

2694
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,520
I saw that.

2695
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,520
Unacceptable.

2696
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,520
Unacceptable.

2697
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,520
Why does he say Solange Bowser?

2698
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:22,520
It's supposed to be Solange King Bowser,

2699
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,520
is what it's actually saying.

2700
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,520
Solange King Bowser?

2701
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,520
Charles Martinet.

2702
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:31,520
Yeah, he confirmed it in a response to Twitter a couple years back.

2703
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,520
Solange Bowser?

2704
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,520
But I guess it just, the heat was too much for Nintendo to take,

2705
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,520
and then Switch just says bye-bye now or some gay shit like that.

2706
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:43,520
You know, I was never super great at Mario 64.

2707
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,520
I did not master like things like the sideways long jump or whatever.

2708
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,520
I'm pretty basic at it.

2709
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:57,520
I think I got 120 stars on the DS port or remake or whatever.

2710
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:59,520
I did too.

2711
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:05,520
Yeah, but I don't think I ever really mastered Mario.

2712
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:09,520
He's got these weird, all these crazy fucking jumps he can do in that game.

2713
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,520
His moveset is so fucking robust in 64.

2714
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,520
It's pretty impressive.

2715
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,520
It's like the first proper 3D game.

2716
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,520
Yeah, they were just like,

2717
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,520
it's almost, they just had like an endless war mentality.

2718
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,520
Just add more features, more fucking features.

2719
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:29,520
If there's any combination of things that we can fit a new jump into,

2720
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:31,520
let's just give them more jumps.

2721
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,520
Just put parallel universes in there, it's fine, just do it.

2722
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:37,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2723
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,520
So that's what I think about it.

2724
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:43,520
No, I haven't played the remake.

2725
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,520
I have, I bought it, but I don't plan on playing it because for some reason

2726
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:51,520
Nintendo's only selling it for seven months and then they're stopping printing.

2727
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,520
So I'm just going to hold on to that for a couple of years.

2728
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:58,520
Because a Nintendo game never is worth less than like retail price.

2729
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:01,520
So I have nothing to lose in everything to potentially gain.

2730
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,520
Oh, you bought a physical copy.

2731
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,520
Yeah, I bought a physical copy and I'm just going to hold on to it for a while

2732
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:08,520
to see if it accumulates any value.

2733
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:11,520
Really? You saw it as like an investment opportunity?

2734
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:14,520
Yeah, you know, why not?

2735
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:17,520
I mean, I already own all the games on their original platforms.

2736
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,520
I'm not like I'm missing out on anything.

2737
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:22,520
And it sounds like the ports aren't even that great because like the,

2738
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:27,520
for Sunshine specific, like for Sunshine, like the whole like flood mechanic

2739
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,520
works with the pressure sensitive triggers, which the switch doesn't have.

2740
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,520
So you lose some control there.

2741
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:36,520
And then Galaxy was all about pointing with the Wiimote and there's no Wiimote on the switch.

2742
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:40,520
So both those sound like nightmares to play and then 64 plays fine on everything.

2743
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:42,520
Why the fuck do you even buy it?

2744
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,520
Hmm.

2745
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,520
Unless you're a Zoomer.

2746
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,520
Did you ever play the one on DS?

2747
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,520
Yeah.

2748
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,520
Yeah, okay.

2749
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,520
They added all these characters.

2750
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,520
That was pretty neat.

2751
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,520
That was pretty cool.

2752
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,520
You started Yoshi.

2753
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:55,520
It was cool.

2754
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:56,520
It was a cool little subversion.

2755
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,520
But you started Yoshi?

2756
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:00,520
Yeah, you started Yoshi in the beginning of that game.

2757
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,520
I don't even remember.

2758
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,520
You have to find Mario.

2759
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:03,520
Yeah, dude.

2760
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:09,520
I remember finding Luigi and Mario and Wario and I guess Yoshi's the fourth one.

2761
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,520
I remember there were four.

2762
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:11,520
Yeah.

2763
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,520
Yeah.

2764
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:15,520
I had a little mini-game said like we're gimmicks with the touch screen.

2765
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,520
Like you could play like Blackjack with Luigi and shit.

2766
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,520
It was weird.

2767
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,520
It's a weird fucking game.

2768
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,520
Yeah.

2769
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:28,520
Next one is from Antonio P. 321 ago.

2770
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:29,520
Hello.

2771
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,520
My question is, is the universe real?

2772
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,520
Yeah.

2773
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:41,520
Okay, next up we got Oblivion Fool.

2774
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,520
The universe has to be real.

2775
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:44,520
What would it even mean?

2776
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:47,520
What would it even mean for the universe not to be real?

2777
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:55,520
Well, I mean, isn't the kind of idea that once a species advances enough, they'll create

2778
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,520
a digital reality.

2779
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:02,520
And since that can happen multiple times, the odds are that you exist in a fake reality

2780
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:06,520
as opposed to a real one because there's only one real reality.

2781
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:09,520
Oh, yeah.

2782
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:10,520
I guess.

2783
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:14,520
I guess we could be living in a simulated reality inside of.

2784
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,520
That's an Elon Musk talking point though.

2785
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:20,520
So I don't know how much you want to get into that.

2786
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:24,520
Like then the simulated reality is still real, right?

2787
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:26,520
It's not like.

2788
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:30,520
I mean, it depends on, I guess, semantically how you want to get into it because even if

2789
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:35,520
we exist in a simulated reality, that simulated reality exists in reality somewhere.

2790
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:42,520
I mean, a video game really exists, even if it's just code or whatever.

2791
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:47,520
Did you know lights in video games use real electricity, bro?

2792
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:48,520
It's true.

2793
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,520
It's true.

2794
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:52,520
Can you imagine?

2795
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:57,520
If you're asking, is the universe a simulation?

2796
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:59,520
Questions like that.

2797
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:00,520
I hope so.

2798
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,520
I hope so.

2799
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,520
Please questions like that.

2800
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:05,520
I don't even like put too much stock into not because I don't think they're interesting

2801
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:11,520
thought experiments, but because it doesn't affect your life in any real way.

2802
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:12,520
You know, it's the same.

2803
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:15,520
It's the same way as like arguing like a deterministic universe.

2804
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:21,520
It's like, even if it is a deterministic universe, we all operate as if we have free will.

2805
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:26,520
So we still have to operate under that assumption because even if there is a deterministic universe,

2806
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:31,520
it's beyond our capacity as human beings to interact with or even understand.

2807
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,520
So like it's cool to think about, but it doesn't affect our lives in any way, shape, or form.

2808
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:41,520
It doesn't affect our lives, but like counterpoint, our lives are meaningless.

2809
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:47,520
So why even why care whether or not something affects them or not?

2810
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:53,520
Like why is why isn't any less valuable just because it doesn't affect our lives?

2811
02:12:54,520 --> 02:13:02,520
I guess my point there is not that like there are people who like I feel care too much about

2812
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:05,520
trying to figure out if there's a deterministic universe or not.

2813
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,520
And I just think it's cool to kind of like talk about when you're like half drunk with

2814
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:13,520
somebody, but like at the end of the day, it's not going to affect anything.

2815
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:17,520
Like there are more important tangible things you can focus your time and energy on.

2816
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,520
But what I'm saying is what I'm saying is what if the tangible things actually don't matter

2817
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:24,520
at all, which they don't, nothing matters.

2818
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,520
Our lives don't matter.

2819
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:30,520
So I mean, if you're like super fucking invested and like I need to figure this out,

2820
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:36,520
like it's no more or less relevant than anything else.

2821
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:43,520
But I just think there are more closer to the ground concepts that can better your own life

2822
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:47,520
than chasing the existential question like that.

2823
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:53,520
What I'm saying is your life better worse.

2824
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,520
It's all an illusion.

2825
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:56,520
Your life is nothing.

2826
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:58,520
You're just dust in the wind anyway.

2827
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:00,520
You know what I'm saying?

2828
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:07,520
So like you still exist as a human being like with with your own likes and dislikes and

2829
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:08,520
things you want to do.

2830
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:13,520
And so like just from that very selfish perspective, you know, pursue things that affect you on

2831
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:16,520
that level, I suppose, and like the community around you.

2832
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:17,520
Sure.

2833
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,520
I mean, of course, but I don't know.

2834
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:28,520
I really, I really, really want this universe to be a simulation.

2835
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:32,520
But so I don't know.

2836
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,520
That that's it.

2837
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:34,520
I guess that's it.

2838
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,520
I just really want to.

2839
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,520
And when I think about it, I think, boy, I sure hope the answer is yes.

2840
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:44,520
What a damn fucking shame that I will never know if it is or not.

2841
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:46,520
I think that's like the brain we're in part of it, right?

2842
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:50,520
Because it's just like, but I want to know.

2843
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,520
Yeah.

2844
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:57,520
I mean, more so than knowing I want it to be true, even if I don't know.

2845
02:14:57,520 --> 02:14:59,520
That's that's that's where I'm at with it.

2846
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,520
There'd be a little bit of relief, wouldn't it?

2847
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:03,520
It's like, oh, this wasn't even real anyway.

2848
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:04,520
Oh, sure.

2849
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:05,520
Sure.

2850
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:06,520
It would be a relief.

2851
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:07,520
It would be a relief if it were true and I were to find out.

2852
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,520
I'd be like, oh, fuck.

2853
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:09,520
Yeah.

2854
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,520
But like, I don't know.

2855
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,520
Still.

2856
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:17,520
It's it's it's comforting to think that it is that it could be true.

2857
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:21,520
And if it were true, if it were true, it would be a comfort.

2858
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:27,520
And so to imagine, I guess even just to imagine that it is true is like sort of a relief, I guess.

2859
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,520
I guess that's how people view religion.

2860
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:33,520
But that's just kind of, but then that kind of stresses me out because I'm aware.

2861
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,520
Like, well, I mean, I don't, I don't actually know.

2862
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:41,520
And like, when I think about it, it's like, well, okay, imagining it being true,

2863
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,520
it actually just raises the very real possibility that it isn't true.

2864
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:47,520
This is the real world and all that exists.

2865
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:52,520
And it is just, you know, a big fucking problem.

2866
02:15:52,520 --> 02:16:00,520
And I'm terrified now to have contemplated that quite possibly true fact.

2867
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:02,520
Oh, dear.

2868
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:07,520
So I guess in that way, I would say, yeah, probably best not to think about it,

2869
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:11,520
not because it's not a useful thing to think about, because nothing is useful,

2870
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:15,520
but because it upsets me.

2871
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,520
Tram.

2872
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,520
Okay, enough.

2873
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:25,520
Next one is from Oblivion Fool.

2874
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,520
Haha.

2875
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:28,520
Three, two, one, go.

2876
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:37,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

2877
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:39,520
I like the number nine. Hello, guys.

2878
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:40,520
It's me, Oblivion Fool.

2879
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:44,520
I've been counting the numbers on Speakpipe because I'm losing my fucking mind.

2880
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:47,520
The last week has been an absolute fucking clusterfuck of bullshit.

2881
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:48,520
Mostly good.

2882
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,520
Some a little bit bad.

2883
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:53,520
The good stuff is a million views on the new ComeZone.

2884
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,520
Sick.

2885
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,520
20,000 new subscribers in a single week.

2886
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:57,520
What the fuck?

2887
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:58,520
That's cool.

2888
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:04,520
A little bit daunting is the fact that I'm working on merch for Welcome to the ComeZone

2889
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:09,520
only to discover that another YouTuber, Dakooters, who has way more subscribers than me,

2890
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:12,520
is already selling Welcome to the ComeZone merch.

2891
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:14,520
Like, what the fuck?

2892
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:18,520
Like, I'm the one who's supposed to do that, but I guess I'll just compete.

2893
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:19,520
I don't know.

2894
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:20,520
I'm going to make shirts.

2895
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,520
Should I bother with mugs?

2896
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:25,520
I feel like the mugs are fucking waste of time, but I don't know.

2897
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:33,520
On a side note, a few fans of the PCP and PCP adjacent discords have let me know that

2898
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:40,520
they don't appreciate the big-titty mommy-milker semen demon that I put in my ComeZone video.

2899
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:42,520
They say, the booby too big.

2900
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,520
If only the boobies were smaller.

2901
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:46,520
It's like, fuck off, dude.

2902
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,520
You're an absolute fucking coward.

2903
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,520
What are you afraid of?

2904
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:51,520
Big booby can't hurt you.

2905
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:53,520
Why are you siding with the police?

2906
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:54,520
Fuck the police.

2907
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:56,520
Fuck the big-titty police especially.

2908
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,520
And fuck you!

2909
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:02,520
Um, yeah.

2910
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:04,520
Yeah, I don't disagree with any of that.

2911
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:08,520
I, well, now I'm curious to see the big booby.

2912
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,520
Okay.

2913
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,520
So, alright.

2914
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:15,520
Hey, I feel like I'm missing some context here.

2915
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:18,520
Are you familiar with Welcome to the ComeZone?

2916
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,520
It's that song, right?

2917
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:21,520
What song?

2918
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,520
Oh god, now I gotta find it.

2919
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:28,520
Uh, it was just that like weird like visualizer thing with PCP guy in the center

2920
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:32,520
with like that digitized voice just talks about like, come and shit.

2921
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:35,520
I mean, I've, I've never seen this before.

2922
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:37,520
We definitely all listen to it.

2923
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:40,520
I've never seen this before.

2924
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:43,520
It's like the first result right here on.

2925
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:46,520
Yeah, you know, I see it now. I see it now.

2926
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,520
You've never seen this?

2927
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:49,520
No, I've, what is this?

2928
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:51,520
We all, this is like years ago.

2929
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,520
It's like from two years ago and we, we've,

2930
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:56,520
I'm pretty sure we listened to it in a voicemail or something like that.

2931
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,520
Maybe it's just long enough.

2932
02:18:58,520 --> 02:18:59,520
Okay.

2933
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,520
Okay.

2934
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:01,520
Well, so.

2935
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:04,520
I'm like legitimately surprised this has almost 6 million views.

2936
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:05,520
I had no idea.

2937
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:08,520
That's incredible.

2938
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:13,520
How does it, how does this have 6 million views?

2939
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:16,520
I think it's like, isn't it like a mix of like,

2940
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:20,520
actual like real songs that just happens to use visualization?

2941
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:24,520
Tangentially related to our show.

2942
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:27,520
Cause there's links to like infected mushroom songs and stuff.

2943
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:28,520
It's, it's.

2944
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:31,520
What is the world coming to that like, yeah,

2945
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:35,520
there's a link in the description to subscribe to the procrastinators.

2946
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:36,520
On this video.

2947
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:37,520
Yeah.

2948
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:41,520
Six, six million people watch this video and didn't read the description

2949
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:43,520
and subscribe to the procrastinators.

2950
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:44,520
They didn't do it.

2951
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:47,520
I mean, oblivion falls got 61 K subs.

2952
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,520
Just do that.

2953
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:51,520
I mean, that's oblivion fall after dark.

2954
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:55,520
I don't, I don't know how much on this other channel.

2955
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,520
Okay.

2956
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:57,520
Okay, whatever.

2957
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:59,520
You know, this is great and all, but like I'm,

2958
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,520
what was that about the big booby?

2959
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,520
I don't, I don't see any big booby in this video.

2960
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:07,520
I'm not sure, actually.

2961
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:11,520
I was too distracted by thinking about big boobies and I wasn't listening to anything else.

2962
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:14,520
Oh, wait, I.

2963
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:15,520
Okay.

2964
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:19,520
There's another video on his channel that's called your come won't last,

2965
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:24,520
which sounds like a similar song and it's kind of got a similar visualizer.

2966
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:28,520
I mean, there's like some I go faces in this video,

2967
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,520
but like, no, I don't see any titties.

2968
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:31,520
No, no.

2969
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,520
Are you watching that your come won't last?

2970
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:34,520
No, no, no, I'm talking about the.

2971
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:35,520
Okay.

2972
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,520
I think he must be talking about because on your come won't last,

2973
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:40,520
there's a lady with the big booby mommy milkers.

2974
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:41,520
So.

2975
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:42,520
It's a good shit.

2976
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:43,520
That's not it.

2977
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:47,520
I mean, no, those are definitely not too big.

2978
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:49,520
Those are definitely not too big.

2979
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:50,520
Not even close.

2980
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:51,520
They are.

2981
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:53,520
I would actually say those are, those are, those are perfect.

2982
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,520
Those are, that's, those are my ideal right there.

2983
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,520
Just like that.

2984
02:20:56,520 --> 02:21:03,520
Too, too big for me is like a, a, a, a, a, like comical, like,

2985
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,520
like, like, like parody level.

2986
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:06,520
And these are not quite there.

2987
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:07,520
So.

2988
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:09,520
Perfecto.

2989
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:12,520
That's, that's what I think.

2990
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:14,520
On that question.

2991
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:15,520
Okay.

2992
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,520
I just want to give props to oblivion fall.

2993
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:21,520
Your come won't last for least September 11th, 2020.

2994
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:22,520
Based.

2995
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,520
Very based, very based.

2996
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:25,520
Okay.

2997
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,520
Good.

2998
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,520
Good to hear from oblivion fall.

2999
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:30,520
Make merch, slay all your enemies.

3000
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:32,520
Don't ask us for advice with scrubs.

3001
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:33,520
We don't know what the.

3002
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,520
Yeah.

3003
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,520
Zero, zero shirts sold.

3004
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,520
Yeah.

3005
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,520
Next up.

3006
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:40,520
Ben, you are cool.

3007
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:42,520
I have disagreement.

3008
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:43,520
Smiley face.

3009
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:44,520
Glitchy.

3010
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:46,520
Send at start.

3011
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:47,520
Frowny face.

3012
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:48,520
Okay.

3013
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:50,520
Maybe it's supposed to be sound.

3014
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:51,520
Oh yeah.

3015
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:52,520
Probably.

3016
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,520
All right.

3017
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:54,520
Three, two, one go.

3018
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:57,520
So I was catching up on the past two episodes of the podcast today.

3019
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:00,520
And there are a few situations where I feel like Ben in particular was

3020
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,520
looking at moral questions and too much of a vacuum.

3021
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:06,520
The first one being he went on like this fervent outburst on his

3022
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:10,520
discord about some woman that people on Twitter were calling sexy

3023
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:14,520
was actually very unattractive in his opinion.

3024
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:18,520
Obviously, if that woman does not see you saying these things in

3025
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,520
the discord, then she won't be hurt by it.

3026
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:22,520
But you have to look at it in the context of you posting it in a

3027
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:26,520
discord server where people are going to say, wow, Ben really

3028
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:30,520
just made a very hostile atmosphere about someone not appealing

3029
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:32,520
to his like subjective preferences.

3030
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:35,520
Obviously, that's going to make people feel like threatened and

3031
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,520
uncomfortable.

3032
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:37,520
You don't want to do that.

3033
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:41,520
You're just that is you are the asshole for that reason.

3034
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:42,520
Okay.

3035
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:46,520
So the other thing is the pornography of real people.

3036
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:49,520
You're saying you can't think of a reason why it would be bad if

3037
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:52,520
like the person does not see it.

3038
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:56,520
Obviously, it's the same type of thing where if they don't see it,

3039
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:59,520
then yeah, I wouldn't be a problem for them.

3040
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:02,520
But if someone makes pornography of a real person disregarding

3041
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:05,520
like whether they would want that or not, then what that

3042
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:09,520
communicates is, hey, I'm willing to go behind people's backs and

3043
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:12,520
break like personal boundaries for the sake of commodifying

3044
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:14,520
them for my own personal gain.

3045
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:18,520
Obviously, that is just going to again make people feel uncomfortable

3046
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,520
and like threatened by doing that.

3047
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:22,520
So you should not do it.

3048
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:25,520
Yeah.

3049
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:26,520
Okay.

3050
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:27,520
I'm not going to lie.

3051
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:28,520
I turned out of that whole thing.

3052
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:29,520
Okay.

3053
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:30,520
All right.

3054
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:31,520
All right.

3055
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:33,520
I have some, I have some.

3056
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:34,520
All right.

3057
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:38,520
About the discord thing, I understand why it was a little,

3058
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:42,520
maybe a little too hostile and why people wouldn't like it.

3059
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:45,520
And I'm not even going to say like, oh, these people are just

3060
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:46,520
being too sensitive.

3061
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:47,520
It's fine.

3062
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:55,520
However, I just, you know, you know, actually no, I don't have anything

3063
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:56,520
else to say about that.

3064
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:57,520
It's fine.

3065
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,520
I'll leave it at that.

3066
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:03,520
But on the, okay, about the, these are like, about the porn

3067
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:08,520
thing, like, I don't know, are you assuming, are you assuming

3068
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:11,520
that they're making the porn to sell it?

3069
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,520
You're like, is that the assumption here?

3070
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,520
Because you said they're commodifying it.

3071
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:21,520
I mean, I think that probably it is illegal to make, to sell.

3072
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,520
Like a person owns their own likeness, right?

3073
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:29,520
You can't like sell, you can't like sell a person's likeness

3074
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,520
unless it's like for the purpose of like criticism or critique

3075
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:34,520
or parody, right?

3076
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:38,520
So like if you were going to make, yeah, it would be wrong to like

3077
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:42,520
make and sell porn of someone to commodify them that way,

3078
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:46,520
unless it were some kind of like statement about a public figure

3079
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:50,520
for the purpose of commentary.

3080
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:53,520
But if you just, if it's, if you're just talking about like just

3081
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,520
the act of like drawing someone naked, like, I don't know,

3082
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:01,520
because you just, because you want to see it or even just because

3083
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:07,520
other people want to see it, like, I don't know.

3084
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:13,520
I don't, I think, I don't, I can't think of, I mean, are you

3085
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:17,520
saying, is this an argument that like one, one mustn't do it?

3086
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,520
Or is it an argument that like it's like wrong or like, like,

3087
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:24,520
it's mean or like it's bad or it's rude?

3088
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:27,520
Because like, I would agree that it's maybe rude or unkind even,

3089
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:32,520
but like, I, like, I'm drawing the line at saying like,

3090
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:36,520
oh, but you shouldn't do it because I'm, I don't know.

3091
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:40,520
I don't, I just, just because I think something is like wrong

3092
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:45,520
or unkind, I am not willing to make the leap to, you know,

3093
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:50,520
therefore it is, it is, it is something that no one should do

3094
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:54,520
ever.

3095
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:56,520
Ben confirmed okay with racism.

3096
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:57,520
That's right.

3097
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:58,520
Yes, true.

3098
02:25:58,520 --> 02:25:59,520
Got him.

3099
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:00,520
Click that.

3100
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:06,520
Um, but like, I'm just kind of, I just kind of think,

3101
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:09,520
I just kind of think people, I'm, I just don't, I'm not,

3102
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,520
I don't like cops.

3103
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:13,520
I don't like cops and people like, oh, people shouldn't,

3104
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:14,520
oh, people shouldn't do that thing.

3105
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:18,520
Oh, well you did that thing and that thing was wrong because it,

3106
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,520
because of this, that and that reasons and it was,

3107
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:23,520
and it was uncomfortable for these people and like,

3108
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:26,520
and they, they know they should, they should be a law like,

3109
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:28,520
no, that's cop behavior.

3110
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:31,520
Um, I don't know.

3111
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,520
Okay.

3112
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:33,520
Whatever.

3113
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:34,520
Fair, fair enough.

3114
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:35,520
Fair criticism.

3115
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:36,520
All right.

3116
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:38,520
Thanks for speaking your piece, idiot.

3117
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:39,520
Next one.

3118
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:41,520
Utilitarianism and holy shit, bro.

3119
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:43,520
Titties and boobies.

3120
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:45,520
Three, two, one, go.

3121
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:47,520
Like, okay, morality.

3122
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:51,520
Like, why not just say like, if something increases overall well-being

3123
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:53,520
in the system, then it is good.

3124
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:57,520
And if it decreases overall well-being, then it is bad.

3125
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:00,520
Like, dude, like, what the fuck dude?

3126
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,520
Like, holy shit, bro.

3127
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:05,520
Fucking titties, fucking boobies.

3128
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:06,520
Okay.

3129
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,520
Well, the really obvious rebuttal is to then,

3130
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:11,520
then you have to quantify well-being and how do you do that?

3131
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:13,520
That's the, that's the answer.

3132
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:16,520
So when you've, when you've, when you've worked that out,

3133
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:19,520
make another voicemail and lay out your.

3134
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,520
Not to mention well-being for some people can be bad for other people.

3135
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:25,520
And so you have the moral question becomes, okay,

3136
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:29,520
is it okay to fuck up some people's lives for the benefit of others?

3137
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,520
Which is the whole critique of utilitarianism in the first place.

3138
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:34,520
Yeah.

3139
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:35,520
Yeah, true.

3140
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:36,520
Yeah.

3141
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:39,520
Like, is it okay to like go and deliberately reduce one person's well-being

3142
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:43,520
because it will like, yeah, raise like more people?

3143
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,520
I guess that's kind of like, you know,

3144
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:47,520
the trolley problem question, right?

3145
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:50,520
Yeah, it's like, is it okay to deliberately kill this person

3146
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:52,520
because it will save these other people?

3147
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:53,520
Yeah.

3148
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:56,520
And like, yes.

3149
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:58,520
In the trolley problem, yes.

3150
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:01,520
Of course you pull the fucking lever.

3151
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,520
Well, I think, I think utilitarianism,

3152
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:06,520
utilitarianism works in like a binary situation like that,

3153
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:09,520
but the real world is often more complicated

3154
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:12,520
and utilitarianism breaks down with multiple variables.

3155
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:15,520
I mean, yeah.

3156
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:18,520
I mean, you're, you're just,

3157
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:21,520
I do think that probably at the end of the day,

3158
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:25,520
if you could, if you could like, prove mathematically that like,

3159
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:30,520
yes, a thing increases like overall well-being in the world,

3160
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:32,520
then maybe you could have an argument for,

3161
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:35,520
yeah, so it's okay to like fuck someone over because it...

3162
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:38,520
It's just tyranny of the majority at that point.

3163
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:40,520
Yeah, but like, but you can't prove it.

3164
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:42,520
You can't like, there's no formula that you could,

3165
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:44,520
you know, mathematically we can see that like,

3166
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:46,520
yes, murdering this person will,

3167
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:48,520
you know, create enough happiness to compensate

3168
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:52,520
in like the people at large or whatever, right?

3169
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:56,520
You just, there's just no foundation for it.

3170
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:58,520
That's the trouble.

3171
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,520
It's hard to define.

3172
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:03,520
Next up, phallic person, gear third.

3173
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:05,520
Three, two, one, go.

3174
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:08,520
Hey, I heard you had a big cock.

3175
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:11,520
Nice.

3176
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:22,520
I've heard this track before actually.

3177
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,520
Nice.

3178
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:26,520
Okay, well-being.

3179
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:28,520
Amazing.

3180
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:30,520
It's, it never gets old.

3181
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:32,520
No, never gets old.

3182
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:37,520
Three, and I hope that next time it's just every voicemail is just

3183
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:40,520
nice cock, bro, nice cock, bro, nice cock.

3184
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:41,520
Yeah.

3185
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:43,520
It's all, it's all I want to hear.

3186
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:49,520
Next up, zinthus schminthus schumilashimia.

3187
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:50,520
Cool.

3188
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:52,520
Three, two, one, go.

3189
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:58,520
Hey there, appreciate you.

3190
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:00,520
So basically,

3191
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:06,520
I've been trying to change my name for the past decade.

3192
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:10,520
On the internet, I mean, I'm trying to have like a cool name.

3193
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:12,520
That's not shit.

3194
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:13,520
Right.

3195
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:19,520
Because that, because of the age of internet, I had to like.

3196
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,520
This guy's such a fucking croon chair.

3197
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,520
Yeah.

3198
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:26,520
Basically decide my name at 12 years old.

3199
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:27,520
What?

3200
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:28,520
And, um.

3201
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,520
Oh, right.

3202
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:31,520
Fuck you.

3203
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:32,520
Fuck you.

3204
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:38,520
I ended up with schumia, which has always been, always been

3205
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:44,520
mispronounced, either by shimuya, shimila, shit like that.

3206
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:45,520
I said it right.

3207
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:46,520
I said schumia.

3208
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,520
I guess I put the answers wrong.

3209
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:53,520
I've been trying like xinthus with the cool Y and T-H's and X's and shit.

3210
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:54,520
Yeah.

3211
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:55,520
Azorath, Metreon, zinthus.

3212
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,520
That's right.

3213
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:57,520
That's good.

3214
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:58,520
Go for it.

3215
02:30:58,520 --> 02:30:59,520
Just do that.

3216
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:00,520
Problem solved.

3217
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:01,520
Do that.

3218
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:02,520
Yeah.

3219
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:03,520
It's a nightmare.

3220
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:04,520
How the fuck do you come up with an internet name?

3221
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:09,520
And how do you change it after 10 years of use where all your emails are named after

3222
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:10,520
it?

3223
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:11,520
You just do it.

3224
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:15,520
You don't need your emails to fucking match your internet handles because that's just

3225
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,520
for you.

3226
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:17,520
No, that's not public.

3227
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:18,520
Nobody sees that.

3228
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:19,520
My email is IAS.

3229
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:20,520
You can change your comic.

3230
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,520
You can change your Twitter handle at any time.

3231
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:23,520
You don't have to make a new account.

3232
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,520
You can just go to settings and change your Twitter handle.

3233
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:30,520
If you want to change your Twitter handle, just fucking do it.

3234
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:37,520
Also, here's a hot tip for if you want to change your Twitter handle, if you're at

3235
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:42,520
handle and it's already taken, just put an underscore after it because when people search

3236
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:45,760
for you, they'll just start typing and they'll never get to the underscore because they'll

3237
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:49,520
find your profile before it finishes.

3238
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:50,520
Yeah.

3239
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,520
But it's ugly.

3240
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:55,240
It's ugly having that underscore in there.

3241
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:56,240
It's fine.

3242
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,240
Yeah.

3243
02:31:57,240 --> 02:31:59,240
I mean, yeah, it doesn't matter.

3244
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:03,360
You just have the actual word in your name and nobody will notice because they'll type

3245
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:05,240
for it and they'll never get to have to type the underscore.

3246
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:07,240
It'll pop up and they're recommended before then and you're fine.

3247
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,240
You're cool.

3248
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:12,240
I mean, unless the person who's got the name has more followers than you, they'll never

3249
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:13,240
find you.

3250
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:15,240
They'll find that guy instead.

3251
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:18,000
I don't think so.

3252
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Take care.

3253
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,440
No, it's like a fish game, like an eater game.

3254
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:25,640
It's like get more followers than a person.

3255
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:30,480
Change your at handle to their name so that you come in on searches above them, so people

3256
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:37,080
looking for them find you and then you gain their followers and then once you grow, you

3257
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:42,600
pick someone else who you've now become bigger than and you just repeat, oh my god.

3258
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:43,600
That's it.

3259
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:44,600
That's how you do it.

3260
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:45,600
That's how you beat Twitter.

3261
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,160
It's how you become the top dog.

3262
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:50,880
Well, try it out and let me know how it works.

3263
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:51,880
I think it's foolproof.

3264
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:52,880
All right.

3265
02:32:52,880 --> 02:32:56,320
So anyways, that's how you that's how you fucking do it.

3266
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:59,880
Yeah, you just thought being afraid of it and just do it.

3267
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:00,880
Easy.

3268
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:01,880
Easy.

3269
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:02,880
Don't worry about the emails.

3270
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:08,080
I have like so many email accounts and they're all a clusterfuck, but it's just it's just

3271
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:09,080
the nature.

3272
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:14,120
Oh, it's it's really funny because because my the Alibaba account that I'm using is

3273
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:18,400
tied to the the ratty Frickers cop killers email.

3274
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:26,080
My name in there is like it's but the name listed on the site is rowdy fucker and like

3275
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:30,760
the lady that I'm talking to about like making pins and stuff calls me rowdy because I mean

3276
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:34,040
I'm sure she knows that that's not my real name, but like that's my listed name.

3277
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:35,680
So that's what she calls me.

3278
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,840
God, the killer himself being called a rowdy and you can't even correct it.

3279
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:41,840
I'm under cover.

3280
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:42,840
Nice.

3281
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:43,840
I'm on I'm undercover.

3282
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:49,280
You know, I'll place the blame on them if anything if things go south.

3283
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:51,480
Next up, funny jokes.

3284
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:56,280
Let's let's hope so three, two, one, go.

3285
02:33:56,280 --> 02:34:04,680
One I hear a funny joke, a man walks into a bar, ouch.

3286
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:07,760
What did one Frenchman say to the other?

3287
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:09,320
I have no idea.

3288
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:13,080
I don't speak French.

3289
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:16,240
Two muffins are sitting in the oven.

3290
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:19,880
One says, wow, it's hot in here.

3291
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:25,600
The other one says, sure is probably about 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

3292
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:38,480
Well, who's there to to who know to whom a horse walks into a bar.

3293
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:44,880
Well of the patrons quickly get up and leave realizing the potential danger of the situation.

3294
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,000
Love animals.

3295
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,880
You won't stop laughing at these animal memes.

3296
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:51,480
Click here to view them.

3297
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:52,480
Don't worry.

3298
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:58,000
I will eat my own ass.

3299
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,880
Do you have an explanation for this Tom?

3300
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:03,480
No, I do not.

3301
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:04,480
I.

3302
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:05,480
I.

3303
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:08,480
Well, I'm sorry.

3304
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:09,480
Viewers, I'm sorry.

3305
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:10,480
I'm sorry.

3306
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:12,480
We put you through that.

3307
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:13,480
We suck.

3308
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:14,480
We all suffer together.

3309
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:17,480
I mean, I mean, I know 2020 has been pretty bad.

3310
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:26,480
But, you know, like this, this too, we can all we can all suffer through together and bond over our mutual distress.

3311
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:28,480
We hear you.

3312
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:30,480
We see you.

3313
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:32,480
Last voicemail.

3314
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:34,480
Tom, are you excited?

3315
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:35,480
I am.

3316
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:36,480
It's a reference.

3317
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:37,480
I understand.

3318
02:35:37,480 --> 02:35:38,480
Is it?

3319
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:40,480
It's metal gear rising.

3320
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:43,480
Oh, well, it's called this isn't my sword.

3321
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:44,480
No, I didn't.

3322
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:46,480
I didn't play it.

3323
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:47,480
What do it?

3324
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:48,480
Yeah.

3325
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:49,480
Yeah.

3326
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:50,480
It looks pretty cool.

3327
02:35:50,480 --> 02:35:53,480
Three, two, one, go.

3328
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:55,480
Eleazar.

3329
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:57,480
Where are we still here?

3330
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:59,480
Just suffer.

3331
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:00,480
Every night.

3332
02:36:00,480 --> 02:36:02,480
I can feel my energy.

3333
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:04,480
And my jokes.

3334
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,480
Even my racist jokes.

3335
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:08,480
The podcast I've lost.

3336
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:11,480
The light novels I've lost.

3337
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:14,480
It won't stop hurting.

3338
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:16,480
Lights like they're still there.

3339
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:19,480
You can feel it too, don't you?

3340
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:22,480
I'm the one who got caught up with Canton.

3341
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:25,480
A group above YouTube monetization.

3342
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:27,480
Even above Patreon.

3343
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:30,480
And I was the parasite below.

3344
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:33,480
Feeding off Nate Bestman's funny power.

3345
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:36,480
They came after you in voice jail.

3346
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:39,480
Then in PC prison industrial complex.

3347
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:42,480
Canton just keeps growing.

3348
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:45,480
Swallowing everything in his path.

3349
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:47,480
Getting bigger and bigger.

3350
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:50,480
It's almost as big as my dick now.

3351
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:51,480
Eleazar.

3352
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:54,480
I'm gonna make him give back our past.

3353
02:36:54,480 --> 02:36:57,480
Take back everything that we've lost.

3354
02:36:57,480 --> 02:37:02,480
And I won't rest until we do.

3355
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:11,480
Well, I'm disappointed.

3356
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:13,480
The title was Metal Gear Rising.

3357
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:15,480
And that was Metal Gear Sub 5 reference.

3358
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:20,480
You fucked up your game references, you fool!

3359
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:23,480
What the fuck is a Metal Gear?

3360
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:28,480
It's a bipedal tank capable of not launching a nuclear strike.

3361
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:31,480
Oh, wow. That sounds pretty cool.

3362
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:33,480
They should make a video game about that.

3363
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:35,480
You know, it's budgetary constraints.

3364
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:37,480
You know, it's a lot of shit.

3365
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:39,480
It's a lot of polygons.

3366
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,480
Who can afford them these days?

3367
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:45,480
They're too busy modeling every single pore on Keanu Reeves' face

3368
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:47,480
for Cyberpunk 2077.

3369
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:50,480
They don't have the budgetary resources to make a Metal Gear game.

3370
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:52,480
Maybe someday, though.

3371
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:54,480
Wait, is that the... is Kojima?

3372
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:55,480
Is that Kojima?

3373
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:56,480
He's not in that now.

3374
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:58,480
Oh, okay, well.

3375
02:37:58,480 --> 02:38:01,480
Um, well, fuck, that was it.

3376
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:03,480
Oh, god, I'm gonna...

3377
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:05,480
Pray to god that we didn't get any more.

3378
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:06,480
Okay, no.

3379
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:07,480
You're...

3380
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:10,480
No, no, no. As soon as the podcast starts, that's the cutoff point.

3381
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:11,480
I would...

3382
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:12,480
No, you know what?

3383
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,480
Don't give these people ideas!

3384
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:16,480
Eleazar, cut that out!

3385
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:18,480
They'll never end!

3386
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:19,480
Yeah, you're right.

3387
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:21,480
It'll be like...

3388
02:38:21,480 --> 02:38:24,480
Like, I mentioned the War on Quickfill contest.

3389
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:25,480
Like, people were submitting...

3390
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:30,480
Like, I said, like, the entry started flooding in, like, right before...

3391
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:32,480
Right before the judging.

3392
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:35,480
But, like, they were still flooding in, like, as we were finishing...

3393
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:38,480
Like, as we were judging the last entry, like, more were still coming in.

3394
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:41,480
We had to be like, okay, that's it, no.

3395
02:38:41,480 --> 02:38:42,480
No more allowed.

3396
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:44,480
Oh, god.

3397
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:46,480
Um, yes.

3398
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:47,480
Yes.

3399
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:49,480
Um, but I guess that's the, uh...

3400
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:51,480
I guess that's the episode.

3401
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:52,480
Um, Tom...

3402
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:53,480
I don't know.

3403
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:54,480
Yeah?

3404
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:55,480
No.

3405
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:57,480
I'm just gonna say, maybe you'll disagree with me.

3406
02:38:57,480 --> 02:39:00,480
I thought this one was kinda almost middling energy.

3407
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:01,480
Like, there was...

3408
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:04,480
There was some good banter going on this week.

3409
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:05,480
Oh...

3410
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,480
I know, we fucked up.

3411
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:08,480
We fucked up pretty bad.

3412
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:09,480
I don't know.

3413
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:10,480
The new...

3414
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:16,480
The new PCP, and you with an Umlat PCP, is about being low energy.

3415
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:19,480
It's something you just put on in the background.

3416
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:24,480
You just put it on on your tablet, and you hand it to your toddler.

3417
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:26,480
And you just let it auto-play.

3418
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:27,480
Right, right.

3419
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:28,480
To make us add revenue.

3420
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:30,480
That's the new model.

3421
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:32,480
YouTube rewards this kind of content.

3422
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:35,480
You know, frequent, regular, long-form content.

3423
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:36,480
We're sorry.

3424
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:40,480
We'll both make sure to pop an ambient before we start recording next week's episode.

3425
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:47,480
We apologize for any energy that may have accidentally slipped in to this podcast.

3426
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:52,480
And I assure you, it will never, ever happen again.

3427
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:54,480
Do we mention that Gibb's on vacation?

3428
02:39:54,480 --> 02:39:55,480
We didn't.

3429
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:56,480
We didn't mention that at all.

3430
02:39:56,480 --> 02:39:58,480
I meant to say that at the beginning.

3431
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:01,480
Yeah, Gibb is not here because she is on vacation.

3432
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:04,480
She's on a dog vacation.

3433
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:09,480
It's literally a vacation for her dog, but she's going also.

3434
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:11,480
Incredible.

3435
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:20,480
They're just like, yeah, let's go on like a two-week vacation to let the dog get some fresh air.

3436
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,480
Going to a cabin or whatever.

3437
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:24,480
So she will not be here next week either.

3438
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:26,480
She might be back the week after that.

3439
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:27,480
I'm not actually sure.

3440
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,480
I guess we'll find out.

3441
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:30,480
I guess we'll find out.

3442
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:31,480
Okay.

3443
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:36,480
I think that's really funny, and I wanted to mention it because it's very, very good.

3444
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:38,480
Very good facts.

3445
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:56,480
So send us a voicemail for next week at speakbike.com slash PCP voicemail and patron us at patreon at patreon.com slash, is it the procrastinators?

3446
02:40:56,480 --> 02:40:57,480
Yep.

3447
02:40:57,480 --> 02:41:00,480
Patreon.com slash the pro.

3448
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:01,480
Wait, let me double check that.

3449
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:03,480
I don't trust procrastinators.

3450
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:04,480
It is the procrastinators.

3451
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:05,480
Okay.

3452
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:11,480
Um, patron us at patreon.com, if you like what we do here and you have it, if you like the episode, if you like the episode.

3453
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:18,480
Get in early for the early episode commentary tracks that may or may not actually end up happening.

3454
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:19,480
Oh, we should do those.

3455
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:21,480
Oh, we should really do those.

3456
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:23,480
You think those would make good bonus episodes?

3457
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:25,480
I think they'd be pretty funny.

3458
02:41:25,480 --> 02:41:26,480
Yeah.

3459
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:27,480
Yeah, that's probably true.

3460
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:31,480
We can just record one, and if it comes out like shit, we'll just pretend this never happened.

3461
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:37,480
We could, we could do, we could do like one and make it public and then be like, okay, we're going to make more of these, but they're going to be bonus or something.

3462
02:41:37,480 --> 02:41:38,480
Yeah, yeah.

3463
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:39,480
Something like that.

3464
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:40,480
Okay.

3465
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:42,480
HD remasters of our own podcast.

3466
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:44,480
Works for every other industry.

3467
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:46,480
Which is put lots of bloom on it.

3468
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:50,480
Anyway, anyway, yes, get, get in on that.

3469
02:41:50,480 --> 02:41:52,480
Patreon costs us that procrastinators.

3470
02:41:52,480 --> 02:42:11,480
Um, and, uh, hey, if you really want, if you really want to be cool in a PCP sort of way, maybe buy a shirt by a I have COVID shirt by a based state shirt at.

3471
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:14,480
I don't even know what's what's the URL for that.

3472
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:17,480
It would be our store, our store friend.

3473
02:42:17,480 --> 02:42:23,480
It's teespring.com slash stores slash the pro procrastinators, but there's dashes where the space to be.

3474
02:42:23,480 --> 02:42:26,480
So the dash pro dash procrastinators.

3475
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:30,480
Links are all in the description links and links in the description, baby.

3476
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:31,480
Um, all right.

3477
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:32,480
And that's going to do it.

3478
02:42:32,480 --> 02:42:34,480
That's going to do it for this week.

3479
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:35,480
Are we out?

3480
02:42:35,480 --> 02:42:36,480
Yes.

3481
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:37,480
We're out.

3482
02:42:37,480 --> 02:42:39,480
Then let's, then let's go.

3483
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:40,480
Oh, goodbye.

3484
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:41,480
Goodbye.

3485
02:42:41,480 --> 02:42:42,480
See you soon.

3486
02:42:42,480 --> 02:42:43,480
Bye.

3487
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:50,480
You know, that was kind of good energy.

3488
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,480
It was pretty.

3489
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:52,480
Yeah.

3490
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:53,480
It was pretty solid.

3491
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:54,480
It was pretty solid banter.

3492
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:55,480
Yeah.
