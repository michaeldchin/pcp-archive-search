00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello Pizzanos, what's going on? It's episode 3 of Motherfucking RickstieMinutes with BestGuyEver and Digibro.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't give a fuck bitch!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, that's my guy. And alright everybody, it's this episode that's gotten a lot of publicity.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A lot of dank memes coming out of the woodwork for this one. Pickle Rick. Pickle Rick everybody.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Fucking Rick. What were they thinking?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Genius. Genius is what they were thinking.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How high do you even have to be to come up with Pickle Rick? It's absolutely absurd.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's talk about the premise of Pickle Rick.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Alright, they literally just came up with like let's make Rick a pickle and then they made an episode about it.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it's great because these people are good writers and they don't fuck up and everything is perfect.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think with this episode what they were going for is because I feel like this show has gotten really into the habit of trying to fuck with the viewer's expectations.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think they seem to have a firm grasp on what people think Rick and Morty is and how they can fuck with you in that.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So with Pickle Rick, they wanted you to be deeply concerned about this.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It seems like a stupid meme that this seems completely retarded. Why is Rick a fucking pickle?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The way that Morty reacts to him at the start of the episode is just like, what? Why would you do this? This is a stupid idea.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because I can tell, I can just see Justin Roiland walking into the room and going, Pickle Rick! We're going to make him a pickle!

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Rick's going to be a pickle and everyone's like, no, no, that's stupid. He's like, ah, no, Pickle Rick!

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then they had to do it.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I have no doubt that's what went down.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have no doubt either.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, but it's just great.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I feel like that's exactly what they're going for. Everyone in the episode is reacting to this with exactly like the dry, you know, exasperation that you would expect in a situation like this.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then it's a fucking great episode anyway.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You know, we can even read in, like Rick himself says, he says this ironically because he doesn't actually mean it, but he says, I did this to challenge myself to see if I could turn myself back.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I feel like the writers did this to challenge themselves of like, okay, let's take one of the stupidest ideas that Roiland's ever shouted at the top of his lungs while walking into the room and see if we can actually make that a cool episode.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And they did. They succeeded.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, that's interesting that you frame it as a challenge because I think of it more as just like an expression of just like how superior the people making this show are compared to the rest of the landscape.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because like, you can have, so you can have like a good premise, you know, you can go on and you can have yourself a good premise.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But if your writers are shit, if like the team doesn't have its act together, it can easily be garbage. There's so many things you can fuck up.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
These people, they simply know what the fuck to do to make a good show and there's almost no premise that they can fuck up if they put the effort in, which they clearly did here.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it was great. It was a great episode.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, I mean, I feel like you can watch the train of thought unfolding as this goes on of like, okay, Rick's a pickle and there's literally no one's around to do anything about it.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What is like the natural course of events is going to happen? Like something has to get him off the desk, a cattle come in, you know, something's going to have to get him off the porch, a rain's going to come in.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, if it rains, he's going to fall down the drain. Well, if he goes down the drain, what's going to be down there? Cockroaches. What can we do with those?

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then from there, it's just like building up this. It's like spore almost, you know, it is just like spore. Yeah.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I mean, what I what I loved about this episode was and Rick and this is like the general thesis I was thinking about for this episode.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What would it make me think about Rick and Morty? Rick and Morty like better than almost, I don't know.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not going to say better than any other show, but like it's so great at being logically consistent with like the just what it's having its characters do and like the things they have at their disposal and like the laws going on.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So OK, when I first heard about a pickle, Rick, I thought they would do something like have him like hop around, be like a pickle man who could just like, you know, I don't know, roll and do things like that.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But a pickle doesn't have fucking muscles. It can't move. So like right from the start, they establish Rick cannot move anything except his face and tongue.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's the entirety of what like like the tools in his toolbox to deal with the situations that he finds himself into.

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And like I was expecting them to fuck that up and like I'd see him like inching like a worm or like wiggling around or something, but they never do that.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It was even fucking with my brain at first to like when he was laying there and I was like, can't he just roll?

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I'm like, well, I guess he wouldn't like that's the expectation, right? That's exactly it.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We've watched so many of these fucking cartoons that would make us think that like a pickle can. Yeah, of course you can roll.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a pickle. Why it's going to roll. But like, no, he's got no fucking muscles in his body, which you can tort his mass to make him roll.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So like, yeah, it just it's exactly how it should be. It's exactly how it should be.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then, you know, and then just because Rick is such a fucking genius, he can cocks these amazing situations to give himself fucking limbs and like powers and weaponry and all the shit he needs to get through.

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, it's the best. And like that moment where where he like plugs like the brain plug into his fucking, you know, pickle brain.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I was like visceral. And I was like, yeah, that's just what you have to do. God, I love how Rick is not afraid at all to get his hands dirty.

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And like, like so many people you got disgusting man. I know it's a nightmare. It's a fucking nightmare. It was it was hard to watch for me when he was in the with the cockroaches and everything.

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Like licking the things fucking brain. I was just like, why? Why do I have to look at this?

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You know, just to be just just to be have the appearance of fairness, though, the one thing that I thought was a little bit ridiculous is how he puppeted the cockroach with his tongue by touching its brain.

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's that's the one thing that's like, all right, I mean, is there any way that would it was awesome? Like it was done with great effect.

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I was I got over that quickly. It was not a big deal. I mean, the fact that he like the moment he because I didn't know what he like, I thought he was going to have it somehow.

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know. Carry him transport. No, he bites his fucking head open. And I was like, oh my God, what are you doing?

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I just love what like a fucking badass Rick is. He's not like Doc Brown, who was like this clumsy, you know, the characters based on like clumsy weirdo science man who doesn't really get his hands dirty just because of the nature of the show.

58
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But Rick is a fucking murdering monster. He'll just go he'll genocide a country. That's what I think we do. Whatever.

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think I can say officially that they are trying to make Rick and Morty the most violent show of all time now.

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Like, you think so?

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like, I mean, the show has always had some violence. But like you look back at season one, like episode one, they kill a bunch of bug men.

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There's some green blood here and there. Like, there's a little, you know, there's like there's a little violence here and there.

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's moments of some of some violence when Rick blows up the king. But most of them are like green or blue blood. You know, it's not a lot of like humans getting eviscerated horribly.

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And season two kicked it up with the purge planet. That was where it was really like a season two is pretty fucking violent overall.

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But purge planet was like another level. But this season, every episode has just been a fucking bloodbath. Like insane amounts of violence going on in this show now.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're not wrong. You're not wrong at all. I think, I suspect that there, I think that it just kind of happens to be that way.

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Maybe there is an intention. Maybe they are going in that direction. Like, but it seems to me like they perfectly make sense for the premise of each of the episodes.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So maybe they do just have an inclination to write more violent stories. But like they were just doing a, yeah, go on.

69
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think Adult Swim has kind of had like a long standing desire to have the most violent show on television.

70
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Like if you think back, like they had that Korgoth the Barbarian pilot, which was just nonstop violence. Metalocalypse was really fucking violent.

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In spite of not even being an action show, managed to have like insane violence in every episode, you know.

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yep, and it ruled.

73
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Most of their shows have had like insanely violent episodes where they'll just be like blood literally everywhere.

74
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's that one.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think of like an Aquatine Hunger Force when the fucking spider like just collecting everyone's blood.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That was the episode that made me stop watching Aquatine. I never was real. I was never a big Aquatine guy at all.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But that's when I'm like, this show is definitely not for me.

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's the only episode I loved of Aquatine Hunger Force because there was so much blood. It was awesome.

79
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I just never laughed and then I got grossed out. So I'm like, why the fuck am I even watching this? There was no reason.

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, well, I mean, we haven't even touched on like the other half of this episode.

81
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That is also legitimately great and makes, I think this is for the first time, makes Daughteru, whose name I forget.

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think this is the most I've ever liked her as a character. They're really finally digging down and we're exploring her character more.

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Just for the one line where she's like, one of my favorite jokes in the episode.

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
From that scene anyway, everything involving Rick was hilarious and awesome.

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like I was laughing constantly at everything that went on with Pickle Rick.

86
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The other scene is much more serious. It's like this actual deep seated psychological thing going on where like they literally just go to a counselor

87
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and they spend the whole episode just like having a family meltdown essentially or mainly Beth who won't open up and be honest with their feelings.

88
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And they're just getting royally fucking owned by this counselor, which I knew was going to happen.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like the whole episode, I was like, they're going to get fucking owned by this bitch.

90
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Which is appropriate because like we understand all their nuances. We know what's going on.

91
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So they can't like hide that shit or right. It's good.

92
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And so that's all going on.

93
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But my favorite line, my favorite joke line for that is when Summer, who the whole episode we have known that she apparently huffed pottery,

94
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
glaze or something. That's part of why they're here because Morty pissed his pants at school and she huffed pottery.

95
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And it has been assumed that this is because of their family situation.

96
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And the funniest part is that there's this reveal that it really wasn't about that at all.

97
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Summer just wanted to get high and Morty is just an idiot.

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So that reveal was probably my favorite joke in the episode when Summer's like,

99
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'd like to be thought of as someone who just likes to get high.

100
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, Summer fucking killed it with that line. That was great.

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Her fucking voice acting was amazing this episode.

102
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The line when the teacher comes out of the room and she's like, none of us have ever eaten poop.

103
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Like however she says it was just like spot on. I fucking loved it.

104
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That was great. I will say though, I think the poop jokes just kind of fell flat for me.

105
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I got it the first time and then they just kept doing it.

106
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That was fine. I just didn't care.

107
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Not as funny as the number of times they used it, but whatever. It wasn't a big deal.

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, the reason why Rick is a pickle, of course, is because he's trying to get out of this counseling thing.

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's what's revealed. And so there's this plot setup.

110
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean, I assume everyone is watching this in the episode.

111
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But nonetheless, there's this. He's got this thing set up where he's going to...

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
As soon as they leave, there's a timer and it's going to inject him with human serum, whatever.

113
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's going to turn it back to a human.

114
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So that's the undercurrent going on through the episode.

115
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And Beth takes it away from him because it's immediately obvious what he's trying to do.

116
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then her and the therapist and the kids are exploring how they know that obviously is what this is.

117
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And yet Beth just can't bring herself to fucking question her father in the slightest.

118
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And I forget how that resolves. Did she actually... Did she challenge him at all at the end?

119
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think she did a little bit, but then immediately gave it back to him.

120
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I honestly don't remember how that resolved.

121
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
She kind of just like... The ending of the episode, they're both clearly shook by what they've experienced at the psychological place.

122
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The only thing she says is like, you shouldn't have lied to me.

123
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She almost doesn't. He says, I'm sorry I lied.

124
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And she's like, oh, it's okay. Well, you shouldn't have lied, but it's okay.

125
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She barely concedes.

126
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's really him who does the apologizing.

127
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Even she can't get past it, even when he can admit some truth.

128
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And it's great that even throughout the whole...

129
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
At the end, she is resistant the entire time.

130
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Beth is the one who's fighting the therapist the entire fucking session.

131
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
At the end, after the therapist does her monologue, it just lays out exactly what Beth's problems are.

132
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In no uncertain terms that we basically already know.

133
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The kids are just like, I liked her.

134
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Can we go back?

135
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That was great.

136
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Their faces at the end of the episode was like, that hit me, man.

137
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The way that the other two were trying to be so casual, and the kids know that these two are shaken by this.

138
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And they're trying to break through the facade like, hey, can we be honest?

139
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Can we go back?

140
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I kind of liked it. It was kind of enriching.

141
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's almost a little bit too real right there.

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because every day, people out there, we all do it.

143
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We all lie to ourselves about the way that we kind of wish that we were.

144
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We trick ourselves.

145
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll give you a real example right now.

146
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I tell people that I go to the gym three times a week.

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I often miss Fridays because I just get caught up doing stuff.

148
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But I still tell people that I go three times a week.

149
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's me kind of lying to make myself feel better about it, even though I'm not being the obligation I've set for myself.

150
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, that's a small little thing.

151
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But these people are lying about like, Beth's whole life has been destroyed.

152
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And her kids, their lives are put in danger every moment that Rick is around, more or less.

153
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because he just doesn't give a fuck.

154
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And it's like the ultimate danger to the fucking universe.

155
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And especially the kids.

156
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And she just enables and enables and enables because she is personally fucked up by her abandonment issues from him as a kid.

157
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And the fact that she isn't willing to deal with her issues and is just pushing them off,

158
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
well, the kids are like, no, mom, please, we should go back.

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You should go back.

160
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is how we all get better as people and healthier and become a better family.

161
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She's just pushing it away so she doesn't have to take responsibility or confront like her own issues.

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's real shit, man.

163
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That is real shit.

164
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And that's why this is the best Beth has ever been.

165
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I really liked it.

166
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, that was great.

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And the fucking speech that the counselor gives at the end.

168
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, this is awesome.

169
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's some very real shit.

170
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
She hits them with, there are wrong and right ways this scene could be done.

171
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But it just feels very matter of fact to me that like she says she is not like making fun of them or anything.

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's not like she's this huge comeback.

173
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
She just like lays out exactly here's what your issues are.

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like, you know, anybody in my field would know this.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Like this is not like me being magic rocket scientists.

176
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's just like, this is what psychology is.

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You avoid it because it's not interesting to you for the same reason that like normal shit is not interesting to me.

178
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But like, it hit me in a very personal way because this is one of the most relatable problems I've heard on this show.

179
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let me describe what I've done today.

180
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I've, right before we did this podcast, I was doing another one that I had to do for Patreon.

181
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And right after this podcast, I will be doing another one that I do with Monkey Jones every week.

182
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And right before I did that other podcast, I had recorded a vlog and was working on a different one.

183
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Like I've worked on like five projects today.

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What I haven't done is clean my office, which has not that dirty, but there's a little bit of stuff around.

185
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Haven't really eaten.

186
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I should have made myself a sandwich, but it was going to take too long.

187
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So I ate two frozen waffles instead and now I'm still hungry.

188
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I should have fucking paid this goddamn $350 I owe to the state of New York for a speeding ticket that I got in May.

189
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I need to pay in within the next four days.

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The reason I haven't done that is because it would require me to go to the post office, which is right up the road.

191
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But that would be not working.

192
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It would be boring.

193
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It would be normal work upkeep shit.

194
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It would just be daily life shit and daily life shit never takes precedence in my mind over doing something interesting.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The only times I go do this shit is when I don't have anything scheduled or planned.

196
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't have any ideas for videos.

197
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You know, like it's the days when I'm not feeling creative that I go and I finally get the other shit done.

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I go and clean up the house.

199
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I go, oh, I don't have an idea for a video.

200
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So I guess I'll like, you know, brush my teeth.

201
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's never going to happen.

202
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll go pick up the trash, you know, like that's the day that that shit gets done because, you know, it just doesn't feel like an adventure.

203
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And I want everything to feel like an adventure.

204
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I want everything to be larger than life, never to just be like normie shit, you know, even though you need the normie shit because your mind cannot handle not being kept up.

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's why you need to keep a clean space because you feel better and you do better work.

206
00:17:46,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know, if you dedicate that hour every day to fucking developing an environment that you can live in, you know, and don't have the looming stress of, oh, God, will this fucking thing get to the courts in time for me to not owe the government whatever

207
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
like interest on this shit, you know, because I have just been holding onto these envelopes.

208
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They've been sitting on my desk like in my line of sight for two weeks now, you know.

209
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I know the feeling well.

210
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I had been putting off getting car insurance for a while and I finally got it.

211
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But it took me months to just get around to doing it, even though like every day I didn't have it, I was at risk, you know, it's just like, it's so true.

212
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's such a relatable thing.

213
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Every fucking person in the world does this shit.

214
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And especially now that like, I don't know, we're all consumed by like fantasy of like Hollywood shit and anime and all this magical shit that we wish would happen in our lives.

215
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We just want to, like every movie is the most interesting portion of those characters' lives and we all want that to be happening to us all the time.

216
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And you know, people back in the old days, like, they didn't know what they were missing.

217
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So day-to-day life, you know, maybe it wasn't so bad.

218
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think there's lots of people, it's like she says, some people can handle work and some people can't.

219
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I think most people, like what we define as normies, what we insult by calling normies are people who can work.

220
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
People who like can do something every day because they know it's the right thing to do.

221
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They know it's how you live.

222
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They know that's like what's normal.

223
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And then there's people like me who are just like, I could never work.

224
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like, I've gotten to the point right now, I don't know if I could work a normal job.

225
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Like, I don't know if that would be possible for me because I've gotten so used to this manic lifestyle of like constantly making new things.

226
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And what's the phrases that Rick says?

227
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's like, he creates-

228
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, wubba lubba dub dub.

229
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He says like, I'm a scientist, I create, destroy and mutate or something like that.

230
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And I'm like, yeah, like, that's what's on my mind.

231
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like, if it's not creating or making something new, then what's the point of it, you know?

232
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But the point is obviously, you don't become a fucking psychopath who goes around putting your life at risk every day

233
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and murdering people constantly.

234
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, he's a little bit out of whack.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know, I remember when you were first starting your Patreon years ago and shit.

236
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And I remember, you know, when you left your job and stuff.

237
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And you, even back then, you were, you know, saying the sentiment that like, you know, you just don't feel like that's right for you.

238
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And you know, that to me has been like a big strength for you personally.

239
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And that way you are like a Rick.

240
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And that you are just wired for this lifestyle.

241
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That just really seems to me, you know, when I was a kid, I used to think that like everyone could do anything.

242
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And if you're not, you know, like excelling at just the shit that everyone needs to do, then you're just not trying hard enough or something.

243
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But as I've gotten older, I've really started to realize that there really are different kinds of people who are built to do different sort of things,

244
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
especially as I've discovered what I'm actually good at.

245
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And, you know, and I, yeah, I don't know, man, she's right about that.

246
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And, you know, one other point that I really liked about just the therapist in general, I really liked how it would be so easy for a show like this to just like,

247
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
you would think that like a nihilist framed show or like a show with themes of nihilism about it would, would like, it would be so easy for it to shit on the idea of psychology in general.

248
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Exactly like, like Rick does and just be like, this is total fucking bullshit, man.

249
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I decide my own destiny, you know, there's nothing controlling me.

250
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm controlling my own thoughts and mind and all that shit.

251
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But the show really does take a more mature stance at it.

252
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And even though like, you know, jokes are thrown in, of course, it's a comedy fucking show with like the poop stuff and whatever.

253
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like, despite all that, she is absolutely like a professional at her craft and has real things to offer these characters.

254
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And it's obvious and the characters understand it and accept it in the form of Morty and Summer.

255
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Whereas our, our less mature people who are just pushing away their problems, the parents, those are the problem people who don't understand the real benefits that could be here.

256
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I just appreciate that, that, that feels refreshing to me that they're not just like shitting on it.

257
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I feel like I've seen that a thousand times.

258
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I think my favorite part of it is the way, the favorite, my favorite part of her speech and how it's framed is that like,

259
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
she keeps saying like, you know, to Rick, like you have this amazing level of intelligence.

260
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like she recognizes like, Rick, you are smarter than me.

261
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But this is what I do is like, understand how people think.

262
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I know how you think.

263
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Like the fact that you're smarter than me doesn't preclude me from like this specialization that I have,

264
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
which is to understand how your mind works, whether I actually like understand the concepts that you do or not.

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Which is something I find really interesting about psychology in general is that like, it's in some ways an equalizer.

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like we're all humans at the end of the day.

267
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Like how the human mind works is not something that you have a better grasp on just by having a higher IQ.

268
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Like your IQ doesn't affect your emotions.

269
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It doesn't affect the chemistry of your brain.

270
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's just like how much shit you know and can know.

271
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And that's clearly, you know, what Rick's strengths are in as opposed to self-awareness and that and other kind of shit.

272
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah man, it's good stuff.

273
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And it's funny, I just watched all of the Sopranos not too long ago, which has, I didn't even know this at the time,

274
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but before I started watching it, the fact that Tony Soprano goes to a therapist, a psychiatrist, yeah.

275
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Like is a big undercurrent throughout the whole thing.

276
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And there's a lot of like dream analysis and, you know, he spends a lot of time talking to her and understanding his motivations for why he like lives this gangster lifestyle and stuff.

277
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And it was really interesting there and it's really interesting here.

278
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's good stuff.

279
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah.

280
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I mean, the only other thing I wanted to talk about was kind of just like the progression, the specific progression of like Rick in his journey

281
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:53,000
throughout, you know, like acquiring the materials he needed to do the shitty comedy, the gigantic action battle scene at the end, which was fucking dope.

282
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So just like the way that Rick, I feel like we've already blown our load here, but nonetheless, like the way that Rick starts out as an immobile pickle.

283
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And then like you were said, like the cat kicks him off the table or whatever, rain comes down, he gets flushed down the drain into the sewer.

284
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He then lures over a cockroach with like spewing brine.

285
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So he's like using pickle special abilities in order to do that, which was dope.

286
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The only special ability a pickle has, which I'm glad they didn't try to like stretch that, you know.

287
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah.

288
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There's one thing he could do and they used it and then.

289
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, how about, how about when he gets hurt later on and in order to bandage his wound, he uses like mustard and hot sauce and then staples a pickle to his wound to hold him like his pickle guts.

290
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It was fucking genius.

291
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Like just from a burger that was sitting there.

292
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Holy shit.

293
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That was amazing.

294
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
They just commit so hard.

295
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Close my pickle hole with more pickle.

296
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It was fucking great.

297
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, while like, of course, you know, while he's fighting this guy, Jaguar, Jaguar, whatever, who fucking just like burns it's shut or whatever.

298
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
God, it was fucking great.

299
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't know.

300
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Like I didn't, there was nothing particularly amazing about like, okay, well, once, once Rick like controls these cockroaches.

301
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So he lures over the brine, he bites his head, snaps his neck and then starts puffing his brain with his tongue.

302
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He then like, then we kind of accelerate to, okay, now he's just gotten to the point where he's building like some machines out of like the various limbs of cockroaches that now that he can move himself, that he can get, get a hold on.

303
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And he eventually makes like this battle armor that he can use to fucking chop up these rats in this like amazingly gory fucking fight.

304
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It was so dope.

305
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I got it was the best.

306
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The fucking shit he says to the big rat at.

307
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.

308
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

309
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Classic.

310
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Like I didn't even give you a name.

311
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I could have called you scar.

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I call you nothing because you're nothing to me.

313
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You aren't even worthy to be my adversary.

314
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But like even the fact that he's addressing the rats, like that rat instantly has character to us as the viewers.

315
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah.

316
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Man, it was so good.

317
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It was so good.

318
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This was a.

319
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Where the fuck was he by the way?

320
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like what, what was this cartel place he was in?

321
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Like I assume because they say like there's lines like this country is a prison and stuff like that.

322
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's right.

323
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm assuming he's in Mexico and some kind of drug cartel place.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Where is their house?

325
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Like do they live in California?

326
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Like why are they so close to the border?

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Because Rick says he's five minutes away by helicopter from his daughter.

328
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So.

329
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I guess.

330
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah.

331
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I guess they must be.

332
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Are they like right on the border of Mexico or something?

333
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Based on the clear like Latin influences on the characters and shit.

334
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Like yeah.

335
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I guess they must be close to the Mexican border.

336
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh yeah.

337
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh yeah.

338
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I forgot about that.

339
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
They're just piling up.

340
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I guess they're close to the Mexican border.

341
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah.

342
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Or something like that.

343
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know.

344
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Maybe there's a Mexican installation in the U.S. somewhere.

345
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't fucking know.

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah.

347
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Something like that.

348
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, that's that was cool.

349
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The the fight I really liked after I just want to mention like how amazing that mouse

350
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
muscle exoskeleton was.

351
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
God, it was so fucking sick.

352
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And I loved that like it's not like he constructed like human anatomy out of rat parts.

353
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Like he clearly still had like rat legs and rat limbs and they didn't.

354
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I love how you could see the the tendon moving independently of the arm.

355
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Of the bone.

356
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah.

357
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah.

358
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I noticed that straightening out.

359
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That looked really cool.

360
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That was fucking dope.

361
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And then the subplot with Jaguar was kind of funny.

362
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's all right.

363
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Didn't have a big pay off.

364
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Wasn't that great.

365
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The fight scene was the coolest part.

366
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think I'm hoping they because they brought back Jaguar for the after credits scene.

367
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That was funny.

368
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Right.

369
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'd feel like maybe they were doing that so that that wouldn't have to happen later

370
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
because like Jaguar is a surviving character.

371
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So he could come back.

372
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But I don't think he's that funny or memorable that he should come back.

373
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You know, I think that ending gag was all the payoff that character will ever need.

374
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He could show up in like the background or a crowd or you know, whatever.

375
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We'll probably get murdered somewhere in the background of another episode.

376
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Probably.

377
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Probably.

378
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I mean, he's really tough.

379
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
He fought toe to toe against Rick and came out came out alive.

380
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He fought toe to toe against Rick as a pickle with rattles.

381
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh, yeah.

382
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Well, yeah, but he was rocking it.

383
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, man, dude, how sick was his fucking like laser gun?

384
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We're using like individual batteries for the fucking charges.

385
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
God, damn, that was awesome.

386
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Well, all right.

387
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Well, that's it, man.

388
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I mean, we kind of went in a circular circuitous route there, but that pretty much covers the

389
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
whole episode and how fucking great it was.

390
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I give this like a big wreck.

391
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm going to give this like a strong nine.

392
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I feel like maybe a mid to strong nine.

393
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's very solid.

394
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The only complaint I would have is that like the subplot that's in the psychology office

395
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
is just very like, you know, it's just like one location with flat shots, you know, like

396
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
it's not that interesting to look at.

397
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You know, I hear what you're saying.

398
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I just like that as is a juxtaposition.

399
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I felt like this was intentional to like the crazy environments that Pickle Rick is going

400
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
to they made it deliberately drab to juxtapose like the insane life Rick has, especially

401
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
as Pickle Rick versus them.

402
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So, you know, I thought it worked, but, you know, I understand your criticism nonetheless.

403
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah, that's it.

404
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
See you later.

405
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh, fuck yourselves.

406
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Bye-bye.
