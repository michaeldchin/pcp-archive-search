1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Come on, you fuckers think that just cause a guy reads comics he can't start some shit?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Aw, fucking take all you want!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Goodbye, you're heavy.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Home again, home again.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Give me a try to love!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Class is paying 101.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I guess one person can make a difference.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Alright, welcome everybody to the panel cast, I guess.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is the first panel cast that I've done in a long time.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't know why I haven't done one in a long time.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know why I would do one again.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Fuck comics, I don't care about comics.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I damn sure don't care about my listening audience.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't care about The Pro Crastinators fans.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't care about a dang old thing.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Joining me once again is the boozy floozy.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
She's here to talk to you.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She knows about comics too, and so do I.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know the most about comics.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We know the best comics.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We play the best comics, and we're the best at them.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We read the best comics, and we're the best at talking about them.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And this is the panel cast, and this is the comics that were this week.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What are we...

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, we didn't really read anything.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I haven't read a comic in two years.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I haven't read a comic in nine on to seventeen years!

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ever since your older brother was born and done,

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
sent our family spiraling into poverty.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You little shit.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's talk about the uncanny Avengers.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Number 18.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you think about this comic that you didn't read?

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It was good.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It was a good comic.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You kind of read it over my shoulder.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, I did.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm gonna be perfectly honest.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm out of the loop.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The last thing that I remember hearing anything about Red Skull

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and Xavier is that Red Skull apparently ate Professor X's brain or some garbage.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, that happened about three years ago or some shit.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And it's just been this long dragged out storyline of the Red Skull

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
has all of Xavier's psychic powers now.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And they're trying to find him and kill him and get him.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's Rogue, and it's Deadpool, and Cable,

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and it's the Quicksilver is on the team,

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and the Wasp is on the team.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's actually a really good team.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, it's a pretty good book.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And Captain America was in charge of them,

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
but he got mad at them and he fired them all.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So now Rogue's gone rogue.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's like a gamer's tavern joke.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wow.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, I guess Rogue is gone rogue.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But now they're not officially sanctioned anymore.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They don't have Captain America's blessing anymore.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's just a team of fucking pissed off people

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
who don't give a shit.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They just want to kill the Red Skull.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's their only mission.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Deadpool and...

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Which Captain America?

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The real Captain America, the only real Captain America,

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the white one.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Not Black in America, not that one.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, not, not, not fucking, not Jonestown, USA.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Not, uh, welcome to Booferville, population one.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Not, not welcome to the jungle.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We got funny games.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Not, uh, not, not, uh, not Jigaboo of the jungle.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Stop.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Watch out for that tree.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
With the help of his friend, an ape named Ape.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, so this is a comic about Black people, I guess.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's what we were talking about, right?

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We were talking about how the Blacks came to America.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Blacks came to America and they ate Professor Xavier's brain with...

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is that the little mermaid I'm hearing?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Interrupting my hilarious anecdote?

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Turn that shit off!

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is happening?

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My shitty Let's Plays are playing in the background of my shitty podcast

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and it's ruining both of them!

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
As I was saying, this is a comic about how the first Blacks came to America

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and ate Charles Xavier's brain at Thanksgiving dinner with the pilgrims

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and then slaughtered all the Indians.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You know, those Blacks, they don't know about their Black privilege

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that they got from scalping all those Indians.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Blacks invented scalping.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Scalping tickets.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll have to take your word for it.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
History was never my strength in school.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you major in herstory?

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because you're such a vagethumping feminist?

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know, there's Bible thumpers and then there's vagethumpers.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is this because of my sandwich comment earlier?

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you fucking serious?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This guy, I swear...

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What the fuck?

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The only thing that's gonna be thumping that vag is the strong right hand of D. Trump's America.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Boy, don't I know it.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Doesn't that happen in January?

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh boy.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Shit.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Donald Trump isn't even funny to me anymore.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't care about anything.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Nothing's funny anymore.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm a comic book boy.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Welcome.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So in this comic on the cover, it's got a picture.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And inside the comic, there's more pictures.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And some of the pictures have little word balloons.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It starts with a flashback of Rogue.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But it's a dream she's having.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a scary nightmare.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then she goes...

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The Red Skull, he's got brain stuff.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He fucks with Quicksilver.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And she goes to beat him up.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She goes, I'm gonna kill him.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And she goes and gets him, but it's all a trick.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And at the end of the comic, she pulls a fast one.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He pulls a fast one on her.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And so now she's hypnotized, too.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so this storyline, this storyline is just,

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
it keeps chugging along.

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It'll never end.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They'll never kill the Red Skull.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, that's...

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Like why?

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why even try?

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like why even have the storyline?

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why even start a storyline of like,

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
we're gonna kill one of these big villains

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
when you know that they're never gonna kill any of the big villains?

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, nobody thought that they'd kill Wolverine,

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
but look at that.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I mean, that's kind of why characters like The Punisher

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
don't really work in comics as much.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, The Punisher works on his own,

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
but like when you add in like,

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
like when you start thinking like,

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
okay, why is the Kingpin still alive?

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And Kingpin's getting his own comic.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, it's just like, you know,

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
if you're not gonna have the balls to kill off these bad guys,

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
then I guess fuck everything.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's all worthless.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, I mean, didn't technically he kill Kingpin

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and Punisher Max,

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
but the Punisher Max series is his own entire different universe.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Not even in the canon.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a different...

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a different universe.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, anyways, that was Uncanny Avengers,

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and it sure was a comic.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's the next comic?

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What, how do I...

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What the hell is this?

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What is this website?

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know what else you read.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I mean, what is this stack of comics

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
that I purchased legally at a comic book store?

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Ooh.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ooh.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ooh.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Ooh.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I like, I like some of these comic books.

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Which ones?

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I like comic books.

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I like comic books.

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, here's Rocket Raccoon number one.

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And he's a little raccoon boy.

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, he looks sad.

183
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's stranded on Earth because the Civil War II,

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
their spaceship got blown up.

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So all the Guardians are having their own solo adventures.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They're all stranded on Earth or some shit.

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's eating a pretzel out of the garbage can.

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And he fucking hates Earth.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He doesn't like Earth because he's a raccoon boy.

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's scratching a man.

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's killing him.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Good.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's pissed off.

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then he goes, oh man, this is a really shitty episode

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
of the panel cast.

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is a real clusterfuck.

198
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is a train wreck.

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But anyways, that's Rocket Raccoon number one.

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And he's, you know, he's, I guess the human torches in this.

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Johnny's, oh, I clicked on the wrong thing.

202
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I, oh boy.

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh boy.

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What is happening here?

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But anyways, you know, let's just go to the last page

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and see how this story resolves itself.

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Dog butt.

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's see.

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What's the, I guess it would be page 22 here.

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's see what happens, Cyril.

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Um.

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know what that is.

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know what the hell that is.

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But you know, so he's got a comic.

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So that's, that's something.

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't even know what, what came out anymore.

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, Spider-Man.

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The more of this.

220
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Nope.

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's not the Spider-Man I was thinking of.

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Black Spider-Man.

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Black Spider-Man.

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I know.

225
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Miles Morales.

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I like Miles.

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Niles the Niglet.

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh my God.

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I clicked on it thinking that there was a new Spider-Man,

230
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
but it was the wrong Spider-Man.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It was a little black baby.

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I thought we didn't care about Spider-Man anymore.

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hey, did you read the new Venom yet?

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought you were going to say,

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I thought we didn't care about race anymore.

236
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I thought, did you read the new Venom?

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
At all?

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The new Venom.

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There was an issue, like there are only up to two issues now,

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
but it was actually really good.

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There's a new host for the symbiote now,

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and it kind of seems like they're going the ghost wrap-wrap.

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How many new hosts does there have to be for?

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's only been like three.

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, maybe there's been more.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There was Eddie Brock and there was Flash Thompson

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and there was probably 10 other guys.

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, there's a Scorpion,

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
but we don't talk about that.

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh yeah, Max Gargleballs.

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't fucking talk about it.

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Max Gargleballs.

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I like that.

255
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, I actually really like the new Venom comic.

256
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They are going back to the roots of the symbiote

257
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
working for evil again, I guess, basically.

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And they're kind of taking a...

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
For those of you who have been reading the Old New Ghost Rider,

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
they're kind of taking that route, the symbiote, now.

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't want to give away too much.

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't want to spoil too much, but...

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There are only up to two issues,

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and I've really liked both of them so far.

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can't stop farting.

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh yeah, this guy.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This guy.

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Did you...?

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No!

271
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Did it squeak?

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No!

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm shitting my pants!

274
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So there's All Star Batman number five.

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I think this is the last one of this arc.

276
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's by Scott Snyder.

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Scott Snyder, who is a wonderful writer,

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
but goddamn it, I don't fucking like the art.

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know.

281
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know if I'd go that far.

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He's a good writer?

283
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I...

284
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What don't you like of Scott Snyder's?

285
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
All of it.

286
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All of it, really?

287
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I hate the...

288
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Everything he does is just a hackier,

289
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
lame-er version of what Grant Morrison did.

290
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The Court of Owls is just a lame-er, black glove.

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
His Joker is just like a homo, a gay.

292
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He wants to suck Batman's dick like blatantly.

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He ruined the fucking Joker.

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
By making him gay, it is homophobic.

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I don't care.

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's gay!

297
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He writes his little Batman comics,

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and he draws a little word balloon.

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He draws a Joker.

300
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He says, hey Joker, say something gay.

301
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Then he writes in the little word balloon,

302
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm gay!

303
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I just like to imagine that all of Joker's

304
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
word bubbles are shaped like wieners.

305
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And they're like, you gotta stop doing that.

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, I hated all of his Joker stories.

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know, I don't really remember the Joker stories very well.

308
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I just remember them being really fucking gross.

309
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Actually, that's a lie, because I liked Endgame.

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
See, I thought that one was kind of anti-climax.

311
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So of his two Joker stories, I hated one of them.

312
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I liked his Bloom story.

313
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, yeah, that was an interesting character.

314
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I liked Bloom.

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But I hated the whole Gordon Batman thing.

316
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We're just talking amongst ourselves now with no context

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
for anyone who didn't know how to even give a shit.

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But anyways, this is All Star Batman.

319
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is his new thing.

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And, you know, it was a cool story.

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Some shit about Two-Face, you know?

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I feel like this comic took a while to come out.

323
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So by the time you get to the end of the story,

324
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you don't remember what the beginning of the story was.

325
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Two-Face put a head out on Batman.

326
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, basically. There's more to it than that.

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But, you know, it's, you know...

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Tweedledee and Tweedledum, what the fuck?

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But anyways, at the end of the story, you know,

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
basically, Two-Face has this cure, this little thing.

331
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it's gonna either make him all Harvey or all Two-Face.

332
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know, whichever side of his personality is the strongest,

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that side is gonna take over.

334
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But at the end of it, Batman says,

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
fuck you, and he breaks the cure,

336
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because he says that, you know,

337
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
everybody in the world has to make the choice every day

338
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
which side is stronger.

339
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I'm not gonna give you the easy way out,

340
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you little punk-ass bitch.

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's fine. No, I don't like that.

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You don't like that?

343
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't like that.

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, Batman explains it better than I do.

345
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I explained it bad.

346
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's fair.

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But, um, anyways, you know,

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that's Batman for ya.

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That was a good story, I think.

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't remember it with perfect clarity,

351
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but you know, you know, video games,

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I mean comics, this is comics.

353
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh yeah, The Dark Knight 3, Master Race number seven.

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That only took a million years to finally come out.

355
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, so I didn't actually read this issue.

356
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I skimmed it, but it looks cool.

357
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've been reading up to this point,

358
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but I've been so I don't really give a shit.

359
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't really give a shit.

360
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So I've been reading comics sometimes,

361
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and when I was a little boy,

362
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and I'm a comic.

363
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And so in this comic,

364
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
so this is the third in The Dark Knight trilogy

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
of, you know, the Frank Miller man.

366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Frank Miller is, you know,

367
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I guess you'd call him one of the seminal

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
comic book boys

369
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
of the 80s.

370
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was like him and Alan Moore and Grant Morrison.

371
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They all made comics cool.

372
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Some kind of triad, I guess.

373
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

374
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Wouldn't Warren Ellis be in there somewhere?

375
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Wouldn't Warren Ellis be in there somewhere?

376
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wouldn't Warren Ellis and fuckin'

377
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Bill Gaiman and all of them.

378
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All the old boys.

379
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But, um, yeah.

380
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You know, Frank Miller, he was a great writer.

381
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He's one of the best of all time.

382
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You know, a lot of Frank Miller stories

383
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
are my favorite stories of all comics, you know?

384
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, Daredevil born again is fantastic.

385
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
His Wolverine,

386
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
which he didn't write, he just drew it.

387
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Claremont wrote it, but, you know,

388
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the original Wolverine was great.

389
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And The Dark Knight Returns is still a great story.

390
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It still holds up.

391
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's a great version with fucking

392
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
RoboCop

393
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
as Batman, which was the coolest thing

394
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Peter Welling.

395
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And it was amazing.

396
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was the coolest thing of all time.

397
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But that's a good story.

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So everyone really loved him.

399
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He was one of the most famous comic book writers.

400
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He was very critically acclaimed.

401
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
His stories are, you know, among the most influential

402
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and widely adapted.

403
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you've seen Batman v Superman,

404
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you've basically seen,

405
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
you know, it's

406
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
it's Batman v Superman

407
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
is just a bastardized, crappier version

408
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
of everything that Frank Miller ever wrote.

409
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

410
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But, um,

411
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
he sort of stopped being

412
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
so critically acclaimed at a certain point

413
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and everyone kind of turned on him.

414
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And they started saying, you know,

415
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
he's gone crazy. He's racist.

416
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He hates Islam. He's a misogynist.

417
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He's a misogynist. He's, you know, the whole thing.

418
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So people stopped liking him

419
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and they, you know, his

420
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
his stories started getting

421
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
worse, I guess.

422
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
His art got a lot more stylized.

423
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't

424
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
really care that much for Miller's art style.

425
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, people have always said that his art

426
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
has gotten worse

427
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and they're right

428
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
looking at it.

429
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was going to defend him, but then like

430
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm looking at it right now and I'm like, yeah.

431
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've never been like a big fan

432
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
of Miller's artwork and I've never really been

433
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
of a John Romita Junior's artwork.

434
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
At least not any of the more recent

435
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I like John Romita Junior's art style.

436
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't like John Romita Junior's more recent art style.

437
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He had a different art style

438
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
like when he first started and then it

439
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
progressively started changing and now they're all sausage fingers.

440
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, that's how you, that's sort of how it is

441
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
with Frank Miller's art. Like you can tell that it's still

442
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
his style, but like he's just

443
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
it's evolved in such a way that like

444
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
it's gotten more and more stylized

445
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and cartoony to the point where it's,

446
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
you know, the anatomy is very

447
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
weird and a lot of people hate it

448
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and I hate it.

449
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But um, yeah, it's not so bad.

450
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But anyways, you know, so

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
he wrote The Dark Knight Returns a million years ago

452
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in the 80s. It's a story about

453
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
old-ass Batman.

454
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He's old and he's retired. He's

455
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
bitter. He comes back

456
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
to kick more ass for one last hurrah.

457
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Then like, you know,

458
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
years later and like the

459
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
year 2000 or something, he wrote The Dark Knight

460
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Strikes Again, which was like the second of that

461
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
series. And in that series,

462
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
everyone hated it. It was

463
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
poopy. Um, I have it.

464
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I've never actually read the second one because

465
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
everyone's told me it's bad, but I know what happens

466
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in it. It's, it turns out that like

467
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
like Dick Grayson

468
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
turned into like a spooky

469
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
bad guy man and nobody liked it.

470
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But anyways, the point is nobody liked the

471
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
second one and nobody likes Frank Miller anymore.

472
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, but he's come back to do The Dark Knight 3 now

473
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the, the, the third

474
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
in his trilogy, I guess, of this

475
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
saga that he started way back in the 80s.

476
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Which honestly has sold like exceptionally

477
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
well, but I, but

478
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it's had some issues with

479
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
you know, being churned out on time.

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The last issue

481
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I remember specifically it getting canceled

482
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
for resuscitation at a later date

483
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
when I was dealing with it

484
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
at least twice, I think.

485
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And you know, that always kind of puts

486
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
a wrench in things, honestly.

487
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, yeah.

488
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The big question going into this

489
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
from everyone is that like

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
does Frank Miller still have it? Can he still

491
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
tell a good Batman story? Because

492
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
you know, everybody hates him

493
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
now. He's, he's not, he doesn't

494
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
have the same, his name doesn't carry the same

495
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
weight as it once did because

496
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
so much of his recent stuff has been so critically

497
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
panned like his All-Star Batman and Robin

498
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
from a couple years back.

499
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I remember that. Which is basically a meme

500
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
because it's so

501
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
weirdly aggressive and cynical and

502
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
out of character. Like out of

503
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
character, even for Batman, it's

504
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
like way too cynical. It reads more like

505
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Rorschach as Batman

506
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and it's a really

507
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
weird, like hilariously

508
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
bad comic. It was so bad

509
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that like

510
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
when the first few issues

511
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
of All-Star Batman and Robin came out, everybody

512
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
hated it so much and said it was so terrible

513
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
that like by the

514
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
fifth issue, Frank Miller had to go

515
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
oh, no, it's

516
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
it's a parody, it's campy.

517
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Like he had to like go, he had to back

518
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
pedal and play that card. So then like from

519
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
issue five on, he tries to

520
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
make it even more extreme to make it seem

521
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
like he was trying to make a parody of Batman

522
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
from the get go, but he's not fooling anyone

523
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
so it just gets weirder and dumber and weirder

524
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and crappier.

525
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But it was not meant to be a parody.

526
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's bullshit.

527
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He screwed the pooch on that one big

528
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
time and everyone hated it

529
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and nobody likes him anymore

530
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
as a writer. But

531
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
he's gone back to the

532
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
storyline that made him famous in the first

533
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
place and

534
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I've really liked this so far

535
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The Dark Knight 3. Have you been reading it?

536
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah, and

537
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
my customers have really enjoyed it too.

538
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I have some really avid

539
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
fans of this particular comic

540
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
primarily because they really enjoyed like the first Dark Knight.

541
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But much like you said

542
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
earlier, a lot of people didn't seem to enjoy

543
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the second one very much.

544
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think everyone's just kind of patiently waiting

545
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to see how this one concludes.

546
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I've yet to have anybody actually like go out of the way

547
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
to cancel it or anything.

548
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Nobody has actually said anything like

549
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you know, oh well I don't like where this is going, just take it off my sub.

550
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So

551
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I...

552
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Was it only supposed to be a seven part series? I can't remember.

553
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Is it eight parts?

554
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Seven's a weird number to me. This one definitely ends

555
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
on a there's gonna be at least one more

556
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
part. Okay, so it's an eight part series.

557
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

558
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, no

559
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I think it's good but

560
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you're also talking to somebody who

561
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
doesn't really, I'm not

562
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
really that big of a Frank Miller fan.

563
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Really? I, you know, a lot of people are

564
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
always like the Dark Knight is one of the best stories of all time

565
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
but you know, anytime I go back and I talk to people

566
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
about my favorite Batman stories

567
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the Dark Knight's never there.

568
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't know

569
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
if I'd call it like one of my favorite

570
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Batman stories of all time

571
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
but I mean everything in it

572
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
is clearly important

573
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to like the pop culture

574
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
mythos of the characters. And you're right

575
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
about that. There's a lot of people that really like

576
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
the Robin that's in that particular Dark Knight

577
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
even though I don't like

578
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Carrie that much. I have

579
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
conflicted feelings about her. It seems like she was never really

580
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
trained at all at any point.

581
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
She was, even in the movie, she just kind of

582
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
puts on the outfit. Like she just shows up and she's Robin.

583
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, and like even in the

584
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
movie at the end when she's like running up next

585
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to Batman's tank, she's just like, she's there for

586
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
moral support but she's wearing the costume. I don't

587
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
know.

588
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But I did, I have an appreciation

589
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
for the whole like Batman vs Superman

590
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
thing in the Dark Knight. I thought that was

591
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
really good. Yeah.

592
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But it's like you said

593
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
BVS basically bastardized that.

594
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah.

595
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The great thing about the Dark Knight 3

596
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is that it really seems like it's

597
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
coming from like a place of catharsis

598
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
from Frank Miller. Like it seems like it's

599
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
a little bit more optimistic

600
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
in tone than some of his other

601
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
stuff because he garnered such a

602
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
reputation for cynicism

603
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and like a lot of his philosophies

604
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
about Batman and superheroes in general, I

605
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
disagree with too because he always

606
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
talks trash about

607
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Batman shouldn't have a Robin

608
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
that's gay and that's kid stuff and Batman

609
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and when superheroes

610
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Superman shouldn't

611
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
be dating Lois Lane. He should be dating Wonder Woman

612
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
because they're both strong and they can have sex

613
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
through a mountain.

614
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And there's even like an entire series

615
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
about Superman and Wonder Woman being together

616
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and breaking up.

617
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you really want to get into

618
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
the philosophy or the mind of

619
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Frank Miller and how he feels about superheroes

620
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and things like that, I feel like Sin City is

621
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
probably one of those books that you need to read

622
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
even though I didn't care that much for Sin City.

623
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I've always

624
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
gravitated more towards

625
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
like a Grant Morrison

626
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
sort of philosophy. Like the stuff that he says

627
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in interviews and stuff. When you understand him.

628
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I always feel like yeah, this guy really gets it.

629
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like

630
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
because like

631
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
because Grant Morrison's whole thing is that

632
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
he has zero cynicism about superheroes whatsoever.

633
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like he goes into every book like

634
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
well yeah, of course Batman

635
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
would have a Robin. Of course he would have a best friend

636
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
who's 12 years old. Why wouldn't you

637
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
if you were a billionaire and they've got a billion dollars? Why wouldn't you fight

638
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
crime with a little boy?

639
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He's your best friend.

640
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Like he's always talks like he loves everything about

641
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
superheroes and like he goes into every

642
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
comic like wanting to talk about like

643
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
he wants to incorporate like the entire

644
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
mythos and like the whole continuity

645
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
of like 70 years of Batman into it.

646
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Grant Morrison's my favorite. He's a good old

647
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
puppy dog boy is what he is.

648
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Did Grant Morrison do the black mirror?

649
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't know. I don't remember.

650
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I just remember the black mirror being like one of my favorite titles.

651
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Um, but yeah

652
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
going on. Yeah, Grant Morrison's great.

653
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah, but and so I guess

654
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
they're sort of opposites because Frank Miller has always been

655
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
more cynical it seems like. But in this

656
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
in The Dark Knight 3 he seems like he's

657
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
he's writing it from a place of like

658
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
wanting to be more optimistic again because

659
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the whole story of this one is that

660
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
um, you know

661
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Batman and Superman are working together again

662
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and they're really kicking ass and

663
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and coming together and saving the day there's

664
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
there's this like religious sect of

665
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
assholes inside the bottled city of

666
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Kandor who breaks out who they're all

667
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Kryptonian so they're all strong and Superman

668
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
so they break out and start raking havoc and trying

669
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
to destroy the world and Batman says

670
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you know I'm a hundred and seven thousand

671
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
years old but I ain't gonna stand for this

672
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
he walks his rickety ass up a mountain

673
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and he he he goes to like the fortress

674
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
of solitude and he and he thaws

675
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Superman out of his block of ice because

676
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Superman he's just been hanging out in a block

677
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
of ice like he doesn't give a shit anymore

678
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and he goes to the block of ice says hey hey Kent

679
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
get your ass out of that ice

680
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
we gotta beat people up and Superman

681
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
he hears them and he's like what we gotta beat

682
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
people up yeah

683
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and then Superman and they just they just

684
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
beat people up and there's this great scene

685
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
where like you know they're fighting

686
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
all these Kryptonians so Batman he

687
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
arranges to have it like he does some

688
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
shit and it's like raining Kryptonite

689
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
rain and it's weakening all the Kryptonians

690
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
but then they're still beating them up

691
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because there's so many of them or whatever but then

692
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Superman shows up and he's so

693
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
so like the the Batman armor

694
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
from like the first book

695
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
where Batman wore that like super powerful

696
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
armor to fight Superman it's in Batman

697
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
v Superman the movie the same armor yeah

698
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
they he did he does like a call back to this

699
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
where because it's raining Kryptonite

700
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Superman gets in like

701
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
his own Batman armor to help

702
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
beat up the Kryptonians

703
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and just punching them with his fists

704
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and stuff it's super cool it's the best

705
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
it's my favorite comic everyone

706
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think this is a good one

707
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
yeah and then the

708
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and then the the latest issue there's

709
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
this great scene this shit yeah

710
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
yeah we're looking at the scene right now

711
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm sure Jesse will put it up on the

712
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
spoilers I guess but yeah

713
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
yeah but it's

714
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
it's just this great moment that

715
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Bruce and Kent both share together

716
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
towards the end of the other latest issue

717
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
but yeah um

718
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I will say one thing about Frank Miller's artwork

719
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
like I know I already said that I don't really like

720
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
it I'm really

721
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
emphasizing that with the way that he draws Wonder Woman

722
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
oh god

723
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
it she's

724
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
there's that vagethumping feminist coming out of

725
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
you again no it's not feminist

726
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I actually agree

727
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't like

728
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm gonna get reamed for it

729
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I just fucking know it but

730
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
she's just so aesthetically unappealing

731
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
to me drawn this way

732
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
yeah he's she's really weird looking in this

733
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
in his style

734
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
he kind of draws her like

735
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
like a spooky person

736
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
yeah I mean she's got that like spooky

737
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
bulky yeah

738
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
like fucking

739
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
she looks like she's like

740
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
she looks like she needs to be wearing pants

741
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
she's like a fat soccer mom on steroids

742
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
in a bikini that's like 10 sizes

743
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
too small for her

744
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
she's like the soccer mom from the earlier seasons

745
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
a family guy remember

746
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
he punches

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
this guy that he assumes is a man

748
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and then everybody starts screaming

749
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
he's like oh my wife

750
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and then he's like what you mean

751
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
your husband and then you start hearing

752
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
like crying he's like yeah

753
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
she wanted to labor she had a baby

754
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
that's kind of what

755
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that's kind of what it reminds me

756
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
of the way that she's drawn

757
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
it's just it's really not

758
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
it's not good looking I'm sorry

759
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
it's shallow but I don't care

760
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I don't like it hey man there's nothing worse

761
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
than a woman who ain't pretty

762
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
yeah I go

763
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
that's your best quality you know

764
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that your hashtag not fat oh my god

765
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Civil War 2 came out

766
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the last one of that finally that's over

767
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
okay so once again

768
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
with Civil War

769
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
they announced that this was only going to be like a 7 part

770
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
series

771
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and before this they did the same thing with Secret Wars

772
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
but then all of a sudden they were like

773
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
we liked this so much

774
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
that we're gonna tag on an extra

775
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
issue that's gonna take forever

776
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to fucking release

777
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and you know Civil War 2

778
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
when it first released like it

779
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I was into it

780
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I may not have been as into it as I was

781
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
in the original Civil War

782
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
in fact I feel like the only reason why they even came out with Civil War 2

783
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
is because of the fucking movie

784
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
but

785
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
but it's taken so long

786
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
for them to actually conclude

787
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
this fucking storyline that I just

788
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I've stopped caring

789
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I really have

790
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
you know especially since like previous already

791
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
came out with stuff saying you know

792
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
here's our next storyline here's

793
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Monsters Unleashed about to happen

794
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
it's gotten to the point where the events

795
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
are so bloated and so long

796
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
that the next ones are already coming out

797
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
by the time they're even over it

798
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
yeah they did that with Infamous Iron Man

799
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
like I remember a ton of people going

800
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
wow spoilers much

801
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
for Civil War when Infamous Iron Man 1 came out

802
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
like Avengers

803
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
or X-Men vs. Inhumans is already coming out

804
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and this one has been

805
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
so that's the next event and it's already done

806
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
it's already done

807
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I think IVX is already done

808
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
well

809
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I've already ranted about Civil War 2

810
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
so I think AVX only had like

811
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
issue number one is out

812
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
no IVX

813
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
IVX definitely has two issues

814
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
same thing it's the same shit

815
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
you're kind of right

816
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
wait no no no I'm thinking of

817
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
no it's not IVX

818
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm thinking of there was another one before

819
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
where it's all about it's like a four part series

820
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
it was all about like

821
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I guess the X-Men getting wiped out or something

822
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I already forgot

823
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I don't know what I'm talking about

824
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
is that Harley Quinn I see

825
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
yeah I guess this came out too

826
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Harley Quinn's Little Black Book

827
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
issue number five didn't the first issue come out last year

828
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Harley Quinn has like 10 different series

829
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't even know what I'm looking at here

830
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
but the cover is clearly

831
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
it's a nod to the old Muhammad Ali vs. Superman cover

832
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Ben she's in a skimpy little thing

833
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
hey look it's Obama

834
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I hear Obama you're not

835
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
you're not relevant anymore you're just another black nigger

836
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Obama

837
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
welcome to

838
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
panel cast the most racist podcast

839
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
on the internet it's supposed to be a

840
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
family friendly comic book show

841
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and it's just an excuse for me to say the N word

842
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
50 times every week

843
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Obama

844
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
so I didn't read this comic

845
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't think I need to read it to know that it's

846
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
garbage oh yeah we have

847
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we both have

848
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
an issue with current quality

849
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Harley Quinn comic books

850
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I have a lot that I could say about how much

851
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
she's designed alone this is like wait

852
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
what is that

853
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
wait a minute

854
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't even think this is a recent comic

855
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I think someone just uploaded this

856
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
because this is

857
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
maybe no it says February yeah

858
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
February 2016 well that's number one

859
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
yeah maybe it is a recent comic

860
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
no number one was I mean she's

861
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
because in this she still looks like she has her

862
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
this is still her new 52 design

863
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
but they've since redesigned her again and she looks

864
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
a little bit better now but still shit

865
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
she's a pre-designer to make her look more like the

866
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Suicide Squad version from the movies which

867
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
but she still has the

868
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
crappy bleached skin

869
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
look at the wall eyed

870
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
who hired this artist

871
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I don't like it

872
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't like it

873
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
the black and red thing is terrible too

874
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I mean the hair

875
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
okay so

876
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
again this is

877
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
another thing that I'm probably gonna get reamed for

878
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
because everybody loves Harley Quinn

879
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
is like one of the most subscribed comic books

880
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
that I know of that DC has released

881
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
it is the Deadpool of the DC

882
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
universe everybody wants

883
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
every single Harley Quinn fucking anything

884
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
when it comes out Harley Quinn

885
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and Poison Ivy Harley Quinn and Power

886
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Girl Harley Quinn

887
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
her little black fucking book

888
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
god what else Harley Quinn's little gang

889
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
or whatever you know there's so much

890
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
fucking Harley Quinn the gang of Harleys

891
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
actually I don't think there was a Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy

892
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
the gang of Harleys which is basically Deadpool

893
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and the Mercs for money

894
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
yeah again this Harley Quinn is

895
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
DC's answer to Deadpool

896
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
for Marvel like I just

897
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
which is

898
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
she shouldn't be because that's not

899
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
what the character is

900
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
okay so Bruce Tim was the one who created

901
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Paul Dini created her

902
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
but Bruce Tim was the one who designed

903
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
her character I think

904
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
or at least he drew her

905
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I think he finalized the design

906
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
if I remember right I think Paul Dini

907
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Paul Dini to this day is still

908
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the only person who

909
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
writes her correctly

910
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
like the only time I enjoy

911
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
every time I read a Harley Quinn comic

912
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
if I enjoy it without

913
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
fail I'll go I know who wrote this

914
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Paul Dini and I'll look at it and then sure enough

915
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
because he's the only one who gets her because he created her

916
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I think for the past two years

917
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
the person who's been writing for her

918
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
um it's been a mannequin

919
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
or somebody else and you know I get

920
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
that a lot that look you just gave me

921
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I get that look a lot when I say that

922
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you know oh well Amanda Connor is going to be

923
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
writing this comic

924
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and you always see the same look from everybody

925
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
they're just like oh

926
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
she's writing for something

927
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
not drawing it

928
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
well that wasn't why I gave that look I gave that look because of course it would be a woman

929
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
ruining Harley Quinn

930
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
well fair enough

931
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
of course it would be some wannabe

932
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
empowered fucking Tumblrina

933
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
who

934
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
God

935
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
they don't want to acknowledge

936
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
what makes the character special because they think

937
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
it's like derogatory now

938
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
DC

939
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
either they don't want to acknowledge it

940
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
or they just don't get it DC doesn't

941
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
understand why people

942
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
love Harley Quinn they don't understand

943
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
why this character who

944
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
was created 20 years ago

945
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is as popular and as important

946
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
to the cultural zeitgeist as

947
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Spider-Man and Superman and Batman who were all created

948
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
70 years ago they don't want to

949
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
acknowledge the reason why so many

950
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
women relate to this character

951
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
why so many men can relate to her

952
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
why there's so much cosplay of her

953
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
why everyone loves this character

954
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
so much it's not because she's a

955
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
wacky zany deadpool knockoff

956
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
it's not because she's an amoral killer

957
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
who goes around and commits crimes

958
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and stuff it's not because she's a free spirit

959
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
or an empowered you know take no

960
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
shit does whatever she wants

961
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
badass suicide girl

962
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
people love Harley Quinn because she's

963
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
a sad damaged human

964
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
character she's relatable

965
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the whole the entire basis of the character

966
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
is that she fell in love with

967
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the wrong person and she knows it

968
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
but it's ruined her fucking life

969
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and everyone's been there that's

970
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
why the character became so popular

971
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
in the first place she's not insane

972
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
she's she's not a wacky

973
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
crazy person like the Joker the only reason

974
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that she's acts like that is because she's dating

975
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
the Joker she has moments

976
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
anything from the old animated series

977
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
that you watch anything that Paul Dini has ever written

978
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
you can see she'll always

979
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
the thing that humanizes the character is these

980
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
little moments where like the Joker kicks

981
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
her out on her ass and she sits there in like an alley

982
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and she goes how did how did it get

983
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to this how did my life become

984
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
this you know she she

985
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
she's intelligent enough

986
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
to understand how weak she is

987
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and how flawed she is and how fucked up

988
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
how badly she screwed up her own life

989
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
she's smart enough to realize it but she's

990
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
not quite strong enough

991
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
to change things and that's what people

992
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
relate to because everyone in the world

993
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
is this you know everyone relates

994
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
to spider-man because everyone has guilt

995
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
everyone relates to Superman

996
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
because everyone feels like they don't belong

997
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
sometimes everyone fucking

998
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
relates to Batman because everyone

999
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
their parents got shot

1000
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
watching Zorro that happened to everyone

1001
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
in the world all of these characters

1002
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
everyone relates to Bruce Banner because

1003
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
everyone has a side of themselves they don't like

1004
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
everyone loses their temper or like

1005
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
you know everyone can see these flaws in themselves

1006
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and that's what people love about Harley Quinn

1007
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
she's a flawed fucking person

1008
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
she doesn't have to be

1009
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
an empowered

1010
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
wacky Deadpool knockoff going on

1011
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
these crazy mercenary adventures every week

1012
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
she just has to be a person

1013
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
trying to be better than she is

1014
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
and I don't really touch upon that anymore

1015
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
like any of the Suicide Squad

1016
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
comics even the movie

1017
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
it's just Mr. J

1018
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and I'm crazy

1019
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and he he I'm cute

1020
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
but I'm kind of ballistic

1021
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
am I gonna kiss you?

1022
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
am I gonna cut you? you never know

1023
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
it's just terrible

1024
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
it's accurate and it's terrible

1025
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
like it and you know

1026
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
it's so devastating to me because I really

1027
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I really enjoyed the character back then

1028
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and you know if everyone does

1029
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
she's a great character

1030
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
she's a character that didn't exist

1031
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
before in comics like that specific

1032
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
moral struggle

1033
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
yeah I know like that specific

1034
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
moral struggle that defines her

1035
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
of just being in love

1036
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
with the wrong person

1037
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
everyone ever has been there

1038
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
everyone has felt that pain and everyone has gone

1039
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
fucking insane from it

1040
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
her whole origin

1041
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
is just that love can make you crazy

1042
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
not that she's crazy and so she fell in love

1043
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
that's the misunderstanding

1044
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that I think is the basis of all these

1045
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
crappy new comics

1046
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
it's just

1047
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
incredibly frustrating that none of these writers seem to get her

1048
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
or that they don't want to acknowledge

1049
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I think they don't want to acknowledge it

1050
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
because people have it in their heads now

1051
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
that it's like somehow derogatory

1052
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
to women

1053
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
to acknowledge the fact

1054
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
that the basis of this character is that

1055
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
she's weak

1056
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but it's not derogatory to constantly throw her

1057
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
into that situation time and time again

1058
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
she's weak and she's in love

1059
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
she's a hopeless romantic

1060
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and she's

1061
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and she's abused

1062
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and no one wants to

1063
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
it seems like they're trying to move away from that

1064
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
because

1065
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
it's not a good role model anymore

1066
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
well

1067
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
as if her being like an insane psychopath

1068
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
serial killer is any better of a role model

1069
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
right and you know actually

1070
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
it's a funny line that people

1071
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
ride upon when it comes to Harley Quinn

1072
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
so if you haven't seen the new

1073
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Suicide Squad movie or any of the

1074
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
interviews with Margo

1075
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Robbie whatever

1076
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
you know she explicitly says that

1077
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
that she really wished they had touched upon

1078
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
the whole

1079
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
the actual abuse because so far it's only been

1080
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
glorified

1081
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that movie Suicide Squad

1082
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
was weirdly romantic

1083
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
like

1084
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
they seem to really love each other

1085
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
in that movie

1086
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
he loved her a lot

1087
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
he was obsessed with getting back to her the whole movie

1088
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
which isn't really that much like the Joker

1089
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I guess

1090
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I haven't seen the Suicide Squad movie

1091
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
if you didn't know

1092
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
well the whole Suicide Squad movie is that

1093
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the Joker is so

1094
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
in love with Harley Quinn

1095
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
that he's on a rampage trying to get back to her

1096
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and he's like

1097
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
there's this scene where

1098
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
he is so broken up

1099
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
about Harley

1100
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
not being there that he goes in this room

1101
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
with all these knives and he lays on the floor and cries

1102
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
like a fucking like a 14 year old emo kid

1103
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
he's crying over not having

1104
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
his boo with him

1105
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the whole Suicide Squad movie

1106
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
is about the Joker

1107
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
he just wants his girlfriend back because he's

1108
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
really in love with her

1109
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
that's not very characteristic

1110
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of him

1111
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
this is coming from the character

1112
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
who has actively

1113
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
gone against Harley Quinn because

1114
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
she went out of her way to try and do something

1115
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
to appeal to him

1116
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
to please him such as kidnapping Batman

1117
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and trying to

1118
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you know kill him in a way that would be funny

1119
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
to both her and the Joker

1120
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
but you know he

1121
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
fucking gets angry at her for it

1122
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
he's like you know how dare you do this

1123
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and throws it out a fucking window for it

1124
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
this is coming from that relationship

1125
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
this is coming from the relationship where he's like time and time again

1126
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
like trying to kill her over and over

1127
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
what the fuck

1128
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
are you serious at Suicide Squad

1129
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm not

1130
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
as against the

1131
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Jared Leto Joker as everyone else is

1132
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I know it looks fucking retarded

1133
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
but to me

1134
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I think a big aspect of the character

1135
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the Joker specifically

1136
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
what makes the Joker such a good character

1137
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
is that he is inherently

1138
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
open to interpretation

1139
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
like I don't think there can really be a wrong Joker

1140
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
that Young Justice episode was pretty bad

1141
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Young Justice

1142
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
episode is it the

1143
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
oddly young looking Joker

1144
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
he looked like David Tennant

1145
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
yeah oh god he did

1146
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
don't do this to me

1147
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
so there can be a wrong Joker

1148
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
nevermind forget what I just said

1149
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
anyway

1150
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
so rewinding back to the whole

1151
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
abusive situation that Harley Quinn has been in

1152
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
so there's been tons and tons and tons of stuff

1153
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
that's touched upon that have you ever read Gotham City Sirens

1154
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that was another

1155
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
mini series

1156
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I say mini series kind of loosely because it was like two volumes long

1157
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
but that was

1158
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
two volumes long I guess now

1159
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
nevermind

1160
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
anyway

1161
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
wasn't that ongoing of a series

1162
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but they touched upon Harley Quinn trying to

1163
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
overcome what she dealt with the trauma

1164
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
of being in a relationship with Joker

1165
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and Poison Ivy and Catwoman both trying to

1166
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
support her through it

1167
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and injustice even though that's not in the same universe

1168
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
they touch upon that a lot

1169
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
in fact I remember there was a scene

1170
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
specific to Harley Quinn

1171
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
god he's like one of my favorite characters

1172
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
starts with an L

1173
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
he comes from outer space he kicked the shit out of Superman

1174
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Lobo, thank you

1175
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
god I don't know why that left my brain for a second

1176
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
he's one of my favorite characters

1177
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the original not

1178
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
the new 52 redesign

1179
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't want to talk about that

1180
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
but there's a scene

1181
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
an injustice where Lobo like backhands Harley Quinn

1182
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
if I remember right

1183
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and you know she like spits for a second

1184
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and like looks at him and says you know

1185
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
if there's anything that she's learned

1186
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and like her long line of being Harley Quinn

1187
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
is that she's never gonna take shit from anybody

1188
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
ever again and of course she's specifically

1189
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
talking about Joker

1190
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I actually really like the injustice comics

1191
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I think that's

1192
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I swing between liking it and hating it honestly

1193
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
to me the injustice comics for being like

1194
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
an else worlds

1195
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
the characters in that still seem like more

1196
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
in character than in most mainline DC

1197
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
publications

1198
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
they've definitely gone some dark routes with that one

1199
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
but yeah Harley Quinn

1200
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
specifically says you know she's been abused long enough

1201
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
she's never gonna accept this again

1202
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and I guess she ends up throwing Lobo out the window

1203
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
or something something absurd for like

1204
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Harley Quinn level strength considering Lobo

1205
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
is who he is well Harley Quinn

1206
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
is super strong or she was

1207
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
before the new 52 I don't know if they changed it

1208
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
well Harley Quinn but there was a long time where like

1209
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Poison Ivy had given her a serum

1210
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that gave her like Captain America

1211
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
ooh I remember that

1212
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
oh god you know

1213
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I think they only remember that when it's

1214
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
convenient to the plot but that was a thing

1215
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
you're not wrong probably

1216
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
but um

1217
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
yeah the thing about

1218
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
like to me the core of the character of Harley Quinn

1219
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and

1220
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
remember I'm right

1221
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
so objectively the core of the character

1222
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
is

1223
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
just that

1224
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
she's a good person who surrounds herself with bad people

1225
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
bad influences toxic influences

1226
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
if not for

1227
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
you know she could be

1228
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
she could be a force for good in the world

1229
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
if not for the fact that

1230
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
her boyfriend is a bad guy

1231
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
her best friend is a bad guy Poison Ivy

1232
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
her boyfriend

1233
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
the Joker is you know a mass murdering

1234
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
psychotic terrorist

1235
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
her best friend Poison Ivy is

1236
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
a man-hating eco-terrorist

1237
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
you know

1238
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
even Catwoman is a fucking burglar

1239
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and not that there's anything wrong with burglaring

1240
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
well she's what they would call it

1241
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
anti-hero I guess

1242
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
but um that's like the core of the character

1243
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
like everybody has someone like that in their lives

1244
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
everybody knows someone who you know

1245
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
is better than the people they surround themselves with

1246
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
who has bad influences

1247
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and does dumb shit and gets

1248
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
becomes a burden on everyone they love

1249
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
you know she's just

1250
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
so much about the way

1251
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
the character was originally written and originally conceived

1252
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
is so human and so relatable

1253
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and that's why she took off

1254
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
she just like skyrocketed immediately

1255
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
she's only existed for 20 years

1256
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and she's like one of the pillars of comic book media

1257
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and that's why

1258
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
one of my favorite episodes

1259
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
revolving around Harley Quinn

1260
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
was like the one I think where

1261
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
where it's just Batman and Harley

1262
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
like I don't know if you remember that from the animated series

1263
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but I really liked that episode

1264
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
the one where she kisses him at the end is

1265
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
you're not a bad guy B-man

1266
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
there's so much that

1267
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I think that episode is actually in the opening

1268
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
of the panel cast it's when

1269
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
home again home again

1270
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
yeah no

1271
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
yeah

1272
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Harley Quinn is just it's

1273
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
it's complicated like I understand that

1274
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
you know DC has to

1275
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
have an answer to Marvel regardless

1276
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
and they have to have some kind of balance

1277
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
to the dark and grittiness that is

1278
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
DC comic books because if you look at Rebirth

1279
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and you look at New 52

1280
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
it's prominently like dark it's dark

1281
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
it's scary it's violent

1282
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and then you have Harley Quinn

1283
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
who yes it's still violent but

1284
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
they have all this bubbly

1285
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
wacky shit going on

1286
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
it's just

1287
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
yeah and like they

1288
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
she has too much of a sense of humor

1289
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
she's too wacky

1290
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
she never takes anything seriously

1291
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
even Deadpool has

1292
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
his moments where he like steps back

1293
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Deadpool is a more serious character than modern Harley

1294
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
holy shit the

1295
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
the issue of Deadpool

1296
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Deadpool comics the one of the more

1297
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
recent issues of Deadpool is where he is

1298
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
trying to help out this girl who

1299
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
he finds on top of a on top of the

1300
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Spider-Man's fucking I talked about that

1301
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
in the panel cast that's right

1302
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that was a really great

1303
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
did you yeah there was a there was

1304
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
that whole arc from Brian Postsein where

1305
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Deadpool and Captain America

1306
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and Wolverine went to go fight some weapon

1307
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
ex-bad guys and he was looking for like his old

1308
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
girlfriend yeah was pregnant with his

1309
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
daughter or whatever and you know

1310
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Deadpool finds this like mass grave of bodies

1311
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and in the mass grave he finds his old girlfriend

1312
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and

1313
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it's like a really sad he's like crying

1314
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and like yelling and Captain America is like

1315
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
nooo

1316
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Deadpool has had some very intense moments like you know

1317
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
yeah it's like they're trying to make her Deadpool

1318
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
but they're also making her a worse Deadpool

1319
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
because she doesn't have the

1320
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
they're not giving her any of that pathos

1321
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
they're not giving back the depth that she used to have

1322
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Deadpool still has depth and you know

1323
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I still get upset when people will be like

1324
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
oh another Deadpool coming he's just another

1325
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
wacky zany piece of shit and it's like

1326
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
like it's not the characters fault

1327
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
it's really not

1328
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and you know I guess you could say the same for Harley

1329
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
it's not really her fault she is totally

1330
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
marketable sex sells

1331
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
even the Deadpool movie you know had

1332
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
it had a core to it it had like an emotional

1333
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
core there was none of that in the Suicide Squad

1334
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
movie and well if in all fairness

1335
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Ryan Reynolds really has like a passion

1336
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
when it comes to comic books and I know

1337
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
that I know a lot of people will like look at the Green Lantern

1338
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
movie and be like are you sure about that

1339
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
statement it's like but that's not really his fault

1340
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
he did not have he did not have

1341
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
a great hand in the Green Lantern like he did

1342
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
in Deadpool but anyway

1343
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
it's just sad to me that they've you know

1344
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
they've taken this character who had

1345
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
so much depth to her and was such an interesting

1346
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
character that you could write stories about

1347
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
forever and

1348
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
due to you know

1349
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
marketing or misunderstanding or whatever they've

1350
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
devolved her into this like

1351
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
warped perversion this parody

1352
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
of what the character once was

1353
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
of just like

1354
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm gonna kill everybody

1355
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and I have a talking squirrel

1356
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
for my best friend and

1357
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
there's poison ivy and we're just

1358
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
lesbians now we're just lesbians

1359
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't you know

1360
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
it doesn't bother me and she's a wacky

1361
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
crazy person and that's another

1362
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
thing like the constant like the

1363
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
the masturbatory I'm so

1364
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
crazy shit

1365
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
it's so it's so annoying

1366
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
because she's not crazy

1367
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
you can't hold me against what I do

1368
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
because I'm a little

1369
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
crazy

1370
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm a little loony toon girl

1371
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
it's shit

1372
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
she's not supposed to be

1373
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
crazy she's just

1374
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
dependent and she's

1375
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
she's a thrill seeker I guess but she's not

1376
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
psychotic like they had

1377
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
an episode in the animated series a whole

1378
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
episode written by Paul Dini we're like

1379
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
at the beginning of the episode

1380
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
she passes a test

1381
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and she's certified sane and she's

1382
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
released from Arkham yeah and the whole

1383
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
reason the only reason she ends up back

1384
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
in Arkham at the end is because

1385
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
she can't acclimate

1386
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
to being free again to society's rules

1387
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
again because she's been in this fucked

1388
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
up lifestyle for so long it's

1389
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
kind of like a commentary on like people

1390
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
getting released from jail and stuff and

1391
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
going right back because they can't acclimate

1392
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
to society anymore right but

1393
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
you know that's how

1394
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
the creator of the character always wrote her

1395
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
she's completely sane

1396
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
she's just retarded

1397
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
you know

1398
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
it's one way to put it

1399
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
she's just a flawed human being

1400
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and she's interesting and I know what

1401
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I know like the comeback to everything

1402
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm going to say is

1403
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
well why can't the character evolve

1404
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
why can't there be character development

1405
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
why can't she move on from the Joker

1406
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
money money money

1407
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'm my opinion

1408
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
it's marketability

1409
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm not saying that the character can't evolve

1410
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm all for character development

1411
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I've made many videos about how much

1412
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I love character development in all media

1413
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
but that's no excuse

1414
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
character development has to be natural

1415
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and logical you can't just

1416
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
rewrite everything about a character

1417
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and like try to fit a square peg into

1418
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
a round hole and that's what they're doing

1419
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
with Harley Quinn they're taking a character

1420
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
one thing and they're constantly trying

1421
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
to ram it down our throats in a way

1422
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
that the character shouldn't be

1423
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and was never intended

1424
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I mean you can't deny that

1425
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
you know they won't let her evolve

1426
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I mean they just they won't

1427
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
yeah she's going to be fucking

1428
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
this crappy Deadpool thing forever

1429
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and you know every now and then you're going to get

1430
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
like these glimpses of hope

1431
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
just like these moments of clarity from her

1432
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and that's all you're ever going to get

1433
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
from DC when it comes to Harley Quinn

1434
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
right now you're not going to see

1435
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
like any like true redeemable anything

1436
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
coming from them because it's all about

1437
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
what sells and Harley Quinn right

1438
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
now regardless of how

1439
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
we feel specifically you and I

1440
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
because it sells

1441
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
this new Harley Quinn

1442
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
fucking sells do you know how I'm like

1443
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
when the Halloween party

1444
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
you went to how many Harley Quinn's did you see I'm curious

1445
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and this year's Halloween party

1446
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
yeah I don't think I saw any

1447
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
but I know what you mean there's always Harley Quinn's

1448
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
like the new Harley Quinn and that's what I saw a lot of

1449
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and this is oh you know what yeah you're right

1450
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
there might have been some suicide squad Harley Quinn's

1451
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
yeah no again

1452
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
marketability like DC needs to make money somehow

1453
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and if Harley Quinn

1454
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
is going to be like that little golden

1455
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
goose fucking egg layer

1456
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
than whatever fine and if this

1457
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
if this system works for them that's fine

1458
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
but I don't I will never

1459
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
actively read or encourage

1460
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Harley to anybody if they say

1461
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
hey I've never read

1462
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
the new Harley Quinn comics what do you think

1463
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I will always put into the older stuff

1464
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
that's what I mean is that like because in the comics

1465
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
you know she's not like the Joker's girlfriend

1466
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
anymore anything she's like a strong independent

1467
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
woman who needs no man and like yeah

1468
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
so so that's like their

1469
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
answer to all these complaints is that like

1470
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
well no she has developed

1471
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
as a character because she's not

1472
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
just she hasn't developed you've just

1473
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
changed her changing her isn't

1474
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
developing her yeah

1475
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
like I don't like

1476
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
if you she had already developed

1477
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and not been the Joker's girlfriend anymore

1478
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
she was like that before the new 52

1479
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and it was fine she developed naturally

1480
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
well it's also been an on and off again thing

1481
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
honestly yeah I think

1482
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
it's only like recently like

1483
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
post Gotham City sirens that she's finally

1484
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
been like if you ever touch me again

1485
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Joker I'll fucking kill you

1486
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
yeah which we know will never happen

1487
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
and like the whole like crazy like

1488
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
in the movie

1489
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
in the Suicide Squad movie there's like a

1490
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
brief flashback to how she became Harley

1491
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Quinn and it shows the Joker

1492
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
literally giving her

1493
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
shock treatment to make her

1494
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
crazy

1495
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
are you serious

1496
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
yeah are you serious

1497
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
like could you get it

1498
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
more that wrong that's like

1499
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
that's not even just wrong it's like a

1500
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
perversion like to weigh everything

1501
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
that's cool about her origin no

1502
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
no god he's so much better than

1503
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
that like I get okay so first of all I know

1504
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Joker is not beyond torment

1505
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
but he's also like the thing

1506
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
that makes him scary is that he can make

1507
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
you fall in love with him he can make a normal

1508
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
sane person fall in love with him

1509
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
with just talking that's

1510
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
like his power he is a true

1511
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
psychopath exactly um not

1512
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
sociopath mind you a fucking

1513
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
psychopath yeah there is no remorse

1514
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
he does what he does because

1515
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
if it works it will work in his favor

1516
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and he knows it works electrocuting

1517
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
somebody's brain to make them crazy like

1518
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
you no that's not

1519
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that's not interesting that's not scary

1520
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
well don't kink shame him

1521
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
are you sure it was to make her crazy it wasn't

1522
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
just like that's what they heavily implied

1523
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
that he okay okay to make her

1524
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
crazy well then I'm okay

1525
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
that's disappointing

1526
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
yeah um

1527
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
well what the fuck so like yeah she's

1528
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
not she's not like

1529
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
a person who was

1530
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
seduced to the dark side or

1531
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
or lulled by the Joker into

1532
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
becoming a worse person

1533
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
she's just a person who was

1534
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
basically you know just cattle

1535
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
prod me yes she was

1536
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
just made crazy and I guess that's how

1537
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
shock treatment works you just become a serial killer

1538
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I guess so

1539
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I guess I've been doing it wrong

1540
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I read a suicide squad comic recently

1541
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000

1545
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000

00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000

1577
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
but I'm just going to have to take your word

1578
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
for any kind of suicide squad beyond the new 52

1579
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
original new suits and squads there was a

1580
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
suicide squad comic

1581
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
recently we're like it was

1582
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
at the prison all the suicide squad bad guys

1583
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
were there or whatever and there was

1584
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
something

1585
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
released into the through the vents or whatever

1586
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
some gas or something

1587
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
and what are you doing

1588
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
what are you doing

1589
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
keep talking keep talking

1590
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
you're distracting me what the

1591
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I get it I see she's just

1592
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
googling kingshark I see him

1593
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm trying to find something god damn it

1594
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
go on

1595
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
go on

1596
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
oh yeah I guess you was on the flash

1597
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
kingshark I've never watched the flash

1598
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
no one has I don't like

1599
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
all those fucking WB

1600
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I hate them all thank you go on

1601
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
but um

1602
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
suicide squad comic that came out recently

1603
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
there was something in the prison in the atmosphere

1604
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
in the vents that made everyone

1605
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
go insane everyone went crazy

1606
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
right all the inmates

1607
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
lost their minds and started becoming crazy

1608
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
people

1609
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
but

1610
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
because Harley Quinn

1611
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
is already so crazy

1612
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
it made her

1613
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
sane again

1614
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
that's what the storyline is called it's called sane again

1615
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
so now that she's sane again

1616
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Harleen Quinzel can

1617
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
get to the bottom of this

1618
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
and solve this crisis

1619
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
because that's her superpower

1620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
she's insane

1621
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
she's wacky

1622
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
this isn't

1623
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
this is

1624
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
ladies and gentlemen this was the day that

1625
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Jesse left this earth forever

1626
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I must go now

1627
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
my planet needs me

1628
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
oh my god

1629
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I remember you telling me about that

1630
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and I was like what the fuck are you talking about

1631
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
are you serious I've never

1632
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I've never

1633
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I just

1634
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I've never been more disappointed

1635
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
DC is like

1636
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
a child that has disappointed me

1637
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
for the last time I have to disown

1638
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
my I'm like Jackie Chan's father

1639
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
in drunken master when he

1640
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
when he gets drunk and he causes that big

1641
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
fucking racket in the town square

1642
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I have no son

1643
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I disown you and Jackie Chan has to

1644
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
fucking go and drown his sorrows

1645
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
alone and cry

1646
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and then he has to redeem himself by fighting the guy in the

1647
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
foundry with the lava you've ever seen drunken master

1648
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I haven't but that sounds amazing

1649
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
drunken master is a masterpiece

1650
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000

1719
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and it should be

1720
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000

1721
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000

01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm going to berate

1728
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
anyone who's listening to me for this long

1729
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000

1730
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
true in this case

1731
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000

01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
to be a good guy because that's what lobo does now

1767
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
he's paid

1768
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
to do what he's fucking told as long as he's paid to do it

1769
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
so batman has paid him to be a good guy

1770
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
holy shit

1771
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
bonus though it is

1772
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
the old school

1773
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
lobo that we all grew up with

1774
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
oh yeah

1775
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
however

1776
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
what the fuck

1777
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
did you ever read the new 52 lobo

1778
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I did not

1779
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
nor will I ever you don't need to

1780
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
okay so for those of you who

1781
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
haven't read the new 52 lobo

1782
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
or even if you have

1783
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
you know it doesn't matter I'm gonna say it anyway

1784
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
the new 52 lobo

1785
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
when it came out

1786
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
they basically tried to say that the old school lobo

1787
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
that we all knew and loved

1788
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
you know the one from the superman animated series

1789
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
you know a big bully voiced by brad garret

1790
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
that glorious

1791
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
hound of a man

1792
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
he uh

1793
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
he was an imposter

1794
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
he was never the real lobo

1795
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
if you didn't know that

1796
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
the real lobo was

1797
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
basically the model for the front cover

1798
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
of a romance novel

1799
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
he was this handsome

1800
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
muscular like pretty boy

1801
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
something had a final fantasy almost

1802
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and they decided they were gonna make him

1803
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
the new lobo

1804
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
he was gonna kill the old lobo if I remember correctly

1805
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
if I don't remember correctly fuck you I don't care

1806
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
this new lobo

1807
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
has me all sorts of discombobulated

1808
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and the new lobo

1809
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
um

1810
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
he so he could basically

1811
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
do anything that the old lobo could do

1812
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
except he if I remember correctly

1813
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
had like super ridiculous

1814
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
regenerative powers like

1815
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Deadpool level regenerative powers

1816
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
like if you cut off his head he'd probably be

1817
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
fucking fine in like an hour or two or something

1818
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
fucking no

1819
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
and you know

1820
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
there was already a lot about the new 52 lobo

1821
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
that I didn't like

1822
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
but I read all the way through it anyway

1823
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
just so that I could try to you know understand

1824
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
it and DC

1825
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and why people read it

1826
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
and I'm not saying that there were a lot of people that read it

1827
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I did not have very many

1828
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
sub customers that had it on their sub

1829
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'd say maybe like three or four tops

1830
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and there might have been more at one point

1831
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
but you know they all dropped it

1832
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
and a whole lot of people tried to subscribe to it to begin with

1833
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
they just kind of like picked it up one day and were like

1834
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
yeah I guess they'll take a look at it

1835
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
maybe it'll be good

1836
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
and it just stayed on their sub for whatever reason

1837
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
there's like you know fuck it I guess I'll just finish it

1838
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
um but

1839
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
there's this entire scene

1840
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
where lobo, new 52 lobo

1841
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
is pitted against the red lantern core

1842
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
and he

1843
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
fucking kills all of them he kills them

1844
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
he kills the red lantern core

1845
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
he tears apart

1846
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
atrocidus, he tears apart the cat

1847
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm going to fart again

1848
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
look out

1849
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
nooooooooooooo well

1850
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
nooo

1851
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
oo I'm shitting my pants

1852
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
ouch

1853
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
oh

1854
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
that's how I felt

1855
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I shit myself

1856
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
We're gonna keep going anyway, so

1857
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:48,280
That's that's basically how I felt, you know in all fairness though. They did renege on that later. They they basically

1858
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,040
Now who's saying the n-word?

1859
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,440
Tell me more about how they reneged. I I have an excuse

1860
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,200
I've been drinking is um when everyone's injured and your basketball team only has white people

1861
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,400
Do you need to renege before the big game?

1862
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,240
Suck my balls

1863
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,920
suck em

1864
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,720
In all fairness they they did to go back and they basically said that oh just kidding the red lantern course still lives

1865
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,200
Do you think that after four years of Trump in the White House America's gonna want to renege? Of course they are

1866
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,160
You know did you know that Obama actually said that if he ran for president again?

1867
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,440
He'd win again. It's like against Trump or whatever. I don't fuck. He doesn't matter

1868
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,120
You're not allowed to run. You're not allowed to have a third term. No, you're not. It's an American thing

1869
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,640
Does it matter I don't know anything about politics welcome to the politics cast and now we're talking about you know

1870
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,520
What else pisses me off about Harley Quinn the whole the whole bleaching her skin thing

1871
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:50,000
How the Joker now her new origin is that he bleached her skin to look more like yeah, hold the fucking phone

1872
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,600
When did that happen? It was not a new 50 that was a new 52 thing. Yeah, I remember now

1873
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,360
I did not like that. Okay. She used to be such a cutie pie

1874
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,960
She'd take off her outfit and her makeup and she'd be normal

1875
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:09,080
So before before new 52 Gotham City sirens actually ended right as the new 52 started it and in Gotham City sirens

1876
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,220
She did not have bleached skin. She was a she was an adorable little

1877
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,360
Harling Quinzel and I loved her. I loved Gotham City sirens. I love Gillum

1878
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,720
What's his face is artwork even though he didn't finish the series he started it and it was wonderful

1879
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,800
And then he started the Catwoman series from new 52, and I liked that series while it lasted but anyway

1880
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,320
Um

1881
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:35,240
Yeah, why did they bleach her skin? You know what's the point? You know what's cool about Harley Quinn?

1882
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:41,060
I'm gonna drink some more is that she's not she wasn't just the Joker's girlfriend. She was his number one

1883
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,640
Lacky she was his bottom bitch

1884
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:49,720
She was based she was like his Robin and she could do things that the Joker couldn't like for example

1885
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:56,600
Walk into a place like a normal person and like be in disguise because she doesn't look like the fucking Joker

1886
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,960
She looks like a regular person. That's that's that's like what that's like her superpower

1887
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,760
That's her asset to the Joker as a lackey

1888
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:09,680
It's not just her glorious tiny little pussy that he loves getting inside with his nasty green tongue

1889
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,680
It's the fact that she can that she can take the makeup off and sneak into places for him and like mingle and shit

1890
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,080
So isn't the Joker supposed to be like an evil genius isn't he supposed to be smart?

1891
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,400
How fucking stupid is it for him to like make her look like him? That's taking away that asset

1892
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,240
I think okay, so I have a theory already on that

1893
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,280
I think they did it to try and emphasize the whole abusive situation

1894
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,680
I think they tried to make it to where he was marking her. Yeah, no, that's how I feel to you

1895
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,680
I don't yeah fucking jerk it off. Whatever jerk it off

1896
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:49,200
But that makes sense, right? I like they want to emphasize the abusive part of the of the relationship

1897
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,360
I think it all just came from wanting everyone to have edgy new hot topic. He redesigned in the new 52

1898
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,760
Yeah, I wanted her with the black and red pig tails and the white skin. That's probably an even better

1899
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,240
I think it was purely idiotic marketing that did that. I remember that scene

1900
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,440
I remember it was kind of rapey to like he dips her in there and like when he takes her out

1901
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,320
He's like holding her like firmly by the chin and she's like sucking in her bottom like like nervously

1902
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:23,560
He's doing his little like Joker grin. I remember. Oh dear god. I tried to forget and you reminded me and now I'm gonna drink some more

1903
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,680
Yeah, yeah

1904
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,040
Fuck

1905
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,920
I

1906
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:40,720
I'm just gonna say I hate new Harley Quinn. I hate I hate it. I've I can't bring myself to

1907
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,640
I'm not again. I'm not gonna

1908
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,580
No, I am I'm gonna kink shame people

1909
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:54,400
Clarify trying to be a good person, but Harley Quinn in this current era does not make me a good person

1910
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,760
Helps me in any kind of way. I don't like it. I don't think she has depth. I don't like the way she looks

1911
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,760
I don't like anything about the new Harley Quinn. It just needs to stop

1912
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,400
And I and I hate how much how much they push the whole lesbian thing now with her and poison Ivy

1913
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,480
Like they really ram it down your throats in these comics, you know Tumblr loves it

1914
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,040
You know

1915
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:22,320
Like Paul Dini always hinted at it. It used to be like a oh, yeah, you make me so thorny. Yeah

1916
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:28,960
Yeah, like it was always like okay. Yeah, we get it there. They're probably munching some carpet behind closed doors

1917
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,800
That's that's cool. That's cute. We get it, but now it's just like okay

1918
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,720
We fucking get it like every other comic is then like hey

1919
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,120
I think you want a fucking finger me in the puss

1920
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,760
You want a finger my puss?

1921
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:50,600
Yeah, I want to finger your puss. How about you finger my puss, baby? That's my poison ivy. That's a pretty good poison ivy

1922
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:56,240
I'll come here to kill all men and finger some puss. That's the Megan Fox poison

1923
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,740
Megan Fox poison ivy. I can't wait

1924
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,740
I

1925
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:07,380
Can't wait with her. I guess you'll have a green thumb

1926
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:15,100
Cuz Megan Fox is known for her gross thumbs. I've never seen her thumbs. Is it like is it like Danny's that's like a meme

1927
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,100
Megan Fox has toe thumbs. Oh

1928
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,700
Like short thumbs like their toes

1929
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,900
So not is it on the same level as like Danny sex being thumbs

1930
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:32,380
What's wrong with any sex banks thumbs, oh they always make fun of Danny sex veins thumbs Megan Fox thumbs. Oh

1931
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,100
Yeah, I guess she does have kind of stubby thumbs. Yeah, that's really gross

1932
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:40,780
Oh

1933
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,780
My god, it's worse than I thought

1934
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,260
God look up Danny sex banks. Oh

1935
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:50,320
It's like if her thumb was a person it would have no knees

1936
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,520
Oh

1937
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,520
Still like cotton from King of the Hill

1938
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,040
Did her thumbs kill Fiddy man? Yeah, she's got cotton thumbs. Oh my god

1939
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,680
Stop doing oh good for you and how was it? Oh

1940
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,020
No, they can Fox discusses her wonky thumbs

1941
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:19,020
I

1942
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,420
Don't want to look at her ever again

1943
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:26,580
Well, you're gonna because she's they're talking about making her the new poison ivy

1944
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,340
Mmm, don't do it. I like it. I don't don't do it

1945
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:37,740
You know who was a good they made her April O'Neill too. That was a mistake

1946
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:43,300
What that whole movie was a what is it with what is it with like perfect beautiful redheads being ruined by Megan Fox?

1947
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:49,080
You know, one of my favorite things that I remember you saying about the TMNT movie when it first came out was you know, like

1948
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,140
splinter

1949
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,540
Learns karate. Oh, yeah through a book

1950
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,580
Yeah, and I'm like yeah, and you're like well

1951
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,580
It's good to know that there is no God. Yeah

1952
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:07,060
That's the that's the the the turtles the 2012 one

1953
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:12,300
Splinter finds a karate book in the garbage and that's where he learns to be a ninja

1954
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,300
You know what you know what's been oh?

1955
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:21,580
Jesse what what did you read any of the Batman TMNT comic books? Of course?

1956
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:28,340
I did I have it have you wrote the new one the one that's based on the new cartoon. It's actually it's the Batman animated

1957
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:35,380
And the TMNT like the current generation I guess on Nickelodeon. I did not it's actually good

1958
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:40,860
It's actually fucking good. Okay. I don't like the new TMNT like cartoon for the most part

1959
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,980
Like I'll watch it and kind of humor myself with it every now and then but I can't like watch it consistently

1960
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:51,260
But thankfully with comic books you don't have to listen to voices. You only have the voices that are in your own head

1961
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,380
But the the new Batman TMNT adventures are actually really good

1962
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,220
So if you haven't read it yet, I do recommend it

1963
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,540
I do feel like a lot of people are like oh well

1964
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,100
It's not going to be as dark and gritty because you know

1965
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,160
It's Batman going into their universe as opposed to the TMNT going into his universe

1966
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:15,300
But it's good like I want to say trust me, but you know to each their own. I enjoyed it

1967
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:23,940
I

1968
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:27,740
Can't think of anything else to talk about. Yeah, that's comics for you. They're all shit. They're all bad

1969
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:32,940
I don't like them. That's not true. Did we like some of them? I don't even remember which ones we liked

1970
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:36,260
We oh, yeah, I read all the new Doctor Strange recently

1971
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,480
You did tell me all about it caught up on that. Oh, I haven't read this one yet

1972
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:44,040
So I haven't read the newest one. Okay, so you read up to 14. Tell me all about it. It's really good. I like it

1973
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:49,160
It's um, I like the artwork a lot. So did you ever read Jason Aaron's?

1974
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,560
Original Thor run his God Bomb arc

1975
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,560
No, I was never really a big fan of Thor. I love Thor. He's a good boy. He didn't do nothing wrong

1976
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,640
You know, you're probably right

1977
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,800
I've just I've never taken the time out to actually like actively read anything by Thor again

1978
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,160
Same with the movies like I enjoyed the movies, but they're not my favorite. I don't know

1979
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,700
Thor was a good boy. He didn't deserve to get replaced by a woman. It was wrong

1980
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,580
Whoa

1981
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,720
Oh

1982
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,660
Massagerist over here. Shut up. What's wrong with a woman for?

1983
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:29,300
You guys can't see it, but I'm trying to do the trout mouth that the trout mouth that a that

1984
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:34,360
Tumblr social justice warriors do what's wrong with Thor being a woman

1985
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:44,960
So um, so this is Dr. Strange Jason Aaron wrote this he also wrote Thor for a long he's been writing Thor for like seven years

1986
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,520
Stop it

1987
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,160
So are you are you saying that all social justice warriors are ugly

1988
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,780
I'm sorry go on saying that all people are ugly until proven innocent

1989
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:06,420
Jason Aaron wrote a Thor comic and his Dr. Strange comic is basically the same comic

1990
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:10,980
It's the same his first arc in Dr. Strange is like the same as his first arc in Thor

1991
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:18,260
We're like in Thor it was this guy there was this guy called gore who hated gods and he wanted to kill all the gods and

1992
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,020
In Dr. Strange

1993
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:24,800
There's this guy who hates magic and he wants to kill all the magics. I can relate to both of them

1994
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,240
But it's really cool

1995
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,120
He like you can tell that he's really you know

1996
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:36,480
It's it's for because of the movie and they're trying to make Dr. Strange like a lot more relatable and down to earth and stuff

1997
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:42,360
So Dr. Strange in this is like a regular guy who has to deal with a lot of magical bullshit. He has to eat gross food

1998
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:48,920
He hates it. He's always sick. He uh, he has to see his fight monsters. He goes into like this a special bar

1999
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
That only magic people can go into

2000
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,020
Like Dr. Voodoo was in there

2001
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:59,420
Eliana Rasputin is in there and like Scarlet Witch and they all hang out and do magic stuff together. They have drinks

2002
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:04,740
Yeah, yeah, and they and so these guys are killing all the magic. They take all the magic out of the world

2003
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,380
And Dr. Strange has to fight back

2004
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,980
And it's cool and they really they try to like I don't know if I'm too far from the mic

2005
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:17,780
I feel like I'm scooting away from it. They they they introduced this concept or of like all magic

2006
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,880
coming from somewhere like it um like

2007
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,560
You know every time that Dr. Strange uses magic unbeknownst to him. There's always a price somewhere

2008
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
so like

2009
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:37,440
There's a bunch of people and a and a so like Wong has a bunch of dudes in a secret temple somewhere that Dr.

2010
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,120
Strange doesn't know about like taking all the pain from all of his magic that he uses what the fuck

2011
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,040
Yeah, and it's very it's interesting and it's cool and he fights the guy

2012
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,260
But then at the end of it um

2013
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:53,340
At the end of that story arc. It's like it's taking all the magic out of the world

2014
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,700
Or like it's taking a significant amount of the magic out of the world

2015
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,860
I was gonna say that might explain the new Dr. Strange versus the punters

2016
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:05,180
Well, it's not like just a punter sure which it it seems like you know

2017
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:07,180
That's like a big shift in the status quo

2018
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:14,380
But it's such it's so vague that it's not really a shift at all like oh you've taken out most of the magic in the world

2019
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:20,000
Well, what does that mean? He's still using magic. Yeah, like every like now in the in now

2020
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,080
It's like oh ever since the magic was taken out of the world doing this is a lot harder

2021
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:31,040
And then he does magic and he doesn't so it's kind of a pointless not really much of a shift in that

2022
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:36,360
It's not much of a shit status quo shift in all fairness that may have tried and attempt was made

2023
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:41,360
I was gonna say you know fairness it might affect other characters in the long run. I'm sure we'll see it

2024
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,360
We'll see some of it later

2025
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,080
But go on. I'm sorry

2026
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,080
Well, that's basically it. I mean

2027
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,440
Then the second story I picked up and right now he's in a car

2028
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,960
It's driven by the orb the guy at the eyeball for a face and I haven't read this issue yet

2029
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,840
But I'll get to it. I really like the new Dr. Strange. Yeah, I like it. It's been good

2030
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,840
You know, I think Dr. Strange is kind of an interesting character in the sense that

2031
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,880
You know, even though he's in the Marvel Universe and there's even a movie out for him now

2032
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,240
Which you and I both saw and talked about a little bit on the last podcast, but

2033
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,220
You know

2034
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:22,260
You know, he's not exactly the easiest character to just kind of slip into any Marvel comic book

2035
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,820
It's like constant teen, you know, yeah

2036
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:31,620
like you can't just throw him in with anybody and I say that of course after they immediately throw him together with a

2037
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,620
Punisher but

2038
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:42,060
There's just so much to Dr. Strange and his abilities that it almost feels pointless to try and get him to team up with anybody else

2039
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,160
because

2040
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:49,000
You remember Civil War, you're a member like the first Civil War run where punish your killed like five guys

2041
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:55,760
But but you know spider-in's like hey, Dr. Strange. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to

2042
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,680
Help I need you to get everybody to forget that I ever revealed my identity to anybody. Yeah

2043
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:07,840
And you know, Dr. Strange like I'll carry you got one and the spider island happens and spider. Oh, no, Dr. Strange said

2044
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:14,960
No, that's impossible. Even I can't do that, but it happens. Anyway, maybe if you if you if you strike up a deal with Satan

2045
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,980
Yeah, maybe that maybe that can do it

2046
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:22,860
Yeah, I don't god I do remember

2047
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:29,360
He did something I could have swore like up and down that he fucking did something in Civil War along that vein

2048
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:35,900
Because I remember in the amazing spider-man's run of spider island where spider is like hey

2049
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:43,560
Dr. Strange, can you do me? Can you do me another favor and Dr. Strange like no, and he just like fucks off forever

2050
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,320
You know whatever maybe I'm getting things mixed up

2051
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,040
but anyway, I

2052
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:57,360
Really like the new Dr. Strange run. I like the artwork. I like the character. I like the way that he's written

2053
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,360
I like the dialogue. I like

2054
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,920
There's a lot about the new like Dr. Strange

2055
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,500
There's very few like Marvel comics and I actively like sit and go. Yeah, this is fucking good

2056
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,300
Dr. Strange is one of those titles

2057
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:14,140
But this is also coming from the same person who says that full killer full killer is fucking fantastic

2058
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,400
Which I stand by that. Holy shit. It's a fucking fantastic comic book

2059
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,060
Totally underrated for anybody who hasn't been reading it. It's great

2060
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:27,940
I know Jess hasn't been reading it, but you know, I don't did you even read Merck's like the Merck's for no

2061
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:33,280
Merck's for money, I guess it's called. Nah, I'm looking at this DC holiday special right now

2062
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:39,560
Oh with Harley Quinn more Harley Quinn all the Harley Quinn hey the suicide squad Harley Quinn

2063
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,200
Hey, she looks pretty sexy right there with your legs spread open open in that present the present

2064
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:49,800
That's in front of her box the box that's in front of her box. I'm uh, yeah, I like that I

2065
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,880
Like Batman sipping on the tiny cup of tea

2066
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,880
That's my fetish

2067
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,920
But anyway, I

2068
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,080
Don't if you're not reading Dr. Strange, I recommend it

2069
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,680
You know, there's so very few Marvel titles. Like I said that I actually actively read

2070
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,680
Dr. Strange is actually one of those titles that I currently read and

2071
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,680
Fool killers another one that actively read before that was vision

2072
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,040
Which you know, Jesse and I both talked about vision already

2073
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,240
But I'm just gonna fucking say it again. If you didn't pick up vision yet do it

2074
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:30,180
There's only two volumes and they're both fucking glorious

2075
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:39,500
That's right and that's is that it is that that's the panel cast everybody

2076
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:45,060
Comics suck and we hate them the end
