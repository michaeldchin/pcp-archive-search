00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,180
Hello everybody and welcome to another exciting, fantastic, jam-packed, dream-free episode of The

2
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:41,500
Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today we have with us my very best friend and newcomer to Instagram

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,660
LeelaloraMate. We got Hippocrit with us today.

4
00:00:50,660 --> 00:01:00,020
Fine bone China. Sick. Sure, Nate is here.

5
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,100
Instagram.com slash bestguyever. Make me an ethernet juggernaut.

6
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,580
It's bestest guy ever. Shit, it is bestest guy ever. Thank you, Tom.

7
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,660
Don't give that imposter who somehow got there first, the follow. Fuck that guy.

8
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,420
And we got Ben Saint. Hey everyone, it's me, professional gerrymanderist

9
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:29,380
Ben Saint here. You see those lines in the sand, those corrupt politicians drawn. I'm

10
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,020
here to change the whole system. We're reworking all this fucking shit.

11
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,660
I'm going to fulfill a number of useful functions, none of which I will specify.

12
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,180
Fantastic. Let's talk about Instagram, everybody.

13
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,660
Let's get into Instagram. I've been on Instagram for a while. I've actually kind of fallen out

14
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,620
of favor with it as well to a certain degree. But yeah, Instagram, Instagram's an interesting

15
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,460
beast. And I guess they're like changing up the entire algorithm that they've been using

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,940
for like this month, I guess. But it sounds like it's a good thing though, because like

17
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,860
the big thing that sucks about Instagram right now is that like, I like the platform a lot

18
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,020
and how it works, but the culture around Instagram is very normie and very fake.

19
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,660
Like it's very thoughty. Too many women. We've got to get rid of some of these women.

20
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,580
Yeah. All right. We're doing a good job. We're going to convince Mage to get off the platform.

21
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,420
So step one down. Let's instigate the Instagram execution

22
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,020
squads. I volunteer to lead this organization and I will serve you at your whim, fair viewers.

23
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,980
All right. That's me. Yeah. But the thing that really sucks about Instagram is just

24
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,660
that like it's it there's tons of the strategy on Instagram to like get big is like make

25
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,020
a repost account. Don't make any original content and then like pay for services to

26
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,860
like automatically to like inflate your account. Like that's a whole thing. There's like things

27
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,540
called power likes where like you get like big, big followers, like big accounts to like

28
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,780
your posts that helps you in the algorithm. And there's that or literally just be any

29
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,420
kind of reasonably attractive woman. And I'm pretty sure that's the only other way.

30
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,180
Women just automatically succeed on the internet. All right. We're not talking about women. We're

31
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,100
talking about like the superior gender that actually has to put effort into things.

32
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,020
Look, just think about this, everybody. Think about this. Endless Jess. Not to I don't think

33
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,500
this is too much information, but like he talked about once his younger sister or something

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,140
just had an Instagram. Think about all the stuff that Jesse has done and all that he's

35
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,540
created. And like his little sister on the basis of being a reasonably attractive girl

36
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,100
had like 10 times his following. I mean, yeah, sanity.

37
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,900
Of course, that's just how it works. It's just like attractive women appeal to literally

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,300
everyone. And that's not the case.

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,220
That patriarchal guy is keeping women down. God, they just can't get anywhere in this

40
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,220
society.

41
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,540
By the way, it's fine. And I accepted that and I will overcome these cruel women to

42
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,820
tell me to get one over on beat them all. Yeah. Okay. But mage, mage, you have the floor.

43
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,660
Tell us your grievances with this platform. Okay, I created Instagram literally just like

44
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,660
a few minutes ago. Wow.

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,660
It was my Instagram.

46
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,660
Oh my God.

47
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
You guys.

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,220
I'm sorry, mage, mage is like, like on a flight tomorrow or something or leaving and she has

49
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,340
no patience for her shenanigans today.

50
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:23,660
Patience today. We have work to do by that. I mean, we need to communicate like friends

51
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
that we are. Come on.

52
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
It's just such a burden.

53
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Why do you hate Instagram?

54
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,700
Yeah, yeah. So I created my account just literally a few moments ago just because I needed to

55
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,300
upload a few images for I went to show people like a few images I took yesterday for a trip

56
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,420
I took that that might be a different topic for a little bit later and he was so late.

57
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,420
At first I couldn't figure out how to bulk upload from my phone and then I realized I

58
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,420
have to use the app. I couldn't just do it from the browser. And the reason I couldn't

59
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,420
I wasn't doing it from my computer is a I don't have the photos on my computer and I

60
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
don't have the time to upload it them on computer.

61
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,420
You can't upload anything from the computer anyways. It all has to be from the app.

62
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh, that is.

63
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Okay, one more reason why it sucks. I hate it.

64
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:22,540
So, yeah, so I figured out how to bulk upload and it's so tedious. You can only choose up

65
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,540
to 10 images per bulk and that's like shitty because I had like one, two, three, four, five,

66
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:36,040
six, like 70 or so images. And so that took a bit of time and it's like it's not enough

67
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,520
that I'm limited to 10 images. It's just like after that, after I choose the images, I have

68
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,040
to click next like three or four times and that's really obnoxious. I don't want to share

69
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,040
with anyone. I just want them to be there and I'll link people what I wanted.

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,040
It sounds like your problems with Instagram is that you're using Instagram like it's

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
flicker and it's not flicker.

72
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,040
I haven't used flicker. What's a flicker?

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,040
It's another site for sharing photographs, but it's more of just like an upload like

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,040
a repository just dump all your photos in. Yeah, it's like Imgur. It's like something

75
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
called Flickr.

76
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Oh, okay. I'll look into that.

77
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Instagram is more like a look at my tits, give me money.

78
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Okay, well if I can show them that.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
One more thing.

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,040
It's like an Apple product and it's really fancy and classy looking.

81
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:31,040
If it's an Apple product, why can't I install it from my Android? Android, you're doing it wrong.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
It should be uninstallable. It's not like.

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,040
It's like you can deactivate it, but not uninstall it.

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Whoa. I've never heard of Instagram being bloatware built into the OS on Android.

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
That's pretty cool.

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,040
It's for Samsung Galaxy S6 or something like that.

87
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
What?

88
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Yeah.

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm suspicious of this clay image. I'm suspicious. Are you sure that you aren't just making a

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
mistake?

91
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,040
No, I went to download it on, like I told you, I'm going to download it and then I look,

92
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,040
it's already downloaded. I just had to activate it and was like, whoa, shit.

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Because a while ago I was on like deactivating and like deleting whatever apps I wasn't using.

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
And I guess I couldn't delete it, so I just deactivated it.

95
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
So, whoa.

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
That's weird.

97
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Okay. One last thing. One last thing.

98
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I super enraged that they didn't notice up until right now when I started looking through

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
the photos, they cropped the photos.

100
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
They cropped them to make them square.

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I hate that.

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh my God.

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
They ruined a lot of the photos.

104
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
At least not ruined the display.

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
That's that.

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,040
If it's ergonomic, that's just good visual design.

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
That's just good spatial reasoning.

108
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Instagram to post their damn fucking, you know, their personal preference on a photo that you

109
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
tailor to be a different shape or size.

110
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Come on.

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
It's a private company.

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
They can do whatever they want.

113
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Of course.

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I had actually heard that they like weren't doing that anymore, but I guess that's not

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
the case.

116
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:03,040
No, you can zoom out and have a, you know, a cuboid, a rectangular, that's the word,

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
picture.

118
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Oh, so does it like just zoom in to make it into a square?

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,040
It zooms in to make it into a square and you can move it around to see which putt is

120
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
the square.

121
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Well, you're uploading, but like I can customize 70 fucking photos into the span of five minutes,

122
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
you know?

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Fair enough.

124
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Fair enough.

125
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You're using the wrong site.

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:33,040
I was told by a certain person to, it was named draft, but yeah, I guess I'll upload it

127
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
after the career if I have the time later on.

128
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
But yeah.

129
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Okay.

130
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:46,040
As Instagram is a normie cesspool, I have had like kind of, I've had fun like being a

131
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,360
normie in that part of the internet and not having any trouble because there's not really

132
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
comments.

133
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,600
People don't really comment on anything and I can show it to a family and it's, you know,

134
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:02,360
I take pictures of my dog and pictures of my cat and pictures of fine bone China.

135
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,360
It's really quite nice.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,560
Follow instagram.com slash hypocrite for all your fine bone China needs.

137
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,360
I actually have an image of a fine bone China teacup that I drank tea out of at a wedding.

138
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,360
So people are just wild for that fine bone.

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm scrolling down to find it.

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Where?

141
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,240
Are you allowed to display images of fine bone China in China?

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,160
Not because of the China thing, but because you're not allowed, you know how you're not

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,360
allowed to show skeletons, like showing skeletons as considered in a pro, yeah, in China, like

144
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,360
they had to, like they changed the, they changed the models in World of Warcraft of the, of the

145
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,360
undead because like every skeleton boss had to be turned into like a weird zombie guy.

146
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Yeah.

147
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Because it's like, why?

148
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Because I don't know something about something about skeletons is like considered.

149
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I would not want to go to the doctor in China if they've never seen a skeleton.

150
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
They don't understand.

151
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Well, I mean, you go to the doctor and you show him your dick.

152
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,360
That's not appropriate in polite society either.

153
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,360
That's a fine bone China for you.

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
There we go.

155
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Finally, someone did it.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
It's like, wait a minute, wait a minute guys.

157
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,360
If it's, if it's, if, if vaginas are so inappropriate, how does anyone give birth in a hospital?

158
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
No one can look at a vagina.

159
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
You know, I was watching the Handmaid's Tale recently and they just do a thing where like,

160
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,360
they set up like a barrier where like the, the handmaids are like behind this wall and like,

161
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,360
like the doctor can see the vagina but not the woman who it's attached to.

162
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
So like they separate it out and it's not, it's like morally pure.

163
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
That's the, that's the, that's the both worlds.

164
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
If you know what I'm saying, that's the, that's the idea.

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Talk about getting the milk for free.

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Yeah.

167
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Am I right, man?

168
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Am I right?

169
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Internet high five.

170
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah.

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
There it is.

172
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
There it is.

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Yes.

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Um, well enough about Instagram.

175
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Uh, let's talk about a problem I'm having right now.

176
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Okay.

177
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
All right.

178
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
What?

179
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
No, no, you go.

180
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
No, you go.

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,360
It's not, it's not like I just completed a, it's not like I just completed a, a massive

182
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
gauntlet and a milestone achievement.

183
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Let's talk about that actually.

184
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
No, that's good.

185
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Yeah.

186
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Yeah.

187
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,360
So I went, I went the entire, uh, so last episode I mentioned that I had started fasting.

188
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
I went an entire week without eating.

189
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Holy shit.

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah.

191
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
I went starting last PCP episode recording day.

192
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
It was, it was the day before that.

193
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Okay.

194
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,360
So yesterday I started eating again and, uh, it didn't even feel like anything.

195
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Like Ben, let's just hang on.

196
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Ben just went for seven days without consuming food.

197
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, okay.

198
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Okay.

199
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Okay.

200
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
That's what happened.

201
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Disclaimer.

202
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Disclaimer.

203
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
I want to do this.

204
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Okay.

205
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Disclaimer.

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
I may, you may say I cheated because I did put lemon in my tea and water.

207
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
No.

208
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
So I may have consumed.

209
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,360
So I may have consumed up to maybe, maybe, maybe 30 calories or something.

210
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Or maybe 50 calories tops over the entire week.

211
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,360
If your water has, if your water has any atoms of like anything that isn't water, any particulates

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
you failed.

213
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Yeah.

214
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Yeah.

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,480
Do not drink anything homeopathic because it has like, it has the spirit echoes of food

216
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,360
in it, of things that have calories in it and it actually magnifies the caloric content.

217
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Having less of those things in them.

218
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,040
Ben, please tell us the impetus for this and your experience of doing so because it's

219
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,360
quite interesting.

220
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Okay.

221
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Also, how do you feel right now?

222
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I mean, well, you're eating again now.

223
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
What have you eaten since then?

224
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Since, since ending your fast?

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I mean, I ate a bunch today.

226
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
No, not today.

227
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
I haven't eaten today.

228
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,360
But yesterday, I just ate, you know, I'm staying keto.

229
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,360
So yesterday I ate pork rinds.

230
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I drank heavy cream.

231
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I ate some leftover pork that was in the fridge.

232
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,360
I ate a bunch of natural peanut butter and celery, you know, just a bunch of keto shit.

233
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Like a normal date.

234
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
People warned me that I should ease back into it.

235
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I totally disregarded that advice and threw caution to the wind and it made no difference

236
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
and was fine.

237
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Okay.

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
So Ben, what you're telling me is that all our viewers should, without consulting their

239
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,360
doctor and with wild abandon, stop consuming food, just add infinites.

240
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
That's right.

241
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
That would be best for that.

242
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
That's right, best guy ever.

243
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
I mean, I'm Ben St.

244
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Professional Jerry Manderer and professional, non-professional medical advice giver.

245
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
And I'm here to tell you that you definitely shouldn't eat anymore.

246
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Look, we talked about being post food.

247
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I've lived it.

248
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I've been to the other side and I've returned and I can tell you, it's really weird.

249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Around day three, like, okay.

250
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
It's hard to imagine doing it.

251
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Okay, okay, okay.

252
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Like day one and two, you know, I was a little hungry.

253
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,360
I was kind of, I was, on day two, I was hungry.

254
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Day three, I was kind of hungry.

255
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
And then day four and after, I like, wasn't hungry at all.

256
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I got a little weak, right?

257
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,060
Like I had, I had, there were sometimes where I felt a little fatigued and sometimes I might

258
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,360
get a little bit dizzy, not like to the point that I was going to faint or anything, but

259
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,360
I would kind of be like, you know, but it would, it would, it would pass.

260
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
It would pass.

261
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
And most doesn't sound great.

262
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
That doesn't sound like a great thing to have happen.

263
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
No, it wasn't.

264
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
It wasn't great.

265
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,360
But 90, 95% of the time, I just felt normal and not hungry and fine.

266
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,360
All right, Ben, do you think that part of the reason you felt okay was because you sit

267
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
at the computer drawing and or not drawing?

268
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Yeah, I was going to ask.

269
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
And not like moving around that much?

270
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Yes.

271
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I do think that that helped.

272
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I think if I had been like walking around, moving around, you know, lifting crates or

273
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,360
you know, tilling the soil, probably it would not have been as easy.

274
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,360
I feel like this is a thing that people in like history have done.

275
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Like because they need to, you know, people survive because there's no food.

276
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Yeah.

277
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Their body adapts to the lack of food, but they can't go forever without food.

278
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,360
They need it eventually, but they can have like a, like a, a small thing of rice can

279
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
keep them going for a week or a month.

280
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
For a year.

281
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Like the last day, like, I mean, I walked, you know, I walked like, you know, down the

282
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,360
street to the corner store and back and stuff.

283
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,360
And like I didn't, it wasn't that, you know, it was fine.

284
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Yeah, I probably, if I'd been doing like manual labor or something, it probably would have

285
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
been more difficult.

286
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,360
But the reason I did it, you asked before, I mean, because I'm doing the keto thing,

287
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,360
people in the keto, in keto circles talk about fasting a bunch, usually in the context of

288
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
intermittent fasting.

289
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
But sometimes, you know, I listened to this, I listened to this podcast, well, actually

290
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
I haven't listened to it in a while because it got really old and samey.

291
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
And I was like, all right, guys, I get it.

292
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
There's this podcast called two keto dudes for a while.

293
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
I was listening to it and they're like really fat guys.

294
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
You know, they're like, you know, they were morbidly obese dudes, maybe still, I don't

295
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
know.

296
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
And you know, they, they talked about doing like extended fasts like for several days

297
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
and stuff.

298
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
And I just thought it was interesting.

299
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
I was like, well, all right, I want to try it.

300
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,360
And then, yeah, so I started doing it and then, but after a certain point, I was like,

301
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I was like, okay, I know this is not a sustainable thing, although maybe it is.

302
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
But I was like, I just wanted to see if I could go for a week just to say I did it and I did

303
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
and now I'm a hero.

304
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,360
And yeah, there was a guy who did it for an entire year.

305
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,360
He was a more, there was a morbidly obese guy who, yeah, he fasted for 382 days.

306
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,360
He lost like 300 pounds.

307
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
The weight, he's, the weight stayed off.

308
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,360
See, I feel like obviously he was drinking water and he was taking like multivitamin supplements

309
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,360
and like salt supplements and potassium and stuff, but he was taking minerals and stuff

310
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
so he wouldn't die.

311
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
But he did not consume calories for over a year.

312
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
A bad act.

313
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,360
And his body, his body just consumed the energy and the fat.

314
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,360
He was carrying around a year's worth of food.

315
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Yeah.

316
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Yeah.

317
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
That's exactly the reason he was able to do it.

318
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Yeah.

319
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
I don't think so.

320
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
No, no, no.

321
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Of course not.

322
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
But like that's like fucking nuts.

323
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Man, I feel like this man became like a plant, you know?

324
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,360
He became like a full synthesizing individual.

325
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,360
How many weeks of fat am I carrying around right now?

326
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
I want to do the calculations.

327
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I bet I'm carrying around, I bet I'm carrying around at least a month, at least a month or

328
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
two.

329
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
God.

330
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
How disgusting.

331
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I mean, I, all right.

332
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Maybe, yeah, probably more than that actually.

333
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,360
People get too hung up about having any fat on their body.

334
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,360
People forget the point of fat is that exact reason.

335
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
To make you uglier.

336
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
To have...

337
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Yeah, talk about Tom's right.

338
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
To have fuel on your person.

339
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Right.

340
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
You don't need that much in day-to-day life.

341
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
The point of fat is God's punishment for decadence.

342
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
No.

343
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
For our decadent body.

344
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I agree completely.

345
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
I hate it.

346
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Which is why it's celebrated in some circles because they're celebrating decadence, which

347
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
makes sense.

348
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,360
It's not about being a big bloated boy, it's about having something on your person so

349
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
that you don't have to carry a satchel full of granola bars.

350
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Give, give.

351
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I'm hearing a lot of fat envy going on right now from skinny lads such as yourself.

352
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I don't want to be fat.

353
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
The position of privilege you speak from.

354
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
I've never been fat.

355
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I couldn't ever even become fat, it's impossible.

356
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Exactly.

357
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Fuck you.

358
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Ha ha.

359
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I'll bet we could make it happen.

360
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Begin training montage.

361
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Like a rocky style training montage of Ben coaching Hippo to get fat.

362
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,360
It's like Hippo's doing pull-ups and the camera pans over to me shaking my head like

363
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
mmm, mmm, mmm.

364
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
And then he's like sorry.

365
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
No, no.

366
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,360
We see Gib consuming massive amounts of food in this montage and everything looks good,

367
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,860
but then at the end the music turns to a sour note and then Ben looks down at heart.

368
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,860
It's like oh no, that's not milk you've been drinking, it's heavy cream and everyone's

369
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
got keto labels all over it.

370
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
He's been losing calories.

371
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,860
Like, like there's no tomorrow, he's become the most fit man.

372
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
This is the opposite of what we wanted.

373
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,860
No, no, no, you should drink, you should drink the heavy cream.

374
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,860
You should drink, you should eat, okay what's that stuff that the fucking sumo wrestler's

375
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
eat?

376
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
I've always wanted to try it.

377
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I love the food.

378
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Chicken nuggets.

379
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
There's some.

380
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
Yeah, that's right.

381
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,860
Have you guys had buttermilk before?

382
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
No.

383
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,860
You're not supposed to just drink it though, right?

384
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,860
The thing is, in Lithuania there's a type of buttermilk that is quite drinkable what

385
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
not.

386
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,860
It's a common drink, but it's different from the buttermilk I found in England though.

387
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Is it called kefir?

388
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Yes.

389
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
Okay, okay, okay.

390
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:03,860
When I was in Poland, like when I first got to Poland or close to it, I went to the supermarket.

391
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,860
It was called Biedronka, which means ladybug.

392
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,860
So I went down to my local Biedronka and I was walking around and I couldn't read any

393
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
labels on anything.

394
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,860
And I bought what I thought was milk and I drank, I thought it was like peach flavored

395
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,860
milk or strawberry flavored, you know, they have like weird or melon flavor, they have

396
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
weird flavors over there.

397
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,860
And I bought it and I drank it.

398
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,860
It was actually kefir, which was very unpleasant because kefir is like a thick buttermilk like

399
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
yogurt kind of thing.

400
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,860
So I drank this thinking that it was milk and I was like, oh god.

401
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,860
And then continued.

402
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,860
For you, for losing weight I think, or at least like it's a better alternative to milk.

403
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Is it keto?

404
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
Was that Ben's first experience?

405
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Probably keto.

406
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,860
I don't think it's keto because it's like, I mean yogurt's not keto.

407
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
Yeah, I guess so.

408
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
It's got lactose.

409
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Well, Ben, I've relinquished my title to you as long as fasting person in the PCP.

410
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,860
So I've gone three days and you've surpassed me.

411
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
Yeah.

412
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Good job, you did it.

413
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Thank you.

414
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,860
It was total five days or seven days.

415
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,860
In some degree or another, going into the post food lifestyle, which is good to say.

416
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
It was seven whole days.

417
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,860
Seven full 24 hour periods.

418
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Wow, that's loud.

419
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,860
I woke up on Saturday and I didn't even want to eat.

420
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
I wasn't like, oh finally.

421
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Okay, during the week I had been, occasionally I would be like, I missed food emotionally

422
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
much more than I was like.

423
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,860
Exactly.

424
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
It is absolutely a mental battle.

425
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Your body doesn't give a shit.

426
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Yeah, yeah, my body was pretty much fine.

427
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,860
But I would be like, man, I wish I had a sausage right now.

428
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,860
I don't have Italian sausage.

429
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
I was thinking about salt.

430
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
All gay.

431
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
I know.

432
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
It turned me real gay.

433
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,860
That's just like every day just magnified.

434
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,860
But 99% of the time we don't need food.

435
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
Yeah, pretty much.

436
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Our minds that want it.

437
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,860
But I woke up on Saturday and I was like, I don't even want to eat.

438
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:19,860
I bought this bag of pork rinds, or keto, and I looked at them and I was like, I said

439
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,860
I was going to eat them today so I guess I'll eat today.

440
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
And I did.

441
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
And I was like, all right.

442
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
The deed is done.

443
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
I think that was wise.

444
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,860
I didn't want to make this permanent.

446
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,860
Fasting definitely is like an enlightening experience.

447
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,860
You definitely transcend to a higher level of existence.

448
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,860
I feel a little bit differently about food in general now.

449
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
It's become optional.

450
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,860
What is the religion that fasts for a heck of a long time?

451
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Ramadan?

452
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Well, there's Ramadan.

453
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Ramadan, I guess.

454
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
Or is that just one day?

455
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
I'm trying to think.

456
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,860
You can only eat when the sun's down or something in very small amounts.

457
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
Ramadan is intermittent fasting.

459
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Yeah, right.

460
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
You know, actually that interests.

461
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Let me tell a story.

462
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,860
I was like maybe three or four, I was maybe three or four days into the fast and my room

463
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,860
or my housemates invited me out to a party.

464
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,860
So I went out and, you know, it was just a small little gathering.

465
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,860
And, you know, there were snacks and, you know, I was offered snacks and I, you know,

466
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
I declined them and I explained like, you know, I'm fasting.

467
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,860
I'm not going to eat anything.

468
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,860
And I got, you know, for the most part that was fine.

469
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,860
A couple, there was, there were a couple of like very negative reactions that that got.

470
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
And.

471
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
Ah, yep.

472
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Yeah.

473
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Those people, I know them well.

474
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Okay.

475
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Well, there were two people that reacted negatively and they both.

476
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
All right.

477
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm going to give like a complete, here I'm going to break down the complete psychological

478
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
makeup of two complete strangers who I know nothing about.

479
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,860
And I'm just going to assume that I'm completely right and you're all going to think I'm really

480
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,860
smart because nobody can dispute me.

481
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
All right.

482
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,860
So the first one, right, was a girl and I, and I say that I'm fasting and she says,

483
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,860
and I had a, I had a monster ultra, right?

484
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,860
The zero calorie, because I was drinking like zero calorie drinks because that's that.

485
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
I didn't think that counted.

486
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Sure.

487
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Sure.

488
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
And she's like, you're fasting.

489
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Oh, but, you know, you, you know, you're, but you're drinking a monster.

490
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
And I'm like, oh, well, it's no, no, no calorie kind.

491
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,860
And she's like, oh, but, you know, it's still, she seemed kind of like miffed about it.

492
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,860
And, you know, based on, here I'm going to be a big racist right now.

493
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Big fucking racist.

494
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Just based on, just based on her complexion and on the fact that she seemed sort of a

495
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,860
little bit like insulted, like you seem like an, from an emotional place.

496
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,860
She seemed a little insulted by suggestion that I was fasting while drinking a monster.

497
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,860
I think that she might have been either, you know, Muslim or maybe just raised in a Muslim

498
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,860
household or have some like cultural and maybe she thought that it was like an, it was like

499
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,860
an insult to the idea of fasting that I was saying I was fasting while drinking this,

500
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,860
this decadent Western chemical swill.

501
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
I think that's a possibility.

502
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,860
And then later on, another girl, she was like, um, she was like, uh, you're fasting.

503
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,860
Oh, like, you're, she kind of got mad.

504
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,860
She was like, you're, you're fasting.

505
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
I was like, yeah, yeah, you know, oh, I'm keto.

506
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
Haha.

507
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
Yeah.

508
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Notice how this was both women.

509
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
How interesting.

510
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
It was, it was two women.

511
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
And she's like, and I say that I'm fasting.

512
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
I'm cute.

513
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
And she's like, you're not in ketosis.

514
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
You're in starvation mode.

515
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Your body's eating itself.

516
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,860
And I'm like, well, first of all, you're wrong because those two things aren't mutually exclusive

517
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,860
and you can totally be in ketosis while you're starving.

518
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Like, of course you will be.

519
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Um, and, and she, and she was like, oh, I don't believe in that diet.

520
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
I don't believe in that diet.

521
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
So, so this person, right?

522
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,860
This person, she was, she was, she was kind of husky.

523
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,860
I wouldn't say she was obese or anything, but she was husky.

524
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,860
She looked, she had the look about her.

525
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,860
She looked like she was on, uh, like women's rugby or a college softball team.

526
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
You know?

527
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Okay.

528
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Right?

529
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
A large lab.

530
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Well, no, no.

531
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
I mean, you just know, like there's a certain, there's a certain kind of look.

532
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,860
Like, you know, like women's softball teams.

533
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Interface or in her like body build?

534
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Both.

535
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Okay.

536
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Sure.

537
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Yeah.

538
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,360
And I think that this person was probably, this person probably had a certain amount

539
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,460
of athletic training, a certain amount of like knowledge about like exercise and diet

540
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,460
imparted to her by, you know, coaches and stuff that was probably in line with the,

541
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,460
um, you know, with the, with the more conventional wisdom of like a relatively high carb diet

542
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,460
and lifestyle for, you know, for, for peak athletic performance.

543
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Yeah.

544
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,460
And this person was probably invested in that idea and had.

545
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Whereas Ben's going for peak intellectual performance.

546
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
That's right.

547
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,460
And this person, and this person was probably invested in that idea and had spent a lot

548
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,760
of her, her life, you know, you know, working under that paradigm and was probably sort

549
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,700
of insulted or sort of, sort of subconsciously insulted by, by the, you know, by the presence

550
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,760
of someone who was going about like a completely different strategy and, and she's like, you

551
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,760
know, she had some, I think she had some emotional stake in this, in the idea that Keto, that

552
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,420
Keto is just a fad and it's dumb and like her way is the way to do things.

553
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
So there we go.

554
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I broke it down.

555
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
That's pretty common, I'd say.

556
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,600
I broke, I broke down the two people that, that gave me, I mean, neither of them gave

557
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,520
me like a huge resistance, but I could tell, like I could tell in both of these people,

558
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,840
there was like a noticeable like things like fasting, Keto, imagine being the kind of person

559
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,640
and I like, I get why I'm not saying these people are crazy or anything, but to, to like,

560
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,120
when someone says, Hey, I'm doing this, this is the lifestyle that I'm choosing to live,

561
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,000
to like, begin to berate them in any kind of way, like, I get it.

562
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,640
If she, she probably really has, believes that she has some degree of expertise here.

563
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Yeah.

564
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,240
You know, if she is an athlete and whatnot, and she sees you in her eyes, making a mistake

565
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,320
and also like propagating a belief system or whatever that she feels is wrong, I get

566
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
it.

567
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Yeah.

568
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
You know, relax.

569
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Yeah.

570
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
Well, I feel like if I was in a situation where somebody told me about a lifestyle that

571
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
I didn't agree with, I would mention it, but I wouldn't get angry, I guess.

572
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,840
I'd just be like, well, yeah, it's your body, it's your life, whatever.

573
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Yeah.

574
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,240
I might be a bit passive aggressive.

575
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,600
I mean, I mean, yeah, it sounds like a proper discussion is, you know, a normal thing to

576
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
do, but you shouldn't get angry about it or like, don't get aggressive.

577
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
No, you should.

578
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
You should punch them.

579
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,520
Don't get aggressive because people will get defensive and you'll get nowhere.

580
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,600
Like, you're not going to get listened to if you just come off really strong, like, no

581
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,240
one's going to want to listen to a stranger that's yelling at them to do something different.

582
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
That's like the opposite.

583
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Yeah.

584
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Of what you want to do.

585
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Yeah.

586
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Yeah.

587
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,840
By the way, I had, I had a question for Ben.

588
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,360
Did you shit all of the shit out of you and then there was no shit left?

589
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,920
Yes, actually, I mean, all right, I'll, I'll go, I'll go into it.

590
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Yeah.

591
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,240
I basically did not poop for like three days.

592
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,400
I finally did a little bit on like the fifth or sixth day and it was very small, you know,

593
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
as you would expect.

594
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Of course.

595
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,120
The guy who fasted for a year, he would, he would go like 30 or 40 days between poop,

596
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,000
but he did, but he would, but he would, yeah, but he would poop occasionally, which is the

597
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
most surprising thing.

598
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,920
Well, because your body, I guess you still poop isn't just food.

599
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,360
It's dead cells and, you know, stuff from your body.

600
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,280
So, you know, and then, and then I don't know if it was a coincidence, but after I, but

601
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,400
after I finally ate like, wait, I did, I did poop again.

602
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,120
I don't know if it was like, I don't know if it was because I ate or if it just happened

603
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
to coincide.

604
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,680
Um, I will say that it made my poop and farts.

605
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,480
Uh, guy, this is really funny.

606
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,080
Uh, I love it.

607
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
It made them smell weird.

608
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Like they, did it?

609
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Yeah.

610
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,480
Like they smelled less like poop and more like, I don't know, they have like a weird musty

611
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
smell.

612
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Victory.

613
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Yeah.

614
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Right.

615
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,120
So, I don't, so that's a little, that's, that's some, some TMI for y'all.

616
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
I'm inspired, Ben.

617
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,600
I want, I want to go eight days.

618
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,080
I want to top this Saturday.

619
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
God damn it.

620
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Christ.

621
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Let's not start another fasting arm race.

622
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,840
A fasting arm, arms, race, arms, race, arms, race, arms.

623
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,080
By the way, the PCP does not encourage you to do any of this shit.

624
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
No, no, no.

625
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Without talking to your doctor.

626
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Yeah.

627
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Please.

628
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
No, but Ben St. does.

629
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Um, and there you go.

630
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,880
And that's, and that's, no, that's the next PCP race.

631
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,080
It's the, uh, it's the PCP fasting arm race.

632
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
The PCP race to the grave.

633
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Here we go, everybody.

634
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
It's doing great.

635
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,800
First one to get there with.

636
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,080
I mean, you don't have, I mean, there's faster ways than fasting.

637
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
If you know what I'm saying.

638
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I hear you.

639
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
I hear you.

640
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,720
Fasting, despite the name, is actually quite slow.

641
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Yeah.

642
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Hmm.

643
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Ironic.

644
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,360
Well, that was a fascinating topic.

645
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,720
Uh, let me, let me mention mine that was so rudely displaced by this whole diversion.

646
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It was you.

647
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
You said you talked about it.

648
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,320
You hear this?

649
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,320
That's my ice rattled around in my cup of iced tea.

650
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,040
And when I sip, it hits my teeth and it's cold.

651
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
This is my problem.

652
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,920
I don't want to use a straw.

653
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,120
I don't want to use a straw like a pussy.

654
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,160
And I love lots of ice in my big old cup of tea.

655
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,120
And when I drink it, it gets too cold on my lips because the ice is touching it.

656
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,120
What's wrong with the straw?

657
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
I don't get it.

658
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,440
Why can't you just get like a manly straw?

659
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,120
There were plenty of straws around me, but I don't like them.

660
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,160
I like to pick up my glass like a man and tilt it like I'm swilling some grog and what

661
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
up.

662
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
All right.

663
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
All right.

664
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
All right.

665
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
All right.

666
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
All right.

667
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Who cares about straws?

668
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Why is it hitting your teeth?

669
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Are your lips not there?

670
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
It actually hits my lips.

671
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
That's what I meant to say.

672
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
It's not hitting my teeth.

673
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Yeah.

674
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
That was strange.

675
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah, I guess.

676
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,080
I suck it through my teeth like this.

677
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,040
I mean, I have a similar, I understand the problem.

678
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,680
I guess I just don't have as big of a deal with it.

679
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
I just use a straw.

680
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,440
It's been like the biggest problem in life.

681
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,760
Like I curve my lip, my top lip like inwards so that the more sensitive part is like sort

682
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,960
of hidden from the ice cold.

683
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,600
But then you get like the liquid on the top of your lip and it's, you can, you can try

684
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
something.

685
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Then you just sniff it up.

686
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
You can try something.

687
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
You just sniff it right up.

688
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Sipping.

689
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
I got nothing else, guys.

690
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
This was, I feel passionate about this.

691
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I have a talk.

692
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,600
This is the most asinine problem I've ever heard in my life.

693
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,880
But wait, what's, what is, the problem is that the cold ice makes your teeth cold?

694
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
Yes.

695
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
No, it makes my lip cold.

696
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
It hits his teeth.

697
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
What the fuck?

698
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
That's my problem.

699
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Yes.

700
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
This is my biggest problem.

701
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Talk about it.

702
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,400
You know, in China, I don't even have ice nates.

703
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
They don't even have lips.

704
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I have a topic though.

705
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Okay, sure.

706
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I mentioned it earlier.

707
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,440
I was, I was on a trip on a guided tour with my mom and it was amazing because I don't

708
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,480
actually go outside of my house that much.

709
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,880
Wait, where was the tour?

710
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Yeah, where was it?

711
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
It was in a different part of Lithuania.

712
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,640
It wasn't in one specific town, but it was near a beach town called Konus and that was

713
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,240
the end destination, basically.

714
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
And Konus.

715
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Konus.

716
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,640
I think the proper, technically proper pronunciation is Kaunus, but most people just call it Konus

717
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
now.

718
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Okay.

719
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,440
It comes from the words to fight, sort of, kind of.

720
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Oh, is this the battlefield of the violence?

721
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
No, no, no, no.

722
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
It's not my town.

723
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
It's not my town.

724
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Um, so yeah, like, I just assume all of Lithuania is just your home town, the entire thing.

725
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,920
We talked about Konus before, like, I'm, look, this sounds really familiar.

726
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I don't.

727
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,840
Is that where the tower is?

728
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,200
Is that where, like, the, remember the tower from, uh, from the flag, from the flag episode?

729
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
God damn.

730
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
My brain has all the, remember?

731
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
When they make it a flag, there's like a tower?

732
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,440
No, Ben, no one remembers this.

733
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
So let's move on.

734
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
No, I'm having a panic attack.

735
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I just remembered.

736
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,440
No, it's from Vidinus, I believe, a Gidman-esque tower.

737
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,960
No, no, this, uh, Konus has its own castle, and I forgot how it's called, god damn it.

738
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
Anywho, um, but yeah, the point is...

739
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Bowser's castle.

740
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,440
We visited a few castles and stuff.

741
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,440
And, uh, did someone join?

742
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,380
Yes, but it's a secret. Oh, okay. It's a secret. I worry about it. Sorry. We have a secret ghost

743
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,820
That spoke me and threw me off. Okay, but anyway, any who so yeah

744
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,060
We went to visit castles and what's and then and then the ghost

745
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,940
The death the death of the ghost, okay

746
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,540
so like well

747
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:44,700
What surprised me is because I was sort of under the impression that most if not all of the castles were completely destroyed in the second

748
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
war in Lepinia and

749
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,080
Like both me and mom we're quite

750
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Ah get fucked retards

751
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,660
So both me and mom were surprised was like castles as in plural like we're gonna see more than one

752
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,440
The one in the in the capital. So yeah, it was a pretty fun trip. We had no clue where we were going technically

753
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,280
I mean, we knew the final destination was gonna be Kona's

754
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,520
But yeah, we haven't seen or heard about these places before so it was gonna be pretty interesting

755
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,500
and we learned about a bit of history and stuff and I took a lot of pictures and

756
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,420
I I took a lot of pictures of nature and stuff

757
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
But you can see all these pictures

758
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,000
Instagram.com slash legal or me. Yeah, I was I was surprised about how

759
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,620
like

760
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,380
Like two of the three castles that we saw

761
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,640
They're like they were completely ruined. They were like just just like

762
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:47,460
In complete ruins up until like people started restoring them and even now they're kind of like a little bit shitty

763
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
But I guess that's like, you know, the authenticity

764
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:57,180
We I've had shown bricks that were like over 600 years old and I remember like the thing that I could show you some dirt

765
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
That's over 600 years old

766
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,060
Listen like the bricks are held together by some sort of mass and I remember one one of the

767
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,880
Things they used to create that mass was like eggs

768
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,880
And it was like holy shit, and it's still keeping the bricks together

769
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,320
And there was like egg in it and egg yolk or something like that. Did you get to eat some? No

770
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,720
Those bricks are keto. It's like it's like the fight like the final the final stop on the tour is you stop at the mess hall

771
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
And you get a free brick

772
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
Everyone

773
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,700
It wasn't the brick it was the thing holding the bricks together. I forgot. Oh the more the mortar

774
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,620
I am guessing so that's that reminds me of a quote from the Bible that reminds me of a quote from the Bible

775
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,500
And

776
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,540
I found this I found this while I was making I was making the new map for endless war and I was looking for quotes to

777
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:57,260
to put in it's like flavor text for each of the different areas and

778
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,240
and

779
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,760
For I found this one, and it's from like it's from Genesis

780
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,320
I think it's from the part where they're building the Tower of Babel and you know the whole endless war slime thing the connections incredible

781
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,700
Beyblade the the tower you remember when Moses part of the Red Sea with Beyblade

782
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,440
Hell yeah, anyway, the point is when they're talking about the Tower of Babel

783
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,920
okay different versions translated differently, but

784
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:28,780
The King James verbal translated as come let us make brick and berm them thoroughly and they had and brick

785
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,140
They had for stone and slime they had for mortar and let us know about this

786
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,180
Yeah brick they had for stone and slime they had for more and they build us and we'll build us a city

787
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,860
Something something and a tower that reaches under the heavens, and it is so fucking appropriate. It was so great

788
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,460
Literally and speaking of towers

789
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,860
There were quite a few towers with the with the with the castles and like there was one mentioned

790
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,200
No, wait a state thing that we visited as well

791
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,840
It was pretty neat and like there were a lot of towers and I climbed every single tower

792
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,560
And then we also visited a few hills and I climbed every single hill. There were so many fucking stairs guys every single hill

793
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
There's a lot of

794
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
The ones we visited I meant

795
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:15,080
Okay, and like oh, it was it was so like my legs were literally shaking. They were literally shaking in their boots

796
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,720
They were like, please mage no more no more walking and it was like it's only 3 p.m

797
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,660
We still have a bit to go and we still walked and we still climbed and I was not

798
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,940
I've never left her house before ever ever since retiring the violent violence

799
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,700
monitor

800
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,620
Thrown back out into the cold uncaring world

801
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:42,920
Not physically prepared for the hardships that awaited the hills challenged every fiber of her being

802
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,420
And and I conquered every single challenge. It was great

803
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,780
I was I was I was I was very very tired, but I was very happy with myself like one of one of the hills

804
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,340
I'm not sure if it's impressive or not, but like it's just one of the things I climbed

805
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,820
It was like 30 feet high and

806
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,860
It's just one of the things I climbed and and there that was like

807
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,740
Like after climbing like two or so towers in one church

808
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:15,480
Tower and like another hill basically a lot of climbing a lot of stairs and those stairs weren't even comfortable guys like in the

809
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,120
Towers, they were like old rickety crackety like wooden stairs

810
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,600
I was so I'm really bad at climbing stairs because I have very bad balance. So I was gonna I was gonna fall

811
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,120
I was afraid I was gonna fall, but I never fell so that's good

812
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,800
Glad to hear it. Yep. You know, it's weird

813
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,400
That's all pretty dope. Just just as an aside

814
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,820
Castles are cool. I

815
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,620
Drive by on my way to the store like two or three castles or gigantic churches

816
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:50,180
Like on in the middle of Ohio in Cincinnati. I mean, yeah, there's more churches, obviously

817
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,260
But I swear to God. There's there's a company nearby

818
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:01,100
Okay, rather there is just a castle tower that's being built next to a bunch of houses with the sign next with it's just like

819
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,280
Custom-building, you know

820
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,120
Whatever Sanford and Sun's construction and they've got like pictures of castles

821
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,040
They just build castles out here for like people who want to live in a castle and I drive by like every day

822
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,160
Yeah, it's pretty dope. It's pretty dope

823
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,600
That's like sort of neat but imagine having to maintain a castle

824
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,320
If you have a castle, I'm assuming you're paying people to do the main I guess but I wouldn't trust people

825
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:33,380
Maybe you just maybe you're just like one of those like maybe you're like that girl. Maybe you're like the girl from

826
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,340
That's that fucking that fucking dragon anime

827
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,260
You just love being a maid and you just

828
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,660
And you want and you want to live in a and you want to live in a castle

829
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,540
Specifically because you want to have you to never be done cleaning

830
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,700
Wait, is that what does that true of Toru? Does she want to but she's a dragon, right?

831
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,920
Isn't isn't like her thing that she just loves being a maid and

832
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,360
Kobayashi because she saved her from dying also, she's a big lesbian

833
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,920
Okay bad example then maybe maybe just like maybe you're just naturally servile

834
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,320
And you want to live as a as an indentured servant to your home and to never

835
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,220
It's the situation we're like you've got those like

836
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,940
They're all color-coded and named individually yes. Yeah. Oh my god. I want this

837
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,380
I want so many you give them tiny little like night's pommels on the top

838
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,180
Like they have like like crests like helmet crests like nights

839
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
Just oh, yeah

840
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,380
No, they shouldn't hurt each other. No

841
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
You make them joust each other

842
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah, yeah, of course the the you have to mount the the lance is too high

843
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,300
So they just miss each other every time they just keep driving by over and over again

844
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,720
And and like and if any of them go out of line you like you you publicly execute

845
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,300
You have a gallows

846
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,300
That's good. You just like pull the power supply out and just watch them like slowly

847
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,120
No, no, no, don't make me sad I love Roomba. They're my boys

848
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,600
They're so good but speaking about it public execution and stuff like that back to the

849
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,920
Speaking of public execution, I have a topic that's near to my heart

850
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,520
Mange publicly executing all her enemies back. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no

851
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,500
I took a picture of like a tree that has like seven trunks technically speaking of speaking of public execution

852
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Let me tell you about growing up in Lithuania

853
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,600
What about this tree relates to yeah, yeah, and like they were like it's not just a public execution

854
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,400
But it was rumored that people that went out of line were there's like this metal rod coming from the

855
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:23,560
Well in between the trunks of the tree and it said that people were strapped to it and like got like what's it called?

856
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:29,280
Like with the whip lashes. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, something that they were punished against this tree

857
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:39,020
As the rumor goes but the person who was talking about it's like always just a rumor but and like why is there a metal rod in between the

858
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,900
The trunks and why is it at a very convenient height for stuff like that to happen?

859
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,500
How long do you think that rod has been there? Oh a while. The tree is very big

860
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
Splits into hundreds and hundreds of years

861
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,180
A few hundred I'm guessing. Okay. Well, that's pretty dope

862
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,300
I like castles. Oh and

863
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,860
I like the castles too as in the same castles as well

864
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,980
Like one of the first things we saw was like this hole in the ground with a big chunky boy at the bottom

865
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,980
Like it wasn't an actual person. It was just like

866
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:22,740
Like this white mass that's meant to look like a human, but he's a very chunky boy a very obese boy

867
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,980
But it's meant to represent like a human and it was like

868
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,800
This was like the dungeon hole and it was like six feet

869
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,600
Not six feet six meter six meters in so that's like a lot of feet a lot more feet

870
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,200
Yeah, like 18-19 feet. Like 18 feet or something. Yeah, like you ever take

871
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,640
So without any sort of light or any sort of anything it was just a hole in the ground and the people who

872
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,720
disobeyed the owner of the castle were

873
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,620
You know put there and it was very damp very dark very

874
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:03,740
Lonely and like the only way to get out is if they dropped a rope from the ceiling and and and the god pulled out

875
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,860
And right I took a picture of that

876
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,180
I managed to take a picture of that hole because it was very hard because there were a lot of people in our guided tour

877
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,880
So a lot of people can photo bombing my photos. So

878
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,060
Disgusting

879
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,200
They're trying to get they're trying to get in with the PCP they're trying to yeah

880
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,600
They're trying to achieve that coveted status of being PCP adjacent

881
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,760
A lot of people were hurling themselves into that hole just to obstruct your picture of the contents of the hole

882
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,400
Know what mage it looks like and all of you dear PCP listeners do not

883
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,240
Think about it this way. They don't know I'm mage

884
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,120
So right but they know but they know in the back of it some deep reasons of their mind

885
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,500
They will always remember that they photo bombed you and it's like remember who it was the look of utter

886
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:59,740
Distain that was shot their way. These these people are all these people are all gonna go home, right with their with their nice little

887
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,300
They're nice little family. There's little family photos

888
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,180
To their into their homes to their homes with their white picket fence and their slime wives

889
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:14,180
These fucking juvie scum are gonna go home and look at their at their holiday pictures their photo album and they're gonna pull it up and

890
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,800
You know you're gonna have been in some of them, but when they look at the photos again, they're just they're just they're just gonna see like a purple blur

891
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,740
There's gonna there's not gonna be a bird a person there

892
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,080
They're like what what's gonna be like but but the picture wasn't black and white

893
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,080
They have an inventive color photography over there yet. Yeah

894
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,360
Like what is what what is this weird this weird cryptid this weird purple cryptid like?

895
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,020
No, nobody knows nobody knows

896
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,900
One tassel had like five legs around it

897
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:56,700
Is that a ghost rattling chains do you have chain mail? No, it is it is I the gatekeeper

898
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,260
These are my rot iron keys

899
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,300
I got I got a whole thing I

900
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:09,020
I'm saying this I'm doing this a new character new character with gatekeeper. He has keys and he rattles them around

901
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:15,920
I got this bunch of like actual like wrought iron keys on a on a on a circular like

902
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,560
Wrought iron thing like there isn't an opening. You can't take the keys off. It's just connected

903
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:28,160
Oh, and I got it at a castle gift shop in Leeds castle. No, that's that's if you want wrought iron keys

904
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,440
And they had a whole thing of actual chain mail. It was very expensive

905
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,460
Yeah, and I really wanted well my brother really wanted any cried all the way home cuz he didn't get chain

906
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,320
But um Leeds castle very cool place if you ever I mean I typed in like I was trying to think how many castles

907
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,640
I've been to and which ones they were and I typed in English castle into Google and there's so many oh

908
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,880
I've I've got such a wealth of choices. I think I've been to like 10

909
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Give is I want us to do a rad con

910
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:06,680
In England come to you come to your pad and then like we just we just either if we have enough money rent a castle

911
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,980
And if not, we just have to shoot. Oh my god

912
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:15,940
All of our footage at a publicly available castle and make everyone think that we're having rad con in a castle

913
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,740
Not completely impossible. That sounds super sick, and I want to do it right now

914
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:31,540
Red rad con for a night is like Bodium castle is is one that's like the most stereotypical like castle that all like generic

915
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,700
Playsets were based off of it's a square

916
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,400
With four like circular, you know pillars and and it's like got a courtyard in the middle

917
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,140
And that's basically and it's got a moat and it's like you can go everywhere in that and you can go up to the

918
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,440
battlements and all the cool stuff and

919
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,480
That would be great

920
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,280
Shooting a fate like a YouTube show where people are looking at imagine imagine red con arena

921
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,400
Imagine like a the nerf battle in a castle. Oh, but but but a melee version with real swords

922
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,320
We get the go pros back out with so oh we got to do a melee we got to do a melee

923
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:19,020
Is there an English word specifically for hills that castles are built up on on

924
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,520
There is I can't remember at them there's a mock for the hills themselves

925
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,680
Yeah, because like the Latvian use is full of them, and I never realized up until like very recently

926
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,780
I guess I like for a while, but

927
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,180
It's called a mutt an m-o-t-t-e a mutt. It's like a an artificial hill used to

928
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,360
You know make a castle be bigger and yeah, okay

929
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,200
Those hills but not a lot of castles because those were all destroyed like yeah

930
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:57,160
See in like when I was little and people kept like mentioning those hills those moths and I just assumed

931
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,360
It's just another word for a hill and like up until recently just hit me

932
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,240
It's like we talked about a man-made one. Yeah

933
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,740
We used to have like a shit ton of castles that means because we have a shit ton of like moths

934
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:15,540
So wow it looks like I'm looking it up. It looks like it looks like a burial mound, but it's I guess it's not

935
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:21,020
I guess it's just a man-made hill. I think I think I think in America. Maybe certain like

936
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:29,580
Maybe I'm crazy. I feel like maybe certain like Native American tribes or someone had they built these very similar looking mounds as like burial mounds

937
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,040
I know

938
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
That's what it looks like to me. I

939
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,160
Don't think it's yeah history. Yeah. I mean, it's possible. Really. It's not really yeah

940
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,640
I've got an important other topic to talk about

941
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,420
And it's great. So it's Dr. Who release trailer that just came out

942
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:55,120
Have you guys I linked it in the in the chat. It's 30 seconds long. You should take a look

943
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,760
Yeah

944
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:04,300
What what I'm a busy guy. You think I got 30 seconds to waste on this bullshit. Fair enough, okay?

945
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:09,500
But I guess this is the funniest round to play. I got cookie clicker to play mother fucker. Yeah, you're right

946
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,820
You're right. This is the funniest thing I've ever seen though because in this trailer

947
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,260
The only things that happen are the camera zooms in on this on her

948
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,780
You know girl dr. Who obviously they pan up as she literally shatters the glass ceiling

949
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,460
Whoops, and she says it's about time

950
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,760
Are you fucking?

951
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,180
So what I was saying is it's time for a woman. I mean clearly

952
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,500
Why do you like that give to that seems really corny to me is my is my

953
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:48,100
All right, I don't know that really watch dr. Who a lot but I don't it is a very corny show

954
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,500
It has never not been a corny show. It's just that's fair

955
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:57,460
Oh, all right, the way I would describe it is that you know how one piece has a lot of goofy shit

956
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,160
But it's also the coolest thing ever. It's basically a corny show that occasionally becomes the most incredible

957
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,080
sci-fi badass thing with the characters that you love so much you cry when they die and they're dead and they're not coming back

958
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,220
Oh, it's that was one of those but let's not forget this character has done nothing to endear us to her yet

959
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,520
Obviously, I mean, but I don't know. I mean I can't remember whether they did another like

960
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,560
Hey get ready for Matt Smith or like ready for Peter Capaldi and he says

961
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,740
Here's catchphrase. I guess her catchphrase is whoops, which is adorable. I'm sorry

962
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,160
But by the way, Jesse was here commenting is that when I posted that and he's just

963
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,700
Well, hang on. I just said I just he said like imagine be the boy that gets to put his wiener in girl

964
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,140
Doctor who to which I replied is it gay thinking about her male history. She's and then

965
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,700
There's a debate we could have well

966
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,560
She had a male body and now is the same person in a female body

967
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,060
So, I mean, you know

968
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:04,260
Jesse just saying I hope the season is about confronting the philosophical conundrum of is it gay and I

969
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:10,320
Expect I expect at least a line of her going. Huh. I'm not used to this much estrogen

970
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:18,040
It just am I am I the only one the things she kind of looks like Hillary Clinton a little bit

971
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,480
I mean, I mean, it's her time. It is

972
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,400
This is the best we can do for she didn't get the presidency, but we can give her this

973
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,640
It's way better to become the doctor than to become the president

974
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:39,160
Kind of well, okay, maybe not you can time travel and me and not change the past and win the presidency

975
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,060
What if I just shit and what it what if what if in this season

976
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:54,260
Doctor who goes back in time and changes the 2016 presidential election and get Hillary Clinton

977
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,420
the like instead of Trump like what if what if that happened?

978
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,220
That's only a little far-fetched in my opinion

979
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:07,820
Can't we can't change the past I think they had one episode specifically with Rose going back in time and like changing like like trying to

980
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,820
Save her father from dying and what if they make the one exception for the

981
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,260
Racist evil hero

982
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:21,100
You know one thing we could only change one thing in history and I think this needs to be it

983
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,060
Rips a hole in space time

984
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,580
Oh, what do you have a problem with holes you fucking misogynist some of us have holes

985
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:37,900
You wouldn't understand what it's like. Eww, male splater. Come on. That's that's heinous. You're hang on has at least

986
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,140
You're not you're nasty. You guys are all nasty. Don't talk about holes here

987
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,100
I don't like the amount of holes we have

988
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:55,460
Seal them up. We got seal them up. Y'all are assholes. That's true. Hashtag seal the holes

989
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
All right

990
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,540
I just want to bring that up because that was very funny to me what cartoon it was but like oh

991
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:11,380
I think it was I am weasel and like the IR baboon or whatever. He tried to plug every single hole with plugs

992
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,700
Does that include like his mouth and shit? I don't remember but it

993
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,100
It was there was a very big hole and I am weasel. Yeah

994
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,260
Man, that was that was in my childhood. We're talking about holes in his body

995
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,740
No, no, no, no, like he was like a little hole in the ground and he was trying to plug that up

996
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:34,420
Oh, I thought you mean in that in that episode. I I think his hashtag plug him up

997
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,060
I think his trade was basically just selling plugs for holes

998
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:45,140
And I think he did plug I am weasel's mouth with with the plug but just just as like a joke with a

999
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,820
mouth plug

1000
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,940
I I have a I have an anecdote for my real life

1001
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,700
Right. Um when when the when the gatekeeper was rattling his uh his keys, right? It reminded me

1002
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,300
It reminded me of what's going of what what I deal with what I deal with every

1003
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,020
Yeah, yeah, it's like it was only yesterday

1004
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,020
No

1005
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:09,060
It's what I deal with in my real life, which is that my my housemates have a bunch of bizarre memes

1006
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,300
Okay, I'm not the like we've all got like bizarre memes about each other

1007
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,980
Sure. Um, so I won't go into everyone else's but I'll they'll talk about mine. Uh mine is um

1008
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:25,140
Uh, they call me they call me thumper because um because apparently because I'm a I'm a lumbering

1009
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,380
I'm a lumbering brood of a man

1010
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,820
And uh, and when I walk around when I when I walk down the stairs or like walk across the living room

1011
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,820
You know, I shake the ground because I have I'm a grace. I'm a graceless gorilla

1012
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:44,260
And um, yeah, yeah as well, you know, uh, but they also call me. You just got that giant brain resting on their shoulders, you know

1013
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:49,780
Yeah, and but but so first I was thumper, but then it evolved it evolved to

1014
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,460
Rattle bambi. So now I am called rattle bambi

1015
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,260
And

1016
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,140
The joke is uh, that uh, you say rattle bambi

1017
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,180
Rattle those chains

1018
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,340
So that just the idea is that rattle rattle bambi

1019
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:26,900
Jake lives upstairs in his like upstairs attic dungeon or whatever and he rattles his chain and he rattles his chains and eats fish heads

1020
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,500
And that's that's rattle bambi and I am rattle bambi and that's that's keto

1021
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,300
They are key. They are. Yeah. In fact, okay. All right. So I'm okay with it. Yeah

1022
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Rattle those chains

1023
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,780
So I'm like, all right. All right gatekeeper. Can we get a rattle for for rattle bambi please?

1024
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,540
Yeah, yeah

1025
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:56,500
Hashtag rattle for rattle bambi. No hashtag rattle those chains. Oh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention, but the gatekeeper was

1026
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,540
I should send you a picture though. Yeah, please do. Let's put a picture on it. That's a good idea

1027
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,540
What are you taking the gates from though?

1028
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,260
I would I keep the gates from

1029
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:24,260
Well, any well any of the foreigners well any well any of those keys undo the giant padlock that I have my wrists thrust through

1030
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,460
Perhaps no

1031
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:33,860
The stocks that I'm that I'm in as I rattle my chains. These fake keys only open fake doors

1032
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
Hey, so

1033
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:46,340
This is maybe a dumb topic that I shouldn't even bring up because I I can't even talk about it

1034
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,460
Um

1035
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:52,340
Because I don't want to spoil it, but anyone see the the adventure time finale adventure time just finished

1036
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,940
I have not seen it and I want to um

1037
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,660
I had I had kind of thought

1038
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:05,300
I had I had kind of thought that adventure time ended like a year ago, but I guess it didn't

1039
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,900
Yeah, I guess not. They're like announced it was gonna end a year ago

1040
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,620
Okay, I remember before before I moved in

1041
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,940
Mage turn your fucking mic off. I'm sorry

1042
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,700
Ignore

1043
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,700
It was okay. Um, so so um

1044
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,380
um

1045
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:26,260
So two years ago when I before I moved into digi's place before rad con 2

1046
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,620
I remember me and me and my friend, uh, we watched like

1047
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:34,420
We watched what was then all the rest of adventure time

1048
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:38,820
and uh, I remember at the time thinking that like adventure time

1049
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,540
Was almost over like the next season was gonna be the last one

1050
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,900
But I guess I was wrong because here we are two years later and it only now ended

1051
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:51,540
Uh, someone in my discord the other day said that he thinks, um, he thinks we probably a lot of people thought it had ended

1052
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:57,780
And that we probably are experiencing the mandela effect that in another universe adventure time did end

1053
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,220
But we've been transferred to one word where it only just ended now

1054
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,500
Um, so I'm so I guess I'm two years of note

1055
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,540
So I guess I'm two years behind but I want to catch it up because I was a pretty big fan of it

1056
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,620
I remember like back then when I when I when I caught up on it two years ago

1057
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:19,620
I remember that like the general feeling was that adventure time was not what it had been and it had declined in quality

1058
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:24,500
Since the early days, but I remember that time we watched like a dozen episodes and like

1059
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:30,100
I had a great fucking time and we laughed like a shit ton like it was like those episodes were really funny

1060
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,100
And I remember coming out of like, huh?

1061
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:38,020
I just kind of assumed that it wasn't the show it used to be but like that was great and like I think it's still really strong

1062
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,340
Um, so I wonder if that state I wonder if that held true through to the end

1063
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:48,100
Maybe they've they found like a second wind, you know for the for the end a couple of seasons. I would hope so

1064
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,620
Yeah, I didn't I didn't like I didn't like the um

1065
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:59,300
I didn't love how much focus the whole like who's finn gonna end up dating got

1066
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:06,020
I thought that I thought that most episodes focusing on that as a primary point of interest were the weakest ones

1067
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,740
um

1068
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,820
I I fell off the adventure. I stopped adventuring

1069
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,380
In season four at some point. I think it was during or after

1070
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,420
Some like spat with flame princess or something. Yeah, and I was just like

1071
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,500
I can tell you exactly what episode I uh checked out permanently

1072
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,820
From uh from adventure time and it was uh, let me see the 22nd episode in the fifth season

1073
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,700
And I hadn't seen every episode but it's the episode the party's over

1074
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,100
Isla de senorita

1075
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:45,300
And it was the episode where they attempted to make a real character out of the party god and that's when I knew

1076
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:50,180
Yeah, there was nothing left for me here, but that was bad. That was a bad idea

1077
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:57,380
Because I've been so checked out from adventure time. I loved the pilot years and years before the show ever got serialized

1078
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,900
I was the biggest fan when it first came out. Everyone else is a baby compared to me

1079
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:05,860
Uh, but I uh over time like whatever I fell out of it because I was so disconnected

1080
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:11,940
I felt completely safe the other day watching someone's like review slash summary of the final episode

1081
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:17,860
And I gotta say it looked awesome and I want to watch that now, uh because I really liked it

1082
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,220
I've been totally spoiled

1083
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,420
I've only been I've I've I've received some slight spoilers for the finale

1084
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:31,700
Nothing nothing too big. So um, they were gay the whole time. Yeah

1085
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:37,300
Well, I mean that is that really a spoiler. That's the only thing I know about the finale personally

1086
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,300
Right, that's the only thing that 99% of the fandom probably even cares about

1087
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,740
Frankly, I don't want to spoil it

1088
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:52,740
But like the message at the end is just exactly what I want to see from like this show

1089
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,340
And I was just like when I saw them get to this in this little summary some lady did I was like

1090
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,660
Hell yes. Hell. Yes. This is exactly what I want from the show

1091
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,620
Adventure is good

1092
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,300
What I want what I want is somebody to like put together a

1093
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,300
What is important? What is an important episodes to watch of adventure?

1094
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:17,140
I've already saw somebody putting together a tier list of like episodes you can skip to just watch the good adventure time

1095
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,980
I want to finish it. I want to I want to wrap up things because yeah

1096
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:26,820
I only vaguely understand that the lich exists. Oh, I kind of want to I kind of want to know

1097
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:33,460
I kind of want to know a bit more about all that because it seems like a villain a lot happens with that guy. Yeah, yeah

1098
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,260
Um, yeah, I mean, I think you're in luck

1099
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,980
I think people are working on that at these at this very moment

1100
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:43,860
I when I when I saw this finale thing it just filled me with all the happiness

1101
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,660
Uh that I had when I first started watching the show

1102
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,060
And man, it made me want to just like jump back in and feel those good vibes again

1103
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,900
Because adventure time was really good when it was at its best. Yeah

1104
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,100
Gets me all for all kinds of ways. Yeah

1105
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,740
And it started is am I wrong that adventure time was like the first show that started this whole

1106
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,300
Cal arts thing going on. Um

1107
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:12,740
It was like the most intellectual cartoon of the last like forever. Yeah. Yeah, I think there may have been a show

1108
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,060
Before but it wasn't as widely known. I guess it was just the biggest one

1109
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:22,020
I think before people god hung up on the whole cal arts terminology people did

1110
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:26,580
Call it like all the adventure time style. I at least I've seen it before

1111
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,860
And now that's changed a little bit to the steven universe style

1112
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:33,060
Especially when they love the gaze as they sure do in

1113
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,540
the adventure time

1114
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:40,820
I mean the the steven universe style like, um, I I don't want to rant about it for too long

1115
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:46,020
But you know the cold crunch roll original series. Oh, hi guardian spice. Yeah. Yeah. Do we mention it last time?

1116
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,780
Be like because the thing it does not look like

1117
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:56,420
Cal arts, it doesn't look like steven universe so much as it looks like. Um, what's that little witch academia thing?

1118
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,580
I mean, I would argue me a little witch academia. Yeah

1119
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:05,620
Is that the little witch academia thing? I was I wasn't sure if that's the correct

1120
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:11,220
Naper but hey kudos for me for actually remembering the full title. Wait. Yeah. No, hold on

1121
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,700
Was it high garden spice?

1122
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,460
This is really remind me of the main character from little witch academia. Dude, are they gonna have it? No, no, there's definitely

1123
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,460
No, no, you're 100% wrong and that's that that's literally the dumbest opinion I've ever heard

1124
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,420
The show definitely looks western like no one's gonna look at them like oh

1125
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:42,100
A little like more detailed and more anime, right? They're adding a little bit more detail. Um, I don't know

1126
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,220
It's funny. Me me and did you're just talking about this on iam games last night?

1127
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:51,140
Uh, we're doing another stream as soon as this episode is done recording. So if uh, you've missed it

1128
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,940
So if you can go back in time fair viewers

1129
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,260
Six days. Yeah, so

1130
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:02,260
Definitely watch the the upload that we'll have if you missed it you fucking peasants are playing spider-man on ps4 and it's great

1131
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,740
Oh, you know what we're doing fable

1132
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:11,620
No, we stopped doing fable because digi got bored and then we went to red dead red dead redemption

1133
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:17,300
And then and then we were playing that and we both hated it thoroughly. So now we're doing spider-man. Yeah

1134
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:22,580
I was like, I would love that. Yeah, that's why we stopped doing it because like if we make a video about this and just trash it

1135
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:27,140
We're never gonna get anywhere. So we'll probably get a lot of views though. I mean if you have a contrary opinion

1136
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,020
That's something right and if you sincerely believe it, you know

1137
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:35,700
It was we're kind of at the point where we're trying to like build some good faith for us before we told you

1138
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:40,820
Here's what you do. No, no, no, you make a video doesn't matter. What's in it and you call it the red dead redemption rant

1139
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,060
That's all you do and then you get a thousand

1140
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,700
And then afterwards after your mind has been changed you do the red dead redemption arc

1141
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,700
Oh

1142
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,380
Well, the thing is that we didn't want to play through an entire like game that we hated

1143
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:59,940
So because we still have to do all the live streams. It's just like neither of us wanted to play it

1144
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,380
um

1145
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,220
But yeah, so now we were talking about high guardian spice because it was just like

1146
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,420
Because digi obviously made that video that blew up and like because I wanted to be as big as you know and got a bunch of shit for it

1147
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,500
uh, but like

1148
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,500
I don't think I don't know if the show is going to be bad like that's the whole thing like everyone

1149
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,460
Oh, yeah, like this show is going to be garbage

1150
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:25,700
It's like if we if we there was a trailer like they put together for high guardian spice for steven universe

1151
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,660
I would have thought the show was going to suck balls, right?

1152
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,740
Like because it's it totally has the same kind of virtue signaling kind of like

1153
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:37,060
All we know about it is that the conceit of the show is heavily virtue signaling

1154
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,060
So like of course people are going to react like steven universe made it work like somehow

1155
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:46,260
So like I think the aesthetics of the show are are nice like it's clearly not anime

1156
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,940
Um, and I don't think this is the way crunchy rolls should be spending their money

1157
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,780
See that's the biggest thing for me about this whole crunchy roll thing when I really sat down

1158
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,940
I don't agree that like anything any criticisms of the show are valid yet

1159
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:02,020
Uh of the show itself criticisms of the marketing and the advertising so far

1160
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:08,900
I get but the main thing is that people pay crunchy roll to support anime and this is not anime. That's my main

1161
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:15,460
That's my huge issue. That's the big one. I can't wait to illegally watch high guardian spice on kiss cartoon

1162
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,180
Instead of kiss anime damn. Oh, what a savage

1163
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,540
That's fucking sick. Uh, I will do that for sure

1164
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,940
It means you got like the staff who made it like they themselves like I'll show them

1165
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,940
I'll upload this to kiss anime myself

1166
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,380
God

1167
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,460
Yeah, so I think that whole like controversy is way fucking overblown

1168
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,540
Did they ever sort of like even

1169
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,620
Announce it as an anime?

1170
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:50,260
What was that made did anyone like crunchy roll or the staff ever really call it an anime at any point?

1171
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:57,220
No, no, but they are an anime company and the fact that they're using the money they make, you know

1172
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,420
I'm just trying to see how pretentious

1173
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,940
I mean, I do not think they've done that particular sin

1174
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:11,300
Yeah, I feel like I feel like they would probably know if they were like, yeah, check out our new original anime

1175
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,220
I'm pretty sure that would be you know what I kind of want them to that would be hilarious

1176
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:21,700
Yeah, it would be pretty funny, but I feel like they're too much on the pulse to make such a people like complaining about the name

1177
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:25,780
And I mean it is a fairly dumb. It is like whenever I heard it

1178
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,620
Like it is a pretty dumb name, but then I thought about it a bit further now

1179
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:36,820
I think the the main character is called rosemary if I remember correctly and yeah, they're all spices spice

1180
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:43,540
Yeah, and I was thinking like well, maybe that's the thing the high guardian spice spice is kind of like maybe their group name or like

1181
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,820
You know how ruby is our wbi, whatever

1182
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,580
They basically wanted to make steven universe, but with condiments pretty much

1183
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,420
I can't wait to see if I can salt and pepper the the the twins

1184
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,220
That's a really cute idea

1185
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:03,300
Oh, I can't wait to make my spice. Oh, see this is gonna be great. That was that was already and that was already in bethy

1186
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,460
Yeah, this the blues clues fandom is gonna have some things to say

1187
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:17,700
I want uh, what about I can't wait until uh, I can't wait until the new like the green ranger of the group, uh, horse radish joins

1188
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,820
That's gonna be my thing and then the uh, the the asian hire wasabi will be a big

1189
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,340
I

1190
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,300
Was almost the same thing okay guys

1191
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:35,940
But to be fair like if I didn't know about the whole staff the whole crunchy roll thing

1192
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:41,460
Like all the controversies and I just saw the poster and like the art style and whatever

1193
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:47,380
If I just saw that and knew nothing about it, I would be like, oh, that looks pretty neat. I'm kind of interested to see where it goes

1194
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:53,300
I agree. Yeah, I think it's not offensive. The criticism is more specific than that. They're about right, you know

1195
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:59,860
It's all like like that's the whole thing like that trailer was like the worst possible move to make

1196
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:06,100
And they did it was so up their own asses. I just yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. It was pretty

1197
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:14,180
The one thing that about that that actually made me annoyed is that they said you've never seen a show like this before

1198
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:18,980
And I'm like, here's that stupid. What the heck out of here? I can't I can't imagine

1199
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,020
Like the only reason they're saying that I think is because

1200
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:27,380
You've never seen a show like this before because we've got the perspectives of people who are usually

1201
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:34,740
Because the writing staff is 100 like it doesn't like the part. Yeah. Yeah, but like writing staff being agender

1202
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:41,700
Agenda or another doesn't necessarily mean that the show is going to be something right like special

1203
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:48,820
You know 99% of women are just normies like 99% of men are also just normies and they all have very similar opinions

1204
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,820
I hate to break it to you guys

1205
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:55,940
But uh, yeah, I mean that whole kind of shadow your glass ceiling all over you ladies

1206
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,460
But uh, you know, I guess a man needs to do it every once in a while

1207
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:04,820
So you can see the light all that glass of dr. Who shatters just all over the high guardian spice production

1208
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:12,580
Edit that trailer so that the glass ceiling shatters and just the high guardian spices just come flying down

1209
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:20,900
It's raining down onto the doctor and she says it's about time for high guardian spice on crunchy roll

1210
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,980
Basil leaves flying everywhere

1211
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:31,620
I just I like the idea of like people named after spices. It's cute. It's it's mage

1212
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:36,500
How upset you're gonna be if none of this actually happens and it's just like not a thing

1213
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,300
I will be very glad because I'm already I'm already standing salt and pepper. I love them

1214
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:46,740
If they're not gonna be twins and they're not gonna be cute, I'll be very sad

1215
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:53,060
Waiting for that horseradish. Yeah, it's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. Our version's already better

1216
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:58,420
Let's all just look like Steven universe is our version of high guardian spice like every gem that everyone knows

1217
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:03,140
Is the thing now in Steven universe? I'm waiting for uh, I'm waiting for a tarragon

1218
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:08,260
Uh, who else we got we got uh, uh, ginger maybe ginger's around cumin

1219
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,580
Definitely cumin

1220
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:16,660
Uh, oh, oh wait a star anus wait shit. No, that's actually cool. I meant it to be funny, but it was actually cool. Fuck

1221
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,540
lemongrass

1222
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:27,380
Lemon grab ha ha. Uh, you got them. Um guys, uh, let me there was this shit. There was a topic. I wanted to say

1223
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,220
It's a it's a uh

1224
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,460
Way more serious thing and I completely forgot it. I'll get back to you when I remember. Fuck

1225
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,820
That's what I have to say. You made you made smash brothers

1226
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:42,500
Let's talk about the funny fucking earthquake that killed all of Japan. Oh, yeah

1227
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:46,100
Let's talk about those problematic gamers guys

1228
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:52,180
So there was an earthquake in japan recently in Hokkaido. Uh, it's true several people died

1229
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,140
I think at least a dozen. I haven't kept track of the numbers

1230
01:13:55,780 --> 01:14:01,220
And because the next day there was a smash bros or actually it was not specifically smash bros

1231
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:04,740
There's a nintendo direct that let's be honest. We all know there was going to be some smash stuff

1232
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:09,300
And they delayed that and it has been several days and it's still delayed by the time you hear this

1233
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:15,140
It'll probably be out fair viewer, but uh, but right now it's still delayed and uh, what's the deal? What's the deal?

1234
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:20,500
Uh, I see people being like why are these gamers complaining about getting the thing delayed?

1235
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,020
But uh, you know, I get why I'd like a human life is more important

1236
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:30,500
But I don't actually understand the causal connection between delaying the trailer. I think it's really just um

1237
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:39,140
Well, I guess like I don't know. Okay. Look if it is literally isek from uh, uh, from fucking, uh,

1238
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:46,500
Golden sun who has earth shaking earthquake superpowers. I will very much understand why they delayed the trailer

1239
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:52,820
It could have been like, oh, we can't now we can't we can't uh, show him at this time

1240
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,700
What if he just gets cancelled?

1241
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,100
No way. There's no way

1242
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,460
That can't be holy shit. That would be this. Oh man. I mean look most likely

1243
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:09,220
Uh, it's it's somebody else and this is just a delay because it's possible. There wasn't even any smash in the direct

1244
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:15,700
It is possible. So you want to talk about you want to talk about like a company like cucking themselves way too long after the fact

1245
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,500
Apple has an event on uh, this wednesday

1246
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:24,020
On the uh announcing all the new iPhones and stuff. They announced that that's coming a couple weeks ago

1247
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:31,540
However, it's a wednesday all like the vast majority of apple events when they announced these products is always on a tuesday

1248
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,060
and the reason it's

1249
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:39,380
The uh, uh wednesday is because it is wednesday the 12th because tuesday is september 11th

1250
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:47,140
And they were too much of a pussy to fucking announce their new products on september 11. Okay, you know, uh, uh, uh, that is

1251
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:52,180
Fairly pussy-ish, but but you know if they're just like look guys, we just don't imagine

1252
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:57,620
How fucking sick would this be if like in the middle of the news cycle remembering 9 11? It's like great guys

1253
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:01,700
We gotta stop talking about remembering 9 11. The new iPhones are out

1254
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,420
Yeah, yeah

1255
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:08,260
I kind of get on a corporate level. Why'd they do that? Just oh, I get it

1256
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:11,780
I just think it'd be hilarious to just have to jump back and forth between 9 11

1257
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:19,220
You could you could imply you could put like you could put like a little memorial thing in like the video for the new iPhone like

1258
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:24,420
You know, uh, just like the default wallpaper of the new iPhones the freedom tower. You know what it is

1259
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,420
You know what it is? It'll be like it'll be like um

1260
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:34,740
The the the terrace tried to destroy america. Yeah, but we came back and we're stronger than ever with the new iPhone

1261
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:40,420
You know why people won't like that. It's because people are made uncomfortable by capitalism

1262
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,940
Uh, they don't like the idea of people like profiting off of other people's suffering. Which I get which I get

1263
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:53,060
But you can you imagine the new iPhone, uh, 10 s with reinforced steel rails

1264
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,860
You'll both melt this phone

1265
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,700
The new 9 phone 11. Yes official for our fallen soldiers and heroes

1266
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:07,460
I mean, it would be the iPhone 11 technically if the 10s the last year's version the 9 phone 11

1267
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,420
Oh man, this is a change that the eye to a nine. We've done it team. There's so much good shit

1268
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,300
I can't believe that we live in a world where this wouldn't be funny

1269
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,420
They do like a the strength test where they where they fire a plane into

1270
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:26,260
Like the jet fuel can't even melt the steel of this iPhone. It's too powerful

1271
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,140
Oh, god

1272
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:37,300
Mange you're not american you should you should be more than happy to indulge

1273
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:42,420
No, I don't I'm not I'm not a particular fan of dark humor in general. That's that's the thing

1274
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:49,700
It's not just this specifically lethal aurora mage. What's uh, are you saying you don't like black comedians?

With a message regarding turtle gate. Um, I have two pet turtles

1287
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:50,420
Uh, two about two years ago. They made a third little pet turtle

1288
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:56,100
It's box turtle, but he's sick and he has like the flu and I'd like you to wish him good luck while he's getting

1289
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:01,140
Chops every three days. It is very painful for him, but he will endure

1290
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:06,740
Uh, let's see if he's wishing him the goodwill. No, she's on in his kundalini. Oh, thank you

1291
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,540

01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,940
Oh, I just got the flu

Um, yeah, good good luck. May your may your markable may your markable spin you through the through the cosmos

1294
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:30,340
Made the small turtle, uh, board the little battleship and save us all

1295
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:37,300
Yeah, that'll help us out. Is the love is the love battleship like the giant murkaba that's like under the pyramids

1296

1297
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:48,740
God love battleship. Uh, okay. Well, I'll pass that on to munchie. We got to let munchie know

1298
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,900
So he's the one with the highest christ consciousness

1299
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,580
I feel that was directed at munchie to make him mad that a guy can touch turtles

1300
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:59,460
You're right. I think oh my god. You're so right. That was actually a passive aggressive like

1301
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:05,300
You can't touch turtles. Oh, man. I'm touching all these turtles. Well, maybe that's all that's so manila

1302
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:12,500
Uh, all right next one we got uh, here's one from um, omni tanius. I think is how that's pronounced. Uh, hit us up

1303
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,940
Is that a

1304
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,180
Is that an accordion

1305
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,460
Keyboard

1306
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,340
Wow, was that was there was it was that going anywhere?

1307
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,500

1308
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,860

Oh, that was good. Um, all right, we are new outro

1310
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,180
Oh new outro, new outro

1311
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:06,900
Um, okay, here's one from um that fucking weird guy. Uh, all right. I don't remember calling into the show

1312
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,660
Yo a question for the fuck boys, you know, Nate, digi, munchie, you know

1313
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,620
Fuck boys and your head in this modern world where everyone's so fucking into them

1314
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:23,300
So fucking the press and everyone want to fucking kill themselves

1315
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:30,340
Because i'm a i'm a fucking high school boy and there's this girl I like and she loves music and I love music

1316
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,980
And we share the love for music and we're very good friends

1317
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,180
But I don't know what the fuck to do to make her my girlfriend

1318
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:42,340
Uh, I don't know what the fuck to do and I don't know me. No me me answers. No fucking me me answers

1319
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,140
Oh good. I feel so

1320
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:51,780
Oh my god, I do a lot of existential fear and terror from the same

1321
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,980
Doesn't he know that fear leads to anger and anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering

1322
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:03,620
It leads to no gf. So stop that right away. First first first tip. Uh, don't don't clip the mic when you speak to her

1323
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:08,020
Girls girls hate it girls hate it when you clip the mic

1324
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:13,540
You got to work on your gain control dude. That's step one. Wait. He said no meme answers

1325
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:15,540
He uh, he was very specific about

1326
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:22,740
He also specifically directed this to the fuck boys me digi and munchie, but yeah, feel free. Yeah

1327
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:28,420
I think uh, no, I think I think we're no we're we all we all gotta wait

1328
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,060
We all gotta weigh in and help and help this poor

1329
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:39,300
Yeah, help this poor guy get get the get the lady that he originally deserves this is as it is as is his birthright as a proud white man

1330
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:41,940
um, that's right

1331
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:49,620
I think he's argentinian actually. Have you considered uh, have you considered have you considered stealing something dear to her and holding it hostage?

1332
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,540
Do not listen to Ben

1333
01:22:54,660 --> 01:23:00,580
To to to be real if he has like he likes music and he knows she likes music then there's your answer

1334
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:05,540
Just talk to her about music and then maybe find other things you like to figure it out

1335
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:11,140
You know, I know this guy's main problem. This guy's main problem is that he's in the depths of the friend zone for sure

1336
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:15,860
For sure. I mean, I'm not clear on if he even knows this girl at all. Like he said they're good friends

1337
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:20,900
He said yeah, that was gonna be my thing is that dude you're you're too late. You're too late. You're too well

1338
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:25,860
It's not too late. It's not too late, but here's what you here's the thing

1339
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:31,620
Definitely uphill here. Well, here's what you gotta do. Here's it might be too late, but you know, you never know

1340
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,340
You just gotta fucking say it

1341
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:42,260
You just gotta say hey, I have feelings for you because yeah, if you do that may

1342
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:48,260
And she doesn't reciprocate might it ruin your friendship? Yep, but guess what your friendship's already fucking exactly

1343
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,620
It's already fucking weird because you feel this way in the first place

1344
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:55,700
Yeah, you gotta you gotta man up and like if you get rejected you get ljbf

1345
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:00,420
You gotta be like fine by and just so don't don't even fucking sweat it don't even sweat it bro

1346
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,020
Ben is right but Ben is right

1347
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:09,300
But the reason why like think about it like this the reason why it's a good idea to just say something instantly is because

1348
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,820
That shows

1349
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:15,460
Confidence is because that and like so but like and that's really the important thing here

1350
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,820
Like if you want to actually get this girl, I know I said this is somebody in the past

1351
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,820
But like okay, like it depends on how deep in the friend zone you are with this person

1352
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,620
But here's what I would do if you want this girl

1353
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:31,780
I would honestly assess your sexual market value. Are you actually someone who would you would want to date?

1354
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,100
If not, then here's what you do

1355
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:39,140
You begin working on that and becoming a better person and then you start dating other girls

1356
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:43,540
You start dating other girls and you can do this in a cold sociopathic way

1357
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,580
Just so you can get experience so you can come back and get this girl later

1358
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:50,900
No, this is this is good. This will work. It will take time, but it does work. I know that's right

1359
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:56,260
You will take a long time this guy that's gonna take like years and like but this is this is why I say that

1360
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:02,020
There's no fucking time for there's there's no fucking time for that bullshit. I mean as it relates as it relates to this girl

1361
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,820
He was a high school boy. So he only has a certain number of years to get it done before that

1362
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:11,780
That's all the more reason to just you can just put it out there and then drop it if it doesn't work out

1363
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,660
What do you mean you can have it done in a month? You can like totally change your whole public persona in a month

1364
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,420
You can totally change you have

1365
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:22,260
Okay, okay. Sorry. Everything here depends on how deep in the friend zone

1366
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:25,540
He is only he knows that that is the crucial element here

1367
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,500
If if this person if you like grew up with her

1368
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:34,340
It's like it's been a long time and like you're just like her buddy and she doesn't think you're like cool or anything

1369
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:39,460
And like what do you what would she want to date you if she just met you today for the first time?

1370
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:41,860
That's that's an important question to ask

1371
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:45,540
But like I look if you want the short the shortcut version

1372
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:52,500
Uh, that's actually fine. I would say go with ben literally tell her instantly that you are into her and just don't delay

1373
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,300
There's no reason to wait. It's fine

1374
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,900
There is no reason to wait

1375
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:01,700
But like I guess if you want to take a slower longer path that like if you need to work your way up

1376
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,700
So that you would even possibly consider it

1377
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,220
Then I would say literally stop being such good friends with her

1378
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:12,660
And go do other things so that you don't like she needs to know that you are a valuable guy

1379
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:19,380
Weird Machiavellian. I don't know. I don't know exactly what it is. That's how inter gender dynamics works. That's like like, okay

1380
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:24,580
Yeah, you should go and work on yourself and improve your your sexual market value

1381
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:30,500
Is you make make yourself a better a cooler and more more more interesting and attractive person that people want to be run

1382
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:37,140
Obviously, you should do that. You should not do that for the purpose of getting this one girl. That's weird 100% right

1383
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,940
That's right. Yeah, the real the real solution here

1384
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:45,860
And I know that this is impossible the real solution is to not care about any one specific girl and have oneitis

1385
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,300
It's to just you get it. Whatever like like like like

1386
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:56,500
It's like it's already set in stone. Either this is on or it's off. I'm gonna be real. It's almost definitely off

1387
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:58,260
But it doesn't matter

1388
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:04,100
You should you should you should just say something anyway, because because nothing ventured nothing right right now

1389
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:08,900
You're just suffering your own mental prison. Yeah, fuck that shit get out one way or the other

1390
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,900
My strategy. Look, maybe my thought would I'm actually with ben here now that I've thought about it more

1391
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:18,580
Literally just say like whatever dude. Don't make it a big romantic thing. Just like no whatever when you're hanging out with

1392
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:22,500
Everyone's is like just to be like, hey, I like you like I want to date you or whatever

1393
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,580
I think that you're really special and I like hanging out with you. Let's you know, I'd like to date

1394
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,420
I think you're cute whatever

1395
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,420
You just got to make it clear in some way and do not worry about the details too much

1396
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:36,020
It's important that you just do it because that shows that you're a cool guy

1397
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:40,340
That is someone worthy of dating her just by by not look every guy out there

1398
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,060
Is is a pussy who likes a girl and doesn't just say something to her and I've been there too

1399
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:47,700
I'm a pussy too in a lot of ways, but uh

1400
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:53,620
Be not a pussy and just go for it and if it fails. Well, sorry about that buddy

1401
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:58,180
But don't and don't go school shooter when you get rejected

1402
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,500
That's an important step would be would be my final word on that

1403
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:07,940
Oh god, no, we gave another meme answer now. He is gonna become a school shooter. We did what he said not to do

1404
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,420
Nuts, we did our best

1405
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:16,420
Okay, here's one. I think that was a pretty great answer. Yeah more than he deserved frankly

1406
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:21,620
Um, here's one from the argentinian guy. Uh, let's see what we've got here

1407
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:28,420
You're back and what's the deal with manji and his hate for south america and argentina

1408
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:32,100
You know, we may have chosen they were on people to run our countries

1409
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,500
We may be racist between each other

1410
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:42,500
We may have forgotten the spirit that our ancestor had when making our countries free from the europeans and

1411
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,340
Oh

1412
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:56,580
Yeah, he's just responding to I think manji said something about he's in south america people

1413
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:00,580
Oh, he realized he realized that manji was right. Does manji hate south america?

1414
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,100
I mean, he was meman about it. He wasn't even about it. Yeah, okay

1415
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:11,940
I mean manji's basically south american anyway. He's like a quarter mexican or something. So, you know, yeah, so it's the same thing

1416
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,340
close enough

1417
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:20,260
Wow, I mean nobody. Yeah, let's move on. I mean, I think I hate south america now after hearing all after hearing that

1418
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:25,380
That argument. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. All right. Here's one from uh from one spar

1419
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,940
Let's see what he's got for us

1420
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,980
Hello procrastinators. Once again, it is one spar of one spar weekly indeed

1421
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:37,060
This voicemail is not actually for you. This is for the viewers viewers

1422
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:40,660
I am posting a public bounty right here right now

1423
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:43,860
I'm looking for timestamps of

1424
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:49,940
Nate bestman aka the quote unquote best quote unquote guy quote unquote ever

1425
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:55,540
And specifically timestamps of him mentioning star fleet

1426
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:01,620
That's right all timestamps of Nate bestman mentioning star fleet on the procrastinators podcast

1427
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:07,140
Just pay a lot for this post them in the comments or post them on the pcp patron discord where I am for right now

1428
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,660
And uh, if you do it fast enough, they will show up

1429
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,460
soon in a compilation that will

1430
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,500
prove just how

1431
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:17,940
star fleet

1432
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,060
Nate

1433
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,820
is

1434
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:26,980
Wow. Yeah, all right. Wait, wait, wait. There's a specific detail not mentioned in this voicemail is this is a bounty

1435
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Yeah, so what is the reward? He said a bounty

1436
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,020
Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's the what do you get?

1437
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:38,980
I I think he needs to clarify a little bit. There are 124 episodes of the procrastinators podcast

1438
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:45,540
That is like in the ballpark of like almost 400 hours worth of content. That is a lot of time invested

1439
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,540
I want some financial

1440
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:52,420
You just need 124 people to watch each one. That's true. That's true. See it's possible

1441
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,420
You gotta pay a lot of people then

1442
01:30:54,420 --> 01:31:00,020
I mean, maybe the bounty is literally one cent. You know, he didn't specify. Maybe it's maybe it's a firm handshake

1443
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:02,820
Maybe it's just credit in the video description

1444
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,740
Did he did he say how to contact him?

1445
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,700
He did not. Oh, well, he did say a one spar weekly. I bet if you google that he said on the page on the page

1446
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:17,300
He said he's in the patreon discord order just leave it in the comments. Okay. Well, like well, I guess contact him there or somewhere

1447
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,780
Oh, yeah, this may be a slightly out of date

1448
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,100
Uh question

1449
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:28,100
But I won't go into detail. Never mind. Well, I mean he he should know what did he die? Uh, he didn't die

1450
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:33,940
Well, we talked today and he might be just like leaving the discord. So this might be in

1451
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:40,340
Oh, no, so, you know, whatever figure it out. We've lost. We've lost a great ally today. Okay

1452
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:46,900
That's weird. Yeah, it's just don't worry about it. It's fine. All right. Let's move on. Uh, okay. Never no question

1453
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:51,940
Here's a question from from russell russell. Oh, no a resident ghoul

1454
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:58,660
Oh, it's not russell. It's coming back. He haunts ben. He haunts me. Uh, he's a real problem. Let's let's see what he's got to say

1455
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,460
I want to pose a hypothetical tea wall

1456
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:09,220
Say you just returned from home from your nine to five having suffered allergies the whole day

1457
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:13,940
Sneezing runny stuffy nose watery eyes the works

1458
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,660
However, for tonight only

1459
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,220
Stormy daniels is in town at your local titty bar as part of her making

1460
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,860
Stay home

1461
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:30,580
God russell's such a fucking villain. He is a villain. So just just to put us in a situation

1462
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:34,020
We have to react to this evil question. It's just fucked up enough as is

1463
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:38,980
Um, it's got a good voice. I didn't know what his voice was. Yeah, I'm looking up. I'm looking up stormy daniels

1464
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:46,100
Make america horny again guys. Um, I've got to say well, she's not exactly my type. She's not exactly

1465
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,500
Is to go look at least for

1466
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,540
Is is to go and look

1467
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:57,620
At least for like curiosity's sake. Yeah, I uh, you don't want to miss that. I don't think I mean

1468
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,980
You want to be able to say I went to that and then people like wait, do I do I want that?

1469
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,380
Ben, do you not want to make america horny again or what?

1470
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:10,740
I would personally even if I was interested. I literally don't care interesting shit happens around me every single day

1471
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:15,540
And I don't care. So and she loves dreams don't count me. She's not seeing any

1472
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,580
I dreams dude, uh

1473
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:25,860
I mean, uh, all right. All right. Well, I mean why you guys I'm not I'm not taking it for I'm not taking it for granted

1474
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:29,140
That I'm interested in this event. Yeah, well fine. Ben

1475
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:34,820
I think don't go. God damn it. It's it's it's it's impure. It's immoral

1476
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:40,740
You know, I would know I would go I would go specifically to arrest her to place her under citizens arrest

1477
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:48,260
What's she's doing? I would I would I would I would yeah, I would I would apprehend her and I would say in the name

1478
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,340
Stop in the name of the law

1479
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:55,380
Yeah, um, and I would you know, she actually did get arrested. Um a while back

1480
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:59,780
Because uh, so there's a so there's this whole thing with she's like suing Donald trump or something

1481
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:02,740
Um, but there was there was the situation where in in ohio

1482
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:06,420
Is she the she's the one she's the one? Oh

1483
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:12,580
Okay, she got arrested specifically for she was at a titty bar and in ohio where I live

1484
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:17,860
And she let a patron touch her like like briefly in a I don't know

1485
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:20,020
I like I don't think it was too hot and heavy at the moment

1486
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,500
But like there was touching going on and that is illegal

1487
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:27,380
So she got like arrested everyone thought it was like the libs thought this was a big over like uh

1488
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:30,340
Look at them trump's trying to attack the person who's getting them

1489
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:34,900
I don't know how trump was involved exactly but because it's like technically prostitution if

1490
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:39,780
I mean yeah, it like crosses into that sort of field. I think which is why it's against the law

1491
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:44,180
She's the one like like trump like got her pregnant or something

1492
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:50,900
Allegedly trump had sex with her which I totally believe but I don't have proof of and uh,

1493
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:54,740
He paid her hush money to keep her quiet about yeah

1494
01:34:55,060 --> 01:35:00,100
And specifically it's a campaign finance issue because like the money that may have been used came from a guy who ran

1495
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,980
His thing which might have used the money from the from the campaign and then he paid him back

1496
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:08,100
But was that legal like that's kind of the gist of it. It's not a legal fuck of a porn star and then

1497
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:11,780
You know pay her off to keep quiet about it, but to use campaign money or is

1498
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:18,900
But it could be if I mean maybe maybe we gotta we gotta push that now. I'm sure yeah after ben's done with us

1499
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:26,020
It will be yeah, after after I after I arrest stormy daniels and and publicly execute her alongside all my rumbas

1500
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:33,540
Stormy daniels can go but let me just leave the room. But wait

1501
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:37,620
I think that the scariest thing about this voicemail wasn't even this this hypothetical

1502
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:42,820
It's that even uh, once you're dead once you're a spirit, uh, you still have to suffer with allergies

1503
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:46,660
Uh, what what a horrible thing. Oh, yeah, right. We forgot about the allergy thing

1504
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:53,220
Or maybe maybe rustles mocking us because we all suffer from these human maladies of our physical bodies that he has been freed from

1505
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:59,140
His superior ectoplasmic form has no such limitations. Yeah, maybe he's putting this this symptom on us

1506
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:06,420
But not himself. He's made of he's made of shadows and poison. Yes, or something if I if I'm not if I'm not much mistaken

1507
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,100
um

1508
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:12,580
Hey, uh, I actually want to this is a topic that I let me let me bring this up

1509
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:17,140
Let's talk about titty bars in general. I think the concept of titty bars is super weird

1510
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,380
I've never been to one and I have so dumb

1511
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:25,140
I have noticed in conjunction with like a strip club like the same thing or is that not are they not the same thing

1512
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:28,580
Yeah, well, I'm asking you. I mean you did okay. I mean I think

1513
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:36,740
I think there's I mean I've never I've never I've never been to a strip club or a titty bar or whatever

1514
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:40,900
Anything like that and I don't I don't get the appeal at all. I think it's I don't

1515
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:47,300
I'm 100% with you ben this idea in the age of internet porn. I don't see how this is in any way now ben

1516
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,820
Ben still functioning would you say that ben if it was for example?

1517
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:56,580
Like a brothel at least at least there's a reason to go wait. Is that an accurate statement? Wait wait wait say that again

1518
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:59,620
You like if it was like instead of a titty bar if it was like a brothel

1519
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:05,540
At least that sort of makes sense as to like why you'd go because you can like have sex with a woman or or a man or whatever

1520
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,860
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yes. I understand. I understand the appeal of direct quote

1521
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,300
Women don't matter unless I can have sex with them. That is what ben just said

1522
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:17,780
He's confirmed this here on the pcb today. Please write that on his grave when he is executed

1523
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:23,300
I don't know just like what what I don't know. I just I don't get it. What do you do?

1524
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,900
Why why would you want?

1525
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:28,740
Why would you want to go get a boner in public and be able to do nothing about it?

1526
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:35,700
Like I like it seems weird to go by yourself and just kind of like get off privately to like, you know

1527
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,820
Semi-nude girls walking around that seems weird

1528
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:44,980
But it also seems weird to like go with friends or like go with go with people and like weird. Yeah

1529
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:47,460
I don't know

1530
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:51,540
But I feel like that's what most people I feel like most people like go with their bros and it's like, uh

1531
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,940
Yeah

1532
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,900
They jail each other

1533
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:02,020
Because obviously the girl obviously the girls can't do it. It's you know, yeah, I guess that's true

1534
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:07,140
That's true. We don't want a stormy daniel situation on you. You need you need that burst link squad

1535
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:10,580
burst link squad

1536
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:11,860
I mean

1537
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:16,580
I guess I like I don't know like it is a bar and then they're just our naked women

1538
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:21,140
So it's like okay, so it's got all the features of a bar plus. There are naked women like, okay

1539
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:24,020
That's the naked women. See someone the naked women are a

1540
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:31,220
Are a detraction at that point for me. Like I don't even like bars in general, but just like to have to have a distraction like that

1541
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:34,420
Uh, does not sound fun to me at all

1542
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:40,020
But like a distraction from what like drinking your beer at this bar. Here's okay. Yeah

1543
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:44,020
Do you want to do you want to be like hanging out with like friends and just be like, oh, no

1544
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,900
That girl's pretty hot now. I have a boner around my friends

1545
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:52,900
I guess you could just go horrifying. I guess you could just go if you just wanted a drink like any other bar

1546
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,580
Sure, however

1547
01:38:54,580 --> 01:39:00,340
I I'm I would be I would be put off by that because I feel like there would be this um

1548
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:07,380
I feel like there'd be there's expectations on you like I because like the girls are there to the girls are there to make money

1549
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:11,300
By by paying attention to guys and and you know getting like, you know

1550
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:18,580
Getting them to tip them by by you know paying attention to them and making them feel good and and whatever and I don't

1551
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:26,020
Okay, I I walk into a titty bar and and what I imagine would then happen is that you know, some girl would be would be like, okay

1552
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,060
I'm gonna I'm gonna you know

1553
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,780
I'm gonna go talk to him and and you know be nice to him

1554
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:34,740
So he'll give me money and then I have this girl talking to me and and

1555
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:39,780
You know, like I know it's fake, right? Like I know she's some some stranger

1556
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,260
Yeah, good looking a good-looking stranger

1557
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:47,540
I cannot think of a single thing more off-putting than the idea of a good-looking stranger

1558
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:53,540
Coming up to me and acting really nice to me and me knowing that it is an act like that is

1559
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,700
Horrifying well sure that that makes me a little sick to even say out loud

1560
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:01,140
It's really the same thing with like a waitress

1561
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:06,260
Who's like trying to get you to give her tips at the end of the meal because she's being really nice

1562
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:07,780
I mean, sort of uh

1563
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:15,300
It's sort of like that. Yeah, like I feel I feel that that that same type of awkwardness when with interactions like that

1564
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:17,620
where they're always really nice to you even though that

1565
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:23,220
There's something about the way that they maybe look at you as like, uh, you don't you

1566
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:29,940
Yeah, I'm trying to eat being nice to my future money right now. I mean you guys. I think you guys are generally describing

1567
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,580
Uh, what I would call millennial cowardice

1568
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,540
You know the most part

1569
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:40,980
Like I know look I know that this is like a share. I basically agree, but I think I'm afflicted as well

1570
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:45,220
And it's like listen, you just be you're just being contrarian when a normal human

1571
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:52,900
Not us but a normal human would like go out to be a social person just to like go out and like go to a bar

1572
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:57,780
Whatever it is not a problem if someone like says anything to them

1573
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:02,420
It's not a problem, but I feel like for our generation. It is a problem and like this is

1574
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,940
Whoa, that is not that's you that's totally different than what I would just

1575
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:12,820
Is there just a sense of insecurity about like being talked to by customer service people?

1576
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:19,940
No, that's not the problem. You it's not that someone's talking to me. It's that someone is being fake to me

1577
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,980
It's that someone is coming up to me and complimenting me

1578
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:30,980
Yeah, it's different with a weight. It's different with a waiter. Oh, well sure. Okay. I just a real point here

1579
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:34,580
That is a criticism of you and me. I have never been and neither have you

1580
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:38,980
So are we not just talking out of our asses here as to what it's actually like at a place like this?

1581
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:46,980
I I guess you're not wrong. Like maybe it's totally fine. Well, then fuck you too. So what so what so what's your angle here?

1582
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:51,780
Well, I guess my angle is that I suppose it seems like I know there are people who enjoy it

1583
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:54,900
So I good for them. I suppose and I have nothing further to say

1584
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,540
I don't know if if you if you if you if you're a fan if you're a fan of strip clubs

1585
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:04,980
And you think that I'm totally off base and what goes on there and and I and I'm mistaken and it's not like this

1586
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,820
You know, leave a comment and explain why I'm wrong. You know, but you know, I've

1587
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:12,660
But you know, I mean I've I've read about it like I've read I've read stories

1588
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:16,180
I've read like stories from like women that work at them and I've you know, I've read people

1589
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:21,460
I've heard people talk about their experiences going to them. This is the impression that I get of what goes on at these places

1590
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:25,300
I there was one time in my life. I almost went to a strip club

1591
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,340
And I know that makes me sound like a pussy because there's plenty of people who just have actually gone

1592
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:34,740
But this is why one time once upon a time me and my friend Adam who I was working with at at a peer one up in

1593
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,740
Up in Massachusetts

1594
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:43,300
Like I found out that Lisa and the porn star was coming to Massachusetts to do like strip shows

1595
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:48,820
Which she does and I am a fan of hers and I was very excited to go to this and I was like, let's do it

1596
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:55,460
Now I basically pussied out by not following through because I was nervous and like, oh, this sounds like a real boy thing

1597
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:58,020
I don't want to make myself embarrassed about

1598
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,100
But I would have I wish that I had gone

1599
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:01,540
I do wish I had gone

1600
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:06,580
Just to see what it's like and to be more of a an actual human being and not a coward as I am

1601
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:09,140
I mean, I kind of I kind of appreciate

1602
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:16,180
Then the idea of an environment where it's okay to to look at the girls in a way that is like

1603
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:22,420
Yeah, yeah, they they know why you're looking and that's fine. Yeah, like if I ever went that would be cool

1604
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:24,820
I agree with hippo like

1605
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:30,660
When like we're talking we're none of us experienced it. I'm guessing and like none of us are god. We're all such pussies

1606
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,980
Mage is definitely gone for sure. He's the only one that's been

1607
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:41,860
But no, no, I mean no particular interest or at least no no burning interest in going them. So like

1608
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:48,100
We're not really talking with any sort of authority interest or even like knowledge of these things like

1609
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,060
It reminds me

1610
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,660
It reminds me of people who like

1611
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:58,420
Talk shit about people who watch less plays or or some

1612
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:02,180
Or listen to podcasts or whatever. Oh, it's just people talking

1613
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:06,980
Oh, it's just why are you watching someone else play a game when you could be playing the game yourself, you know

1614
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,940
I mean, I mean you could be playing a stripper. That's true

1615
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:16,580
I see I see I see the I see the comparison. I see that I do see the comparison. I'm not judging anyone if they like

1616
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:19,540
I'm just saying I'm just saying that the appeal of the

1617
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:25,380
From what I understand. I don't see the appeal. We should go next rad con. We should go

1618
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:34,500
Rad con entirely in rad con the divergining. That's let's call that and let's rid ourselves of this cursed virginity once and for all

1619
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,220
Finally

1620
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,540
We'll just title the video the burst length squad

1621
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,060
That's good. And we'll wear the gopro

1622
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:53,620
Okay, if if I'm there big if and we go there and I go you guys will have to come with me to a guy bar as well then

1623
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,820
You know what that sounds funny

1624
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:03,940
Yeah, I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not interested in either of them, but I I just want to go

1625
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:09,380
I would believe a lot of ladies are looking to have sex on that day. So that's cool

1626
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:11,540
Well, when's that not true?

1627
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:16,180
Can you guys like send me candy corn? I never had candy corn. I've always been curious about it

1628
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:21,540
I like candy corn. A lot of people shit on this and I think it's I think it's pretty good

1629
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:27,220
Both sides and it's like you either love it or hate it. There's no one between and I really want to try

1630
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:32,340
It's like a p.o. Box open a p.o. Box so people can send you candy. It's like sugar wax. It's pretty much what it is

1631
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,900
It has a kind of a caramel taste

1632
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:41,060
About a p.o. Box, but I'm not sure if there's anyone any any near me. So I don't

1633
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:45,860
Uh, well fair enough. I mean, yeah, we post office around here. There's a bunch of them around

1634
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:49,940
I opened a p.o. Box in georgia and um

1635
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:55,060
Literally one person because people were saying they were going to send me stuff

1636
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:57,780
Literally one person did

1637
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:04,500
And and I didn't find out about it until after the p.o. Box had expired and I never got the package and I felt terrible

1638
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:08,740
That's funny. People say a lot of things that they're definitely going to do

1639
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:13,700
I don't believe or have faith in anyone. Uh, which is why my whole p.o. Box was formed around like

1640
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:19,140
I give them something which is inclusion in weaguar and stuff. So that that keeps them coming that keeps them coming

1641
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,220
Yep, yep

1642
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:26,820
Hey, here's a question from uh at sam x amu 99 if given the choice

1643
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:33,540
What would you do destroy anime or save anime? I think we all agree. Uh, it's time for it to go

1644
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:44,580
Fully coolly was like 20 years ago and every it's been downhill ever since then have you seen fully coolly two and possibly three are like

1645
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:50,660
I have I know that they're out. I haven't seen them. I don't want to I don't even want to acknowledge that they exist

1646
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,900
I want to watch them

1647
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:57,380
One day, I definitely will watch them and I probably will at some point

1648
01:46:57,460 --> 01:47:02,900
I'm not looking forward to the consensus though, Ben. You'll be happy to know is that they're way worse. So there's

1649
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:09,380
Well, no, well, no, no, no, shit. Yeah. Yeah, who could have who could have seen this coming god damn it

1650
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:13,940
I'm sorry. I have to read this question. I actually I feel like I've seen a pretty mixed response

1651
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:19,380
Like it seems like people are not entirely negative on them, which is deeply disappointing and but yeah

1652
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,700
Yeah, I mean they're probably I mean as long as as long as people

1653
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:28,900
As long as people know that it's no it's not the original. That's I guess it's fine

1654
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:35,380
Yeah, yeah, I just I hate that you have like the original good things getting buried under sequels and spinoffs and that's

1655
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:39,860
As long as that I mean that's probably not gonna happen here, but whatever. What was that made?

1656
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:44,260
You mentioned some sort of question and and then oh, yeah, uh, here's a question that I'm sorry

1657
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:47,620
But I'm just selfishly going to answer it's at alien observer asks

1658
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:52,260
When will Nate realize that communism is the ultimate weird utilitarian mode of production?

1659
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,540
And also myth but a card is literally called Karl Marx

1660
01:47:55,940 --> 01:48:02,660
God, I think this is a total meme and he's just like mocking me and getting me all upset because fucking starfleet is not

1661
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,900
communist you pieces of trash

1662
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:08,180
I just hey, there's one answer this last way

1663
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,660
Wait, there's one sign one one time stem for you talking about starfish plate thing

1664
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:19,700
That the oh, yeah, there you go. That's that's a free one. Everyone go claim that bounty. Yeah, that's right. Get your one set everybody

1665
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:20,820
um

1666
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:23,780
I'm just gonna say uh, I'm just gonna give the short version here

1667
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:26,020
Uh starfleet is post

1668
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:31,460
Uh, what what's the word post something scarcely post scarcely the normal economic models

1669
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:34,420
We have no longer apply uh in the same way they do now

1670
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:39,540
So you cannot think of it in the same way stop being silly alien observer and everybody else out there

1671
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,260
All right, who's got another question?

1672
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:47,860
Let's see what we got. Let's see what we got. Um, I can tell you guys are being lazy and not looking

1673
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:50,020
His only mage and I have offered them

1674
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:54,020
Uh, oh god, okay. Yeah, you're right. Oh, you're right. I'll look

1675
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:59,540
God, I'll look at them and I'll know if they're bad. Yeah. Well, I mean we that's a safe assumption

1676
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:06,580
Um, uh rocks and asks, uh, do you hate all tabletops or just dnd because there is a cool pokemon tabletop

1677
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,060
Are you guys on this excuse?

1678
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:13,380
I have I have a I have a legendary video defending dnd from ben's bullshit

1679
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:18,420
And I have an equally legendary video assaulting tom for for his terrified

1680
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:24,900
Dnd in concept, but I've never really experienced it in practice. I liked it till the end

1681
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:30,100
D the the the the act of getting together to play dnd is

1682
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,060
Usually a nightmare

1683
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:36,580
For one pcp, we should all gather and play dnd for two hours

1684
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:42,340
I would I would play dnd with the pcp. I would do that. Um, but it's not something that I want

1685
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:44,980
But it's not no

1686
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:50,980
Terrible, it's not something that I want a lot of in my life. It's a big hassle. I don't know. It's been it's it's fun

1687
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:52,420
I don't know. I guess

1688
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:58,980
I don't I don't I don't disagree if anyone thinks it is fun or or under or because I get it but

1689
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:03,300
I don't know. Um, so we'll but like like in in general

1690
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:06,660
In general my problems with dnd extend to all tabletops

1691
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:11,460
But I do think that there are there are other tabletops that I think are better than dnd

1692
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:17,780
Like mutants and masterminds. I think is is pretty neat. Um, for example, and just generally generally

1693
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:22,020
That that's that's a pretty rules heavy one, but in general I think that rules

1694
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:27,940
Uh, it's it's got kind of a class. It's not really like a class based system. So yes, basically

1695
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:33,780
Yeah, you can basically do it. You basically do it. I mean like settlers of katan and that kind of shit. No, no

1696
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:38,420
Yeah, okay. All right, you know, you know, let me tell you a little anecdote

1697
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:43,140
I think I think I just want to say I think that the like the more rules light a game is the more

1698
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:47,940
I'll probably be disposed to like it. Yes. Also. I like there's kind of the shorter the better

1699
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:51,540
Just like I don't want to play for like months and months in one campaign

1700
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:57,620
I would love to sit down for like one time playing and uh, which I know is kind of not what tabletops are designed for

1701
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:59,620
But that's why I don't play tabletops

1702
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:03,860
Um, uh, but I was going to say on this the other day. Uh, this wasn't a tabletop

1703
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:04,660
This is a board game thing

1704

But I just I walked downstairs out of my apartment and I see there's like a there's like a little thing

1705
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:14,660
Uh, like a little kind of glass enclosure, um, where I live that like another person lives in and I see a guy in there

1706
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:21,220
Like my my my not my roommate, but like another guy who lives whatever in the same place I do and I see him like with friends

1707
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:25,140
Uh, a bunch of guys gathered around us in a circle playing a board game

1708
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:29,540
And I'm just my face is pressed up to the glass and I'm like, I want to play too

I want to have fun with friends. Um, but I didn't and I never will that's it

1710
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:39,060
That's the story

1722
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:30,260
Being killed to the black mage will be one of the the helpless

1723
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:33,780
Lambs that are slaughtered by me and my gamer crew when we roll through

1729
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:13,540
I'd use I'd use the stealth boy from fallout to go completely invisible and then shank you from behind

1730
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:15,140
sense

1731
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:21,460
I probably use the rules here amaze my real weapons amaze in one hand and I don't know how this works

1732
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:26,580
Probably use a shotgun. I like shotguns. I like like scattershot buckshot kind of weapons. They're cool

1733
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:31,460
I want that grappling hook shotgun from the new doom game coming out. That looks pretty helpful. Yeah, that looks pretty useful

1734
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:39,060
Oh, fucking I get the hook shot from legend of zelda. What the double hook? How sick by the way was getting the double hook shot in

1735
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:43,140
Twilight princess that was like my favorite upgrade ever. It was so fucking sick

1736
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,860
Just saying just saying

1737
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:51,620
Gamers rise up everybody. It's time. I want when I say gamers rise up

1738
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:58,100
Do they mean like the nuclear fallout will give gamers the ability to make video games real life

1739
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:00,980
Yeah, to make their favorite video game

1740
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:06,660
Manifest destiny the only manifest destiny that ever mattered was games becoming real life. That's what needs to happen

1741
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:10,740
What if the pcp got trapped inside their favorite video games? Oh my god. Oh

1742
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:13,540
Yeah, what were you saying?

1743
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:15,540
What if I became sad?

1744
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:20,820
We're already living life sans video games, which is paying enough for me

1745
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:25,540
Are you the undertaler would become sans in this reality? That's probably true

1746
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:33,300
Yeah, um, all right. That's enough questions. I think we're done here folks. I think I think we're good. We're like just at two hours

1747
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:35,380

1751
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:57,220
Remember when those bonus episodes are just a twinkle in our eye. Well now you've got a million of them for the little

1752
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:59,300
little price of five dollars per month

1753
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:04,260
And now if you're not now the value is basically unbeatable. Yeah, you're not spending the five dollars

1754
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:06,260
You're literally retarded. Oh

Think think about how sad your life is right now because it's the end of the episode

1759
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:24,340
And now you have seven painful days before another episode comes for five dollars. That's so that feeling evaporates
