00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:19,560
BG and we got BS over there. The shitter himself. We got TO. What's up, T?

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,680
Yo. Yeah, his catchphrase. Yo, we got GT.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,160
Lord of Ghost Chapter 5 will be out by the time you're listening to this. Always

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,280
pushing that L, O, G, and D.B. Yo, I'm sorry I've not been on the show for a long

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,320
time. I was spent a long six weeks trying to figure out exactly how gay I

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,960
actually am. Results? Any closer? Very gay, it turns out. Extremely excessively

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,880
gayer than I ever thought possible, so now I have to live that life for the rest

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,480
of my life. I want to say, first thing, today, when this is coming out, this

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,080
will be the last day that the Rowdy Frickers Cop Killers Pin Kickstarter is on and

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,960
we will be streaming the end of the Kickstarter on twitch.tv slash Rowdy

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,200
Frickers Cop Killers tonight. This is the big finale. We've achieved, we've

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,520
outdone all of our expectations, as always. That's great, that's great. You

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
guys, you do that and here's some incentive. I forgot to do it until now.

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm gonna do it today, the day this is recorded, but you should go do it. Yep, I

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,000
know, I know. I'm gonna make a note to myself. Go get those. I want those. It's

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,240
very sloppy, it's very sloppy. Was there any updates on the pixel V-non pixel

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,440
red man face? The pixelated version overwhelmingly won, like almost two to

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,800
one. But was there any issues with the guys? Can they do that kind of? I

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,400
suspect they can do it. I suspect it is doable. Well, cool, cool. But we'll see.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,960
Well, there you go, folks. Hey, other news in the, in the news, it's May, which means

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,880
some people are doing me a math of a type things. Not me, though. No, sir. It's May,

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,560
so there's new butterflies on Yakitori Island. Oh, thank goodness. There's the

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,000
big one. Is that true? There's a scorpion. I got stung by a scorpion the other day.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,600
Oh, goodness. Does that have the same effect as a tarantula? It is the same,

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,440
it's just you pass out and die. Epic.

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Good, good. Glad to hear. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You already did the thing.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm sorry. But pause, everybody pause for one second and listen to this right now.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:56,240
I couldn't. Okay, was that an animal crossing? Rose thing? It was. I couldn't hear the words.

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,520
It was. That's the same guy. Is that the same? That's Eleazar. That's our editor Eleazar.

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,560
Wait, that's Eleazar? Yeah, that's him. Okay, then was Eleazar the one who did the,

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,920
it's time to shit on the pizza party podcast song? It, I think it may have been. Yeah,

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,480
it must be because it was, that's the clearly the same guy. I didn't even realize that was Eleazar.

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,600
Also, wait, there's another one. There's another one. Let's listen to this.

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,760
Ben Saints Animal Crossing Time To Talk About All The Times Has Had Breeding Flowers

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,760
In Your Dazed Tool of Poses To Ben Saints Animal Crossing Life

37
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,480
There Is Full Of All The Black and Purple Flower

38
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,600
Ben Saints Animal Crossing Time

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:51,880
Yeah, well guys, my Rose Garden has expanded. It's covering like almost a third of the

40
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,480
freaking island at this point. It's real good. I got a lot of blacks. Purples are getting up there.

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,440
I got a lot of pinks by accident. I'll just probably throw them in the garbage or something.

42
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah, fuck those. Yeah, you know, I'm going for pinks actually. I'm trying to. Well, hey,

43
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,400
you know, I think today I'm going to fucking do the thing. I'm going to do the fucking thing

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,440
where I spend the money to get online. So if you want to come visit my island and you want to,

45
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,280
you want to dig up some pinks, that's fine. Or I can just bring them to your island. I don't know

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,880
whatever. I want pink windflowers specifically. I don't have any windflowers. Well, fuck that.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,640
What are they? Wildflowers? All I've got is roses. Oh, I'll take roses. Roses are good too.

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,800
Okay, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Sick, sick. Well, there it is, everybody.

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,840
We've got a jingles. Did I already mention that I was on the bonus episode that I talked about

50
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,880
winning the stock market? Yes. Yeah, I think that was, yeah. Well, I'll briefly mention then I made

51
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,480
a shit ton of money on the turnip speculation and now I have a mansion of a fully upgraded house.

52
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,880
Looks great. But there's this village Fauna, the deer. She lives on my freaking peninsula

53
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,200
and she's cramping my style. It's my peninsula. She wasn't doing anything with it. I know she was

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,840
here first, but I moved here now and I've got big ambitions for it. So she's got to go,

55
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,640
she's got to go to the animal ghetto where she belongs, down in like Kramn of the bottom left

56
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:25,240
with Curlose and Gala. It's time for a new trail of tears. Yeah. She's got to, she'll be,

57
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,600
she'll be happier there among her own kind, I think. And she's standing in the way of progress.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,240
There could be none of that on Yakutori Island.

59
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Future, Utopia. Utopian is real in Ben St.'s world. We have to, you know,

60
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,640
where her house is standing would make a really nice parking lot. Oh, you know, that's true.

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,120
Hey, we got a voicemail that I did not play, which was someone said they had a genius idea

62
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,160
of how to make so much money. And this was their genius idea. You go to your store, I think, where

63
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,760
you can buy the fruit that they sell on your island. This is what he said, for 400 bells,

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,920
then you, I assume you fill your inventory and then you go to another player's island

65
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,840
and you sell your fruit on theirs for each fruit making a 100 berry or belly, berry,

66
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,960
whatever it is, profit. That seems like a very low profit each time you're going to be doing that.

67
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,480
Well, you would make a hundred, you would make a thousand bells per stack.

68
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,920
Would times 40, I guess, which is 40,000? So you would make 40,000 bells, yeah.

69
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,600
Okay, that's not bad. That's not too bad. Now you could definitely do that.

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,240
If you went to someone else's island where your fruit was for into them.

71
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm glad we crunched the numbers. I was wondering about that.

72
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,480
Oh, anyway, hey, I just want to say, since it's May, I made the definitive version

73
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,800
of the Miyamafufa jingle, Miyamafufa 2 theme, that is. I am very proud of it. Lots of memes in

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,120
there. If you watch my streams, I'm sure you'll appreciate it very much. So go check that out.

75
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,600
But beyond that, congratulations. And I'm excited to see what the other people who are doing Miyamafufa

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,400
is doing, of which I know too, that is Nexus and May, aka Pantsu Party. So good work on those.

77
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,960
I bet there's more people too. And corrupting your kids, because it's across both channels

78
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,960
that she's doing. Right, right. What is she doing every day? Making videos. May, May, May is what it is.

79
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,320
A video every day, is that it? Yeah, video or live stream. Okay. What's Nexus doing?

80
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,960
He's drawing a picture. Yeah, he's drawing a day, I think. Good. As you should. Jade Moro.

81
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,920
I think Nexus is in particular, it's like some weird experiment where he has like a character

82
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,000
and you have to fill her room with stuff, like people have to comment stuff that he will draw

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,800
around her or something like that. What's the girl? It's like generic girl. It's filler girl.

84
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,000
He used her for like Inktober once. Yeah, that's right. You always got funny ideas.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,400
Well, I hope it doesn't take too much time away from Nexus finishing the vaporette.

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Jade Moro says she's almost done with hers and I haven't heard from Kazi and Munchie in a while,

87
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,200
so I can only assume they've been working hard on theirs. I've heard tales of Kazi

88
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,480
doing some work on it by her own admissions. She says I'm working on it, so I think she may be

89
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,160
working on it. I also heard tales, but Jade said like yesterday, she said hers was like basically

90
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,800
done, which I... That's good. That reminds me of something else I wanted to bring up regarding

91
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,320
that, because last year when I was doing me a MAFA, I had the film festival, the film contest or

92
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,000
whatever, and a bunch of really talented people entered and some not talented people don't get

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,880
me wrong. But some of the impressive guys, I've been keeping tabs on a little bit,

94
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,560
see what they're doing. Most notable was the winner, Fune Bure, who is an insanely talented guy,

95
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,640
and there was another guy, 404Tales, and I just happened the other day to stumble across a video,

96
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,400
like buy that guy 404Tales. That was like, oh, it was like the greatest cringe of all,

97
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,480
horny on main, something like that. And I thought to myself, absolutely not. Oh yeah,

98
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,280
of course did you would say that. It occurred to me that this seems like the kind of name

99
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,360
a video would have that gets really, really popular. And I'm like, oh, that must be why it's

100
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,040
recommended to me. But I click on it, it's got a couple hundred views or something. It'll be in

101
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,600
the show notes, I'm sure. And I watch it, and I had some thoughts about that and Fune Bure too,

102
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,120
because both these guys are insanely talented and put ridiculous amounts of effort

103
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,920
into their videos. And they're both in like this weird, I don't know, that starting enigma place

104
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,440
of like starting your YouTube channel, or it just like you've been doing it for a while,

105
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,320
but it hasn't really grown yet and hasn't caught on. And I was trying to think of why that is,

106
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,440
considering how much production value there is in this. And I think I had, yeah, go for it.

107
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,960
Because this is something I've been thinking about lately as per my whole fucking neuro typing

108
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,160
chart thing, which has helped me to understand my own content in a way, because I've always

109
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,760
insisted that I'm somebody who's like doing non-objective, opinionated, like it's just me,

110
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,800
it's Gonzo, and anybody who follows everything I do would obviously know that. But there's always

111
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,240
been this weird disconnect where people watching just my anime videos expect me to be like a critic.

112
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,760
They're like, oh, you missed this detail, you got something wrong. How could you criticize a show

113
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,960
if you're not going to be exacting about it? And it's like, well, that was never my point.

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,520
That's why I'm a Gonzo journalist. But I realized that the problem is I had not figured out how to

115
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:44,520
translate the script in a way that focuses on the emotions instead of the logic. If the point is

116
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,760
not to be perfectly logistical, but to tap into an emotion, then it's like anything you put into

117
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,320
the video that doesn't contribute to the emotion is essentially pointless. That is exactly kind

118
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,920
of what I was thinking. But yeah, go on. You can add all these things because you think people want

119
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,200
a video to be flashy. They want it to look clean. They want it to look good. No, they want to connect

120
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,640
with the video emotionally. They literally just are there to feel something. They're there to take

121
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,520
the ride that you're providing for them. And you've just hit them with facts. How is that ride so

122
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,920
great? That's kind of what I was thinking about. And I think that clean presentation can work for

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,000
if you're a channel like Polymatter where it's like literally facts being dumped into your head.

124
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,840
And it's like just very clean animations and information and all of it contributes to the

125
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,400
point. And that's important too. If you're trying to make a point with your video, all the images

126
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,680
should help make the point. It shouldn't just be that it looks nice. It's that it looks nice and

127
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,120
it's helping to make the point. If you just have like a bunch of pointless animations,

128
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,400
then it's just like, why are you spending all this time keyframing something that nobody cares

129
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,680
about? Like, just to make your video have the impression of being fancy, who cares? That's

130
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,520
pretentious. That is the definition of what is pretentious. I suppose so. But I mean, for both

131
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,280
of these guys, yeah, I mean, when I was kind of reviewing this and I didn't watch all of it all

132
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,680
the way through whatever. I'm not speaking about these guys in particular, by the way. I've never

133
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,160
seen anything like this. Right, of course, of course. These are just the ones I haven't

134
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,360
ever seen enough. And I thought that with both of these guys, who obviously I respect a lot,

135
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,160
and I think they're great at what they do. But it's a key issue of there's a missing narrative

136
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,440
throughline through some of these. Like, they're just describing thing. And I get some people can

137
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,800
succeed with that. But when I watch these, I get to the end, I'm like, I've gone on a ride,

138
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,960
but where did I get at the end of it? What have I achieved?

139
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:40,120
Would you say it's like akin to an editor putting like random images that match the words

140
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,760
phonetically, but not, you know, they don't serve the point? Right. In a sense, yes. But

141
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,160
there's even a bigger problem, because I really don't feel like I've like, again, not I like

142
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,680
both these guys, but I'm just trying to be constructive. My criticism here, it's that like,

143
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,440
I don't feel like there was a real point. I feel like that like in the writing stage,

144
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,640
they put down some thoughts on a thing that just kind of go, I don't know, not particularly,

145
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,280
and you know, there's no, you could see you could express the exact same feelings. But I feel like

146
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,640
a well written script would leave you with like a punch. It's like, ah, like a like an aha moment

147
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,400
at the end. It's fun to feel that. There's lots of people who make content like that. They just

148
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,560
like, you know, cringe, horny, or main, like, they just look at a bunch of things that are cringy,

149
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,480
and they as a YouTube personality reacting a funny way to it. And then them reacting in the funny

150
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,200
way is the point. So like, are they not doing that? Are they like just displaying it?

151
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,640
I think the key issue here is that may be true, but so far it is working for these guys.

152
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,520
I mean, I would say that I had a conversation of like this earlier that was about like,

153
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,320
just explaining that I think a lot of people, they don't really understand how to put the

154
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,560
thing into words, and but they still are trying to make an analysis video. And it's like,

155
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,480
if you don't understand how to put it into words, put it into something else, put it into,

156
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,840
you know, put it into the editing, the music, the sound, like whatever, but convey the idea.

157
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,360
Like, don't just like, give me fancy editing and you telling me how you can't figure out,

158
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,480
like how to explain this thing, like, or explaining it in a roundabout way, you know,

159
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,800
where I don't really feel like I get the point, like, make the point however you can,

160
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,400
but there needs to be a point, you need to understand the point. And if you can't put

161
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,600
the point into words, put it into something else, you know? Yeah, yeah, I basically agree.

162
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,680
I don't know. I like these, both these videos, just an example to be mildly critical, contained a

163
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:43,720
lot of some thoughts swirling around the issue of like, horny on main and like, simping in that,

164
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,920
like, Budokan show that obviously I had strong feelings about. But, but I don't know, something

165
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,880
was missing. And I'm trying to help these guys and anybody who finds himself in a similar position,

166
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,000
because I upon watching both, I'm like, I enjoyed this ride for the surface value, but like,

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,800
it doesn't give me a connection or like, I want to hear what this guy has to say about

168
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,080
next thing and a reason to come back. I don't know. I'm listening. Oh, I'm not listening,

169
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,680
but I'm watching muted the four or four tails video. And he's got like the four or four logo,

170
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:22,520
like DVD, like, jumping in the back, but he cuts, he cuts and it doesn't, he doesn't let it go all

171
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,160
the way. He doesn't stay there. He cuts and it changes around. That's the worst thing about this

172
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,000
guy. This guy sucks. That was a little unsatisfying. It's true. I wish he had moved his avatar, but

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,760
left that thing bouncing around. And you know what, just because I watched this one, watching this

174
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,240
video, I thought that like, what this video would contain, and I was disappointed when it didn't,

175
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,480
was lots of examples of people being horny on main that he would present in an amusing way,

176
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,000
but it's mostly just his thoughts about it. And that was somewhat unsatisfying, considering

177
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,280
that it was just his avatar moving around as he continues to describe various thoughts about it.

178
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:06,120
Again, not bad, not bad, but there's way too high effort to have like 299 views.

179
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,280
I know, I know. And it makes me feel for the guy, which is why I want to want to help because I

180
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,560
respect both these guys greatly. I don't know. I don't know. So hopefully this has been some sort

181
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,640
of useful critique. As I'm working on my remake thoughts and stuff, I've just been reassessing

182
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,040
like everything. I'm kind of getting back to like what I originally did on YouTube now with this

183
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,960
kind of shit. And it's like, I'm trying to think like, what was the point of all this? What am I

184
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:37,480
trying to achieve? What makes a video good? Why bother criticizing a video when quality literally

185
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,880
doesn't matter, and it only exposure matters? Well, the question is, is it that these guys are

186
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,640
not getting the views because they're not connecting with the audience? Or is it because

187
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,960
they're not, you know, they're just not getting seen? You know, like I do think that, you know,

188
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,320
it's not quality doesn't matter, but connecting does. Like it's just that a lot of videos connect

189
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,880
incidentally or through almost no fault or consideration of the actual, you know, creator

190
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,760
of the video. But, you know, as long as there's something people want to see, that's why they

191
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,720
come to it. And like, just looking at the simp moho video, like the thumbnail and title are

192
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,320
terrible. Like they don't convey anything to me at all. It just says simp moho. I don't know what

193
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,400
that means. The thumbnail says simp and then there's like, I don't understand what most of the

194
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,800
thumbnail is. There's like vaguely an anime somewhere deep buried in this thumbnail. But

195
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,400
like, what the hell is all this black shit around it? What is this whole silhouette thing?

196
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:45,640
That's his style. That's why would I click on that? It literally does not tell me anything. It

197
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,520
just says simp and then it's confusing. Okay. Okay. First of all, everyone knows what a simp is.

198
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,240
And when you see this ominous shit and a little bit of anime thing, I think this is a more provocative

199
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:05,240
title than I know means click on this video. It's sort of in the right direction. But like,

200
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,600
yeah, it looks, it could be any name of the show. I mean, what is this video supposed to be about?

201
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,240
Just simp in general? Like, is there a question that it seeks to answer? It should be okay. I

202
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,120
watch like 30 seconds of it. And I guess it's him talking about simping. It should be called like,

203
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,000
it should be called something that is like, let's know that it's going to be a guy talking about

204
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,680
video should just be called simping the anime and then have a big picture of the main girl,

205
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,600
like doing a simping move and just that is the thumbnail. It should be a picture that indicates

206
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,800
simping, you know, like, this is just a picture of the show. It does not show simping in the thumbnail.

207
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Like there are the show definitely has many, many, many, many powerful visuals to convey

208
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,840
simping as a concept. What show are you talking about? The show that he's talking about in the

209
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,920
video. Which is definitely about simping. It's a show about simping. That's why me and Nate covered it

210
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,880
in extensive depth earlier. I know it's a little cringe, but I don't think it would be a bad idea

211
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,480
to have like, he's got a very expressive, like, and stylish avatar. He should feature his fucking

212
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,800
avatar, like, you know, making the DreamWorks face and like crossing his arms or something, you know.

213
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,960
That does work on YouTube.

214
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,840
I mean, why have an avatar like that? Like, it's a nice avatar. I like it. It looks good. I think

215
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,920
if I saw it in the thumbnail, I would be drawn to maybe click on it. I think me and Fune and probably

216
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,600
404Tales as well. We have this thing where like, he clearly, he clearly, if you just watch the video

217
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,920
and look at the thumbnail, he has a vision for like the style of what he wants to create. But this

218
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,960
is YouTube. Our vision is worthless. It matters not at all. What matters is getting people to

219
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,600
click on the video and keep them coming back. I mean, I just don't think this is a good title

220
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,840
or thumbnail period. Like, it conveys nothing emotionally. Like, a title and thumbnail only,

221
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,520
I mean, aside from on YouTube, the meta is that it has to be an ad for your video. But aside from

222
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,520
being an ad, if you're treating it like a title or like a, then it needs to be an artistic encapsulation

223
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,240
of the point of the thing. Like a title of a book, like to kill a mockingbird, you know, like,

224
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,600
that is a fucking title. You want your title to sound like that, you know? So that's why I said,

225
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,600
like, simping the anime and then like a picture of simping, you know, and then I get it immediately,

226
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,800
I would definitely click on. Maybe put your avatar cringing. I don't know, something. Yeah.

227
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,680
All right. All right. That's my advice. Well, I hope that's been constructive feedback, Fune,

228
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,520
out of love for you and your craft and you 404Tales. That was what it was intended to be.

229
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,200
It pisses me off when people put so much effort in, but they're not rewarded fairly.

230
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,360
I mean, life isn't fair, right? It's all about putting your effort in the right place. You have

231
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,600
to work smarter than hard. Working hard won't get you nearly as far as working smart will.

232
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,280
The 404Tales one is better. At least there's like, it tells me a little more about what's gonna...

233
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,080
The title is good. I like the title. I actually like the thumbnail of that one. I mean, it's

234
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,680
evocative. I would say this one's fine. I'm surprised it doesn't have a shit ton of views.

235
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,560
Like you said, it seems like... It seems like a video that would get lots of views, but I mean,

236
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,720
it happens to be a small guy who I had heard of, so got recommended to me, but it did get

237
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,640
recommended to me. That's a sign of success. That's good news. He's got an interesting avatar.

238
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,800
I like this idea. This is very... It reminds me of like Kimono Friends,

239
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,920
like the studio that does that, like their style.

240
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,880
Oh yeah, yeah. That's cool.

241
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,000
Well, okay, there you go. Hopefully that's been useful. Ladies and gentlemen,

242
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,720
please continue. Good luck, everyone, on your quest to succeed and not die.

243
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:53,240
I really like titles that are excessively informational. I mean, that Final Fantasy video,

244
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,680
like Final Fantasy 7 remake came out and I have thoughts pertaining to it. That's the entire

245
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,920
title. It's a really stupid, bad title, but I really like it. I would click on things that

246
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,080
are like that because it's unusual and also it tells me what it is. It's like all those memes

247
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,160
where it's like Shrek, but every time Shrek appears, the movie doubles in speed or whatever.

248
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,400
Like the title is the entire meme, but then you click on it and it's actually true and that's the

249
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,920
joke. Even though it would be my inclination, some guys like Matthew Matosis get away with it

250
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,120
because they're over the hill of this sort of thing, although they probably could do better,

251
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,600
but I have to resist the urge to, when I put out my video calling it, Final Fantasy 7 remake

252
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:41,720
review. That's the worst possible title. Matthew Matosis titles, he's successful despite those.

253
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,440
I don't see why that's a bad title. I think the only thing that would be better is if you also

254
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,440
gave it like another, like a secondary title that is like your particular brand of like,

255
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,760
these are my, this is my review series. Sure. Like if it was Final Fantasy 7 review.

256
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,680
Like as much as I dislike, I hate everything's content. It is a very good gimmick to say I hate

257
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,080
this. It's a good gimmick. It's a strong word, gets people interested. No doubt. Even though

258
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,960
sometimes I think he hates those things a little bit less than the title might imply. Oh my god.

259
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,320
That fry. No. Impossible.

260
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,440
Well, that's all I had to say about that. I did go mushroom hunting yesterday, which was kind of fun.

261
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,360
Yeah. Please play Cowboy Bebop mushroom hunting in your mind as you listen to this, ladies and

262
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,080
gentlemen. Why did you go mushroom hunting? The conga drum. Sicily, Tijuana, India, Osaka,

263
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,800
Indonesia. But why did you go mushroom hunting, Nate? I want to know. Well, Michelle has been

264
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:54,200
enraptured by mushrooming culture. Yeah. Yeah. This is the thing. Who are a notably secretive?

265
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,360
I like a good mushroom from time to time. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Very secretive,

266
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,480
like cult of protecting their secrets. Because, okay, there's a mushroom called

267
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,480
a Morrell. Here, I'll get you the image. There's a, what's that fucking show on YouTube?

268
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,960
Best of the worst. Yeah. There's a, there's a Best of the worst where one of the videos they watch

269
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,480
is, it's like a guy. Morrell madness. Morrell madness. Just a guy just gushing about Morrell

270
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,240
mushrooms and how to hunt them. I've got to check that out. Well, we went, we've gone out twice now,

271
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,840
hunting Morrell's, which are supposed to grow in Ohio, in southern Ohio, which is where I live.

272
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,160
Badass. I know. They are, they trigger that, trypophobia. You know what I'm talking about?

273
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,440
They look like sponges. It's the holes. They, they, they frighten me. Okay, but they're supposed

274
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,240
to be delicious. And they, they supposed to grow, Michelle just goes down these rabbit holes sometimes

275
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:56,360
and we, she's just gotten into mushrooming and Morrell's are like a prized find in this area.

276
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,520
And she's been watching, she's been getting very depressed, watching people who are finding

277
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,800
like hundreds of Morrell's. We've been out twice, has not found any, and it's making her very sad.

278
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,880
Well, you must not be looking in the right spots. There must be somewhere else. Yeah,

279
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,920
this is what I'm saying. Like southern Ohio, which is where we are in forests. And you know,

280
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,720
we've been looking around a little bit. So we were just out there. Sit down and wait for them

281
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,560
to grow. What would you do with a Morrell if you found one? You, we cook them. You cook them is

282
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,160
what you do with them. They're supposed to be delicious. Slice them up and fry them or?

283
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,240
You know, I asked the same question. She said, you know, fricassem in, in butter,

284
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,320
make a little cream sauce served on a. So yeah, slice them up and fry them. Slice them up.

285
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,680
Yeah, yeah, whatever. You just, just fucking bite them out of the ground and eat them.

286
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,360
And put them on a, what are they called? Like a, like a toasted slice of bread or

287
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,040
something and you eat it with like a sauce on it or something. It's supposed to be delicious.

288
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,760
I can't stop staring at them and mushroom hunting is overpowering all of my thoughts now.

289
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,160
That baseline is rumbling through my body. It's on my mind every moment we're out there.

290
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,520
I would eat that. I would eat one of those. They terrify me, but she ordered some from Amazon

291
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:11,640
anyway, just to try them while we continue the hunt. I have gotten my fucking oligo saccharides,

292
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:19,560
my friggin tapioca soluble fiber. I have been like blending the shit together to try and make

293
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,800
a gummy. I finally got a gummy consistency that was hard enough, but it was not sticky enough.

294
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,640
It like fell apart a little too hard too easily with the teeth. When you bit into it,

295
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,680
I think there was too much coconut oil. So back to the drawing board. But yesterday,

296
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:42,440
I, I got my fruit flavors. I got peach mango, pear, you know, the works. It's going to be great.

297
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,280
But I don't, but the thing that I'm waiting for the most is my citric acid, the thing that will

298
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,960
make them like really tart and sour and you roll them in like a sour, like a sour gummy.

299
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh my God. I feel like I'm making progress. I'm making progress on the candy front. It's very

300
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,080
exciting. I'm looking forward to it. I want to try some. I can't wait to get molds. When I have

301
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,800
the gummy, the worm molds, that's when it's going to really be real. Yeah. I'll send you some extract

302
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,640
of morel when we find some. Yes. I'll make some morel gummies. It sounds good. And by the way,

303
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,480
last thing on the subject is just that I mean, one of the reasons it's been challenging is because

304
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,840
the morel community specifically is extremely protective of the locations of these morels.

305
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,440
We, the first time we went out, we, we were just out there, there were a bunch of people and one

306
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,080
of these guys just like, Hey, how's it going? Like, oh, you know, doing a little mushroom hunting.

307
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,120
They're like morels and we're like, you know it dog, you know it. And they said, we have scoured

308
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,640
this forest. You met other mushroom hunters. We met specifically morel hunters and get this,

309
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,200
not only that, they had a bucket of some substance and we were like, Hey, what are you guys up to?

310
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,280
They're like, so there's no morels in this forest in Cincinnati. We have a bucket here of spores.

311
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,200
We are planting around this forest to grow specifically morels for next year's season.

312
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,600
Yeah. This is the degree to which morels are beloved in these areas.

313
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,840
How did you meet other mushroom hunters? We were simply in the woods walking around and it

314
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,520
happened to come up in conversation. And did you pick where these woods like specifically

315
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,280
recommended as a mushroom hunting location? I think, yeah. I mean,

316
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,400
otherwise it just seems like an incredible coincidence. Maybe it's like a thing like

317
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,120
with quarantine, the only people like daring enough to go outside is the mushroom hunters

318
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,840
because they love them so much. And by the way, all the only people you could find.

319
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,360
I can't help but think of, remember Elizabeth, that real thick mushroom from Dark Souls one DLC

320
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,040
You keep Myra in her curves. Yes. All these images flood to mind. Also, the bad ass mushrooms

321
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,640
from Dark Souls one, you just beat your ass and they're like the strongest enemies in the game.

322
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,400
All good stuff. All good stuff. Anyway, so mushrooms. I wish you'd been doing that. Me and

323
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,240
Michelle have been out there. That's the reason for the name.

324
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,000
Indeed, on Twitter. I always wondered why she was called that. It didn't make any sense before.

325
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,520
Michelle Tobin. It's very unfortunate. Well, that's it. Been hunting mushrooms,

326
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:21,000
so that's what's going on in my life. Mushroom hunting. It's a great time. It's a great time.

327
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,760
What's going on with you guys? Shit, other than animal crossing and mixing gelatin into

328
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,960
goop. That's all I got. Oh, you know, okay, here I'll just get my other thing out of the way and

329
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,520
everyone else can say their piece. The other thing I'm doing is watching the tutors,

330
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,280
which is a showtime historical show about Henry VIII and all his wives. And it's pretty based.

331
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,240
It's pretty excellent. And the main thing it's doing is making me think that history is in fact

332
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,840
awesome, even though there's some inaccuracies on the show, which is fine. But I want to call

333
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:00,120
out Munchy. I wasn't sold until I heard inaccuracies and now I'm down. Now, yeah, it sounded boring

334
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,920
until you said that they were inaccurate. No, it's the story of Henry VIII is like,

335
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,200
truth is stranger than fiction. Shit. It's awesome. I love political machinations,

336
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,280
though I didn't even know what the Holy Roman Empire was until I watched the show.

337
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,760
When's Munchy's freaking lecture coming out? That's what I'm here to roast him about. Where the

338
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,520
fuck is the French Revolution lecture? I want to hang it with my nibba, the Marquis de Lafayette,

339
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:31,000
our guy. He's the coolest guy. And I miss him every day. Fuck you, Munchy. Harass that man.

340
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,920
The spirit science lecture was extensively edited and came out months later, so I wouldn't be

341
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,920
surprised. This doesn't even need any editing. He put visuals. We don't need to see what the

342
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,360
fucking Marquis looks like. I mean, I won't go into spoilers right now. That's not the kind

343
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,320
of editing the spirit science lecture had. It didn't show anything from the spirit science.

344
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,680
It was just madness. It was just crazy, delirious, fucking aesthetic editing.

345
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,760
Sure. Well, I would argue this doesn't need any of that, and I just want it out.

346
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,280
This is good, though. Munchy, don't work on the lecture. Make the vaporette. Thank you. And good

347
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,840
night. Do both, please. I mean, it was like my favorite lecture, and I want to watch it again,

348
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:19,240
so I'm missing it. All right, there you go. He's been canceled until that comes out.

349
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,760
Apparently, I guess I'm off scot-free until Munchy's comes out then. Is that the way this works?

350
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Oh, yeah, I forgot about yours, too. Wait, didn't you say yours was going to be done soon?

351
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,600
You were working on it, too, but it stopped. You said it was almost ready.

352
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,560
Look, things changed. I never said it was almost ready. I never said anything like that. I just

353
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,080
said I was working on it. Okay, okay. You were working on it. I mean, initially, my plan was to

354
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,720
not edit it at all and to just have both cameras in full streams the whole time,

355
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,680
but then I found a way to edit it that made it much more entertaining,

356
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:03,080
and so I just wanted to spend the time to make it good, but then I have a lot of things I have to

357
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:10,760
work on. I'm just too much on my plate, dude. It's fucking a lot. I didn't edit my first lecture

358
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,520
at all, which was fine, but then I saw Nate's the intro, the one-piece lecture. I was like,

359
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,120
you know, I like that. Maybe I would like to put something like that on the Sonichu one.

360
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,520
I mean, I really like. There's definitely something to be said for just starting the lecture when

361
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,800
the people start out. Yeah, but you're a little like just like five-second like musical intro. It

362
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,120
just makes it feel like more substantial, and I don't think it takes anything away, so I like

363
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,200
that. I want to do something like that. It's cool. It's cool. Just a little something-something.

364
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:53,480
I have a question for the first May-May-May video. Why are you the tripod? Is that your

365
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,080
idea? Do you want to be the tripod the whole time? No, it was really distracting. It was simply a

366
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,960
matter of the fact that we thought, oh, we could do it in front of this Henrietta Wallscroll that

367
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,480
we have, but directly in front of that is the couch, so I am on the couch holding the camera

368
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,240
to film. But the thing is that from the description I was given of the video, I thought it was going

369
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,560
to be like eight minutes long. Like, so I didn't realize I was going to be like holding it for

370
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,760
45 minutes, so, you know, I had to kind of get comfortable. It was one of the things you start

371
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,520
filming, and then you realize, oh, I have to hold this camera in place. Like, oh, right, that's hard.

372
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,400
I don't have any physical strength to do that with, so. Same. Yeah. Well, the good news about

373
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,040
these things is that, like, I don't know, like, when I started MiaMath of a one, for example,

374
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I, like, had not figured out my style, but, like, by the end of that, when I was done with that,

375
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,360
I was like, oh, like, I've made, like, 30 videos. I, like, this kind of placement for the camera.

376
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm just going to do this, and then all of Viagua's for, like, two years happened, and I was reasonably

377
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,280
happy with it. So you figure out a lot of shit real quick about, like, how you want to make your

378
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,080
videos and what you're into. So you burn through that stuff all quickly, so I don't know. You

379
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,680
realize you need a tripod after one episode. That's probably the best thing about doing a video

380
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:18,760
every day. I mean, like, when I did it in August, back in 2018, it was very much, like, every video

381
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,360
was completely different style, just because it was, like, the question was always, what can be

382
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,680
done within this time of day? Like, all right, I've got an idea for a video, like, what edit,

383
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,040
like, what level of editing can I do on this concept in the fucking five hours, you know,

384
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:40,120
and you get really inventive. And then you go, actually, that was fine. Like, that little 30

385
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,280
minutes of editing I did there. That video was entertaining, and I had no problems with it.

386
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,760
So let's do all of them that way forever now, you know. Yep. That's the goal. Goals.

387
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,160
It's a very educational experience. You should try it if you're thinking about it.

388
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:07,000
Well, so I've been just working on books. I've been writing novels. I've been making songs.

389
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:14,360
I've been fucking having, smoking more weed than anybody's ever smoked since Snoop Dogg.

390
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,880
And so cool. No, it's not, it's not cool. It's not cool at all.

391
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:33,080
But, you know, but it helps. So, so I've just been sitting around thinking about shit and making

392
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,880
stuff, and it's been sick. I have nothing to talk about. I thought I did at some point.

393
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,200
Tom, Tom, please.

394
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,480
Tom, save us. Tom, Tom, you're, you're a crazy, you're a wacky guy. Tell us some shenanigans.

395
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,920
The only shenanigans that have been happening to me the last couple of days is that I've been

396
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,160
hit with some sort of technology curse and everything has been destroyed. So I'm recording

397
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,800
right now with my old microphone because my audio interface is just not, well, it works.

398
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,560
But the problem is that for like a long time when I got my old computer, it would constantly like

399
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,920
crash and was saying like, Oh, one of the things connected to it is crashing a computer. I'm like,

400
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,760
well, that's dumb. So I finally built my new computer. I was excited to never have that problem

401
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,240
again, but it's still happening. So I guess my audio interface is just broken. And then my friend

402
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,400
let me borrow one of his computers yesterday because he's like, I got a new one. I don't need

403
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,200
this anymore. And I was going to use it as a render slave. And I touched it and it died. I don't

404
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,280
know what happened. I like would I just cleaned it out because it was covered in fucking dust.

405
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,320
I've been sitting in a closet forever. And so I was like, Oh, I'm going to clean it. I'm going to

406
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,480
make it look good. I'm going to like be a good responsible person and make this computer not

407
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,200
choke on itself. And I turned it on and there was no video. And I was like, okay, that's dumb.

408
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,240
Then it just didn't turn on at all. So I guess all the components died and I thought the power

409
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,720
supply died. So I guess I got to buy a new power supply for him because I broke it. But then I

410
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,400
figured it wasn't the power supply. It was the motherboard and the graphics card that both died

411
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,560
at the same time. And I was like, well, that's stupid. Then the graphics card just started

412
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,680
working again for no apparent reason. So I don't know, I'm in a cursed zone right now. And

413
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,920
that's all bad. It's all gay. I don't like it. I have like my old mic taped onto a

414
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,640
arm so it can still be not crappy. It's all it's all dumb. It's all bad.

415
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,520
Well, shit, man. Where's the happy ending to this? I don't know to be concluded so much for my happy

416
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,880
ending. Digi, what I want, I was wondering, because a couple of days ago you tweeted out about

417
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:52,440
artists and their inspirations, I guess, and saying, oh, this art reminds me of that.

418
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,120
And then I responded to that tweet saying, this is the problem whenever someone comments,

419
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,720
like, oh, your art reminds me of whatever. And they get pissed off. That shit drives me crazy.

420
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,360
It's so dumb. It drives you crazy that you think that? No, it drives me crazy that people,

421
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,800
when someone, when some normie comes into your art's mentions, like, oh, this looks great.

422
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,960
It reminds me of some popular thing. And they get offended. Yeah, it's just like, that's not meant

423
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,640
as a derogatory statement, 99% of the time. But like, artists get on their fucking high

424
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,480
horse and are just like, oh, it's don't, this is the wrong thing to say. You know, they have their

425
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,200
dumb little like graphics as they can draw on shit. They're like, don't say this, say this. And

426
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,200
it's just like, shut up. You're not a boss of people. I think the problem with the culture

427
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,600
around artists is that with it being such a like, you know, art kind of is an inherently like emotional

428
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,520
thing to do, you know, and these people, they want to feel like, you know,

429
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,400
protected in their ability to express these things that they have these intense emotional

430
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,200
attachments to. So it's like anything you say, it's like, you know, oh, you're going to say

431
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,480
something negative about my baby, you know, but it's like, you really need to be understanding

432
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,800
about the intentions of the people talking to you. Like it's, it's one thing to be like, oh,

433
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,400
this is an insult like inherently, it's like, well, it's not, it's not inherently an insult to

434
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,360
compare your art to somebody else. It's usually complimentary. Like if that is upsetting to you,

435
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:31,240
you can tell the person, but like, you know, it should be under, you should be understanding of

436
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,920
the fact that that person would not assume that you were going to have a problem with that. Like,

437
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,600
why would they think that was an insult? You know, like when I tell Ben anything, I'm excited.

438
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,400
Champion is like Naruto, but gay, you know, hopefully he takes that in the positive way.

439
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,200
Sure, sure. It's just funny that you tweeted that because I'd like, I had for a completely

440
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,640
different purpose, I was like, made this meme for my friend, because we were talking about this very

441
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,080
topic and I didn't post it because I assumed to art Twitter would get mad at me. But that's,

442
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,920
that's my thoughts on the matter. Lincoln, I agree. I think the reason I was able to

443
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,800
make the tweet funny was that I made it like sympathetic to both parties, you know, the

444
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,960
fuck is the limb in the foreground? That's what I was wondering. It's a very ominous limb. It's

445
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,680
very scary, right? But that's like the image macro for the meme. Yeah, what the fuck? It just looks

446
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:31,720
like part of the furniture. It does. I think it's, is it an arm or a leg? I want you to imagine

447
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,880
that it's leading up against that desk, like that it is that size. Oh, it's that big.

448
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,840
That it was leaning on the desk. We just, we just don't know. That's fucked up.

449
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:47,560
We just don't see a giant gross head. Sick. I think it's a guy in the foreground who's doing

450
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,920
like a weird, weird arm angle thing with a bent elbow. Like his head would be right off. We're

451
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,280
going to have to track down the guy sitting there and get an explanation, but all right,

452
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,720
what was going on in the frame over there at this exact moment? But I don't know. I mean,

453
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,840
obviously when somebody looks at your art and is like, and like doesn't engage with it the way you

454
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,280
want them to and is like, Oh, I have a more popular thing in my brain that this reminds me of,

455
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,360
which is like distracting me from just appreciating this the way you would ideally want me to. Of

456
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,360
course, that doesn't feel like ideally good, but you know, you got to, you got to control how you

457
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,800
react to these things to a degree, I suppose. Speaking of that then, Lord of Ghost chapter four

458
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,240
was, I think, not quite out by the, maybe it was out last time, PCP, but now it's definitely out.

459
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,680
Yeah, you guys have seen it. What is my comic? What is my art reminder of? Because nobody's

460
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,440
actually made comparisons. Lord of Ghost comic is fucking cool. I was going to say,

461
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,120
homestuck a little bit, but not really. I mean, hmm. I like reading it because it's cool.

462
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,480
Thank you. I can't think of anything offhand. You're welcome. Oh, there's a comic I really

463
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,680
like called Stone Toss that there's a lot of overlap here between the themes. Yeah. Yeah.

464
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,360
Really gets my my noodle going.

465
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,720
What of the 13%? Hmm. Yes, I must consider this.

466
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Hmm. That 2% though. I don't know. I think there was, I don't know, like some of the

467
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,920
thing was maybe it's a reference like riddle me this. Oh no. Okay. I'm sorry. It was a racial

468
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:29,000
slur. Something me this Batman. What is 13, but also 51 or something very, very based.

469
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,320
I can, I can fill in the list. Indeed. Indeed. Disavow. And thusly be amused. Indeed. Indeed.

470
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:42,520
I love all of God's creatures. Anyway, this guy needs to work on his posture is the main

471
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,400
thing I'm seeing going on in this picture. Both him and our man kind of shrink that down,

472
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,320
not enjoying this. What if he just has a big arm? What are you talking about? Oh,

473
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,080
it must be the legendary Coomer. This is this gigantic arm from all that cooming he's been

474
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:04,200
doing. There he is. His bones also. His arm did not get any bulkier just longer. Just longer and

475
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,800
wider. Yeah. Proportionally larger. Yeah. Great. Great. As is Dick also grew proportionally,

476
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,120
which happens when you coom excessively, as I understand it.

477
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,320
Did you have an actual answer for that? What my art style reminds you of? Or at least the Lord of

478
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:30,840
Ghosts. Oh, your art style? Yeah. I mean, yours is very distinct. Like, your art only reminds

479
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,480
me of your own art, for the most part. Like, there's obvious elements of homestuck, especially in

480
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,760
like, Baaljape and the stuff that's, you know, done in that style. But, uh, like when I think of

481
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,360
Lord of Ghosts, um, yeah, and it's just like very Hippocrates style, you know. Not much just comes

482
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,480
to mind. I mean, okay, honestly, a little bit of like the rounded characters like in stone toss,

483
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,440
like there's a little bit of an overlap in just like the, I don't know, character. I just sort of

484
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,040
see it a lot. I would assume that like where your illustrating influences come from are probably

485
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,640
things I am less familiar with, as they are probably more like British. I would assume, but.

486
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:15,800
Well, no, I mean, I'm mostly going off of like Scott Pilgrim and One Piece. Okay. I can definitely

487
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,680
see Scott Pilgrim. Specifically the hands and capes and stuff, the boots. I'm thinking like One Piece

488
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:30,920
sort of stuff. Your style is just so abstract, you know. Like you tend to, I imagine everything

489
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,440
with you has like a wobbliness, like a bloobliness, you know, that like makes it very distinct. Like

490
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,160
that's what I tend to focus on is that the wobbliness of the aesthetic. When I think of the

491
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,320
Lord of Ghosts comic, like the image that comes to mind is like my favorite or most iconic panel is

492
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,320
the one of like, I think it's from chapter one where the Lord of Ghosts is like screaming with

493
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,680
both his mouths and his eyes are like bulging out of his face a little bit, and he's like

494
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,520
reacting to whatever it was. And I'm trying to think of something that looks like that, but

495
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:01,080
I just keep it back. Like when I try to like imagine the Lord of Ghosts comic in my head,

496
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,960
I just keep picturing all the like epic sewer shots of just like the gigantic backgrounds in

497
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:12,680
the sewers. That shit was ill. Control alt delete seems like a major inspiration for the art style.

498
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, honestly, I'm like, I'm looking through it right now. And, you know, the closest thing that

499
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,720
it reminds me of, I guess, is like some of the like, not not all of them, but some of those like

500
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,480
mid 2000s, like new grounds, flash animations, just because for those projects, they had to use

501
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,840
like really simplistic form just because that was kind of like what flashers about and they were

502
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,880
animating it. I feel like you're really capturing that kind of like simplistic

503
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,560
form where like it's very much everything's defined by its silhouette more than anything else.

504
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,480
And like it doesn't have too much detail, but enough to to separate everything from each other

505
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,960
and give everything a distinct look. Like I could easily see this animating in that shaky kind of

506
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,680
old school flash kind of style. Like like there's a fish in my door.

507
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,560
You can see like hippo inviting a vizek or something maybe. It's like my favorite

508
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:18,600
new grounds. It's like my favorite new grounds anime series, CCC city, the greatest work of art

509
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,560
ever committed to the internet. This looks epic. Have I gushed about CCC city?

510
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,120
No, I don't. I see a guy with dark circles on his eyes, so I'm sold.

511
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:38,760
This it's it's it's only like like a dozen flash animations by this guy called Vinny.

512
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,040
And I guess there was a webcomic, but I never read it. It's just like this like it's that like

513
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,640
yeah early new grounds kind of like crappy anime like style like pseudo anime American

514
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:56,200
take on it, but like they're actually great and they're really good and they're really cool.

515
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,480
And I want them to be real life. Maybe we'll get the Netflix live action adaptation one of these

516
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:10,120
days. There's one one of these is like the whole video is like slow motion in reverse of like a

517
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:16,520
guy falling out of like an airplane and it's just you watch him like rise up from the ground and

518
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,840
like shit like this battle is going on around him, but you see the whole thing in slow motion

519
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:26,680
reverse and it's sick. What do you call it? The not the cinematography the fucking directing

520
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,720
I can tell is really good. Like they're blocking things out and they've got like depth of field

521
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,080
transitions, which is really difficult to do in flash. That big idea I can immediately see they

522
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:45,080
have a lot of like ideas. It's a lot of solid they do. This whole the whole thing it's like I

523
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:52,120
guess CCC city is just this big like giant like fucking it's like it's like the city in um in um

524
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,480
what's that game space port janitor yeah yeah it's like space port janitor but like it's huge

525
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,680
and it covers like a whole planet and it's like all everyone is like a weird anime character with

526
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,080
like all this weird like bullshit like armor on their fucking sticking out of their heads and stuff

527
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,880
and it's what a fucking treat. Is that one spanish? My favorite fucking thing in the world.

528
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:19,800
Well it's watch these flash videos. Flash was cool. I'm watching it right now and then you'll

529
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,240
understand me better. The drawing's not super complicated but yeah the composition the shot

530
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,320
composition and stuff the way he's like framing all the the cuts is really good.

531
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:36,520
I'm watching the start of gravataxis right now. Remember Rebecca the stamper that's still the

532
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:43,320
greatest video ever made on Newgrounds. Short and sweet baby that's all you need. Wait what? Which one?

533
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:50,040
Rebecca where uh oh god what are the names Jerry and Rebecca and the uh the kid I don't

534
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,600
fucking remember their names but it's legendary. Oh yeah Jerry, Rebecca and the kid. Wait you're

535
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:01,480
thinking of Hot Diggity Demon. He did Jerry. That's not true. Yeah it is. Yeah Jerry the and

536
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,040
like he's a depressed guy and he has a terrible life. Oh Jerry right right well fuck that I'm

537
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,400
talking about Rebecca the legendary animation by stamper whatever it'll be in the description

538
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:18,440
people will know what it is everyone everyone loves it especially me. Yes correct correct.

539
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,440
Well boys I feel we're out of steam here and we do have a bunch of voicemails if you want.

540
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,560
I forgot to say about the Kickstarter the rfck kicks it ends at 9

541
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,960
p.m. that's when we'll be 9 p.m. EST so we'll be streaming for like a bunch of hours maybe four

542
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,000
hours or six hours before that that's when that's when the ball fucking drops at ratty

543
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,120
twitch.tv slash rattyfriker's cop killers. I got news I got my trump bucks today. Okay that's nice.

544
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:57,160
I got my $1,200 for being a good American. I have not yet. Thank you Donald. Did you

545
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,720
get it in the mail like a physical letter or something? Huh what did you get it in the mail

546
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:07,160
as a physical thing or was it a transfer? They are supposed to direct deposit it if they have

547
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,800
your information. I don't know why they didn't do that but yeah I went to the IRS site and I

548
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,480
they asked for my information and they were like okay we're gonna mail you a letter and they did.

549
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,000
Okay you know yesterday I was getting my tire I had a flat tire so I called triple A to help

550
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,680
me out with it and the guy said that he was gonna give me like the guy would happen to be

551
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,880
changing what we were talking about whatever and he was like uh yeah hey have you gotten your thing

552
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,760
yet? I was like nope not yet. He's like yeah there's a website that my mom found that you can go to

553
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,680
that they will tell you like if you're ready or like if you're eligible. Yeah it's just the IRS

554
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,440
website. Just the okay I gotta fucking do that. Just be like the IRS homepage there's a button on it

555
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,800
that's like get my payment and they will ask you. Okay I'm gonna do that then. Yep I got my payment

556
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:52,680
yesterday as well so we probably got them around the same time. All right not bad thank you Drumpf

557
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:59,080
you're back at it again. All right well if there's nothing else to say I want to shout out Vic and Hope

558
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,640
so they're doing like real serious stuff I've been watching the videos they've been putting on the

559
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:13,480
channel and you know they've launched a patreon. Victor is trying to do like real youtube show

560
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:20,040
stuff and he's just put out a they just put out a podcast let's play where they're talking about

561
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,680
um you know well Victor's been talking about like gaming the system and doing all this SEO

562
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,040
shit and his approach to youtube is very like tactical I think that's really cool and I hope he

563
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:38,600
succeeds. Yeah he's had for a while now he's been the guy that we've thought about like uh uh like oh

564
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,480
you know like canton was partially inspired by like Victor saying like guys I watch these other

565
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,800
youtubers I don't even like because they do the thing about the shows I want to hear about please

566
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,200
do that so it sounds like he's doing it now which is good that's what I've been telling him to do

567
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,480
for fucking seven years god damn it like he's just literally doing what I was like badgering him all

568
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,360
the time like hey Vic it's really fun to listen to you just describe shows you should do it as a

569
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,800
youtube video series like there's actually a video uh on the Modal Soul production channel

570
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,360
it's probably unlisted right now because the audio is like almost it's so quiet you can't hear it

571
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:18,920
but it's Victor in a wig in that that girl wig that he wears some of the time of just describing

572
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,840
the the first episode of Aquarian Evolve for like 10 minutes and it's just like because he used to do

573
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,840
this like he used to just watch movies and then just describe them to me in the funniest way and I

574
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,080
would be like you have to do this is this is like a gift you need to do this all the time you need

575
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,320
to do this on the internet and then there was a double shot the drinky pony where he did it with

576
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,520
my little pony episodes but he did like two I think he did one that actually got posted and

577
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,040
then I don't even know if he finished the second one I don't remember if it ever came out I think

578
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,400
it did but uh yeah that never happened and he just kept being like uh he was just so down on youtube

579
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,960
it's like a thing as a career as uh it's gay I don't want to be some youtuber it's like he's

580
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,600
right the second he found himself on lockdown and was like oh this is actually the most reliable

581
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:06,200
career right now all of a sudden bam youtube time you know what he's right it was probably for the

582
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:12,840
best to not do it to develop other useful skills let me sure solve everything and tell tell him how

583
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:19,000
to do it and now he can just come in and fucking sweep the sweep the sweet rewards the sweet nectar

584
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,040
of my knowledge and uh that I brought to the world so make sense make sense sick I mean victors victors

585
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:37,240
camera alone makes him uh epic and good and very very nice well I mean if it does become a full-time

586
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:44,360
youtuber then like we we got him you know I mean that's got him he's in our clutch I mean his

587
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,360
because the schedule is so flexible it's it's like like gig-based or whatever I'm sure he can

588
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,520
do camera work and then also be a youtuber when he's not doing that probably seems like a pretty

589
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,160
decent business model especially because they both kind of lend each other I don't know about

590
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,040
I don't know about like like to be a really successful youtuber you need to be putting out

591
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,840
content forever until you're dead constantly I'm thinking of it more of as like a hobby that

592
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,720
happens to make money but I see your point I see your point yeah you can I guess you can be like

593
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,880
pretty big as long as the videos you make are like really substantial like if you're making

594
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,840
impressions on current shows it obviously needs to be very soon after the show is aired

595
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:31,160
that you make that video that's true and also it's not like high um no it's not high art it's

596
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,920
not the greatest stuff like people aren't going to wait months for like a you know a first impression

597
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,440
sort of thing right right they'll wait months for a genre an episode for some reason well that's

598
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,560
that's led by the comedy and it'll be about things that aren't timely so you can get that pretty

599
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,280
much anytime I feel if you're like one of those legacy youtubers the rules don't necessarily apply

600
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,160
to you as much you know that's true your name precedes you it's well you know what I think it's

601
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,080
the comfort of just seeing a familiar face like I think I think in a lot of people's minds like

602
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,880
if you never had a moment of disillusionment with John Tron then your impression is just like oh

603
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:15,080
John Tron he's a funny guy ergo it's funny to see John Tron saying things I mean what's a game

604
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:21,480
lizard brain it's so powerful oh you know here's a good example if Matthew Matosis released

605
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:28,120
just like his bloodborne review I would be on that shit I don't care how outdated it is or

606
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,720
how many lore videos I want to know what Matthew Matosis thinks about bloodborne yeah but that's

607
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:40,680
because Matthew Matosis has never let us down you know like yeah that's true it's like I've

608
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,160
really been enjoying his smaller videos he's been making oh yeah you know I caught up on like

609
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,840
all his videos except for a couple of the Zachtronics that those are the ones I'm watching now

610
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,160
and I'm just like ah yes I've forgotten I don't know like I got a little bit out of it when he

611
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,560
was doing all the Zachtronic but now I'm like caught up on almost everything I'm like mwah

612
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,400
this is the good shit I love these little videos I just want to hear him talk about a game that

613
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:07,080
Kiro Blaster video I was like yes I love this I want to hear more things like this I'm still

614
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,800
got to watch that beautiful Joe one because that is not interesting to me I am bored by that video

615
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,680
yeah but everything else that Victor I like and hope I don't even know why are you telling me that

616
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:22,680
you have to have played the game that he's talking about to he did listen to the video no no not at

617
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:28,440
all uh beautiful Joe beautiful Joe then I don't know something about it was just playing yourself

618
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,040
I don't know maybe it's weird like I loved his commentary on Devil May maybe it really is that

619
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,520
I haven't played it and just am not interested in that particular game because I loved his ones

620
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,480
about I mean the the Dark Souls ones I loved his deep dive into those I do think your impression

621
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,680
would be very different if you had played it simply because yeah the gameplay that he shows in the

622
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:55,640
videos is the highest conceivable level gameplay of that game yeah and that game is almost impossible

623
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,360
like it is that is one of the hardest video games I ever played when I was a kid like even just getting

624
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,760
through the first couple screens was hard like understanding the controls like I think you

625
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,400
would you would not have trouble with it obviously as you know what I think that's exactly it but I

626
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,640
think I need to play it in order to appreciate that video it's definitely worth playing it's fun

627
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,640
yeah okay it's it's his literal favorite game except for Wonderful 101 right is that

628
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,920
do I have this correct it's his absolute favorite but yeah yeah I love all them camea games that

629
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,960
game I did play so I enjoyed his shilling of the remake or the Kickstarter for the remake or whatever

630
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:34,520
if you play Devil May Cry there's a couple DMC references in Beautiful Jet I clapped I clapped

631
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,960
when he did the the reference it's my favorite as a kid and I still clap today because I don't care

632
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:46,200
I wear my fanboyism on my sleeve unabashedly unashamedly well you know what I it's different as

633
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,360
opposed to like making a sequel to something you know this is funny it's like with Final Fantasies

634
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,800
every game was distinct and not a sequel and so when you got like to the next like for example

635
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,720
in Final Fantasy 7 the fact that Holy and Meteor are like giant plot devices which just like were

636
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,360
black and white major spells like up to that point and actually Meteor was kind of a big plot

637
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,800
point in Final Fantasy 4 it's like oh what a cool way to like capitalize on this meme in a way that

638
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,680
like in no way like messes with like continuity or anything because it's its own it's its own story

639
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,880
but like wow so cool that they would do that and and same with like the Clover Studio stuff

640
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,680
whatever the old Capcom going into Platinum and stuff again that's really cool to see those kind

641
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,600
of references done in that way but with like a sequel I don't know something about that has far

642
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:39,960
less soul back to the the the soul discussion or whatever it's uh it's more I don't like Final

643
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:45,400
Fantasy 10 like of course it references the shit out of Final Fantasy or 10102 I meant to say like

644
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,920
that inherently is more boring and I would be way less interested in any of these like connecting

645
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,760
threads than in like I don't know like Final Fantasy 11 or whatever. Some sequels are good obviously.

646
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,480
Of course of course I don't know just just a fun thing I like. Well I mean you expect a sequel to

647
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,360
reference the thing it's a sequel of. Yeah yeah so I guess it just feels more like. Or be weird if it

648
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:13,160
didn't. I guess it becomes like an obligation as opposed to like a fun bonus in in that sense so

649
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,520
I don't know. Anyway we weren't talking about that we were talking about. Yeah yeah that'll

650
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,880
that is all to say that like Matematosis can get away with making a video whenever he wants

651
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:30,600
because his opinion his take on video games is so powerful for lack of a better term because I

652
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:37,640
don't know terms. Yeah so powerful that people will wait for that and I don't know yet whether Vic

653
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,360
and Hope can make videos like that. Victor is definitely incredibly entertaining to watch

654
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:48,760
and listen to. Like I would I just love seeing him but he would probably need to like make videos

655
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,120
all the time in order to actually gain traction. Yeah of course. I mean I just hope I like you

656
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:59,720
know his his main sort of series is that like just describe the plot of or anime done quick

657
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,040
that's what he's calling it even though it took a really long time to describe the plot of Fate

658
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:10,520
Zero or Fate Stay Night Rather. But like you know. As quick as can be done. I've always enjoyed

659
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:17,800
watching him do that and like for me it's legitimately made Fate watchable like I would

660
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,440
not watch Unlimited Blade Works. It is fucking boring. Listening to Victor describe the plot

661
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,840
was a thousand times better than trying to sit through the fucking show so. I enjoyed the visual

662
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:32,920
novel. I don't need the anime. It's just that was enough. You're not a visual novel guy though so.

663
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,560
Well particularly I just think that the visual novel is written like shit. I actually have a

664
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:44,440
video. I wouldn't say it's good. I was inspired to buy Victor's recap to write a video about Fate

665
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,680
that I might do soon. That is just about like how I think it's basically just emotionally retarded

666
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,440
like like it's a story that's like just obsessed with having like as much shit in it as possible

667
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:02,520
but like the story is garbage. Like it stuff just happens. Like have I mentioned it's just

668
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,240
character standing around and talking and then showing up in scenes and fighting. Yeah I mean

669
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:12,040
that's true. I know I've probably said this before but like have I mentioned like how unique an

670
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,680
experience reading the visual novel of Fate was and I did like every route. I didn't get every

671
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,240
ending but you know there's a lot of like little ones whatever and like the very particular experience

672
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:26,200
I've never had before in a story. There was a little bit of an Harry Potter I guess but it's like

673
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:33,960
the vast amount of detail describing the unique specific agonies of a character engaged in battle

674
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,960
like oh and then I felt my left tibia break and ooh that made me have to stagger forward. Like in

675
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,160
an anime you won't get any of that. You're going to see like him take you know 50 hit points of

676
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,600
damage basically and then get up with a little blood and keep going. That was a very uncomfortable

677
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:56,120
reading experience but it was unique and I always I always remembered that uh uh after finishing it.

678
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,200
I don't know like even just the way that like I don't know it's actually kind of fun to think about

679
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,160
when if you're if you're in a battle like in a war and you've got like you know a 50 pound sword

680
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,640
and like a 20 pound shield or whatever maybe maybe less than that whatever and you are continually

681
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,040
swinging at your opponents you don't see this in video games you don't see this in a lot of

682
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:19,720
anime or whatever like you will get tired and your bones will start to hurt after your I don't know

683
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:24,920
fifth swing I've practiced like kendo a little bit you just do like a hundred swings and you get

684
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,720
fucking tired with like a bamboo sword uh so like when you're doing it one hand I don't know

685
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:35,160
fucking battlefield or whatever you get fucking exhausted and shit and the novel goes into detail

686
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:41,400
on like how fucking tired shiro is at any given moment and I kind of love it I kind of love that

687
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,080
it goes into that stuff even though it feels very strange like for an anime uh very very unexpected

688
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:54,680
it just seems like a lot of like what is what is good about fate is the details and so the visual

689
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,000
novel is the best way to experience that because it's just uncompressed detail like it's it's just

690
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,080
nothing but rambling about fucking information for 90 fucking hours you know and like if you

691
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:10,840
remove a bunch of that then all you're left with is the story and like that's what you get with the

692
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:15,240
anime it's like the story sucks who cares about the story you know they still think it's good

693
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:21,160
for some reason they still think it's good because the animation is cool and flashy you know it's like

694
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:26,120
all that anybody cares about is that all this dialogue and all this boring shit they just see

695
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,880
it as all of that is the justification for why I get to watch this fight scene you know like and and

696
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:37,160
not have to uh not have to think that the show is stupid you know let's say oh it's a turn your

697
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,640
brain off shelly no it's a think you show you have to pay attention to follow the plot the plot

698
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,280
stupid don't think about it here's a hot take I heard uh this will be my one comment about the

699
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:52,280
remake it was that uh in the original ff7 you would like grind a little bit through battles

700
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:57,560
to get to the story uh which was enjoyable it was the best part kind of in the new remake you

701
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:05,400
grind through the awful agonizing cutscenes uh to get to the fun gameplay sometimes and uh yep

702
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:12,200
hits the mark for me here you go this is my angry rant oh you know what's funny I watched

703
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,000
what were they thinking what were they thinking it was very i watched angry joe's review of it a

704
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,640
little bit angry joe loves the remake but he never played the original these perspectives are very

705
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:31,320
interesting god what i'm not surprised i'm not surprised how do you got it look yeah he can like

706
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:36,920
the original i guess or he can like the remake okay but how do you how do you be a professional

707
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,320
video game guy and you've never played f***ing final fantasy seven yeah he's just a different kind

708
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:46,440
of gamer i don't know he started off as a college differently abled he is differently abled yeah

709
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,920
were you saying something didgy uh no should we get our voice mails now uh we can certainly

710
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,480
that's literally like a film reviewer who's never seen like citizen kane it's like i mean

711
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,680
what you don't have to be a good reviewer of movies i don't know but you don't have to

712
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:08,600
see every classic but you should at least understand it's it's it's not that i don't think he can

713
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:15,000
it's not that i think you would need to to have a an informed opinion and be a decent critic i just

714
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
if you're gonna be that why would you not play like the most f***ing influential games of all f***ing

715
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,360
time i mean why would you do it that'd be good because you get into it too is to be this way

716
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,720
you see a fan of jr pitchers no not really no well then there you go he's the first person

724
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:39,560
that i pinned where i asked people to send me bands to listen to the entirety oh yeah the

725
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:45,880
entire discography of i've been going through those recently uh i uh listened to king gives it

726
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,600
an elizabeth wizard oh hell yeah which i've heard of but i've never really listened to pretty good

727
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:56,680
i recently i've recently finished murder of the universe which is like cool which is like war of

728
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:05,080
the worlds but you know like cool i love the universe is it the narrative the fucking that

729
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:09,480
there's a narrative definitely there's like narration that goes throughout uh part three has

730
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:19,240
this cyborg like synthesized i am a cyborg yeah and all he wants to do is to vomit and like the

731
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:26,120
vomit and die is he cannot vomit or die and so he wants to do those things to be human the last

732
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:31,640
song really stuck with me because it was like one of my big i don't know what to call it like fears

733
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:38,440
but like cool fears that i enjoy having um where it's like the like uh exponential growth of he

734
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:43,880
vomits so much that his like head explodes and then it is like his entire body is filled with

735
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,040
vomit and then just it grows and grows and takes over the entire universe and kills everything with

736
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:54,520
vomit it was disgusting it's like four minutes of this guy describing the the the exponential growth

737
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:59,320
of the vomit as it fills the universe for four minutes on end as the music gets just like rises

738
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,360
and keeps getting more epic in the background it's awesome have you i mean this reminds me very

739
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,760
much of that comic maybe i can find it i google it don't see it immediately where a guy's like puking

740
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,760
it's all stick figures and then someone starts pissing and then shitting and then every person

741
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,880
on the planet catches this thing where they are vomiting green pissing yellow and shitting brown

742
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,680
and like and it's a virus that captures the entire planet and it zooms out and you see there's just

743
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:29,160
massive spirals everywhere of like a three-point spiral of yellow brown and green as every person

744
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,400
on the planet sounds pretty similar to what they're actually doing it more that's it that's the

745
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:39,400
comic it just ends with that maybe i'll see if i can find it oh i found it i found it uh hang on

746
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:48,840
i got it right here it's got parts it's got parts like vomit coffin filthy breeze rotting skull vomit

747
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:55,320
bomb it's good shit man uh that that album also has the 30 minute song about altered beast

748
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:03,080
about becoming the altered beast whoa oh sick this comic is fucking awesome yeah it's great it is great

749
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,440
he's like spiraling upward as a project that would force him up stronger and stronger like boil down

750
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:14,680
to one image this is good thank you for chan for making this i appreciate that this is basically

751
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:21,320
homestuck this is basically what happens when you get the coronavirus sicko thing i'm staying

752
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:29,240
indoors like here's splatters of bodily fluids on the window i can't stop this is a this is a work

753
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,960
you're right i do need to give a succinct piece of apocalyptic fiction i've ever seen

754
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,800
like yeah well well well this is basically no man this is what how impact is lost at all

755
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:50,520
every panel uh has purpose and meaning every image is so dense there's so much going on every

756
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:57,800
panel they're pointing with their mouths open what do they expect to happen they get hit with piss

757
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:04,520
and then vomit and then shit and then every man woman and child i know i know this is just funny

758
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,680
but like the line of action on these are really good it's really shows the comedy

759
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,080
there's real talent here i mean i don't know small one my favorite thing in the third panel is okay

760
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:21,560
and the shitting intensely this is it isn't there's just a tiny little piece yeah the tiny

761
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:27,480
history of this starts but then it too swirls into infinite power look at the way this expression

762
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:32,680
changes across the first three panels as well he realizes what's happening just like uh to like

763
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:38,680
oh it's like oh no like by the fourth one he's moving so fast that you can't even make him out

764
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,880
he's just a complete blur i i legitimately love the effect of like the spiral that starts so

765
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,440
type of then widens out and then widens to the big like beautiful like end of evan gellion

766
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:54,520
yeah like why did he start spinning because each stream is so strong it's it's just forcing him to

767
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,200
spin i guess we need to track this artist down and interview him get to the bottom of all

768
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:03,880
like the sixth panel the p-stream has become as big it's like giants oh my god the panel where

769
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,960
all the people are pointing up at the sky did you notice that there's a u turn sign that just says

770
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:17,560
no you every panel's so dense it's a rich tapestry right here what what caused this i why did this

771
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,600
happen to this man i don't know what began this cascaded ronavirus

772
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,360
once i made a thing i can't remember one guy i made a comic that really had to be

773
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,400
i mean this is like this is a classic i made a comic somewhere this is making me hungry

774
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:39,480
i need some chocolate this is like some fucking uh bloodborne shit i think this is what's

775
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,120
gonna happen at the end of bloodborne when the the celestials touchdown the elder gods have their

776
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,120
way with us uh what is the um what is the long blue line in the it's a river the panel right

777
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,400
oh that's just a river as we zoom out for larger and larger that's a that's a river yeah yeah we're

778
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:00,120
just getting the largest scope of the world i think oh that's we're looking from above down at the

779
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:06,040
ground yeah yeah oh it's cloud spiraling round i see yeah that makes sense what was like i made a

780
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,920
comic i linked it on the pcp like a years ago somebody in the comics linked it i'm sure somebody

781
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,320
knows where it is it was like the sun has sunglasses and like isn't impressed by your

782
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,000
problems at the end of it or something i don't know that was like the theme i had somebody

783
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,720
linked that i don't know wait you made that yeah i made it i made it like i wasn't inspired by this

784
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:29,320
specifically but like i just wanted to make like a shit posty like apocalypse style comic kind of

785
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,800
like this uh so sometimes you just hit with the spark i guess and then you make it real fast

786
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:40,680
well on that note uh speaking of the apocalypse this is just a random story i'll never get tired

787
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:46,200
this is absolutely wonderful how do we even get here i forget i don't know or care this comic

788
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,840
this is yeah you don't watch devil man uh don't watch end of evan gellion you just need this this

789
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,960
really gets to the core of the matter and it's great and it's great all right let's let's do our

790
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,840
voicemails we've got voicemails let's do it if you have a lot i just want to get it done there's like

791
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,360
seven or so i think oh this one is very appropriate for what we've just seen this is called uh good

792
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:15,480
pcp content uh of which i think we've just delivered all right well uh let's hear it up

793
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:20,840
take it away go i just want to say this is one of my favorite arcs of the pcp in a long time

794
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,400
because every week ben will talk about animal crossing and i'm like playing that game and every

795
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:31,320
week nate talks about final fantasy seven remake and i'm like playing that game as well i feel in

796
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,520
the loop of everything like back in like november when every week you guys were just talking about

797
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:43,400
pokemon it was it sucked because i play short and shield and it sucks and it was it was just every

798
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:49,560
week it's like oh man right pokemon sucks they could all have the pokemon which scissors um but

799
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:57,000
now it's like you know you love final fantasy seven but also you hate it and like the remake and

800
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,960
you know it's cool conversation and animal crossing is just a giant pure force of good um

801
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:13,240
yeah that's correct there you go all right oh that's it i mean sure uh the our instructions

802
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:18,680
i know yeah instructions are do thing that guy knows and it will be good content uh agreed

803
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:25,480
understood messed received all right next one is uh rad content rollout okay here's an informational

804
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:34,200
request uh take it away yo lads uh i just wanted to ask you guys uh what are the holdups for

805
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:41,240
further rad content coming out at the moment uh nate kind of hinted at this at stream uh all

806
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:46,360
my stream but it wasn't very clear uh he said he couldn't release the rad lecture because he was

807
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:52,680
waiting on the diss track but my question is like is that what's holding up everything else

808
01:14:53,320 --> 01:15:00,280
like is everything else being worked on because like it's just a little confusing like you guys

809
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:05,080
pumped out those you did really good you pumped out those lectures super fast you know but then

810
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:11,160
now we've been like stalling sitting on like these other two what is what is it two or three for

811
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,560
like a month how long is this going um i mean i just want to know what's up with that here and

812
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:20,440
like if the distract okay is what's holding everything back all right we get recorded yeah i get

813
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,440
he says stalling but it's like they're bigger projects they take long yeah i have okay well i'm

814
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:32,520
not i don't want to release the sonichu lecture until i finish the slime and punishment finale

815
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,880
which i have been stalling on and just putting off doing to do for other stuff uh so that's the

816
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,360
holdup on that uh lol this is the story of my fucking life i mean i've got so many projects

817
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:47,640
i want to do but i've got a first project i got to get done first but yeah let's just do it idiot

818
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,480
i'm just very curious about like which content exactly he

819
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:57,720
is waiting on because of the fact that like well yeah that's what you said is it there's the lectures

820
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:03,640
there's the brad carling house um yeah our distract distract and then there's the well there's the

821
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:08,200
distract in the lecture which are tied together the ova is obviously going to take some time and

822
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:15,000
the animation is a part of the ova uh the dojin admittedly i don't know if we've even started

823
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,840
like workshop i mean we're we're kind of not worried about that right now because we've got

824
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,760
lots of other stuff hold off on the dojin until the um the ova gets a little bit more yeah for

825
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,560
a lot further along i mean we need the character designs to do the dojin exactly which we're

826
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:33,240
working on which we're working on so we're making progress yeah the progress has been made on the

827
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:42,760
animated op for that so um be excited i guess indeed i guess good and then i mean i mean some of the

828
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,880
lectures you know whatever bed and munchie they got there we already talked about we already talked

829
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,200
about what's going on with digi's lecture and munchie's lecture yeah right right uh yeah we do

830
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:55,400
gotta make some progress on the distract uh we're being a little behind the curve on that one we

831
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:00,600
could uh we could move that one for itself what about what about all of the can tent that you filmed

832
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,360
well you know we did digi and i did make one can tent that uh is in production and i it will be

833
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,720
released but it's not quite ready and i'm just wait i mean i've just got other oh at least one

834
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:17,640
waiting till nate is done working on what he's working on before we relaunch canton yeah and

835
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,000
then we'll get back to it like yeah the the fact of the matter is canton got taken down and so it

836
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,400
was like okay well we're not going to worry about this channel until it's back and then by the time

837
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:33,400
it was back we had radcon four and then also having to pick up our own careers after radcon four

838
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,800
while doing radcon four editing which is generally what radcon does that's why we wanted all that

839
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:43,560
extra money to cushion us for the fact that you know yep it puts us in that position the good news

840
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,680
though i mean i'm very excited because can tent finally got to a point where like it's monetized

841
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:54,360
and we're getting like enough viewership now we will actually be making probably some profit

842
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:59,000
when we get back to making those videos so i can't fucking wait we had we had gotten monetization

843
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,320
we're already the videos were very profitable like the second they started making money because the

844
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:07,640
cpm is really good but it was just like we made like there was like one or two months and then

845
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,120
the thing got stolen we only had like a small window yeah but once we're back there i'm excited

846
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,160
or something like that but yeah yeah it's gonna be good it's gonna be good ton of potential and of

847
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:24,040
course if uh if nate is still moving on down to virginia beach then canton can be i mean like

848
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:29,400
basically for me it's hard to like the idea of the show is that it's going to be a show we do in

849
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:35,880
person so it's like yeah of course it's like almost to to do like a relaunch without it being like

850
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:41,160
okay we're relaunching so that we can get to the point where you're moving down then it's like

851
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,800
doing it before that point is kind of pointless like the show is not supposed to be a podcast

852
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:51,240
recorded online it's supposed to be recorded in person so like you know once we are ready to make

853
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,000
those kind of decisions that'll probably be when cancent is like fully ready to come back

854
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,920
which should be before too long yeah basically i've just been busy and me and digi need to

855
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,720
work out some details and we will do that we're both extreme both because we both bite off more

856
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,600
than we could chew and have too many different projects at the same time and uh and no matter

857
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,640
what you drop somebody will be pissed off so you can't just be like oh i'm just gonna not do this one

858
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:20,920
thing i said i do to do this other thing i said i do um that's true everybody wants you to do all

859
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:26,360
the things you said you were gonna do so yeah never promise anything never promise it's the only

860
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:34,520
safe way so wait so how how close are you digi to getting all those rants done you're still behind

861
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:40,040
the last time a lot left yeah i mean there's there's a lot of there's a lot of rants i have to do

862
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:45,480
where i already consumed the thing i have to rant i just didn't record the rant because i wanted to

863
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:50,280
do them all at once um sure there's plenty of them that i have i still have to like most of my

864
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,120
stuff i have to read which is a pain in the ass because it's a lot easier to just watch stuff

865
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:59,000
because i could just get high and watch it and not have to fucking read um sure thankfully i'm

866
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,720
changing the way all this works after i'm done with it but uh yeah there's a lot of catching up

867
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:09,560
to do good but it's it's like well okay there's all the projects i have on my plate are all big

868
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:15,000
they're all equally huge projects and like it's the same position i found myself in once before

869
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,400
and in order to to make it so that i don't disappear for two months to go do those big projects

870
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,400
i'm trying to figure out like what can i release that can come out that's not that hard to do

871
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,960
that will be satisfying so that's what the otaku ganzo journal is about i already wrote eight of

872
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:35,720
those so that's just fucking smooth sailing um while i go work on this other shit but yeah i'm

873
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:40,120
working on a lot of fucking big projects so it's going to be as usual with me all of them will

874
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,920
complete at the same time and so it'll go from like six months of people saying digi bro's not

875
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:51,160
doing anything he slowed down to all of a sudden wow digi bro put out six books and fucking 20 movies

876
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,840
and you know he's active again and it's like no i just finished everything i've been working on

877
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,120
you know oh and you know what i don't know i this seems like an interesting thing to mention just

878
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,680
while we're on the subject like the other day you made a tweet that was it was it was a joke but it

879
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:09,640
was something in the spirit of like um what like people are complaining about that i'm not classic

880
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:15,480
digi something along those lines um no it was that people have been saying that i've been losing my

881
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:22,200
mind for the last three years there's particularly this was addressed about my my uh not discord my

882
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:28,680
reddit because when i created the digi bro patreon discord all of my patrons went to the discord

883
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:34,760
and abandoned the reddit so the reddit is only occupied by people who are watching my videos

884
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:41,160
but are not patrons and most of them have a have a problem with me but it's weird because

885
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,360
they've been in there for years saying the same stuff like these are people who have been hanging

886
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:51,160
out in my subreddit and they're the only people there like it's just a bunch of people who are

887
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:56,280
like really sour and bitter about like the changes i've made to my content but like when

888
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:02,920
they talk about it the way that they perceive the content is is really fascinating you know

889
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:10,360
and and it just goes to show that they in their mind it's like i've changed because of the fact

890
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:16,360
that i'm doing these things before or doing these things now that they didn't know i was doing before

891
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:21,320
you know it's like this is the stuff that i used to post on moda soul productions or used to post

892
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:26,600
on after dark or used to post wherever but now it's on the main channel and like i think for those

893
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,680
people or even you know really i should say it started from when i started posting stuff on after

894
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,600
dark that wouldn't have been there before because even that was a more manicured channel up until

895
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:39,800
2017 when i decided to start putting stuff that would have been on personal channels there so

896
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,280
like from these people's perspective it's like oh digi rose losing his mind his content keeps

897
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:50,120
getting weirder it keeps getting his view counts are dropping and it's like well if you look at

898
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:55,720
2015 where i only put out four videos a month and one of them got a hundred thousand views and the

899
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:01,720
other three all got less than 10 000 and you compare that to now where i put out 30 videos in a month

900
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:06,120
and one of them gets a hundred thousand views and the rest have less than 10 000 which one do you

901
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,520
think benefits me more and makes me more buddy it's the second one you know like putting out more

902
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:17,080
content has only benefited me it's just that it it changes the way that it looks it changes it from

903
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:22,520
looking like oh this is a guy who bats a hundred every video he puts out to like this is a guy who

904
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,520
puts out whatever he wants and when he feels like he needs to you know make some money he goes and

905
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:33,320
makes some content that he thinks he's gonna make some money you know um but like that's a decision

906
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:38,600
that i make and like you can turn that valve on and off because i don't i don't always i'm not

907
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,720
always in a position where i need to be busting my ass and growing in order to survive you know

908
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,800
like i can take my time and think about what i want to do and do something that's emotionally

909
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:55,640
satisfying uh because i have that that extra leverage of you know of of my career but like

910
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:01,160
it's it's been a very difficult balancing act and the whole time it's been dysfunctional like it's

911
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:05,480
never been perfect i say a difficult balancing act because i've never been balanced you know i've

912
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:11,240
been imbalanced if you couldn't tell this whole time so you know still trying to find that balance

913
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:17,640
but finding that requires going through the process of exploring everything that you think

914
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,600
might lead you to get closer to there you know and i do that in a public way because i have to put

915
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:29,240
out content all the time like a lot of this content might be stuff that you know if i didn't have to

916
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:33,720
put out a video all the time i would only release a video once a month when it was a fully considered

917
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,760
well thought out idea you know but like um and there are some people who succeed with stuff

918
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,960
like that so it's not that i couldn't do that it's not my style you know it's just like it's

919
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:51,400
just funny to me that from my perspective it's like i haven't changed what i'm doing i've just

920
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:57,320
made it more clear what i was trying to do you know the whole time it's like my intentions have

921
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:02,120
become clearer and therefore people who thought that they could relate to me because they thought

922
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:08,280
i was somebody else are now upset because i'm not like them you know i'm not or i'm not who they

923
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:14,760
wanted me to be you know it's like to some degree i think i understand the the counter position uh

924
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,200
and and i can articulate so when when you put out the tweet i responded to you uh privately

925
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,360
in a way that i thought would represent what i thought at the time you didn't really you weren't

926
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,040
seeing the other side of the argument and we had i don't know we had like a little bit of a long

927
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:33,560
back and forth um where i i tried to present it where i said that like basically yeah the way

928
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:39,000
that you've articulated here is pretty accurate it's that like your main channel has not had a lot

929
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,200
of like the kind of classic digi content which which specifically i would think is is basically like

930
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,400
scripted content and actually the video you put out two days ago the fear of continuing a show

931
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:55,480
that right there that hit that like ah this is the kind of classic digi flavor well and that's

932
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:01,560
that's what i've been looking for but so to put it like in in terms of like my chart again like to

933
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:07,000
because this is how i it's easier for me to understand it it's like uh it was very difficult

934
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:14,200
for me to create a style that represents what i am trying to do with my videos in a way where the

935
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:20,200
audience will feel the same way about it that i want them to you know it's like so so long so

936
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:25,400
many of my videos the problems people have with them are lexical problems it's like you you said

937
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,880
something wrong you had wrong information or you came at like you didn't watch the whole show this

938
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,520
or that and it's like how do i make these people understand that i'm not trying to be a critic

939
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,200
like how do i make them understand that this channel is not being about fair and balance it's

940
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,760
not being about it's not about being objective because i don't believe in that and it's like

941
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,960
i think the problem is that in my mind because of the fact that i don't believe in objectivity

942
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,720
to me it's just obvious that like whatever data i'm presenting is not hard data because in my

943
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:58,520
mind there basically is no hard data people don't think that way though and so if you present your

944
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,240
video in a way where it feels like it's data driven it feels like it's meant to be informative

945
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:08,200
people are going to look at it as attempting to be an informative video and i did not know

946
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:14,360
how to make that feeling go away while still writing the same way i do which is to use lots of

947
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:20,120
information to make an emotional point basically and so that's what the otogonzo tapes is about

948
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:27,160
it's like this is the the each of these videos is using stuff i know about anime but the point it's

949
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,360
making is an emotional point it's not this show is good this show is bad i think i understand you

950
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:38,600
know i understand your point there but i think that my analysis of the situation is much simpler

951
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,160
which is that you're a guy i like listening to and i have for many years and and i find your

952
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:50,040
takes interesting frankly speaking just the fact that this was a scripted video that inherently

953
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:56,280
gives that kind of cadence that alone yeah i understand why that matters for you you're

954
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:00,680
you're completely spot on of what what my intention was here because the the idea of

955
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:05,960
otogonzo tapes is for quadrant appeal i'm going through the same thing right now as well so i

956
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:10,360
certainly i think i have some insight the the idea of it is just simply like i looked at it and i

957
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:16,920
said what is like how do you appeal to everybody on my on my neuro typing chart right like if you

958
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:22,600
want to people just because somebody is a more lexical thinker doesn't mean they want lexical

959
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,560
content they want if if the content presents itself that way they want it to be perfectly

960
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,800
accurate if it doesn't present themselves yeah itself that way they don't care so like how do

961
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:37,080
i make the video appeal to those people because my audience comes to me because of the fact that i

962
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:43,560
i do have information i do have insight but like yeah what i use that insight for is not to make

963
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,040
objective statements is to help you deal with emotions like my channel is mostly emotionally

964
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:53,320
driven it's mostly about like trying to understand what emotions a show is trying to fill you with

965
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:59,240
or like what message it's trying to send you know so like by focusing on that and presenting it as

966
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:04,760
like okay if this video is really like rough and rugged if it looks like it was filmed in a bedroom

967
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:10,760
on a vhs tape like it looks like a home video and it doesn't start off like it like the tone of it

968
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:17,160
just feels so raw and personal and emotional in spite of the fact that i'm mostly talking about

969
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:21,320
data you know but the data is there to make the point so it's like it appeals to people on both

970
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,560
ends of the spectrum both emotional and logical and it doesn't have nobody has to get hung up on

971
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:30,440
anything nobody has to be like oh i don't get where he's going with this or like you know nobody's

972
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:35,640
gonna miss the point because the point is so blindingly obvious in every aspect of the creation

973
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:41,320
you know and so like that's what i've been looking for is how do i make a video that's easy to make

974
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:49,160
and also true to myself and also not confusing you know and i don't think it's a confusing video

975
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:55,080
i hope i i thought found it pretty narratively coherent yeah but if i i mean in general i mean

976
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:59,960
i think we're on the same point here if i could if i could make one recommendation for your channel

977
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:05,240
i i your desire to i think there is a certain logic in the way things were split up before

978
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,640
where your your more polished work would go on the main channel because i don't think there's

979
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:14,120
anything wrong with in theory someone having a specific channel with a specific purpose

980
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:18,200
to attract a specific kind of audience i don't find that inauthentic i think that's a totally

981
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:21,960
legitimate way and then you have another channel where the stuff that's fine it's taking the approach

982
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,760
of just putting everything on one channel also makes sense however that just makes people sometimes

983
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,760
feel that they're missing some elements because it can get over flooded it's harder description would

984
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:37,000
be more scripted content because i just there's a thirst for that i think just more not all not

985
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,280
even most but more would be satisfying for the audience i think i mean ideally for me all of

986
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:47,880
my content would be scripted like the reason that this i guess the reason i'm positing this is like

987
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:53,560
such a breakthrough is that you notice that was a scripted video with no editing it was just

988
01:30:54,360 --> 01:31:00,600
one take it was one shot one camera take it took no time to create because it relied on the idea

989
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:05,480
basically like when i i think nate you probably are somebody who when you write a script you already

990
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:11,400
have in mind everything that is going to visually or audially appear like in relationship that is

991
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:17,000
how i kind of create them yeah i am not like that i write the script and i have like maybe five

992
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,400
images in my head of like scenes from the show or the thing i'm talking about that are like

993
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:27,320
like where there's a sentence that i wrote this sentence because i had this scene in mind but

994
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:32,760
there's literally like five of them so for me everything in between those images is just filler

995
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:37,960
like most of my videos comprise of just lazy filler where i just cut you know 10 second clips

996
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,680
together out of the first episode of a show to fill as much time as possible it is not exciting to

997
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:47,800
watch you know but it fills time and it serves attention well enough for you to finish the

998
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,280
video but it's not memorable those videos are hard to rewatch or sit through again i want my

999
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:58,360
videos to be something that in spite of the fact that it only took me 30 minutes to make it was

1000
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:03,000
memorable it made the point all the visuals contributed to both the emotions and the logic

1001
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,000
of the video you know that's the ideal so sure and like you know once i had this it was just it

1002
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,560
was kind of funny that you you sent me those messages and i i agree with your sentiment but

1003
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,400
i was already like ahead i was already in that mindset like i already wrote eight of these videos

1004
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:24,840
you know like i'm already ready to bring scripted content back it's just like a question of how can

1005
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:31,240
i write a script and not have to spend 10 hours editing the fucking video you know for a perfectly

1006
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:38,200
understandable yeah and still be exciting so that's what i might well i mean just some thoughts from

1007
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:43,480
an observer and a fan and a friend um and that's true the same thing with like fune boray and uh

1008
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,920
and 404 tales i just uh hope to be useful and i would happily welcome any any pointers about me

1009
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,480
as i as i try to i know this all makes me think though there's all these things that other people

1010
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:59,240
think about their content that i i feel like i am just blind to because of my particular perspective

1011
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:04,200
and i want to avoid that i feel like there's very obvious things like i don't know ghost the shell

1012
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,200
like big and a fucking best anime ever stuff just didn't come out for years that strikes me as just

1013
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,760
a blind spot things i should have been doing all along and then i just let details get in the way

1014
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:17,880
of why why that has happened well it's just missing the forest for the trees which is very easy to do

1015
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:25,800
if you're a detail-oriented thinker you know very true very true okay well that all said hopefully

1016
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,920
people enjoyed uh hearing some of those thoughts we do have more voicemails such as oh my god i'm

1017
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:37,480
excited for this one okay this one is called uh is e pal simp okay listen listen to this lads

1018
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:46,440
i found this strange website called e pal dot gg and uh it's like you buy like a session with

1019
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:53,960
someone to play video games with you and uh it's mostly girls but there are dudes and like is that

1020
01:33:53,960 --> 01:34:01,720
simping is it because it's like it's one person and uh you're not paying for like uh explicit

1021
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,600
like content like you know pornography or something it's just you're playing a video game with them

1022
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:15,000
it's got they got like you know like overwatch you know there's people and they're like and

1023
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,600
they even got like little voice clips to preview them but you're like hey indeed i'm absolutely

1024
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:29,000
simping 100 percent simping let's uh okay we get the idea disconnect now okay is it is it simping

1025
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,920
i mean sort of is it because it's sad you should just have friends that you can hopefully do this

1026
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:40,200
with play a game with you for like a dollar that's right that's right okay but but i found a true

1027
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:46,680
hero i don't know if you guys have gone to the website is it asian andy asian 25 bucks asian andy

1028
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:51,880
25 dollars per game he has a platinum in league of legends was by the way there's some diamond and

1029
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:57,160
challenger people that's not even that impressive they have tags like sweet voice silly friendly

1030
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:01,720
no flame or toxicity easy to get along with i think i just figured out nice with a little spice

1031
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:07,880
i think i just figured out how to define a simp you know what a simp is a simp is somebody who

1032
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:14,120
who willingly puts himself in a relationship in which they have they do not have any control

1033
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:19,240
or could not make any of it wait a minute wait a minute i'm thinking now is this about maybe this

1034
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:23,880
isn't necessarily about being a simp maybe it's about like raising your like win ratio because

1035
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:29,240
you play with someone who's really good i mean i think that might be part of that actually that

1036
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,640
actually is not a bad idea i mean if you're playing with a guy who's challenger you're gonna

1037
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:37,240
do better if you're playing with someone who's platinum or diamond like your team's more likely

1038
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:43,880
to win i still think the optics are just terrible that you had to go to this website true but i could

1039
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:51,080
understand but if that's not simping though dude they call roblox mobile if that oh fuck yeah

1040
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:56,920
dude you could play roblox with asian andy in the gang if that's your motivation like i would argue

1041
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,760
that isn't simming is all about what's going on in your mind you know that's really what it's about

1042
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,400
so would that be something no if you're doing it to have any contact with a girl because i because

1043
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:11,640
i think that a key part of simping is that like if you could get around it you wouldn't do this

1044
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:17,640
you're doing it because it's like your last option it's your only way to and no one no one should

1045
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:22,760
operate their life and they're doing like the last case scenario if it can be avoided but by the way

1046
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,840
listen i i did a little digging i did a little preparing here because i want you guys to hear

1047
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:31,720
all right i prepared the voice clip of the legendary asian andy i want you all at home

1048
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:38,280
to hear the the dulcet tones of this man this is how he sells you 25 dollars per game with platinum

1049
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:45,240
asian andy in league of legends here we go this is his pitch go yo what up um i'm just gonna try

1050
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:56,920
my hardest i don't know cool that's it that's all he says oh that is he was at the top he was at

1051
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:03,400
his number two best seller he's number two on the charts people okay this is really funny do you

1052
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:10,280
i love it i love him is it only like one time payments or can you subscribe to somebody you

1053
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:15,320
know i'm not sure how the business model works i really think that and this is why i'm trying to

1054
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:21,160
like find a way to kind of escape from patreon to a degree not that i want to shut down my patreon

1055
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:27,960
but i want to make it for specifically the otaganzo tapes as a show instead of being okay sure and

1056
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:34,840
because i see a huge problem in selling yourself as a product because you by the way did you i

1057
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,480
totally agree with you can we just observe this uh this rainbow dash next to asian andy in this in

1058
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:44,200
this main uh just absolutely beautiful absolutely wonderful okay he's he's a king it's like when

1059
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:49,800
you make a transaction with somebody right like each of you has to like make the decision to make

1060
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,560
this transaction about this thing like you understand what the product is to whatever

1061
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:59,320
degree you've you know interrogated about it and they want your money you make the trade

1062
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,320
it's done you know if there's hard feelings afterwards take it to fucking court you should

1063
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:08,920
have done your research right but like right on patreon it's like you pay me every month to do i

1064
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:14,760
don't know like stuff it's very vague and like different people will be disappointed by different

1065
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,040
things and i'm kind of swayed by their influence they're kind of swayed by you know and it just

1066
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:25,560
it's such a weird relationship and it's exactly what we all feared patreon would be like when we

1067
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:30,440
got on it in the first place i think sure sure uh which is why like i think you're still per video

1068
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:36,120
aren't you or did you ever go monthly um oh sorry that cut off could you say that are you still per

1069
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:41,320
video or are you monthly no i switched to monthly a while back okay because like per video we were

1070
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:46,200
all doing that because we were afraid of this exact thing of like i want people to understand

1071
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:51,400
what the product is you know and it's hard to do that with patreon and i think that's what i think

1072
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:58,040
that simping in general tends to be the result of subscription of like committing to a relationship

1073
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:04,280
with somebody who you do not have a relationship with you know right like oh i'm going to pay you

1074
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:10,120
ten dollars every month because you're hot and i'm gonna watch your streams but like you don't

1075
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:15,000
really know what you're getting you're not there's no real product it's just like i mean there might

1076
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,240
be a guarantee of a certain number of streams or a certain number of photos you'll be provided with

1077
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:24,440
but like will they all be of equal quality will you get the same emotional reaction there's so

1078
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:30,760
much up in the air and it comes down to just this very strange relationship where like these people's

1079
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:36,920
feelings get really tied up in it you know and like simping is extremely emotionally damaging

1080
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:42,680
it just not a good thing uh so you know stopped i totally sympathize with your point how does

1081
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:51,000
it make so much money twenty five dollars a game i think he's 301 people not bad i think it's because

1082
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,960
he's uh like a uh a known stream that's what i'm wondering like this guy must be known outside

1083
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:01,160
the side right he's gotta be i would think i think it says on his thing it was bio like streamer or

1084
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:05,800
something okay it's the only way it makes sense makes sense so like he that they go to him because

1085
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,800
he'll help them win the game he's charging more than these other guys though i mean jesus he's the

1086
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:16,040
most expensive he must have a kind of love his pitch i'm looking at these other pages and um notable

1087
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:20,520
but league of legends probably this is like sprung around league of legends and this is why that is

1088
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:25,880
the top billing yeah that's why asian andy's up there's like like it's playing with good players

1089
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:32,200
is important yeah um all of these other ones the best seller category is entirely women of course

1090
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:36,680
of course we can play animal crossing it just shows you what's really going on you know they have

1091
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:43,400
animal crossing there animal crossing great yeah there it is there it is hey but by the way though

1092
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:50,840
to digi's point you know uh my uh about the patreon thing my look my ideal patron is like a i don't

1093
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:59,800
know maybe he's like a a 25 year old man maybe i don't know 26 27 with a job and like likes my content

1094
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:04,840
but spends very little time worried about it and then is just happy when a video comes out

1095
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:11,000
but is not spending tons of time like concerned or like thinking about and his investment is low

1096
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,440
you just want to imagine everyone who watches you is like the coolest person they could buy my

1097
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,360
ideal really what i'm trying to describe what i'm trying to describe is someone who's not overly

1098
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:29,240
my ideal patron is you to sublimate listener yeah you're it yes you you can do it uh yeah i mean

1099
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:35,160
my ideal patron just somebody who's card clears at the end of the month

1100
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,840
that's just a warm body yeah that's fair i'll take cold buddies i don't give a

1101
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:42,600
shit i don't know that almost sounds a little bit like i'm trying to wiggle out of responsibility

1102
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:47,720
but my my favorite patrons are always the ones that give me like 20 dollars and then their rant

1103
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:52,680
request is like i don't know i just give you money so do rant about whatever you want sick sure

1104
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:57,960
dude sure that's good that's truly king or even the ones who just don't request anything and just

1105
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:02,120
they're like i don't even care i don't want any of this extra shit i could barely watch your content

1106
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:10,520

1109
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:29,880
about it you can be a dick about it yeah yeah there is such a thing as an annoying patron that uh

1110
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:34,120
that uh i don't think i have any we get i don't think i have any of those at the moment it's pretty

1111
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:39,240
sweet i don't have any either all right well anyway we'll rush to clarify patreon yeah not you

1112
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:47,000
no no you're fine no not you not you of course if you're thinking i hope he's not talking about me

1113
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,680
it's not you it's you if you're having that thought it's definitely you oh shit he's definitely talking

1114
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:58,920
about me i don't know 100 there was nobody i was talking about so it could possibly be you

1115
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:03,880
why would you have that thought if it weren't you it's you right i do this thing a lot where

1116
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:08,680
i speak in hypotheticals and it digs me into holes because i just sound like i'm you know saying

1117
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:14,360
horrible things but uh legitimately uh no no i mean there are people who hang around my community

1118
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:20,360
and aren't patrons and are annoying those people definitely exist but as far as i know no patrons

1119
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:26,040
are annoying you know you can make it so only people with roles can see your discord so therefore

1120
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,800
oh i mean that's true i don't even necessarily mean in discord like on streams or i don't know

1121
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:35,320
comments i mean those people exist obviously but you know and if you're thinking that's you it's you

1122
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:40,120
all right anyway let's go to our next voicemail okay we got patreon.com slash give and take give

1123
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:45,720
and take dot side for a non-judgmental patron experience uh you will get the things that i

1124
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:52,120
promise in the patreon fair fair all right here we go uh soundcloud uh what i'm saying

1125
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:55,640
fucking the next next voicemail oh by the way speak pipe link leave his voicemails description

1126
01:43:55,640 --> 01:44:00,440
there you go this is a buster one nandesca let's find out go

1127
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:13,880
matao pcp it is i eroge samura today i want to teach you the english word buster

1128
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,120
please

1129
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,000
you know that is a good uh just dose of reality because we kind of were just speculating what

1130
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,600
does buster mean it like it has a definition it kind of works you got a gun buster it's got a gun

1131
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:52,920
it busts the aliens well wait he just said he just said yeah it doesn't you don't bust the guns

1132
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:59,080
and you do bust the crime so like what's going on it's not the same god the the words can be is

1133
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:05,000
there outwardly two words like with the exact same spelling meaning the exact same thing but

1134
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,920
they're two distinct words impossible i'm thinking maybe criminal okay well beyond that we have a

1135
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:18,360
follow-up sort of this is a little voicemail called fuck die buster old good new bag okay take it away

1136
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:23,960
go die buster is a shit show and you're all wrong it could have been a great original show but instead

1137
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,760
they decided to make a shitty sequel the key to the striking plot and themes and gun busters

1138
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:33,320
space and time and how these properties affect the characters and their relationships keeps

1139
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:38,200
building upon this theme until the end of the show when noriko and kawasaki are are sure that

1140
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:43,880
they're going to have been forgotten 12 000 years later in the future and at least that amazing fucking

1141
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:51,560
ending that nothing could top uh all this shit not in die buster i have no idea where the characters

1142
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:56,440
are what they were doing and why they were doing it warp technology was somehow banned i think in the

1143
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:03,160
show uh but the characters can still be wherever they want to be it makes a bullshit science fiction

1144
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:11,080
terms where everything in gun buster which was sick as shit also die buster had more budget but

1145
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:16,520
somehow looked worse than gun buster last episode of gun buster wasn't finished or in color and was

1146
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:22,280
still more visually compelling than anything die buster had to offer okay it was fun hold on okay

1147
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:28,040
we got this guy i hate this guy we have to address this thing i get i get that i get i'm sorry i'm

1148
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:32,360
sorry it didn't have the time dilation thing i'm i get it it's really cool i know you really like

1149
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:36,680
but it doesn't make it a bad show because it doesn't have the fucking time dilation shit we have

1150
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:41,560
to address this fucking thing that comes up where people try to like talk about the last episode

1151
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:48,600
being in black and white and that this was somehow a cost cutting measure which is the opposite of

1152
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:53,640
true that's not true it in fact i think costed more money because they had to like shoot in a

1153
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:58,280
different way than i looked into this yeah you're right and yeah i mean like well just even think

1154
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:02,520
about it they had to paint all the fucking grays it's not like they just yep like why would color

1155
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,840
be more expensive than gray i don't understand i thought it might have been it's all paint it all

1156
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:13,080
cost the fucking same it's at least the same possibly more uh yeah it was a stylistic choice on

1157
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:19,560
purpose so that that that's out the window uh well i mean this guy i don't know it was this

1158
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:25,800
point that like he does like that about the original about gun buster gun buster was not even finished

1159
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:29,480
and it still looked better than die buster which is oh well it actually was and he was

1160
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:34,360
trying to say that die buster had like a way higher budget it probably had a higher budget

1161
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:39,560
but i'm sure it had a higher budget completely different in in my opinion die buster looks better

1162
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:44,120
i mean die buster was like i agree most cutting edge looking show of its time like it was like one

1163
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:50,440
of the first yeah like digital anime that looked amazing like it looks so good to this i get okay

1164
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:54,840
you know i get a maybe you don't like the cg on the robots and i'll give you it looks a little

1165
01:47:54,920 --> 01:48:01,240
awkward sometimes but i don't i don't care i sense that this man just loves the like the

1166
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:06,360
theming and the styling of the original which is more grounded in reality uh like okay i totally

1167
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:11,160
respect that you would prefer this the narrative of the original and stuff but he's just making

1168
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:15,880
shit up like how the characters just move around too fast as ben said remember how noriko's like

1169
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:21,320
giant arc on what's that episode five where she unlocks her fucking power to get that to teleport

1170
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:26,280
she's she's gone for a while because she has to go to the edge of the solar system to get that

1171
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:33,160
you know to supposedly get that uh buster machine which is okay and whatever man you like a style

1172
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:38,360
more that's fine as fucking dumb you know the fuck you like it's like a shitty sequel because it

1173
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:42,600
doesn't stick to the theme get the hell out of here it is a unique story it's got different like

1174
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:48,200
you get like one more voice jail voice jail voice jail voice yeah this man's going to voice jail

1175
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,440
yeah it's just for a stupid ass take you know talk shit about die buster around here

1176
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:58,360
his name is was fuck die buster he's going straight to jail there you go no i don't think so

1177
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:04,440
fuck die buster obliterate it fuck you i won't fucking have any of his and it's just the only

1178
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:09,160
other thing is just it's just that like yes it doesn't touch the themes but like the ending

1179
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:15,880
like honors the themes of the original and in no way does it like fuck with the original in any

1180
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:21,800
way it just adds good stuff i guess i guess he thinks opinion okay i mean like this the sci-fi

1181
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:27,400
stuff is like messy maybe you think that like oh like all the science in in die buster is like

1182
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:33,000
it's all like weird like fantasy science oh yeah like gun busters fucking uh like the actions this

1183
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,320
robot does in space would like what is that thing where it electrifies with those weird

1184
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:43,160
things on either side like the sci-fi of what gun buster did specifically was real to begin with

1185
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:49,960
i mean it's obviously not stupid gun buster is cleared more harder it's harder sci-fi it's more

1186
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:54,120
it's more grounded for sure i don't know it seems to me like that's the point like it's the far

1187
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:58,600
future and like the technology has advanced all these crazy ways but also they've locked off all

1188
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,680
these technologies in some ways the world of gun buster is more advanced because they use warp

1189
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:09,000
technology i don't think they um that's true yeah did they um like i don't think they ever do like

1190
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:15,400
light speed travel in die buster although i don't think they do they must because like i mean well

1191
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:20,040
no no does but no no figures how long did it yeah yeah but like before that how long did it take

1192
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:24,680
her to get to pluto it was like an episode where she was like shipped off or something she was it

1193
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:29,320
was like a couple weeks i think right you know what because that would tell us if it was faster

1194
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:36,840
than light if we knew how well the distance to pluto in light years is um well it's three point

1195
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:46,680
well it's three billion miles okay three billion miles in light years is oh yeah okay it's point

1196
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:52,680
zero zero zero five okay that's not light speed and she's not going light speed to get there so

1197
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:58,760
i mean she's going really fucking fast but like a fraction of light speed like a small

1198
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,440
for maybe like a tenth of it or something there might have been a little bit of dilation

1199
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:07,960
um yeah okay all right how much is that is that one gunlation is that one two thousandth

1200
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:14,440
of a no wait if it could be a person i guess it would be that's like that's like one two

1201
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:18,760
thousandth of a of a light year okay so there's nothing where do the uh nothing okay question

1202
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:24,120
where are the guys going in gun buster when they travel and experience dilation like in the episode

1203
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:29,640
like three they go to like the center of the galaxy in that's really far away that's in gun buster

1204
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:36,120
in gun buster they travel like all throughout the galaxy in die buster they only go inside the solar

1205
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:42,120
system yeah because the um the red the like drones like are like they won't they're protecting the

1206
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:47,640
solar they won't let them leave the solar system and warp technology has been locked away well there

1207
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:53,080
you go we have just confirmed basically that die buster does not fuck with the sci-fi in those

1208
01:51:53,160 --> 01:52:00,120
important ways sorry sorry you wanted more time dilation i get it but i get it but it's just go

1209
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:04,840
to jail it did everything it could do with time dilation in gun buster it pushed it to the limit

1210
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:10,600
which is why it's good you wouldn't even want to show to try to do more time dilation stuff it did

1211
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:16,520
the best job ever so let's do some imagine if if gurren legan two came out and they just said uh

1212
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:21,560
we're going to be the size of two universes this time yeah i'd kill myself i would end it right

1213
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:28,120
then and there uh yes yes so there you go oh but we found like a new energy source that is even worse

1214
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:33,640
for the spiral nemesis that's the fly roll the by roll yeah with a big b emoji at the front the

1215
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:40,040
viral energy oh i hate that double um all right anyway now that he's in jail and we'll never

1216
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:45,000
hear from fuck die buster again we can move along with our lives the menace has been stopped

1217
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:50,920
huh oh here we go okay this is um how many more we got two more only two more and it is

1218
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:58,040
art so fuck so's wuxo duck so uh has something to say let's uh let's give him a chance go

1219
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:03,880
i recently picked up drawing with the mindset to improve after several years of casually doodling

1220
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:08,120
i've made progress since starting and i recently changed my head shape to be more stylistic and

1221
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:12,840
i quite like drawing that way the issue is that i can only draw half decent body when it's done

1222
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,560
realistically which completely clashes with the style i'm aiming for any advice on how to

1223
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:26,280
overcome this dilemma would be appreciated i don't understand he can only draw body he can only draw

1224
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:31,720
bodies realistically but i think he's gonna get a problem with realistic no he can only draw the

1225
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:37,560
body realistically but the head that he has developed is more like stylized and so he's trying

1226
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:42,520
to figure out how to reconcile these two things i mean you gotta just keep you're just gonna have

1227
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:47,320
to practice realistically yeah it's just practice you're just gonna have to experiment with uh body

1228
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:52,040
shapes that you are good at drawing the reason you can only draw bodies realistically is because

1229
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:57,880
you don't fully understand anatomy yet once you understand anatomy yeah changes to it maybe if

1230
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:03,480
there is anybody whose art style is like similar to what you have done with the face see what they've

1231
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:09,080
done for bodies and see if there's like a an answer you know that's been been arrived at so far

1232
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:15,160
oh but then they're gonna say you remind me of Naruto with your body shape and just wear it

1233
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:20,280
probably be like yeah this guy was like yeah i'm developing my style it's like this there's seven

1234
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:27,960
billion fucking people out there most of us are fairly similar in most ways why would you even

1235
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:33,320
think you were gonna make something unique enough to be noteworthy to like like i mean it's so

1236
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:37,400
frustrating to me because like the the artists who are like oh don't compare me to other artists

1237
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,920
it's like bitch have you like spent any time looking at art like there is no art i wouldn't

1238
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:47,960
compare to another piece of art there is no fucking such thing as one i'm not going to do that too

1239
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:53,160
it's a pretty immature like mindset to be like i i don't want to be compared to anyone else like

1240
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:59,960
like that's an insult if if you want art tutorials and you're just starting out and

1241
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:06,600
you like people who are cool this guy is very very cool which like five seconds of this video

1242
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:11,720
and you'll understand that he's the only smart you art tutorial person in the world it's a very nice

1243
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:17,400
spider-man it's a good peter parker oh i've seen this guy once or twice the only two mistakes you're

1244
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:23,080
making what's well there's a gunbuster game for ps2 the way he delivers the information is like the

1245
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:28,280
least boring and therefore the coolest and the best way to do art i don't like his go actually

1246
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:32,280
listening i'll have to check it out that's i don't i will not watch this man because he has a goatee

1247
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:39,400
but he has a butcher's knife he he puts he puts his microphone on a knife and he speaks into it

1248
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:46,440
that's true you're not wrong about that it's pretty killer it's america i i just clicked

1249
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:51,400
on youtube and i was watching american flag aviators you know this guy is with me on team joe

1250
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:59,000
dude fucking oh yeah no doubt i'm watching this fucking ps2 get the point yeah go on go on yeah

1251
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:03,400
say that yeah the point is that he's like a professional artist and his advice is really

1252
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:08,600
good and he's also a really good youtuber and i like him sick so he's got two microphones one

1253
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:13,560
clipped to a butcher's knife and then one that's just a microphone i i've seen this guy around but

1254
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:18,520
yeah he does a lot of experimental stuff i don't know why i'm so mad at him click play on this

1255
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:24,520
ps2 gun buster game gameplay to watch intense noriko sweeping action as she pushes a broom

1256
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:29,880
around the fucking sports field i assume this is the end we see coach appearing on the top left

1257
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:36,280
presumably to give her anime hype speeches as she does this this looks epic and i love it uh this

1258
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:42,280
is made for the ps2 we gotta play this so this is made like decades after the original uh fascinating

1259
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:47,480
this is delightful i kind of want to explore this uh okay but anyway i wonder if we've got one more

1260
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:53,000
voice for the game or the capture card that is just like the frame rate is dog shit yeah i'm gonna

1261
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,760
guess it's like emulating it i think so probably capture yeah okay one last voicemail and this one

1262
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:06,920
is from uh oh it's simply called azumi is based you know uh tom mo i just wanted to say that

1263
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:16,360
azumi is very based i absolutely love azumi uh it just looks so cool i don't know if it's a girl

1264
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:25,320
or a dude but like i wish i could play the game but my computer doesn't have internet right now so

1265
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:31,400
i can't really how did you say this um maybe a mobile port would be cool but that would probably

1266
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:37,080
take a lot of work so uh what the fuck i don't know man this is pretty cool it's based

1267
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:45,160
voice jail voice jail voice no i don't know i appreciate it what's wrong with that he got his

1268
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:52,840
point across just fine i am but isn't it just a suggestion for the the man who wants to play on

1269
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:59,240
mobile yeah just bluetooth game pad the demo has game pad support if you can hook up a game pad bluetooth

1270
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:05,400
to your phone you can play it on your phone oh hey what the fuck do you know cool wait does

1271
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:10,280
actually run on your phone then wait the game is on web app it's a web app right the game's on

1272
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:15,560
new grounds right yeah it's on new grounds oh yeah it's on game jolt yeah right okay any of those

1273
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:19,080
any of those there you go boom i was thinking like wait was there another release that i didn't play

1274
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:26,840
yet i mean i updated it a couple like before ride con on new grounds yeah with like some

1275
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:33,160
combos and better hits done can you continually update your like that link on new grounds with the

1276
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:40,600
oh cool cool okay i was wondering is it me or were all these voicemails from the same guy some i

1277
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:46,040
think i think this one and the good pcp content were from the same guy i think all the others were

1278
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:51,720
from different people soundly like paradox now i don't like maybe it was no that's not paradox

1279
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:58,520
what if you put one voicemail from a person in voice jail and the other one from the same guy in

1280
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:04,280
voice grail does he get split is he like the emperor from final fantasy two who is his good

1281
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:11,000
aspects are put into heaven and his bad ones went to hell and took over yes uh yes okay good

1282
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,120

that's about like the homunculus that lives within like the brain and that's like just what people

1307
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:40,360
used to think oh really yeah well then what gave that guy his ability to think uh another

1308
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:45,800
homunculus inside his brain and on and on it goes yeah he's just jellyfish piloting jellyfish

1309
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:52,040
piloting jellyfish all the way down i love it we have a word for that Nate it's called the ghost

1310
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:57,480
in the shell uh i mean that's true okay but but what gives the ghost its consciousness is my

1311
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:01,880
