The Pro Crastinators Podcast is a non-commercial podcast that is based on a non-commercial topic.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That goddamn vape. I had that vape for four days and I broke it.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It has a cap that you're supposed to be able to screw off, but for whatever reason the screw off cap was super tight.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I couldn't get it off. And in my attempt to get it off I broke the glass that contains the fluid.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And none of the vape stores in town had replacement glass, so I had to order it online for the specific model of vape that I have.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So now I'm smoking again until my glass comes in for the vape, which of course the only place that sold it was only standard shipping at a three to four weeks rate.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know, it's like it's not coming till December.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So yeah, bought a vape, broke it immediately, even though I was loving it.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was totally in love with this vape and I managed to break it so quickly, just trying to get this fucking cap off.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Anyways, so this past week I've been doing practically nothing but reading comics.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've been talking about comics at the end of each of these decompression chambers briefly.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And of course this was all inspired by Jesse having his panel cast, which I don't know if episode three of that will be out by the time this comes out,

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but I did a little guest spot on it towards the very end where we talked about the new issue of Gwenpool since that's sort of what started this whole thing.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And rather than talk about the specific comics I've been reading, I want to talk about why this is happening.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why am I so into comics right now?

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And you know, I've always had an interest in different mediums besides anime.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Obviously I take a lot of interest in film, TV shows, comic books, music, which I am pretty diehard into.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'd say I know quite a lot about music.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just every form of art essentially I have some interest in, especially the mediums that really get discussed and the stuff that people analyze and talk about and cherish and collect, all that kind of stuff.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And with comics I talked about sort of how I got an in with comics in the last podcast, like how I sort of figured out what they're like and that made it easier to start reading them.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But as for why I'm so intensely into it right now, it's that as an anime fan, I've kind of talked about in the last podcast so I feel like I'm reaching the end of anime.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like that I've watched so much of the good stuff and there's only so much of it left.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There's only so much left that I need to consume before I can kind of move on from anime.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I mean, I'll still be watching it forever and there'll always be new stuff coming out.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But for instance, this year, 2016, in fact let's just take the first half of this year, because I have completed everything I intended to from the first half of this year.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I watched all the winter and all of the summer shows with a couple of exceptions in the process of my Finish or Fail series.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And not one thing that I watched, did I score a 9 out of 10 or above.

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Not one single thing that came out in the first half of this year was that amazing that I would give it a 9 or above.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I mean, it's not so much that this is a complaint about this being a week year, which I haven't even watched any of the summer or fall shows.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So I might have said summer early, I meant winter and spring are the ones I've completed.

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sure there's probably something that's better than what I've watched so far and if not, it's not terrible to have a year where nothing is outright amazing.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I feel like I've gotten to the point where it is a struggle for me to find an anime I haven't seen that's a 9 out of 10 or above.

36
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Like, you know, if you get into a medium and you watch all the classics, then what's left?

37
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know, all that's left after the classics is the stuff that's just kinda good.

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And for me, so much of what so many of the anime that I finish now, so often when I go out and do a marathon, when I do finish or fail and just, you know, watch a whole bunch of shows in one big clump,

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
or when I do board of second chances or something, or any of the stuff I do to marathon shows.

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like, I'm really getting this baseline 7 out of 10 experience. That's most of what I'm gonna see.

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Most of the shows I haven't watched already are gonna be the 7 out of 10 shows because if it's something really amazing, then chances are I found out about it already, you know?

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And the reason I have to scour everything is just on that chance, on the chance that I stumble upon something that, you know, no one else thought was a 10 and I did.

43
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Cause like, you know, if I only watched Consensus Masterpieces, I probably would never have seen, like, Log Horizon.

44
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You know, a show that I think is extremely underrated, that for me is one of my favorite shows of all time and has so much going for it that I never saw talked about, and I still haven't really seen talked about to a great extent, you know?

45
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think there's so many shows like that that I'd be at risk of missing if I didn't try to seek out every good show.

46
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But at the same time, like, you know, it takes a lot of effort now. It takes going through all this searching, and in the meantime I end up watching so many 7 out of 10s.

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And what's great about being able to dive into comics is that I've got, you know, I know, I have a list, sort of, not like a real list, but in my mind, from having consumed so many charts and favorites list and heard so many recommendations,

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I know a concrete list of, like, what are considered the classic comics, and I haven't read any of them.

49
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So almost everything I read is going to be great. It's either going to be the best comic ever, or at least something really cool and interesting.

50
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And even if it's not, I'm so new to it that even the, like, 7 out of 10 stuff is, like, something that I have never seen before, where, like, with anime I've seen everything, you know?

51
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If there's some new cute girls doing cute things show that's not bad, but it's not not noteworthy or, like, memorable, you know, then it's not going to be anything extra for me.

52
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I've seen them all. I know exactly what I'm getting myself into. But, like, with a comic, if I read something that's, like, it doesn't blow my mind, but it's just interesting enough, and I haven't really seen anything like it before, then it's still interesting.

53
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So that's sort of what I've been experiencing this past week. It's just every single comic I've read has automatically been, like, a new fresh experience that adds to my overall understanding and appreciation of the medium, and that's kind of magical.

54
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I've always wanted that to happen, and I kind of wanted that to happen when I tried to get into comics back in 2012, which I read a whole bunch back then, but I never had this sense of, like, finding something complete to read.

55
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like, I didn't understand how comics worked, you know? I thought that it was all just giant series that go on forever, and, you know, there was very few that I read that I really got interested in, and none of them were over yet at the time where I didn't read the whole thing,

56
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
so it was just kind of this confusing, like, you know, haze of reading comics. Now I've already put down a few, like, full series that I'm like, that was great.

57
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You know, I read The Vision Run. That was great. Silver Surfer Requiem wasn't amazing, but the artwork was so fucking good, and it was a complete story in, like, four chapters, and I was like, cool, I now know a thing.

58
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I know an event in the timeline of The Silver Surfer. I know this thing that happened, and I've been reading Sandman, which is fucking amazing.

59
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm about a little less than halfway through the whole series, and it's just been all kinds of cool-ass shit happening, and, yeah, it's been great, and it's something I can't get from anime right now.

60
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And not to say that there's not plenty of good anime I haven't seen. I mean, my on-hold list stretches towards Infinity, and a lot of that is legitimately great stuff.

61
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's plenty of, like, classics that I still haven't watched, especially older ones, and I'd love to get to them at some point, but, like, it's so easy with comics right now to just, in one day, read, like, five comics that are all solid.

62
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Today, I read, I woke up, I read, like, a whole arc of the Sandman, which was awesome, and then I read the first two volumes of The New 52 Wonder Woman, because I had bought, I read Volume 1 back in 2012, and I thought it was cool, and so I bought Volume 2, and I never read it.

63
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And so today I read both volumes 1 and 2, and they were pretty good. And then I also read all of this series called Aries the God of War, just because I saw it on a recommendation chart.

64
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That one wasn't very good. It was only five chapters. It was a pretty generic, like, basically taken, except with Aries and God's fighting, as opposed to Liam Neeson, but it was kind of corny, and I wasn't that into it.

65
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But then, you know, I followed that up with, started reading Animal Man, and, unlike, ten chapters into Animal Man, that's pretty cool. So, yeah, like, all at once, you can just bowl through a bunch of comics, and have a great time with it.

66
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Whereas with anime, you know, there's like a, there's a serious time investment if you want to watch even a short show. You know, like, a 13 episode show is four hours, and it's a lot more taxing, because you have to pay full attention.

67
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know, it takes up all of your senses. Whereas with a comic, I can listen to my own music, and, you know, and take a break whenever I want, kind of thing. A chapter is just a few, maybe ten minutes, as opposed to twenty-two, you know? So, yeah, it's just very easy to sit around and read comics forever.

68
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, I definitely have taken a huge interest in that medium, and it's even making me think about, like, man, I want to get into all the mediums this way. I want it to be like this for all of them. I just want that easy end.

69
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I want that moment of realization, like, to happen for literature or for film, where I don't know what it is about movies, because obviously I've seen, like, fucking 750 movies in my lifetime, according to my Letterbox account, which is pretty complete.

70
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So, it's not like I haven't seen a ton of movies. It's just weird to try to, like, get into them in a big way, I guess, just because movies are almost always short, and I'm not that into, like, that super short form media.

71
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You know, even though I'm saying that comics are short, but, like, comics tend to have a lot of shit happen in those short spans of time. They're just really fast and constant, like, crazy fucking things are going on.

72
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In comparison to the way movies are more of a, like, a slow build to making one point, whereas a comic will just make a thousand points by the time it's over. At least the ones I've been reading have been kind of like that.

73
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But, you know, maybe one day I'll find the time to get into that as well. I definitely think that I'm just more interested in drawings in general than I am in, you know, live action.

74
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have much more of a predilection towards things that couldn't exist in reality than I do to things that could exist in reality, you know?

75
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm much more interested in the fantastical and the mythological, just to an extent, like, with The Sandman.

76
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like, The Sandman could not be anything other than a comic. I don't even think it could be an animated series, really.

77
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I think it's, like, perfect as it is, and I could not see it being adapted into anything else, which is probably why it hasn't been, really.

78
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And, um, it's, yeah, it's just so imaginative and so out there. I guess it could be a book.

79
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The only thing it could imagine as would be a novel, so even less information would be helpful for it.

80
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But then you'd lose out on the awesome character designs.

81
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So, yeah, and the reason I haven't started talking about comics is what allows me the time to do this is that, you know,

82
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
November is a month that I already, I did all my work for November before the month started, gave it all to DeVoo, he's been editing,

83
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you know, we've been working on a couple little things here and there.

84
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He wants me to do more, like, blogs and stuff, but honestly, I just haven't had any ideas for things to put him in.

85
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So, in the meantime, I've, you know, I've got, like, a video or two planned for next month, but, like, I have a lot of time to read comics,

86
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and you might be thinking, why not make videos about comics if you're so into it, why not do some reviews, why not talk about it,

87
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and it's just a matter of the way that I like to do my content, which is to come at it from a very broad perspective.

88
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I like, for me, every anime video I make is from the perspective of someone who has seen all the anime, you know,

89
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
like, it's kind of imperative to the way I write, where I talk about a series for what makes it unique as opposed to what it is,

90
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
like, something like Mob Psycho 100 that I did recently, where, like, I really just zeroed in on this one aspect of it

91
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that was not something that is in any other anime I can think of, you know, in the exact way that it is in that show.

92
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And so, to me, that's the most interesting way to write about something.

93
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And when I think of a comic book, like, if I wrote about what's interesting to me about some of these comics I've read,

94
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
then I really run the risk of comic book fans being like, yeah, no shit, you know.

95
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I mean, and I know some people are happy just to hear someone talking about something they like, no matter how basic,

96
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but for me personally, the style I like to go for has that broad perspective.

97
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So maybe eventually I will write about comics, but I feel like it's not something I could do until I've read, you know,

98
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
enough that I wouldn't be easily torn down by comic book fans if I said something wrong, you know.

99
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I want to have a good enough grasp of the overall canon and the way that comics have moved over the years,

100
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
like what they've been up to, like, I'm slowly getting this sense that in the 80s and early 90s

101
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
they started like using lots of old superheroes as canon fodder.

102
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Like, it seems like there's a lot of like individual chapters of stuff like Animal Man and the Sandman

103
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
where it'll be like, introduce some old DC characters so we can kill them.

104
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Like just to have a really dark scene in a chapter which fits in with that, you know, this is the era when the Watchmen

105
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and Vertigo took off and like, you know, it's a deconstructive era of comics when comics got serious and adult and stuff.

106
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So yeah, it'd be interesting to, you know, study up on stuff like that.

107
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But yeah, that's all I have to say about that for now.

108
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I have this great fear with regards to what I do because I've seen so many other people fall into this sort of trap

109
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and I'm afraid it'll happen to me.

110
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
See, I hear all the time people giving the advice that you shouldn't make your art your job

111
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
because then you'll grow to hate doing it.

112
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think it's weird that people give that advice because obviously most of the artists you know and are a fan of have made art their job.

113
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You know, anyone who's ever made a movie or written a comic with any degree of mainstream success,

114
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
anyone who's made an anime, they're making their job their art.

115
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And for many of us, that's the only way we can justify doing our art.

116
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I mean, it's nice when you get to do art as a pastime, but like for some of us doing a normal job is soul-crushing

117
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and we feel like that's keeping us from doing our art that we should be doing.

118
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No, I've never had a problem with that.

119
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The idea of making my art my job is totally cool with me and if anything, it makes the art even more satisfying.

120
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
When I get to make something and then it makes money, that's like the pinnacle of making the art for me.

121
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My fear is a different one.

122
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What I've observed is when you make your art your life, then your art runs the risk of becoming boring.

123
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And here's what I mean.

124
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm talking kind of about this modern phenomenon of like daily vloggers, people who do stuff daily, who do stuff all the time,

125
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
who are constantly making things about themselves.

126
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because what inevitably happens is that who you are becomes a guy who makes things about himself.

127
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And that narrative is always going to just kind of eat its own tail, you know?

128
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You see where I'm going with this, like for instance, I love Casey Neistat.

129
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I love his vlogs.

130
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But I got into him, you know, and started watching the daily vlogs and I watched like over a hundred of them.

131
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And inevitably, they all start bleeding into each other.

132
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I mean, if you watch one now, nothing's going to be in it you haven't seen before.

133
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Very rarely will he do something really innovative in one of his vlogs.

134
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And so it kind of becomes where the story of Casey Neistat is the story of a guy who makes a daily vlog, you know?

135
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Not that that's really what he's doing.

136
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I mean, his vlog takes up, you know, only so much of his day.

137
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
He always says, you know, what you're seeing is ten minutes of a 24-hour day in which I'm busy for those whole 24 hours.

138
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And sure, he works on other things. He keeps himself busy.

139
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But when you're watching just the daily vlog, it's like inevitably, it's just going to be like what it is.

140
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's repetitive.

141
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You're always either watching him flying somewhere or watching him skateboarding around New York

142
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
or flying drones around New York, you know, or hanging out with one of the same couple of people

143
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
or doing some kind of speech somewhere.

144
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like, you're going to see those same things over and over and over and over again.

145
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And he's not even the worst example.

146
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And this is kind of why I don't follow Game Grumps anymore.

147
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And Game Grumps has this channel called Grump Out,

148
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
which is like for a bunch of side things that they do that are not relevant to the main channel.

149
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Even though I unfollowed Game Grumps like towards the beginning of this year, I still follow Grump Out.

150
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So I still kind of see little bits and pieces of them.

151
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And they just started up this interview series that's very similar to the PCP interviews,

152
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
except ours are three hours long and there's only 45 minutes.

153
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But it's one of the Grumps who will interview one of the other Grumps for 45 minutes about what their life was

154
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
up until joining the Game Grumps.

155
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And funnily enough, the least interesting interview that I've heard so far is the one where Aaron interviews Dan.

156
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Now Dan is my favorite member of the Game Grumps.

157
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He's a super cool guy. He's super nice and lovable.

158
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And listening to him talk is relaxing and fun.

159
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And it's what's made Game Grumps such a great show since he came on.

160
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But what killed Game Grumps for me ultimately is that Dan only has so many stories.

161
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Dan doesn't have a great memory.

162
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
He's not generally someone who, A, has a whole ton of memories.

163
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And B will remember whether or not he's told the same stories before.

164
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So listening to his interview was just kind of a reminder of all the problems I have with Game Grumps now,

165
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
which is that they just talk about the same shit.

166
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because, you know, their lives up until Game Grumps, once those stories are exhausted, there's nothing left to go on.

167
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But their story now is they make Game Grumps.

168
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But when they talk about what they've been up to, it's always the same thing.

169
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's, well, you know what we've been up to. We make Game Grumps, you know?

170
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Like, of course, it's gonna be the same stuff.

171
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And again, it's not that they record every single thing that they're up to in the day,

172
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
but the exciting things happening in their lives are all relative to the show you're already watching.

173
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I have long been worried about falling into this exact trap.

174
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You know, and you hear this on the Digi Bros. show, where me and Victor would get together,

175
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and I usually let Victor tell all the stories because Victor is doing film.

176
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And like, he's not a YouTuber. His daily life is not explained anywhere.

177
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So when he comes on the show, he's telling all these stories about all these things that I don't know about.

178
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It'll be some film he was working on, and the film has nothing to do with the process of having made the film.

179
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Whereas, like, this podcast that you're listening to right now, there is no, like, story to it

180
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
beyond the fact that it is about my life. You know, the process of its creation is the same thing as what it is.

181
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So if you were to watch one of Victor's films that he's worked on, you won't learn about what he was doing on the film.

182
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That is a story best explained on Digi Bros.

183
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But me, I don't have a lot of that. And you'd hear this all the time, right?

184
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You'd be like, well, I was working on this video that came out on my main channel, you know?

185
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
There's nothing more to it. It's like, the story of me making Shinbo in the 90s is that I watched all the Shinbo shows,

186
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and I wrote a video, and DeVue edited it. There's nothing more complex to it.

187
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So I'm always worried that I am going to inevitably become a boring person,

188
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
because, like, my pool of things to talk about is pretty much self-explanatory.

189
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And that's why sometimes, that's why I constantly try to innovate with things.

190
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like, with the Digi Bro After Dark, I did, like, a huge amount of vlogs,

191
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and then I've kind of calmed down with them a bit, and now I've started this podcast.

192
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And, like, this podcast might seem like it's pretty much the same thing as After Dark,

193
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but it's different in enough ways that it keeps things fresh, that it's not the exact same thing as Digi Bros.

194
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Where, you know, as I explained in episode one of this, on Digi Bros., it's more of a conversation.

195
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's more of, like, me presenting myself to another person.

196
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
On After Dark, it's more idea-focused. Each video is about a certain idea.

197
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This podcast is just free-form thought-dumping about what's going on with me right now, you know?

198
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So, it's somewhat different. It's a different approach, and there's different nuances and different little flavors

199
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
you can get out of it that you might not get out of the other things I'm doing.

200
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And I feel like it's imperative to keep innovating that way, because when you watch enough Game Grumps,

201
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
eventually it's just the same thing every episode.

202
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Dan tells the same stories, Aaron cracks the same jokes. We already know their lives.

203
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We already know the Game Grumps experience, and it just, it kind of all at once just got so dull

204
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
right around when, I would say, right at the end of last year.

205
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like, when they were wrapping up, dead-rising, and when Mario Maker just went on a little bit too long.

206
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And now I have seen, and I haven't watched these videos yet, but I've seen that Grumps have been doing a few new things.

207
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like, they just did a playthrough of just Aaron playing Mega Man X, and I totally want to watch that.

208
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Because that's new. You know, whoa, it's just one of them. What will that be like? What will the dynamic be?

209
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You know, and that kind of little innovation is enough to perk my interest again.

210
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And Casey Neistat has talked about how he's going to stop the daily vlog at some point, and I'm kind of excited for that.

211
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I want him to go back to just, you know, I want to see just his films, his little short films that he likes making.

212
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I want to know what it's going to be like to go back to those, or to see what kind of innovations he'll think of

213
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:19,000
if he has more time, and isn't, you know, instead of putting those ten minutes a day, or whatever, you know,

214
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
which is obviously he works on for hours on the editing of the videos.

215
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So it's not like it's literally just ten minutes a day going into the vlogs.

216
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But I want to know what it'll be like when he decides to open it up and do something a little bit more experimental,

217
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
as opposed to the same things he's been doing.

218
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And yeah, that's why I have to keep innovating.

219
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And like this podcast is only going to go as long as I think it's interesting,

220
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
as long as I keep thinking that I have these unstructured ideas.

221
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And it works really well for right now because of the fact that I haven't been having these single topic ideas like I was

222
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
when I was doing the really intense vlogs, and I was vlogging like every day as I was for, you know, most of the summer of this year.

223
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because at that time it was just, man, I've had so many random topical thoughts that I need to get out there.

224
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And right now I haven't been having those.

225
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I've been more having a, like my life has been this kind of hazy miasma of moving between things,

226
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
of this weird experience of being way ahead of myself in work, and way ahead of myself in planning.

227
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You know, I have things planned for a fairly large amount of time ahead of me, which is unusual.

228
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I've got, you know, all these new interests like comics that I don't really want to talk about in videos that I'm like exploring.

229
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So there's just this whole world of new things happening that I'm not used to.

230
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And this is the right, this podcast is the right vehicle for exploring that.

231
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But as soon as it stops being that way, this podcast will probably end.

232
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm really predicting this to have maybe, maybe it'll go for a season, you know, like an anime season.

233
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I kind of started it at a, when did I start this?

234
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Midway through October? No, late into October.

235
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So I could see it going until maybe the end of the year.

236
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Maybe until Radcon 2, that would probably be a stopping point.

237
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Which, when that happens, you know, me and Jesse are going to make the plebe in the weeb.

238
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's going to be 10 whole videos on its own, so that's a whole different experimental thing.

239
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We're going to be working more on trying to move Jesse and Nate down here.

240
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So that's going to be a whole thing.

241
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So yeah, like, there's just going to be, there's going to be a lot of changes going forward.

242
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And for each stage, I want, I want everything to evolve.

243
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't ever want to be boring. I don't ever want people to watch my videos and be like,

244
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
this is the exact same thing I heard last time.

245
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I know that I repeat myself a lot. I know I come from a very certain place.

246
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And that I'm not always presenting new ideas.

247
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But I do think that the rate at which I present new ideas is kind of staggering.

248
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know anybody else who's, who puts out as much content as I do

249
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and for as many of the ideas to be unique.

250
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And as I watch other people, I've come to realize that like,

251
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
a lot of people are more just kind of known for holding one position.

252
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You know, they're not really, especially like politicians.

253
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I remember having this interesting moment where I was kind of like watching a few different things

254
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that Bernie Sanders had been saying back when he was trying to run, you know, for president.

255
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And it was weird to realize that they all say the exact same thing.

256
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He has a strict platform and everywhere he goes, he just presents his platform.

257
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And you know, a lot of comedians in the old days before, you know,

258
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
before now everybody kind of has to change their set

259
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
if they want to keep making specials for the internet age.

260
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But like, stand-up comedy is usually you go to a bunch of places, you tell the same jokes.

261
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And there are certain YouTubers who are kind of like that.

262
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Or if you watch Jimquisition or something, it's not so much about him constantly coming up with new ideas

263
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
as it is him applying the ideas he always applies to a variety of different subjects.

264
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I think that's what standard reviews are like.

265
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I think most reviewers are like saying,

266
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
hey, you all know what my opinions in general are.

267
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Here's how this show worked with my general stance.

268
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And I've never really done that.

269
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I've always been more of like every video, everything I do has to have something new.

270
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It has to say something I haven't said before because I often take this stance that like,

271
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
if you know how I feel about things, then you can apply it to everything else.

272
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Like you can take what I've said about this show and you can then apply it to every other show you've seen.

273
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But I actually think maybe I've been somewhat misguided in that.

274
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Like when I think of reviews as entertainment or even as just giving people information,

275
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I think it could be helpful if I took on like every show in kind of the same way because nobody else is watching all of it.

276
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You know, nobody else has the time to sort through every single show and tell you how they all relate.

277
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And speaking personally, as someone who's been watching video game analysis for four fucking years now,

278
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
while playing very few video games,

279
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,000
like I am deeply invested in the narrative of video game evolution even though I'm not following it at all.

280
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, I'm just following these analysts who are like sort of guiding me through what games are doing,

281
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
but I don't even play the games for the most part.

282
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So I feel like there's probably people who, and this would be a great way,

283
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
if I ever just want to like buckle down and get out a lot of videos and expand my audience,

284
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I would probably do something a bit more like that, just like make more reviews of things

285
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and just like go through a ton of anime and just express opinions on them and sort of get people invested in the narrative.

286
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's just that with anime in particular, there's so much foundation I felt like I had to build.

287
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like that no one was talking about the things I wanted them to talk about with anime

288
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and there's so many ideas I have to present and so much groundwork I have to lay before I can even consider

289
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
just like jumping on to each individual show, you know.

290
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And over time, as I've kept doing this, I've seen some of the ideas I've presented

291
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
start to permeate through, you know, other people and the way they talk about shows.

292
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So that's been cool to see, but I want to take it even further.

293
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Anyway, hopefully that helps you to understand why I never have anything happen consistently

294
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and I know that can be kind of weird for my followers who might get really into one way that I've been doing things

295
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and then have it kind of disappear.

296
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You know, Digi Bros. will be back, I know it seems dead right now because we haven't been doing anything for it

297
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
but I still like that format and I like the idea of it coming out consistently over time.

298
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But things like, you know, when I start up some new video series and it seems like,

299
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
this content is going to go in this direction and then it just like hard right veers somewhere else

300
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
or anything like that, you know.

301
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's understandably, I can see how that could throw people for a loop and make it so it's harder to follow me in a way

302
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
but it's just how I like doing things.

303
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I want to always be new, I want to always be fresh.

304
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't ever want you to like wake up one morning and put on one of my videos and feel like,

305
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
God, it's just Digi saying the same old shit, you know.

306
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I don't ever want you to feel like you can just skip half my videos which is how I feel about like,

307
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
nice stat or game grumps that I don't have to watch them.

308
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Like a new video comes out and I'm just like, eh, I know what I'm going to get myself into, you know,

309
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I can watch it at a later date.

310
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I want, when one of mine comes out, you're like, what is it going to be this time?

311
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What's he going to tell me?

312
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What new thing am I going to learn?

313
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You know, I hope it's felt that way.

314
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Anyway, continued in the next part.

315
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, in the process of reading all these comics and books and all that other stuff I've been reading,

316
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
there's one dangerous thought that keeps popping back into my mind.

317
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's sort of an itch that I get every once in a while,

318
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and I know this is relatable for some other people who do the kind of work I do,

319
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
which is that itch to make original stories.

320
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Even though I don't really like writing original stories or constructing them in any way,

321
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
but there's all these characters and plots that I came up with ages ago

322
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
that like, when it bubbles up to the surface, it's like, God,

323
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
maybe I should finally make that story.

324
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Maybe it's time to bring these characters to life,

325
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
even though most of the stories and characters that I have are just by-products

326
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
of things I was interested in long ago,

327
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that like, the current me has no relationship with the spark

328
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that generated these characters and ideas.

329
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I feel like me now couldn't possibly bring them to life

330
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
in the way that me then wanted them to be brought to life.

331
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But I was thinking about why this keeps happening.

332
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Why do I keep getting this inspiration specifically from reading comics

333
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and books to a lesser extent, but comics especially?

334
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And it's because it's my language.

335
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Like, obviously I watch anime with subtitles and stuff.

336
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I read manga that's translated and everything.

337
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But Japanese has a very specific way of communicating.

338
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The way their language is, the way that their writing sounds.

339
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Like, I'm very used to hearing it.

340
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I know exactly what it's like.

341
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And I could not recreate it.

342
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Like, there's no way I could write an anime-style story using English words.

343
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Because to me, those stories are communicated through Japanese.

344
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Like, the way the language is is integral to the way that characters communicate

345
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
in anime and manga.

346
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And if I knew Japanese well enough, I'd almost be tempted to write,

347
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
you know, an anime-style story.

348
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because, like, just the way I think about them is so integrally tied to that.

349
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But now when I read, like, books and comics, it's like, whoa!

350
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
These are my words!

351
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
These are sentences I would come up with.

352
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
These are stories that seem like something I would have invented, you know?

353
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And it's been especially true with these comics that, uh...

354
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
God, comics have such a willingness to go so big and so audacious

355
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and so, like, out there with their ideas.

356
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And to do it quickly.

357
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Like, with no hesitation.

358
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Just to bowl through all these high concepts.

359
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Um, you know, and obviously this isn't true of all comics, but...

360
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You know, there's the crazy ones, like the Sandman,

361
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and I've been reading Grant Morrison's Animal Man,

362
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
which are just, like, nothing but mind-destroying, high-concept shit all the time.

363
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But even, like...

364
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Like, even normal stuff.

365
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Like, I mean, in comics, comparing characters to gods is, like, a mainstay feature of comics.

366
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Like, in an average comic, someone will be a god.

367
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
There will be a battle between gods.

368
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The universe will be at stake.

369
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Alternate dimensions and realities are a constant, you know?

370
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It's kinda like...

371
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's funny for me because, like, when I watched Rick and Morty,

372
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I thought, wow, this show goes so far beyond the insane with, like, you know,

373
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
uh, with going to all these different dimensions and universes and stuff,

374
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and it's so flippant about it.

375
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And that's kinda what I love about Rick and Morty, is that it's so flippant,

376
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and it's all just kind of a big joke to that story.

377
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But in comics, they also do kinda do that.

378
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Like, it's not as flippant about it, but it's so sudden.

379
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Like, we're aliens from another dimension,

380
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
we'll show up and be like, oh, we created your reality, you know?

381
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And that just happens in a comic book.

382
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's kinda taken as a given that crazy-ass shit will happen.

383
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And, uh, I feel like that...

384
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Like, when I'm reading these things,

385
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
it feels like the kinds of stories that I used to come up with back when I was trying to be a writer, you know?

386
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Most of the stories that I had thought up involved some kind of super-super-humans,

387
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
super-powers, like, uh, concepts as characters.

388
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I mean, for fuck's sake, in, uh, The Sandman, in that comic series,

389
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
there's these seven things called the Endless, which are personifications of concepts.

390
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Uh, they are dream, death, destiny, uh, destruction, I think,

391
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
uh, pshh, desire, um, delirium, and...

392
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Nah, I'm forgetting one.

393
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But, you know, it's seven personifications of concepts.

394
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And, like, in my story that I was writing called, uh, uh, Tales from the End of the World,

395
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
then it was, like, I had seven concepts personifi-

396
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It was, like, the seven gods who ruled over this city, um,

397
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
who were all, like, personifications of concepts.

398
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There was the chaos, the end, the, uh, something else.

399
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I don't remember them right now.

400
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's been a long time. The chaos was the one that, like, mattered to the story.

401
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But, um, you know, that's the kind of stuff I used to do.

402
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And there's just so many little things when I'm reading The Sandman

403
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
where I'm like, fuck, I would have written this.

404
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And I never even read this story. Like, I wasn't influenced by this.

405
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Funnily enough, I was more influenced by anime and stuff like that.

406
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But somehow, I still got these concepts that are so comic book.

407
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Reading these comics, I wonder if I would have felt more at home in, in this.

408
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Like, if I'd grown up with these. You know, if I'd grown up with comics like The Sandman,

409
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
which is, ironically, The Sandman has been around me my whole life,

410
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
because my mom is a hardcore collector of The Sandman.

411
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
She owns all the comics, she has tons of statues,

412
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
she's been, like, a lifelong fan, and I've never actually read any of it.

413
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So, like, you know, it's, it's this weird irony to pick it up now and be like,

414
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
this is exactly the kind of thing that I've always been looking for, you know?

415
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And it just makes me wonder if I would have become more incensed to write

416
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
if I had, you know, seen these things before, to create my own stories.

417
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And even though I still like a lot of the concepts I had before,

418
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
it's just, a lot of them are just not me.

419
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like, I don't have that same kind of, like, I don't know.

420
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It used to be that I loved edgy shit.

421
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I loved to write this crazy off-the-wall edgy shit, you know?

422
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And now, the idea of writing something more abstracted than reality,

423
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
just like, I can't even do it.

424
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I, I try, I, uh, because of Nano Remo,

425
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
which is, you know, every November is Nano Remo,

426
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and I, I had done, I was working on this video project,

427
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I kind of canceled that.

428
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And then I thought, like, four or five days into November,

429
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I was like, what if I just try to write an actual novel?

430
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Let's just go for it.

431
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And I wrote, like, four pages of something,

432
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and most of what I wrote was more, like, diary style.

433
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It was like, I was just writing everything that came into my head

434
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
as it came into my head.

435
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And, uh, and I just wrote out, like, four pages of stuff

436
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that kind of works as maybe an intro to a story.

437
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And then I, like, at the end of those four pages,

438
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I was like, all right, now let's launch into an actual story,

439
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
like a fiction story.

440
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I just couldn't do it.

441
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's like that, that just isn't my style to make stuff something up

442
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
as opposed to just saying things that are on my mind.

443
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I'm, I think I'm good at that.

444
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I think I'm good at writing nonfiction.

445
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And maybe I could write a whole book worth of just thoughts

446
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that come into my head.

447
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You know, I don't think a book is really the best outlet for it.

448
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I think these kinds of podcasts and vlogs are great.

449
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And even if I did something written,

450
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'd prefer it to be more like a series of journal entries or something.

451
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Just, I don't, I don't like writing non-real things.

452
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And as time has gone on, I've gotten worse and worse at it.

453
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So it's weird, because I feel like I should.

454
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I feel like when I read these comics, I feel like I should do this.

455
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But then I'm like, who even wants it?

456
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Who wants me to do that?

457
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like, it might not even, it probably won't be good for me

458
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and not good for anyone else compared to what I'm already doing.

459
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You know?

460
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But it's this odd compulsion.

461
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And I know this is something that other people get.

462
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I know because DeVu had, had like a, like a month ago,

463
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
he went into what he called like a game hole

464
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
where he just suddenly remembered like that,

465
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
like a trigger in his mind that like,

466
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
because for so long he wanted to design games.

467
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And he has designed games.

468
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
He has made actual games before.

469
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You know, very minor little self-made ones that took him forever.

470
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But like, there's a huge part of his brain that still thinks of him as a games guy.

471
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Like his destiny is supposed to be to make games.

472
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And like, even though he's happy with what he's doing now,

473
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and he loves being an editor and he loves, you know, working on analysis videos,

474
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
there's still this, this little thing in his mind that gets switched every once in a while

475
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and he becomes obsessed with making a video game.

476
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then he remembers that he, that it's not the time yet.

477
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And he dials it back.

478
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
He grabs the dial and he dials it back.

479
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh God, I'm like, I've got my hand on my head

480
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and I'm grabbing like a dial on the side of my head,

481
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
like Stein from Frankenstein in Soul Eater.

482
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Imagine that.

483
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Cranking that dial.

484
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But, but for me, it's even more torturous

485
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
because I feel like I'm at a place in my career where I, I totally have time.

486
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Like if I wanted to start writing now, I have time now.

487
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You know, I, my dream when I started up Patreon and everything,

488
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
even when I first started making videos,

489
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
like I've always wanted it to be where I could get so far ahead of myself

490
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
that I'd have time to work on other things.

491
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And I've said this a thousand times, I must have.

492
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Like, that me giving all this work to DeVue ahead of time is meant to free me up

493
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
to do whatever I want.

494
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And I have been doing other things in my main videos,

495
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
but like, you know, it's all been kind of related.

496
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's all more things that utilize those same kinds of talents,

497
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
the, the speaking, the vlogging, the video editing,

498
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
the making, making content for YouTube, you know,

499
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
occasionally writing a little bit of, you know, nonfiction stuff here and there.

500
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
But that, that itch for prose writing, it just creeps up and it grabs me

501
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and it makes me feel like, you have time, you can do it.

502
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But then it's like, what do I actually want to write?

503
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I just, I'm just so in love with the idea that I could do it,

504
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
that I could be a writer, that I could be creating these kinds of stories.

505
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But do I actually want to?

506
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Do I actually want to sit down and try to write prose, which I hate?

507
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
The answer is probably no, but it's torturous,

508
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
because so much of my life was about that up until, you know, I found this.

509
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Like, arguably, even though, even though it's something no one's seen,

510
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
even though no one knows or cares about that aspect, you know,

511
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I was 10 when I wrote my first story,

512
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and I was about 20 when I gave up on writing stories.

513
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I mean, I was 20 when I, no, I guess I was 20 when I actually wrote the book,

514
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
the nano-remote book, the one that I succeeded at.

515
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So, you know, 10 years I was writing stories,

516
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and then in the next couple of years,

517
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I mean, the last thing I wrote was Ciano and Purple Steve in 2011.

518
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So, you know, it's 11 years of stories.

519
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Nobody read any of them.

520
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
None of them are worthy of digging back up, really.

521
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But that's a huge part of my identity,

522
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and it's still there, needling at me in the back of my mind.

523
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And who knows, maybe one day I'll give into it.

524
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:38,000
In the meantime, I think I might just release those four pages of that book that I, you know,

525
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
just those four pages just to see how people feel about my style of writing,

526
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
because I don't really think that story is worth continuing,

527
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but it would be interesting to see how people feel about reading that kind of thing.

528
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So that's all.

529
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh, boy.

530
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
For this last section, I'm gonna be sitting in my desk chair as opposed to the couch.

531
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I mean, I don't know if anybody, like, processes how relaxed I am anyways in these,

532
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
but, you know, this one's a...this bit's gonna be decompression more in the sense,

533
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
not so much in the relaxing sense, as the God I need to get the thoughts out of my head sense.

534
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I feel like shit right now.

535
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I've made the...

536
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't know why I do this to myself, mistake of eating fast food twice today.

537
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
All I've eaten today is fast food, and not just any fast food,

538
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
but both Wendy's and Arby's.

539
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And every time I eat Arby's, I feel like total garbage.

540
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The only reason at all to go to Arby's is that it's right next to my house.

541
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So, like, you know, I can walk there.

542
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But, God, it makes me feel terrible.

543
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't know why I ever eat at Arby's.

544
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's such a bad idea.

545
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So I feel like garbage doesn't help that I'm back to cigarettes because of my vape breaking and shit,

546
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and, like, I've been getting head rushes because I fucking bought 100s like an idiot.

547
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh, God, I feel like a fucking mishmash whirlwind of shit.

548
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And the main reason, aside from all the physical stuff,

549
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:11,000
is that I have way too much power and way too much responsibility for me to deal with at this point in my life.

550
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I am too big. I have too much pull. I have too big of a voice.

551
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And my vision outstrips my ability to deal with the things I say.

552
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
My God, I put out two videos the other day that, I mean, these are not big videos.

553
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They're on After Dark. They've got, you know, 5,000 views apiece.

554
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's amazing how much I can just, like, suggest something and cause, you know, after effects to ripple out from it.

555
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So one of the videos was to make a recommendations community on Reddit.

556
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And it's the kind of thing where, for whatever reason in my head, it's like, alright, I'm posting up three recommendations.

557
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Maybe this will have, like, I'll make a video about it, you know, suggesting it to people.

558
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'll post, like, 20 or so recommendations. I'll go through them. It'll be slow forever.

559
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
No, of course it's not like that. I post that video and there's fucking several hundred recommendations on the board already.

560
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And immediately I'm like, well, I can't moderate this.

561
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Like, I don't have time to go through this and moderate this and, you know, like, check out absolutely all of it.

562
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I mean, I have been actually consuming a lot of it.

563
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Immediately it paid off in a huge way, because in one of the first recommendations someone posted this series by a music guy called Nick Ott,

564
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I think that's his name, Chris Ott, I don't know why I thought Nick, Chris Ott, OTT, who did this series called Shallow Rewards,

565
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
which is just a series of this guy, like, just basically vlogging in much the same style as Digibro After Dark,

566
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
which is just like his face and he's talking about stuff, about music, usually about music history and just interesting stuff,

567
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and it's fucking great, because the way he talks is insane.

568
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
He talks like he's writing an article in speech, and I don't just mean like a straightforward article.

569
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
He talks like prose, almost, and just makes all these connections and references to things at a blistering speed,

570
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
where, you know, I don't completely, I don't know a lot of the stuff he's saying, and yet I can draw the connections and I can kind of get it and I can follow it,

571
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and just everything he talks about is fascinating, because he just has this unfucking believable wealth of knowledge about music and its history,

572
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
you know, and he's a former journalist, but he formerly worked for like a pitchfork and stuff,

573
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and he has all these opinions about the way, the state of the industry and stuff,

574
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and what got to me the most about the way he talks is that he's very serious.

575
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
There's not a whole lot, I mean, he swears and stuff, and it's sort of loose and personal and gonzo,

576
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but there's no sense of like making fun of himself in the way that like I do, where I come out with the fucking sunglasses and the robe and everything,

577
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and I try to make like a big joke of it so that, so I don't come off as like a, you know, a douchebag or whatever.

578
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This guy doesn't care, he's just like, he's upfront about how much he cares about the shit he's talking about, you know,

579
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and he's very dramatic about it, but in a good way, and I really enjoy it, and I'm watching these,

580
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and what got to me the most is how he name drops things, you know, he constantly is, you know, making reference to specific musicians,

581
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
specific points in time, specific people in the industry and people in his line of work, you know, fellow journalists and stuff like that,

582
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and it fascinated me because I've had this problem with how I think there's a lot of great journalism happening in the anime community right now,

583
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and no communication happening between the people doing it. I mean, some of them are friends with each other on Twitter and stuff,

584
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but there's no like cross-referencing, there's no people saying like, or like joining of information, you know,

585
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
like I'm writing this series on Akiyuki Shinbo, and I'm reading Wave Motion Canon, which is blogging about Akiyuki Shinbo,

586
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and I'm reading, you know, this and that person talking about this stuff, why aren't we all talking about it together?

587
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Why is there no coalition of information, you know, if we're all doing the same research, why are we not sort of in the same field together?

588
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You know, it's odd that we're all kind of reading each other, but not mentioning it to our audience,

589
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
no one's like, by the way, check out Digi Bro, check out Wave Motion Canon, you know, we're not doing the back and forth,

590
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and that's including me, I'm not doing enough back and forth, you know, so I decided when I was watching these Chris Ott videos,

591
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I was like, I gotta fucking get something out there like that, so I made a video like that, you know, a mere hour after I had just put out the video

592
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:54,000
about the recommendations thing on Digi Bro After Dark, you know, so I just launched this Reddit board that is already spiraling out of my control,

593
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and then an hour later, I launched another video that's like where I name drop eight different people who by morning have all seen this video

594
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and have all commented on it on Twitter, and I'm trying to like fucking, you know, figure out what to do with the can of worms I just opened,

595
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and now suddenly I have all this responsibility because I'm the one calling people out, so now I have to do it, I have to follow up, I have to follow through, you know,

596
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I have to go and make reference to all these people and try to make these connections and start talking to people,

597
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and you know, I just showed like eight important guys, hey, I want to start a dialogue between us, you know, and that's where I am now,

598
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,000
and that's just, it's so weird because the way I go about creating things, it's all about that video,

599
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and this happens to me all the time, where I make a video that has a ripple effect, that has this follow up, but I've already moved on,

600
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
like when I publish a video, I have mentally moved on to the next thing, you know, sure, I will incorporate elements of what I've said,

601
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I'll start moving in that direction, but like, you know, I feel like the kinds of calls to action that I do on like a weekly basis are the kind of things that most people save for once a year,

602
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
once every six months, you know, like every so often someone's like, hey, why don't we all do this, and everyone else is like,

603
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:22,000
oh, that's an interesting thought, and I do that like constantly, and then I'm always like, you know, it backfires on me partly because I have no skills of delegation,

604
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and I don't talk to anybody, you know, my biggest problem is I'm not talking to enough people, I am very, I'm a hermit, you know, I talk to the PCP,

605
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:41,000
those are my friends, I like almost exclusively talk to the members of the procrastinator's podcast, that's it, I really don't talk to anybody else,

606
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
except for like, you know, a few ancillary people like Munky or Munchy who are basically PCP members as it is,

607
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and you know, some of my other friends like Neil X, who I even him, I can barely ever get around to talking to, you know, it's like,

608
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
it's really the close people who I have a narrative with that I keep talking to, so, you know, when I open these cans of worms,

609
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:10,000
it's like, I don't know what to do with it, who can I possibly appoint to be the moderator of this recommendation subreddit, I don't know who anybody is,

610
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,000
you know, everyone posting there, you know, they're now, you know, possibly committed to being a part of this community,

611
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
but I have no idea who I could pick out, you know, after like a year, I appointed Lachlan still the moderator of the Digibro subreddit,

612
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,000
you know, the one that I have for myself, maybe it hasn't been up for a year, I have no idea, but after a long period of time,

613
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
you know, I saw that Lachlan was, he reads everything on there and responds to everything, and I was like, well, this guy cares more about my subreddit than I do,

614
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and even then, I still do most of the moderation work myself, because something is caught in the fucking filter or something, and I'm the one who ends up taking it down,

615
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
so, yeah, just because I'm on there all the time, not like to take a thing away from Lachlan, like I just kind of get to stuff faster,

616
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and I understand why he'd rather have me make executive decisions than, you know, try to decide for me what goes on my Reddit board,

617
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:13,000
but that's the problem, I don't know how to like delegate tasks to people and like handpower over and not try to be a part of every single fucking thing that I open up,

618
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
and then as a result, so much of what I start goes unfinished, so many of the things that like, I opened up this huge big idea to the world,

619
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and everyone's like, whoa, that's a cool idea, and then, you know, I lose interest and the whole thing dies, because I don't leave anybody in charge,

620
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I don't know who to leave in charge, you know, I wish I was better at that, I wish I could have the mindset of someone like, you know,

621
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I watch Casey Neistat and he's going around talking to all these different kinds of people, and like, he starts up something like Beam,

622
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and it's like, he started it, but the guy who like fucking Coke founded Tumblr is the guy who runs it, you know,

623
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and I wish I knew people like that, who I could delegate to these things, but the problem is it's all unpaid, like these are all passion projects, you know,

624
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I can't pay somebody to mod the fucking reccomendations board, what is it, reccompendium, I can't like, pay someone to do it,

625
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
it's just like, hey, who's interested in like, taking this idea that I had out of nowhere, and now you're suddenly in charge of it, you know,

626
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
like I haven't even peppered anybody up and gotten excited, I just launched this fucking thing the second I had the idea for it,

627
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:32,000
but that's me, I just kind of go and go and go, and I don't stop, and then, you know, I blast past the things that I've left in my wake,

628
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and it's a sad thing, and it's not that I don't think I have time to like, even do some of this stuff, it's just that I like moving on,

629
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:49,000
you know, I'm so into getting into the next idea, and when I have an idea, it's always a big idea, and I guess it is that I don't have time,

630
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:56,000
like, how am I meant to, you know, launch a community, and like, for most people, that's then what they're doing, you know,

631
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
for most people who are like, a moderator of a forum, that's like, when they get off work, that's what they do with their day,

632
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
you know, they moderate the forum for a few hours, like, that's their kind of thing they do as a creative outlet,

633
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and for me, it's like, I just launched a community, and now I'm gonna go watch 200 fucking shaft shows, so I can write about them, or something,

634
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
you know, like, I have some huge project I have to go do that will totally absorb everything, and I will not have time for this forum,

635
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,000
so, yeah, that's the kind of nightmare I live in, and then, you know, I know that some of the comments on here,

636
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
like, there's probably gonna be somebody who's like, hey, what about me, I'd like to delegate your forum, and the other problem is that,

637
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:44,000
like, again, I don't know people, and I don't trust anybody I don't know, like, and I don't go and meet people, so I never meet anybody who I can trust,

638
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:56,000
you know, not that I don't think that you guys can probably do a good job, just that, like, the way I am, I don't tend to, like, contact people unless I already know them for something,

639
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,000
you know, like, for me, before I ever, like, follow someone, or befriend them, or, like, get their fucking discord information,

640
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,000
it's always, like, someone who I've been watching for a while, who I know their content, and I'm like, oh, I'm comfortable with this person,

641
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and those aren't the people you can hand something over to, because those are the people who are already running their own channel, you know,

642
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I already felt, like, kind of bad that I saddled, like, I know Lachlan wants to do it, but I felt funny about saddling him with the moderating of DigiBro,

643
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and it's like, his attention's obviously not gonna be here, he's got his own fucking YouTube channel, you know, he probably hopes that one day he'll have his own subreddit,

644
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,000
you know, uh, dedicated to his work, um, that he can fucking find somebody to delegate it to,

645
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:50,000
but, yeah, so that's the place I'm in right now, and it's kind of dramatic, and I just never have my ideas just don't fucking stop,

646
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and especially when I'm watching something like these Chris Ott videos, and just, like, every single one makes me want to go do something,

647
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I started up so many videos yesterday, like, aside from those two that I already released, I filmed a fucking hour-long thing that I'm working on,

648
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
uh, that's got, like, full editing and stuff, and if it's successful, it might launch a whole other series, you know,

649
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I did, in fact, post on my Reddit the story I was talking about in the last part of this podcast, um, that I had written, like, five pages of,

650
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and, you know, let that out there, and people were like, yeah, this is kind of not bad, I can see you reading more of your prose,

651
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and I'm like, don't tell me that, tell me it's awful, tell me to stop, don't tell me I can do this, cause that's fucking scary,

652
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:45,000
you know, and every time I read some, like, God, I'm so envious of the people on Twitter who, like, post screenshots of every show they fucking watch,

653
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and like, make web-ems of every cool piece of animation, and I feel like that's a real service that I could be doing, you know, that I could be going through,

654
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I tried to do this, uh, like, a week ago, two weeks ago, when I was watching Moonphase, and like, I capped out this little segment that I was like,

655
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,000
this seems like it's probably one of Shin Onuma's, like, first defining moments, and I kind of posted it, but then I didn't feel anything afterwards,

656
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I can't even tell when I've made a tweet, people, like, really care about, cause everything I fucking post gets a thousand likes and retweets,

657
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I know I'm making that sound like, oh, whoa is me, everything gets so many likes, but it really does, like, make it so you don't even really know that you've had an impact,

658
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:29,000
unless it's like, way over the top, you know, like, the number of likes and retweets you get, um, it's like, I don't even know if it's helping anybody,

659
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
who just, did anybody care that Shin Onuma had a thing in some show you probably never fucking watched or cared about, cause it's 12 years old,

660
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:45,000
and who the hell is Shin Onuma, I haven't even made a video about him yet to make anybody care about him, um, you know, but then I see those people,

661
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and every time I'm like, man, is what I'm doing really helping people, you know, am I really, like, helping the anime community,

662
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:00,000
could, would I be more helpful if I was like, I don't know, type setting, scantilations or something, and of course I can't make money doing that,

663
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
so I'm gonna be, you know, I can't do as much if I'm doing something that doesn't make me any money, cause I have to get a regular job,

664
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:17,000
and I can only do whatever it is on the side, you know, um, which is in its own way kind of sad, and obviously I'm not very self-sacrificing about all this,

665
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:29,000
um, but Jesus, I wish I could fucking, I need to learn Japanese, cause I could do so much more, and I do feel bad, I feel like I, you know,

666
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I consider myself a journalist, and I say Gonzo journalist, and that's both a defense and a warning, like the reason I'm Gonzo is because,

667
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:48,000
you know, it lets you know, hey, I cannot necessarily be held to be, like, presenting accurate facts, this is just my interpretations,

668
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and that's, you know, some people might see it as, well, you're just using an excuse to not do more research, and I'm like, sure, fine,

669
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:04,000
you can accuse me of that, I certainly don't do as much research as I could, but it's also to warn you, like, hey, I haven't done my due diligence,

670
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:13,000
this is not facts, this is just how I'm interpreting the things that I see, you know, the data that I see, so, be aware that that's what you're getting yourselves into,

671
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:24,000
um, and, yeah, but I do feel bad that I'm not doing more of it, but like, you can't really fucking research this stuff if you don't know Japanese,

672
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:33,000
it's fucking impossible, there's just not enough, you know, information in English, and what there is is trickling out in a, like, a, you know, wave motion cannon,

673
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I love what they're doing, where they're translating interviews with Japanese creators right now, and it's all like, you know, hot, important people who people care about,

674
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:49,000
but it's like, this is one interview about, like, one cut from one show kind of thing, you know, like, sometimes a year old, and I'm like, I need to be able to fucking,

675
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:59,000
a journalist is someone who calls up the office of the fucking place, and, you know, gets the interview, which, in fairness, Wave Motion Cannon did this interview with Lan from the 2B Hero show,

676
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:08,000
that was great, that's some real journalism there, that they could reach out to him, and like, get this guy who, you know, is fucking just now being heard of, just like, breaking out,

677
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and having this like, moment, and it's like, this monumentous occasion for Chinese animation and stuff, and even then, like, as excited as Lan is to the fact that,

678
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:28,000
like, in American cares about his work at all, you know, on the flip side, how many people even read Wave Motion Cannon, you know, like, disinformation needs to be out there,

679
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,000
and that's when I feel like, well, I've got the platform, I've got the 250 subscribers, or 50,000 subscribers rather, but do they care?

680
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You know, like, if I become this, like, if I became a full-blown journal, it's like, yeah, I'm doing better work, but no one wants it, you know, people want the pop shit,

681
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:53,000
there's a reason that my biggest videos are like, reviews of, you know, shows I don't like, and stuff, it's, people aren't clamoring for the information,

682
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:04,000
they want the stories, and of course, the best journalists can spin the story, you know, can spin the info into a story, and, yeah, like, I feel like that's what I'm,

683
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:13,000
that's what I'd like to be able to do, but without knowing Japanese, it's so much harder, and being the, you know, insular, self-obsessed guy that I am,

684
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:22,000
being the guy who doesn't spend a month on a video, I spend a day on a video, I spend, you know, and I don't just mean, like, main-series videos,

685
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I mean, like, I'm constantly making shit, I always have something going on, I have three Let's Plays that I'm in the middle of editing.

686
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Let's Plays, like, nobody even cares, nobody even fucking cares about my Let's Plays, except for, like, this, his handful of people who are, like, hardcore fans,

687
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
but, you know, that's the kind of work I'm saddling myself with that's taking away from time I could be learning Japanese,

688
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:55,000
but, you know, doing Let's Plays fun and learning Japanese fucking blows, but it's something I hope I eventually do, you know,

689
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I don't know if I'm gonna get any more mature than I am now, so that's, I can't say, like, maybe when I'm grown up, that time has come and is here.

690
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:18,000
This is what I'm talking about, like, you know, I went on that whole rant, not thinking about the fact that this will come out before,

691
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and then people will just link this to that guy, so, you know, that's the kind of thing that's gonna happen,

692
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and I'd rather talk to him about it in person, so now I'm just gonna have to scrub 15 minutes out of this podcast that I don't even want to do that.

693
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Well, God, that's probably the end, this might be a shorter one, I thought I was actually gonna rant for, like, 40 minutes about this,

694
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:02,000
but I seem to have gotten all the ideas that were at the surface of my head out in a concentrated burst, so that might be the end,

695
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
and we'll leave it in case I remember something.

696
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So this video is gonna be coming out a little late, like, an extra day rather than at the end of the week.

697
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I know because it's already the 15th, as I'm recording this, like, about 45 minutes ago it became that.

698
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,000
In any case, just some parting thoughts, you know, I got a moderator for Ret Compendium,

699
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
gave it to rival Steven, who moderates the subreddit for the Procrastinators channel,

700
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
that we don't talk about all that much, but it's always in the descriptions,

701
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and, you know, after yesterday I felt like total shit until I did this recording, and then I went and got Ben.

702
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:56,000
We worked out, I felt much better after working out and eating something that wasn't fucking fast food for the first time in the day.

703
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I spent all night watching Chris Ott videos and all day today doing the same, and, yeah.

704
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You know, I find that for me, a bad mood is usually attributable to, like, it's usually more physiological.

705
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Like, whatever I'm mad about, I'm mad about it because of other reasons.

706
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Like, it's not really because it's that bad, like, there's a lot of things I can shrug off when I'm generally feeling good

707
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
that will make me feel shitty if I'm generally feeling shitty, so it's kind of funny in that way.

708
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But, man, I've just been reeling from the realization when I did the last part of this recording

709
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
that, like, I can't say anything anymore that has no repercussions.

710
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Like, I have too much of an audience now that knows my stuff too well, like, too many people who follow everything I do.

711
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And it's kind of funny, like, it used to be that the things I said didn't matter.

712
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Like, I could say fucking anything, and it just didn't matter because, uh, you know, I was nobody.

713
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And now that I'm, um, you know, someone popular, then it's like everything I say, like, has some kind of repercussion.

714
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Not that I'm saying, like, I'm gonna watch my words from now on.

715
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Like, I'm not that type of person.

716
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I'm always just gonna be, like, off the handle, but it's just, it's really interesting to sort of enter that world where, um, you know,

717
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,000
if I name drop somebody for any reason, that person's probably gonna hear about it because it wasn't just some guy who said it.

718
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It was DigiBro, who has 250,000 subscribers and who, you know, has fans who will send my stuff to the people I'm talking about.

719
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Um, or even not fans, just people who want to start something, you know, if I'm talking shit about somebody.

720
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Uh, and vice versa, like, anything anyone says about me, I hear about it.

721
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's, it's really funny to me when people are, like, shocked that I turn up somewhere, when people are like,

722
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
wow, you watch that YouTube channel or wow, you do that?

723
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah, of course I do. All I do is fucking watch YouTube.

724
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
All I do is consume stuff, you know?

725
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Like, I'm, whoever, if you're someone who sits at your computer all day and, like, you know, watches my videos,

726
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
like, I promise I sit at my computer more than you do and watch even more videos than you do.

727
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
You know, like, all I do is sit around and watch stuff.

728
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So, like, yeah, anytime someone mentions me, it gets sent to me.

729
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You know, someone's gonna fucking post it on my Reddit or something and I'm gonna watch it.

730
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I'm always around.

731
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Um, so, yeah, it's, it's kind of funny when people are like, oh my god, did you watch this channel?

732
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I watch every channel, um, if it's relevant to, like, the kind of stuff I'm doing, you know?

733
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'm gonna get sent it eventually.

734
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,000
So, yeah, that's funny to me just because I guess, I guess it's like people see it as if you have a big following,

735
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
you must just be busy all the time.

736
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Like, you know, somehow you're spending all your time doing something.

737
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I don't know what, you know, I don't know.

738
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I mean, I guess that's, like, there's a lot of big channels who they don't, you know, they don't respond to comments,

739
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
they don't seem to watch a lot of YouTube videos and stuff,

740
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
but the reason for that isn't because they're big, it's because it's just not what they do.

741
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You know, like, if you're someone who normally spends a lot of time, like, let's say you have a family,

742
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
you know, if you spend all your time with your family, no, you're not reading YouTube comments,

743
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
you know, you're not out there watching everybody else's videos and stuff,

744
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
but like, uh, that's not a consequence of having a big channel.

745
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Um, I, that's, you know, that's what I, I, I live my life just the way that probably most of my viewers do,

746
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
which is probably why so many of them connect with me, you know, because it's like, hey, this guy is exactly like me,

747
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,000
just articulate and, uh, and, uh, you know, and interesting in the way he thinks about things,

748
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
but yeah, I find that kind of funny.

749
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
But anyways, that about wraps up this, uh, this Decompression podcast.

750
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It was a very, a very necessary one, I guess, for me this week.

751
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Um, but this podcast is, it's funny because its purpose is kind of to get stuff out there and relieve stress,

752
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
but it can be stressful in itself just because it is a thing I have to make, you know, and I've got so much going on.

753
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And like right now, the consequence of me making this is that I'm not editing the new PCP that we just recorded, you know,

754
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and like now those are going to come out weirdly back to back.

755
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And, uh, the whole schedule of this channel is kind of fucked,

756
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
but it's because the person who cares the most is Nate, and Nate has the least time to deal with any of it.

757
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Like Nate is the one who by far puts the most effort into organizing the PCP and making sure it comes out,

758
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
you know, and like making sure everybody's on top of their game, but he personally can't work on it.

759
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You know, he doesn't have time to edit these videos and to make it all correct.

760
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And like, uh, and I'm the only one who's kind of reliable enough to expect that it'll actually come out like reasonably on time

761
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
because I edit fast and I don't put things off, um, the way everybody else will.

762
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Like in the early days of PCP, we were all editing.

763
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Like we would exchange editors and you can see that in most of the early videos.

764
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Like there's a credit for editor and like, you know, if Jesse edits one, he's going to put more effort in,

765
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
but it's going to take an extra fucking week before it comes out.

766
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Um, so, you know, it just kind of falls on me, which is funny because I'm doing a million things.

767
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So, you know, I'll put it off for a couple of days because I want to do the decompression chamber.

768
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I want to do this, uh, did you watch a dark video, you know?

769
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
But anyway, so that's it for now.

770
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I hope you enjoyed.

771
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Stay tuned.

772
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
The next one will probably be out in a week, but maybe it'll be a day late like this one.

773
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You know, it's not a strict format.

774
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Um, enjoy the music and have a nice day.

775
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Oh,

776
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Oh,

777
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Oh,

778
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oh,
