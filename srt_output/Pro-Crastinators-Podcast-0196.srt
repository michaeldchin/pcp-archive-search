00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,600
the best guy ever. Oh, who else is here? We got, yeah. Wait, is that, is the best guy

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,200
ever? Don't you mean, don't you mean my favorite cryptocurrency miner, Brad Garlinghouse? I'm

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,240
sorry. The mask has slipped. My name is Brad Garlinghouse. I am the CEO of Ripple Cryptocurrency.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,340
I've been fooling you all this anime bullshit, all this video game bullshit. It's been a

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,740
fucking ruse to pull you into my scheme, to profit to like 1% of my vast capital gains.

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,340
Finally, you've decided to contribute something to society.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,740
It all began 29 years ago when I snuck it to Ben Saint's Mother's Womb, who I knew would be a

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,380
ripe candidate for manipulation and emotional destruction later on. This is a long con I've

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:58,900
been running here. And as you can see, the fruits are ripe and abundant. Bravo, sir.

11
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,020
We got, yeah, you can hear the grass, Tom Oliver, Gibb and take, you know these guys.

12
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:12,860
And New York Times bestselling author DigiBro, creator of Road to Radcon 4, with Chapter

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,380
2, hopefully coming soon, but that's on you guys.

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Road to Radcon 4 asterisk, assuming you'd give us lots of money.

15
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,900
But if you do give us lots of money, you will see the thrilling continuation of the series

16
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,020
in which we introduce our main antagonist. Who could it be? Who could be the biggest

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:43,620
obstacle to making Radcon 4 happen? I think there's a distinct possibility that this is

18
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,540
not on the procrastinators channel and most of the people watching this have no idea what

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,860
the hell is happening. It's very possible that this is on my channel, in which case,

20
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,620
hello, my subscribers. This is the procrastinators podcast. It's been going on for like four

21
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,340
fucking five years. How long have we been doing this shit?

22
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,340
Like three, four, five years. Like three, four, five, two, one.

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,900
A lot of years. Whenever Undertale came out.

24
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,540
Eight, eight, 12, you know, what is this number?

25
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,420
We've been doing this podcast since Undertale came out.

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,900
That's true. The best thing to happen to the internet

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,380
since Undertale, the procrastinators podcast. That should be our tagline.

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:27,020
And the reason that it might be on my channel is that Brad Garlinghouse, the evil crypto

29
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,660
mastermind, has taken over the PCP channel. So in order to prevent...

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,820
And other channels as well. Many channels. He has an empire now.

31
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:47,100
In order to prevent Radcon 4 from becoming Bradcon 4, as per his evil plan, we must

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,700
continue the story. So give us money on Kickstarter.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,260
And also thanks everybody who already, because this Kickstarter has already funded almost

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,500
all the original stretch goals.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,740
Let's just quickly take a look at that. We've got, so last time there were 308 total backers.

36
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,900
As of the whole time, there's already 156 backers and it's, we're 22 days ago.

37
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,660
You said there were 308. And now there's 156?

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,780
I'm saying that on Radcon 3 there were.

39
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
Oh yes, of course.

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,620
So with 156 backers, we're already at $10,573. So we, Radcon 4 is happening. We've met our

41
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,140
first and second stretch goals. So there will be a Tiki Bar and the OVA will be made.

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,420
The important note in all that data you just spouted was that with half the number of people,

43
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,100
we have achieved more money.

44
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Correct. That's correct.

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,340
So really the important question is where the fuck are the rest of you guys? You goddamn

46
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,340
placards.

47
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,420
There's another 150 of you out there, 152, just waiting to give us money.

48
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,420
That is the 152 people who unsubscribed because of the politics discussion.

49
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Damn, we are the 152 who would not give to Radcon 4. The proud.

50
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Yeah. Well, I mean, if you guys want, now that we've established that, so hey, go give

51
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,260
it to Radcon 4. It's still happening. Don't worry about all this other bullshit. That's

52
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
going to happen no matter what.

53
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,780
I have a question for Ben before we continue about this topic.

54
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Oh, God.

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780
Ben, is this, find your phone.

56
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,780
No comment. Did I find my phone? No, it's gone.

57
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,780
Shit. I lost my phone for a while, but I ended up finding it.

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,780
So is this the crypto fascists I keep hearing about? They're just going around shilling

59
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
cryptocurrency, stealing people's channels.

60
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,780
I mean, he's crypto because he's mining Bitcoin and he's fascist because he's a bad man.

61
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,780
That's what I thought. I'm with you now.

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
I take back everything. You're right.

63
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,500
I think this literally counts. Yeah. Even I think this counts, right? It's certainly

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
fascist to steal somebody's channel without permission, right?

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
You know, I think that's a little bit loose use of the word fascist.

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,940
Like annexing another country, Garland House here has annexed our channels without our

67
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
permission.

68
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
I mean, that's true. That is true.

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,940
Fascism just means I don't like it. So, yeah.

70
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,940
That's probably the most honest definition of fascism I've heard.

71
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
And I definitely do not care for what I'm seeing here today.

72
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,100
According to Wikipedia, fascism is a form of far right authoritarian ultranationalism

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,700
characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
of society and of the economy.

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
That sounds like my boy, Brad.

76
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Sounds exactly like what's happening.

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,700
I can't believe it. I can't believe it. He was hiding in plain sight all along.

78
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,700
It's the crypto punks versus the crypto fascists, the ultimate battle.

79
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
That's right.

80
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,460
My only question is, will Brad continue to mine once the sun goes down?

81
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Yeah.

82
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,460
Like, how long will this continue?

83
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,460
I wish I had answers.

84
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,460
That'll be the final insult, where we're just going to have to bring out the big guns.

85
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,460
There's only so much injustice we can take.

86
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,460
The second the sun goes down, I'm tweeting about this man.

87
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,220
This man is still mining at its night.

88
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Listen, Brad, as one night miner to another, don't do it, man.

89
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
Consequences, man.

90
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
I suffer the consequences.

91
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
I want better for you, Brad.

92
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
Well, you got a...

93
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Known fascist sympathizer, Ben St. looking out.

94
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,220
You got to respect the hustle, though.

95
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
You got to hand it to him.

96
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,220
I do.

97
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Where don't mine at night came from?

98
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,220
The pony version of the Minecraft parody of the Ken Perry song.

99
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
That became a meme at Radcon 3.

100
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Yeah, that's correct.

101
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Ben got his ass kicked for mining at night during Radcon 3.

102
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,220
God, it's such a rich tapestry.

103
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,220
This is what we should do on every episode.

104
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Imagine if you're just the normal...

105
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,220
You're just the normal Digi Bro subscriber, bombing into this video, not knowing what to expect.

106
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,220
And already, with this many layers deep into PCP lore, they're gone.

107
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,220
They're just gone.

108
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
Well, this is why you need to watch Radcon 4 when it comes out,

109
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,220
and donate to it to make it happen, so you can understand it.

110
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:11,220
If you're not aware, you should watch the Radcon 3 playlist,

111
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
and all your answers will be revealed.

112
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,220
When are we going to do PCPU lecture PCP?

113
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
I think eventually.

114
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
That's actually a really good idea.

115
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,220
We're going to start from the beginning and go through the whole history.

116
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Give it a couple more read.

117
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Is that going to be a stretch?

118
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:35,220
We did the RFCK one at RFConK, and we allowed audience participation.

119
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
We could do the same thing with PCP.

120
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,220
We could have us, the audience, raise our hands.

121
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Hey, don't you remember that one time that this really stupid thing happened?

122
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,220
Imagine if we had a meetup, and the meetup was for the PCP lecture on the PCP.

123
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
We've long had this idea, at least I have,

124
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,220
of doing a public, more actual con where people can come and attend,

125
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
even if it's public or something, I don't know.

126
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,220
But then, with a gathering of people, we do that lecture.

127
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,220
That was the RFCK lecture, basically.

128
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Well, we'll steal their idea.

129
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,220
Which was great, by the way, and is coming soon.

130
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,220
Stealing their ideas, as if it was easy.

131
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,220
I hope it comes out before the Kickstarter ends,

132
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,220
so people will be tricked into giving more money.

133
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,220
I also hope that.

134
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Connor, Ethan, get on it.

135
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,220
I hope that by some magical fucking circumstance,

136
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,220
that the Stealing Your Dad episodes from Rancon 3

137
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,220
also come out before Rancon 4 happened.

138
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,220
Someone suggested making that a stretch goal for this Kickstarter.

139
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,220
They're almost all done!

140
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,220
Munchie said that two of them are complete, one of them is almost done.

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,220
He just wants all three of them to be done before he releases them,

142
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
and he literally just doesn't care enough to...

143
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
What a fool.

144
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
He simply doesn't...

145
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,220
See, that means that it's up to you people to create pressure.

146
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
No, they did! They created...

147
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,220
I don't know if you know this,

148
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,220
people from my Discord formed a Discord

149
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,220
specifically to Badger Munchie about this.

150
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
And they did so. They ran a whole campaign,

151
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
and he literally said what I just told you,

152
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
and has still not done anything.

153
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
Well, that's not enough pressure, obviously.

154
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
He just doesn't care.

155
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,220
He needs to feel the sting.

156
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
He needs to feel the pain of not releasing the...

157
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
What can we do to Munchie?

158
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,220
He's too powerful.

159
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,220
I don't know.

160
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
He's got nothing to lose.

161
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,220
I guess you're right.

162
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
I think the people have to, from that Discord,

163
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,220
raid RFCK,

164
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,220
try to destroy his hometown.

165
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
That's the only way that will get us attention.

166
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,220
I mean, RFCK and Stealing Your Dads,

167
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,220
I like to think they exist in the same universe,

168
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
at different timelines.

169
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,220
So I see no canonical conflict

170
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,220
between a bunch of Stealing Your Dad heads

171
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,220
bomb in from the dystopian post-slime future

172
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
to say, fuck you.

173
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Do it.

174
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
Maybe the unborn disaster was right.

175
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
See, the most unfortunate thing about it to me...

176
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,220
Yeah, it's time like shenanigans now.

177
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,220
Like, while there may be extant episodes

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
of Stealing Your Dads,

179
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
they were merely podcasts.

180
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
The only episodes that are, like, good

181
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
are the ones that have not come out yet.

182
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,220
So I don't know if there are Stealing Your Dad heads

183
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
the way that there would be if the show was out.

184
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
I mean, probably.

185
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
Probably.

186
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
When are we gonna get the man and the boy?

187
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Oh, boy.

188
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,220
Oh, yeah.

189
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,220
When are we gonna get GRPJ, Kingdom Hearts 2?

190
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Oh, no.

191
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
We're all gonna call that right now.

192
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
That's right.

193
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I'm not me.

194
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
I'm such a good boy.

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
I did all my projects.

196
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
You did.

197
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,220
I mean, you got T-Bap Resurrection out.

198
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
I got Ten Paces in Drawout.

199
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
I did it all.

200
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
That's true.

201
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
I'm thorough.

202
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,220
Everything PCP related I've gotten done.

203
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
It's only my personal projects that are taking a little while.

204
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
They're gonna take a little while longer now.

205
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
That was your father's idea.

206
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,220
Nobody ever...

207
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Yeah.

208
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Let me break it down for people, just the story of what's going on.

209
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Here's your little public service announcement.

210
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
The following channels have been hacked.

211
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,220
It definitely seems like it's my fault.

212
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,220
And I'll tell everybody why in a minute.

213
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
But these are the channels.

214
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,220
My main best guy ever, which is currently renamed Brad Garlinghouse and is streaming

215
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,220
some cryptocurrency stream that I have no control over.

216
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,220
The name of the video is RippleXRP Goes To The Moon Explosion Emoji.

217
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,220
New cryptocurrency partnership and bullish news.

218
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
3,000 people are watching this.

219
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,220
Redcon5, Crypto's On The Moon.

220
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Why don't I pull these kind of numbers when I stream?

221
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,220
Either on my channel or on my fucking Twitch.

222
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
God damn it.

223
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
I'd be a partner right now, Brad.

224
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Maybe a lot of them are fake viewers, though.

225
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
That was my thought.

226
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,220
I mean, I think people are watching for the drama.

227
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
They're like, this is wrong.

228
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
This is fucked up, which I totally understand.

229
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,220
I mean, this guy's gotta be botting as well, right?

230
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
No doubt.

231
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,220
It's not, by the way, we're gonna laugh.

232
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
Brad Garlinghouse, really funny.

233
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,220
It is not actually Brad Garlinghouse, just to be absolutely clear.

234
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of some company.

235
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
This is an important man.

236
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
It's like Elon Musk of crypto.

237
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
It's not actually him.

238
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,220
I've been looking into it and he's a very rich man who owns this Ripple company,

239
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,220
which basically just moves money of various types around.

240
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Anything that can be used as currency, basically.

241
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,220
It is a way of trading that internationally.

242
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Apparently, they're under a huge lawsuit,

243
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,220
and he's in trouble for skirting the law.

244
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
That's why he's trying to pull a couple of side hustles,

245
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,220
like capitalizing a couple of YouTube channels here and there,

246
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,220
just grab them while you can.

247
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,220
It seems to be common in the crypto world for things like,

248
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,220
for hackers to take people's channels,

249
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,220
livestream under names that are famous in the crypto world,

250
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
such as this one.

251
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,220
But the actual people who took your channel,

252
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,220
you can tell us about.

253
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Yeah, please do.

254
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Well, okay.

255
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,220
You know, I'll tell you.

256
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,220
So there's a couple interesting things that happened over the last couple of days,

257
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
so I've been talking of two.

258
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,220
So, okay, this seems to have happened on around the 22nd or the 23rd,

259
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
I think on the 23rd.

260
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
So just so everybody knows, I'm already in contact.

261
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,220
Oh, by the way, all the channels, just so you know,

262
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,220
all the channels that are not us.

263
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,220
It is Best Guy Ever, Bestie Boy, Best Guy Ever livestreams,

264
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,220
The Procrastinators, The Poddycast, T-Bap, and CanTent.

265
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,220
All of those have been hijacked.

266
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Yesterday, I went through T-Bap,

267
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,220
and I ripped every video that I could,

268
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
just in case the worst happened.

269
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
I could not get all of them.

270
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,220
Some of them I could not rip because they contained music.

271
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
They were maybe like a dozen of those.

272
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Oh, Ben, you gotta use, you can get them.

273
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,220
You just gotta use a multitude of YouTube rip sites.

274
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,220
I recommend switching between Clip Converter and several others.

275
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,220
I use Clip Converter to get the ones that I did manage.

276
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,220
What you gotta do is you have to use VLC.

277
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,220
You can download YouTube videos with VLC.

278
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Oh, no shit.

279
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
It works 100% of the time.

280
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,220
I need to remember to do that from now on.

281
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
I got Phantom Reviews. I could not get Keg Reviews.

282
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Keg Reviews putting your hoof down was copyright claim.

283
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,220
That needs to be preserved for all time. It has to be saved.

284
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,220
It's a beloved video by me, if no one else.

285
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Okay, so those are all the channels.

286
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Here's what happened, everybody.

287
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,220
What happened was, I recently have been looking,

288
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
a lot of people were like, oh my God, Nate,

289
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
did you not two-factor authenticate your channels?

290
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Lol, did you use the same password?

291
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
No, this is not the issue.

292
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
What happened was, by the way, we have checked,

293
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,220
there have been no suspicious logins from China or Russia.

294
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
I don't know if you saw my screenshot.

295
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
On T-Bap, there was a suspicious login account from Russia

296
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,220
on January 1st.

297
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,220
January 1st?

298
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Yeah, I screenshoted it.

299
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Okay, I believe you. That must have just been before this.

300
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
That must have been just an unrelated, I guess,

301
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
separate hack thing.

302
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Because here's what happened.

303
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
I've been talking...

304
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
I've been so lucrative.

305
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
I'm just saying, maybe potentially,

306
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
I do use a VPN.

307
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
I don't think I've ever set myself to Russia.

308
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Maybe I said to Russia and logged in.

309
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
I don't think so, but I don't know, whatever.

310
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
I was getting...

311
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Recently, I'm doing one last

312
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Weagawa

313
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
before I wrap up Weagawa's for now

314
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
and are focusing on the bigger content,

315
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
as I've told a bunch of times.

316
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
For that, I was like, okay,

317
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
it would be really funny and also cool

318
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
and thematically appropriate

319
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
to finally get one ad on the last

320
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Weagawa for now.

321
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
I more aggressively was looking through

322
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
all the messages I get

323
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
to see what ads are going to be.

324
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
And I will still be talking to.

325
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
But one of them...

326
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
I should have known, man. I should have known.

327
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
But here's what happened. There was just like

328
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,220
one of those emails was like, hey, do you want to do this thing?

329
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
We'll pay you to, like,

330
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
promote this software. And so what I said was like,

331
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
there was a link to a website

332
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,220
and let me actually go get the name of this.

333
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Because this is, I mean, at the very least other people

334
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
can avoid this. Nobody clicked this link

335
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
that you're about to leave the name of.

336
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
No one clicked on this link from this company.

337
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
And here's the fascinating thing. This website

338
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
is extremely professional looking.

339
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
And this is why I was tricked.

340
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
It's supposed to be like a cloud software

341
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
like, what's that thing where you're

342
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
streaming gameplay between things?

343
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
This is like the general pitch they had.

344
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,220
Their website looks really good.

345
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,220
And the whole thing was in English, the email.

346
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
But I noticed that it seemed to be from,

347
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
it was like Russian text or something.

348
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
So I was a little bit, okay, I don't know what this is about.

349
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,220
So they just say like, hey,

350
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
download this software. So I mentioned this one time

351
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
and I'm like, okay guys, I'm open to this

352
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
if it's good. Can you like, tell me what

353
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
you need me to do if I'm going to do this?

354
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
They respond and they say,

355
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
download this software, show it off in a video

356
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
and like, we'll pay you for it.

357
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
So I'm like, okay, I will go

358
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
see what this is about. So I'm looking

359
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,220
into it and I, this is,

360
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
I go to the website, everything's fine. I'm just like,

361
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
okay, I mean, I'm not going to agree

362
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
to do this yet until I know

363
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
what I'm getting myself into. But what I will

364
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
do is just download the software

365
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,220
and like, see what it is. Cause that

366
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
should be fine, right? And what I believe

367
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
happened is that I download

368
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,220
the thing, I install it and

369
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
nothing seemed

370
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
to happen on my computer. I was like, this is

371
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
weird. I don't know what happened.

372
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
Nothing changed. But then

373
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
several days later,

374
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
every YouTube account that like

375
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
I just am logged into

376
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
generally speaking, all the

377
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
accounts on there had disappeared

378
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
from my Google accounts and

379
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
they, so they seem to have been like moved

380
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
to other people's Google accounts.

381
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
So what I think happened is that there's

382
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,220
some bot in here that uses either

383
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
like your Google, like your cookies

384
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
cache or maybe like the fact that I'm

385
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
currently logged in because there were no

386
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
suspicious logins from anywhere else. It probably

387
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,220
was done from like my machine

388
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
that it just went in there. It like

389
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
hijacked the fucking

390
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
links to all these accounts and

391
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
this is something you can do on Google. You can

392
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
just move your account to like another

393
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
Google account on your YouTube channel.

394
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
So I think that was done

395
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
by at least some kind of intelligence

396
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,220
because it wasn't done to my

397
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,220
vast number of just like small little throwaway

398
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
YouTube accounts I make for various purposes, like test

399
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
uploads and stuff. It was only

400
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
like the big ones that are regularly used

401
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,220
and have some value. So clearly

402
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
even though like BGE live streams probably

403
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
has less than a thousand subs, right?

404
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,220
It's got like 1500, but I do upload

405
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
like twice a week and it gets

406
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
you know, like 500 views

407
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
per video. So that's not zero.

408
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,220
So I guess they thought that was above their

409
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,220
threshold for whatever reason.

410
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
But yeah, that's

411
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
pretty much the full story of like what I know

412
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
and so I'll just tell everybody that I

413
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
have contacted Google

414
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
for all of these

415
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,220
things, for all these different accounts.

416
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
I've got like separate tickets running for each

417
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
different account and like I seem

418
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,220
to be in contact with humans for all of them

419
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
and apparently they are working

420
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
to sort it out. And from what I've heard

421
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,220
this isn't confirmed, it takes

422
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
like people have reported that when this has happened

423
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
because this is a fairly common thing, it happened

424
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
to Pogo apparently, famous music

425
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,220
guy on YouTube and a bunch of other people

426
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
that like it takes around

427
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
two weeks before things get resolved

428
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
typically speaking. So you might

429
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
not see any of these channels active for another

430
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
two weeks. Hopefully after that they're back.

431
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
That's what I know.

432
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,220
I seem to see the only thing that's

433
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
really bad right now is that they're

434
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
actively streaming on my personal

435
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
YouTube channel and best guy ever.

436
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
And you know, some people

437
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
are unsubscribing and you know that's too bad.

438
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,220
I hope no one's being tricked into buying fucking crypto.

439
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
I highly doubt it.

440
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,220
I don't even understand how, like

441
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,220
who the fuck would fall for this shit? Like how does this even

442
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
work? How does this racket even

443
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
there was somebody in my discord theorizing

444
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
that like maybe they literally

445
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
just do this to like smear the name

446
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
of Brad

447
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
Garlinghouse or whatever.

448
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
But I don't know. I feel like just some

449
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Whoever it is though, what gives me a little

450
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,220
bit of happiness is that like knowing the

451
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,220
MO, if these people want to

452
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
they could tank and delete everything

453
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
or just fuck up everything on all

454
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
these channels if they so chose.

455
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
But it seems like the MO is just

456
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
to use them for whatever reach they have

457
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
and generally speaking they seem

458
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
to come back. And there seems to be a pretty

459
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,220
healthy like reversal process

460
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
when you get your shit back. Like if videos

461
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,220
are deleted within a certain time frame

462
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
YouTube can restore them. So even if

463
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
like someone was telling me that like hey Nate

464
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
seems like the number of videos on your channel is dropping

465
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
that's ominous.

466
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I didn't look into it, but even if that's

467
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
true, hopefully they'll be able to be revived

468
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
if not, I know a bunch of people are downloading videos

469
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,220
and including me, I've got most of the important

470
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,220
ones stored, so

471
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
we'll see. I guess we'll just see in time.

472
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Most of the important ones. That's

473
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
not good enough.

474
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
I need all of them.

475
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
I don't have literally all of them, it's true

476
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
but I have all of like, I have every best

477
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
anime ever, best game ever and like all the

478
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
viagra was I think from the last several years.

479
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
So I should

480
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
have pretty much everything. We'll see.

481
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
We'll see. So obviously it's not good

482
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
I can tell people don't be too worried

483
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,220
if you're concerned. I'm generally pretty optimistic.

484
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
They changed your channel banner.

485
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
They changed the banner?

486
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,220
They changed the icon now?

487
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,220
They replaced my little icon face.

488
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
I still see you. I still see your face.

489
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
I refreshed it and I see

490
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Brad on here, but I don't know.

491
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Also all the affected channels have

492
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
strings of Russian

493
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
text in the about page that seem to be

494
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,220
like passages from

495
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Fight Club and or the Bible

496
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
or something. Just like edgy

497
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
posts about

498
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
like in the night we do

499
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,220
dangerous things and in the morning

500
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220
we only regret. No, I mean once she searched

501
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,220
them and they were from Fight Club, like literally.

502
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,220
It's just quotes from Fight Club.

503
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
Maybe they know I'm a big fan of Fight Club.

504
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,220
He's tossing your bone here.

505
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
You'd appreciate it.

506
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
Anarchy in the UK, bro.

507
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Let's fuck them up.

508
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Well, that's the status.

509
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Hopefully things will be fixed soon.

510
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
I don't know. I don't know.

511
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
That's it. That's all I got.

512
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
Oh, boy. Well,

513
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
if you don't want Radcon to become

514
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Bradcon, then you've got to

515
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,220
donate to the Kickstarter.

516
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Our lawyers advise us

517
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
that donating to Radcon for it will in no way

518
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,220
save Radcon from becoming

519
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Bradcon.

520
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
I mean, I don't know.

521
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,220
Maybe some people will think

522
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
considering there is a Kickstarter with a good

523
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
amount of money attached to her right now,

524
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
I don't know if people might think, like, is this some sort of

525
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
fucking publicity stuff? This is odd timing.

526
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
I mean, there's no doubt about that.

527
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
I mean, it was definitely,

528
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
I was pretty upset just this morning

529
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
because I scheduled my video to come out at

530
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,220
12. So, and of course

531
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
it came out alongside this. It's not that

532
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
it's not that I'm

533
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
mad that it's sold my

534
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
Thunder. It's that it's funnier than my fucking

535
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
video. That's what makes me mad.

536
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
That is unfortunate. The Brad Garlinghouse

537
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
name is funnier than

538
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
this story that I think is hilarious.

539
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
I am seeing a lot of Brad Garlinghouse

540
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
comments on the

541
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Digibro light novel. Sorry, dude.

542
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
You just got to lean into it.

543
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
It's given you the path forward. That's right.

544
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,220
We can capitalize on this.

545
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Brad Garlinghouse is

546
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
definitely going to be

547
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
in the Royal Rumble at Radcon.

548
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
He's clearly the main villain.

549
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
There's no doubt about it.

550
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
So, you know, pledge if you want to see

551
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
that. I mean, we're probably going to

552
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,220
definitely going to be doing it already.

553
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
Indeed.

554
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
What's going to happen to the party cast?

555
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
I'm restarting my phone.

556
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
Our ship is going to get sunk.

557
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Our ship is currently sinking. We're bailing out

558
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
the water. Hippo and BGE Boy

559
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
are currently bailing things as fast

560
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
as they can. Hopefully we stay afloat.

561
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
I mean, there is a possibility

562
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
that some or all of these channels

563
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
don't come back. But, like, even if that

564
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
happens, we're just going to make new ones

565
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
and, like, re-upload as much as we can

566
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
and just keep going. I mean,

567
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,220
I don't know. Hopefully that won't be too bad.

568
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
I mean, the thing that sucks

569
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
not so much, like, if that's

570
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
the case, you know, if, like, you can't get them

571
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
back, the worst thing

572
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
is not that we can't have them back,

573
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
but they still have them.

574
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
That, I mean, yeah. They still have

575
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,220
your channel, like,

576
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
anything that links to your channel will now

577
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,220
link to Brad Garlinghouse.

578
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
I have some fear that, like,

579
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
I mean, just considering the legality,

580
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,220
it seems to me that this, I don't know this for sure,

581
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,220
but it seems to me the most likely thing is that

582
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
this was done, like, via, like, my personal

583
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
longings, that, like, Google

584
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
will be like, sorry, Nate, like, sure,

585
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
you can prove you're you, but, like, this

586
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
was done on your account. We can't

587
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
prove you didn't do this. We don't have the

588
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
authority to just give them back. I mean, if they were to say that,

589
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
that would be the most fucking, like, pretending

590
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,220
to be ignorant thing I've ever heard, like...

591
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,220
I mean, I'd hope so. I would hope so.

592
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
Well, even if it's from your account, it's not

593
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,220
like you can't take

594
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,220
it back if it was, like, a mistake, like,

595
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,220
oh, I accidentally did this. Can you please

596
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
undo this? Like, Google can't say no.

597
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
I guess you're right. That's just stupid.

598
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm just thinking, like, what about respecting the

599
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
rights of, in this case, like, they're a criminal

600
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
clearly, but, like, the other person...

601
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
Well, hold on. If you, if they believe

602
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,220
the claim that you

603
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,220
accidentally moved it to this other thing,

604
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,220
how would it be... like, that would mean

605
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,220
that this is, like, two different... this is

606
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,220
one person, basically. How would it be

607
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,220
disrespecting that channel's rights?

608
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Like, either way, you're the original...

609
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
Or what if?

610
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,220
Your account is linked to the channel.

611
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,220
The hypothetical I fear slightly

612
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
is, like, what if I had under the table

613
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
made an agreement to, like, sell my account

614
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
to these people, which I totally didn't

615
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
do, to sell my account to Brad Garlinghouse

616
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
stuff's

617
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
wallet full of money that I did,

618
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
in fact, do the thing I'm saying with. What if

619
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,220
I had sold it to them, and they're like,

620
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,220
well, I mean, you know, that's your business

621
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
if your account got... we don't have the authority

622
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
to just take it from other people.

623
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
But it seems unlikely, I know.

624
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
I'm just thinking about how my...

625
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
One of my friends, one time,

626
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,220
sold a World of Warcraft

627
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,220
account to somebody for $400,

628
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
and

629
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,220
that person then used it to,

630
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
like,

631
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
like, just farm gold or whatever, like,

632
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,220
he turned it into a bot, and

633
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
got caught by Blizzard, and they returned

634
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
the account to my friend.

635
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Like, he just got to keep the money,

636
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
so, you know, sometimes things go...

637
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Well, how an extra good.

638
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Dude,

639
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
when you get the channel back, it's going to come

640
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
with so much cryptocurrency.

641
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,220
That would be...

642
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
That, I've looked at my World of Warcraft account,

643
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,220
actually. A bot stole it,

644
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
and then when I got back,

645
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
I just had so much vast wealth

646
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
in the game. I was a god.

647
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
They just helped me out.

648
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
You know, thinking back on it now,

649
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
actually, that is fucking hilarious.

650
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Fuck yeah. But, uh, thinking back,

651
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
I remember my League of Legends account,

652
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
I think this is one of the main reasons

653
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
I stopped playing. Oh, no, I think I didn't play

654
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
for a long time. In that lapse,

655
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
like, I noticed that I couldn't get back in.

656
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
It seemed like it had been stolen, or something had

657
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
happened with it, and I could... Yeah, I definitely

658
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
had been stolen. I couldn't get into it.

659
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
And I, like, there was some... I had some average,

660
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
ooh, maybe I'll, like, try to get in and, like,

661
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
help my friends, but then I was like, oh wait, it's League of Legends.

662
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,220
I'm not gonna put in the effort to get back in there

663
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,220
just to, you know, lose more money and stuff.

664
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,220
Uh, so, thank you, hackers.

665
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
You saved me on the one hand, you hurt me on the other.

666
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
All in all, that's what I call balance.

667
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
That's balance.

668
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
By the way, um, I'm getting

669
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
the name of the company. Okay, got it.

670
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
So, this is the email I got.

671
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
It's just, it's this company, Vantex.

672
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
V-O-N-T-E-X.

673
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
That's the one who messaged me. Guys,

674
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
in my recommendation, I would not accept a deal

675
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
from Vantex Promo.

676
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
Uh, if you get an email from them,

677
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,220
they're, uh, they're, I don't mean to

678
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
disperse, disperse, disperse the good name

679
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
of the Vantex corporation.

680
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,220
But, uh, whatever. Yes, you do.

681
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,220
But they are, they are literally the real crypto fashists.

682
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
I mean, maybe it's like a Brad Garlinghouse thing

683
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
where, like, they're just using a different name

684
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,220
to fuck with people. I mean, I don't know.

685
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
I mean, probably not. And the other thing is,

686
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
I try, one of the things I did early on,

687
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220
before I installed the software, was I was just like,

688
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Google these guys and, like, see what they are.

689
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
It's like, what the product is. Like, there was, like,

690
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
zero results on the internet for Vantex,

691
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
like, what, why.

692
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
So I should have known.

693
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
You should have done that.

694
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
I was thinking myself, I'm being such a

695
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
big brain ethical boy right now.

696
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Like, I am absolutely not going to agree to just

697
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
take these people's money until I know it's like

698
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
a product and I'm willing to use it, blah, blah, blah.

699
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
But I will just try out the software.

700
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
That couldn't hurt, right?

701
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
Little did you know.

702
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Little did I know.

703
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Yep, that's correct.

704
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,220
That's correct.

705
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
More like soft skull.

706
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
You got on you there.

707
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
As opposed to what?

708
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
You know, like a soft spot on your skull,

709
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
cause you're like a baby.

710
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
Oh, well, yeah, but it sounded like you were saying

711
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,220
soft skull, like that was a play on something I'd said

712
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
previously. Yeah, the software.

713
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,220
Oh, right.

714
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Yeah, see.

715
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
Got it. Well, yeah, I have a small brain

716
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
both confirmed to this point.

717
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Very soft.

718
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Very smooth.

719
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
Very, very smooth. No wrinkles here.

720
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
So my computer is definitely still

721
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
compromised and very likely still

722
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,220
has this operating. So I'm

723
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
spending the vast majority of time

724
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
unplugged from the internet on that machine

725
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
because I need to wipe it.

726
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
As Tom advised, I need to just completely

727
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
destroy the computer and rebuild it

728
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
software from the ground up, which I will do.

729
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,220
But I'm in the middle

730
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,220
of editing something and I am terrified

731
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
of rebooting it

732
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,220
and not being able to like make all the weird

733
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
connections. You know how if people use Vegas

734
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
like you pull files from all over your computer,

735
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
I've got things like a download folder and like

736
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,220
like an editing folder and

737
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,220
the reason I don't have that problem is that

738
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
anything I'm working on, I keep

739
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
exclusively on the desktop

740
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
and it's a great motivator

741
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
because I hate having

742
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
shit on my desktop. So I will

743
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
literally edit the video just to get the

744
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
fucking shit off my desktop. But what happens

745
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
when your editing project is six months long

746
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
though, just by virtue of the price?

747
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
That has happened and it's miserable.

748
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
It fucking sucks. There's too much shit on

749
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
my desktop. Well I mean

750
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
so I'm hoping to have that video done

751
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
the one I'm working on soon and it'll be ready

752
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
to go. This much discussed Nate's working

753
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
on a video for the end of the month or whatever.

754
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
I mean there's been some derailings

755
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
even before this Radcon 4 really took

756
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
up a good chunk of time. But like

757
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
I might have it ready real quick

758
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
I just won't have a place to upload it

759
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
until I have the channel back

760
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
and I'm just gonna give it a couple weeks

761
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
to see if the channel returns at all

762
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
before I make best guy ever

763
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Redux or whatever the fuck

764
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
thing I have to do to keep moving. Second

765
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
best guy ever. Secondest

766
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,220
best guy in the world will be

767
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,220
the second channel. I'm looking forward to it.

768
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Well if you need to, I can temporarily host it

769
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,220
on my channel too.

770
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Have everybody shit.

771
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
I did that with

772
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
one of Jesse's videos once. There was

773
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
a Ground Zero's

774
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
vlog he did that's on After Dark.

775
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
It never got re-uploaded anywhere else. It's just

776
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,220
on After Dark.

777
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Yeah it must have been years ago I forgot

778
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
about that.

779
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
So in other

780
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
news, today

781
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I got

782
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
television

783
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
for the first time in years.

784
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Television. Why? What's that?

785
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
Did you watch Big Bang Theory Use Me?

786
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Because I found out

787
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
that these days

788
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
good old

789
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
satellite but

790
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,220
cable? No not cable.

791
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
Antenna.

792
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Antenna TV.

793
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Well there ain't no bunny ears no more.

794
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
The technology has come a long way.

795
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
And so

796
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,220
I just like 25 bucks on Amazon

797
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,220
bought this big flat

798
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
thing that you put in your window and I've got

799
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,220
50 channels. So why the fuck do I ever need cable?

800
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
It's pretty sick.

801
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
I'm just saying.

802
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
It's funny to me to think

803
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
like

804
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
TV kept advancing

805
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,220
and getting crazier and it's like cable

806
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
and now you need a thousand million channels

807
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
and now you need all this extra shit

808
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,220
and then the internet came along

809
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
and I was like I don't need cable. What the fuck

810
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
would I need it for? Well the answer to that

811
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
is the Olympics

812
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,220
or

813
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
just like CNN

814
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
that occasionally throw

815
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,220
something on

816
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
PBS front line documentaries

817
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,220
which are not live streamed or shown anywhere

818
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,220
for some reason.

819
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
No the dem debates are all live streamed.

820
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
I haven't seen them live streamed.

821
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
They're on CNN. I'm sure they're around.

822
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
What about the replays though?

823
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
They don't have any replays for people like me

824
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
who don't watch them live right?

825
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,220
No. Just watch your favorite

826
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
alt-right commenters review of the

827
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,220
how do you think I'm informed nowadays?

828
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
That is

829
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
unironically the better way to watch it

830
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,220
because I mean they cut out the filler

831
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
so I mean you know it's

832
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,220
there's a bunch of

833
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
there's a bunch of people who just live stream

834
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,220
they're like live reacting

835
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
to the debate while it's happening so

836
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
that could be better. That sounds definitely

837
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
better. The debates are fucking miserable.

838
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
They're boring. It's shit. They're terrible.

839
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
They're fucking I mean what are they

840
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
on like five or six? I'm just saying like I'm

841
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
sure they're all been consistent with the shit.

842
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
There's like five now.

843
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,220
I think the last one was the final one before

844
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
the caucuses started. On average

845
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
one thing happens in three hours

846
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
and you'll hear about it.

847
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Yeah.

848
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
You'll hear. The only story

849
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
from the last one was the thing with

850
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
Warren and Sandy and it was all over Twitter.

851
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
Literally all that fucking

852
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
happened. It was so boring and terrible.

853
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
That's true. I mean we know their positions now it's about

854
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
whatever fucking clash is happening.

855
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Well hey speaking of TV do you have

856
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
a cartoon network on there?

857
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,220
The one thing I kind of want to watch

858
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
sometimes is like Toonami

859
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
slash Adult Swim. I'm like oh that'd be fun

860
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
to just turn on. It would have been nice to have

861
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,220
but I think that's on cable.

862
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
We get some kind of food channels.

863
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
I literally just hooked this up like right before

864
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,220
we started the podcast so I have not

865
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
explored it at all.

866
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
I just bought a TV for the bedroom

867
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
and an antenna.

868
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
I remember trying to watch Rick and

869
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
Morty like when we were

870
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
at the time we did the

871
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
60 minutes or whatever

872
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
and it's so fucking weird on the Adult Swim

873
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
website. They're like streaming

874
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
here. Click here to watch the new Rick and Morty

875
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
episode and then they're like dot dot dot

876
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
if you have Hulu

877
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
or fucking blah blah blah.

878
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
It's like why would you just lead with

879
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
I need Hulu to watch it or whatever

880
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
they want you to be like well I guess I'll just get

881
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
fucking cable right now.

882
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,220
I guess you got me.

883
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
There must be people dumb enough to do that otherwise

884
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
we'll be doing that.

885
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
If I really need to watch you know Rick and Morty

886
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
right then and there on there

887
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
every time they put up these weird

888
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Roblox Mike I'm just saying on the high seas

889
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
fuck you.

890
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
I'm a thousand percent

891
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
more into piracy than

892
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,220
anything else.

893
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
I didn't really miss TV

894
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
at all

895
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
and I still really don't

896
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,220
but it's like the idea that

897
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
if I really have nothing

898
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
to do there is a room I can go into

899
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
and just put something on

900
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
and it will put flashing lights and information

901
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
in front of me without me having to decide

902
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
what to put on. Yes.

903
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Because I spend a lot of time

904
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
like YouTube

905
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
unfortunately not enough fucking

906
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
shit comes out.

907
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
I'm always star for more YouTube content

908
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
and I'll sit there like

909
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
maybe May just cooked dinner

910
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
we've got all this beautiful food laid out

911
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
in front of me on this TV tray

912
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
for 15 minutes trying to find something

913
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
to watch while I eat because there's nothing

914
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
on YouTube.

915
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,220
So in situations like that

916
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
it might be nice to just

917
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
I mean granted I put the TV in the bedroom

918
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
but...

919
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
I do like sometimes

920
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
putting on like the BBC news channel

921
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,220
when I'm just like

922
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
waking up making breakfast or something.

923
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Black Hawk news channel.

924
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
I just love seeing that on screen

925
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
like a huge

926
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
but anyway

927
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
but like

928
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
they just do the news and it's so boring

929
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
and so like in the background

930
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
occasionally I hear about like oh something's happening

931
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm like oh cool I'm just drinking my coffee

932
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
and waking up

933
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
it's a nice little like noise box I guess.

934
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
It is aesthetically pleasing

935
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
to kind of be passively informed about

936
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
what's going on in the world even if you know

937
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
mainstream news maybe they got some issues

938
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
I mean I'm passively informed of what's going on

939
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
in the news every day anyways because I watch

940
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
YouTube and I trust that more than

941
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
any of the other news outlets but

942
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I guess the revelation

943
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,220
I would say is simply that

944
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,220
cable is obviously

945
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
not worth paying for

946
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
because you have to pay for it every month

947
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
but an antenna is just $25

948
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
and you have those channels forever

949
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
so

950
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
why not?

951
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
That's all I have to say on the matter.

952
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
I've got some news

953
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
I know what it is

954
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
and I'm a big fan.

955
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
It's the Lord of Ghosts comic

956
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Chapter 2 is out.

957
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
I haven't read it yet but

958
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
you're way short to do it

959
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
because it's way better than the Vapors has ever

960
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
or will ever be.

961
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Shit.

962
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
That pony fucking comic about slime

963
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Garbagio

964
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
put it in the trash where it belongs

965
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
it's all about the new hot joke.

966
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
It's readable on

967
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
gibbentake.site

968
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm really proud

969
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
of what I've been

970
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
doing.

971
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
I have to ask

972
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
that one shot of the clock tower

973
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
that was homestucked

974
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,220
you didn't actually draw that whole thing did you?

975
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
I copy pasted a few places

976
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
but yeah I kind of drew the whole thing.

977
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Oh wow.

978
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
It was weird.

979
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
I was drawing it.

980
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
It's traced so it's not like

981
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
disclosure.

982
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
But like

983
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
it was sort of discovering that

984
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
I guess I just like the act of drawing

985
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
because this is really inefficient

986
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
and not even that useful.

987
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
It's like a big like wow moment

988
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
but it's also kind of pointless

989
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
and you wouldn't need to do that really

990
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
and I did it anyway and it took a long time

991
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,220
but I just liked it.

992
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
I loved that little moment where you flash between

993
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
like that and then the next panel

994
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,220
of the like almost chibi-fied

995
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
like big eye of the tower

996
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
and it's a different moment and incidentally

997
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
the whole comic is probably the most attractive

998
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
looking thing you've ever drawn

999
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
up to this point and I've absolutely

1000
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,220
like it feels like a huge

1001
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
jump in your skill.

1002
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
I don't know if I thought that about chapter one

1003
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
but with chapter two I really stopped

1004
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,220
and felt it out and really

1005
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
really enjoyed reading it.

1006
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
I gotta read it.

1007
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
Can I understand this comic

1008
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
if I don't know anything about it?

1009
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
Yes Digi, yes you can.

1010
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Yeah, I've

1011
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
written the entire thing to

1012
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,220
be its own adventure and you don't need to know

1013
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,220
anything about R.C.K.

1014
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
There is like a little bit of backstory

1015
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,220
to catch you up on the basics

1016
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,220
of Endless War but the Lord of Ghosts

1017
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
himself travels to a different place

1018
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
and is doing other adventures.

1019
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
Digi, you will love

1020
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,220
the literal embodiment of clusterfuck

1021
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,220
that is the Lord of Ghosts.

1022
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
If just one look at his

1023
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
misshapen freakish body and you'll be like

1024
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,220
this is me, this is me

1025
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,220
if I was a little monster.

1026
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
He's pretty relatable.

1027
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,220
What did you think of my artwork

1028
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,220
for the Road to Radcon 4?

1029
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
I was frankly way into it.

1030
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,220
It was great, it was kind of exactly

1031
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
what I hoped for from a Digi

1032
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
and frankly it seemed like

1033
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
I'm feeling some experimentations.

1034
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
You're trying some new things it feels like.

1035
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Yeah, new things like dropping piss on my face.

1036
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
Yes, yes.

1037
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,220
It was wonderful.

1038
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Hippo, what you got to do?

1039
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Okay, I know you've made

1040
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
you made, or sorry

1041
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
look pass this on

1042
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,220
to Gun Girl because I know

1043
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,220
Gun Girl is a zinester

1044
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
and is the author of the best selling

1045
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
zine and one of the best selling zines

1046
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
in New Los Angeles City, the Gamer and the Bear.

1047
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
Yes.

1048
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
So you know about zines.

1049
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,220
I have been converting

1050
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,220
I have been converting slime and punishment

1051
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
into in-game

1052
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
zine form

1053
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
and the first seven issues

1054
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,220
of slime and punishment are available

1055
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,220
in Endless War as zines

1056
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,220
that you can purchase with slime

1057
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,220
if that's your pleasure.

1058
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220
I'm going to get around to finishing it up soon.

1059
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Everything should be a zine.

1060
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Why don't we have

1061
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,220
a PCP zine already?

1062
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Like a real life...

1063
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
A real zine.

1064
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
I've been planning to make my own zine

1065
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
for a while

1066
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,220
but I would have to be the only

1067
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
contributor to it

1068
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,220
and it just wouldn't be as cool

1069
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
as if we had it.

1070
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
I'm into the idea. I would actually love

1071
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
to contribute to a zine

1072
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,220
but how would we distribute it?

1073
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,220
Wait, I've got an idea

1074
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
and it's maybe Twitter, but

1075
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,220
do you remember that website that we had a guy

1076
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,220
in his free time working on

1077
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,220
which was absolutely beautiful

1078
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,220
and was like 95% done

1079
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
just because I was busy and I never get back to him.

1080
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,220
I forget his name right now.

1081
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
But that could be a pretty good vehicle.

1082
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Click on the sign for the latest...

1083
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,220
A zine,

1084
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
what would it consist of?

1085
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
Is it a news magazine or is it just comics?

1086
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
The one I want to make

1087
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,220
is called

1088
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Cluster Punk

1089
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
and it would be

1090
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
all kinds of shit

1091
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
but the number one article

1092
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,220
I want to write for it is my Cluster Punk

1093
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,220
fashion show article

1094
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
or the current line

1095
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
just photos of me wearing

1096
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,220
cool outfits basically

1097
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
but I don't know yet

1098
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,220
I just have always wanted

1099
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
to make a magazine

1100
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
so

1101
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
my plan was just to fund it through

1102
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
the same way Ben did his comic.

1103
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,220
To me, the spirit of a zine

1104
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,220
is you go to

1105
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,220
your fucking mom's office

1106
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
to print it out on 8x11

1107
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
you fold it in half, you staple it

1108
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,220
you put boxes of them

1109
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,220
in stores or on city corners

1110
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
or whatever

1111
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
If I made a zine, that's how I would do it

1112
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,220
It's funny you say that Ben

1113
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
that is what I was planning to do

1114
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,220
back in 2012

1115
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,220
I had this one I did called

1116
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,220
the Virginia Beach Hermit Society

1117
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
that was incomplete

1118
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,220
but the plan was to just print them out

1119
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
and leave them at Barnes & Noble

1120
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,220
but the thing about that is

1121
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,220
it won't work and nobody will give a shit

1122
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
so I'd rather just do it

1123
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
to a means by which people will actually want one

1124
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,220
Makes sense

1125
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,220
I like the idea

1126
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
of all of us collaborating

1127
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
parts to a zine

1128
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,220
some of us doing art

1129
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
Imagine if Jesse wrote articles

1130
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,220
it would be incredible

1131
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,220
He could literally write anything

1132
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,220
and it would be publishable

1133
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,220
but organization

1134
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,220
and all that

1135
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,220
has always been an issue

1136
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,220
especially when there's no money involved

1137
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,220
We need the money first

1138
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
then our effort will follow

1139
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,220
We can worry about that later

1140
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,220
we got Radcon 4 to worry about right now

1141
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,220
but maybe we can discuss the possibilities

1142
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,220
with zine at Radcon 4

1143
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,220
If we reach 20k guys

1144
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,220
we will start talking about a zine stretch

1145
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,220
to let 30k so let's get it going

1146
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,220
I wonder how far

1147
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,220
we could push one kickstarter

1148
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,220
just by adding new stretch goals onto it

1149
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,220
It depends on how good

1150
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,220
if it's something that is really good

1151
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,220
and pertains to a large audience

1152
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,220
a documentary on

1153
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,220
the fucking Shanghai 7

1154
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,220
the most dangerous samurai bunch

1155
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,220
I don't fucking know

1156
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
at some point it would be like

1157
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,220
why not make just another kickstarter

1158
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,220
for that other thing

1159
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
No

1160
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,220
No

1161
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,220
Why do that

1162
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,220
when you can do this

1163
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,220
capitalize off the hype

1164
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,220
20k is going to take

1165
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,220
some doing I think

1166
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,220
While we're on the subject

1167
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,220
we're putting the stretch goal on this one

1168
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,220
I don't think it's impossible

1169
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,220
Obviously the math isn't going to work out this perfectly

1170
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,220
but we're at over 10k

1171
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,220
and we're at half of the previous donators

1172
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,220
Do a little math

1173
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,220
if they all donate, surely

1174
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,220
that will bring us up to

1175
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,220
5th of what we've made so far

1176
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,220
is from two people

1177
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,220
That is correct

1178
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,220
Our $2,000 donors

1179
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,220
We did have $1,000 last time

1180
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,220
so you really have to subtract $1,000

1181
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,220
from that to get parity from last time

1182
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,220
That's true

1183
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,220
We need to find more exchange students

1184
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,220
I know

1185
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,220
We gotta pull them in, we gotta have a better outreach program

1186
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,220
We gotta reach out to the inner city

1187
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,220
My thinking is

1188
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
the people that made it

1189
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,220
succeed instantly

1190
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,220
are a lot of the people that donated

1191
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,220
last time

1192
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,220
A lot of the people that are really invested

1193
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,220
knew about it immediately, donated immediately

1194
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,220
So I think that we will probably get more

1195
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,220
If we didn't do anything else

1196
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,220
we would probably get more donors

1197
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,220
than the first time

1198
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,220
but probably the remainder of them

1199
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,220
would be smaller donors than we've had

1200
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,220
thus far

1201
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,220
So I think that

1202
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,220
we'll need to have more donors

1203
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
because we'll need to reach new donors

1204
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,220
to actually double the number

1205
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,220
of donate

1206
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,220
even if we do hit the

1207
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,220
$380

1208
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,220
Reaching out to Digi's audience with the book

1209
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,220
is a good gesture

1210
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,220
I hope so

1211
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,220
I gotta talk about it at the end

1212
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,220
of any other videos we do too

1213
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,220
Just gotta campaign for it

1214
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
My reaction is that it's ready to go

1215
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,220
I haven't tweeted about the Kickstarter at all

1216
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,220
I've been meaning to

1217
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,220
I'll do my part

1218
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
I'm doing my part

1219
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,220
Good

1220
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
I'm extremely curious about

1221
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
what will happen when the end of the month

1222
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,220
comes around and people get their paychecks

1223
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,220
as well as

1224
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,220
there's always spikes

1225
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,220
in the last few days when people are like

1226
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,220
I wanna push to the next goal

1227
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,220
The final push is

1228
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,220
I know for a fact that some of the most excited people

1229
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,220
are waiting for payday

1230
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,220
because they want the higher tiers

1231
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,220
I mean

1232
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,220
you can donate

1233
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,220
and then up your pledge later

1234
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,220
That's true, nothing against that

1235
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,220
You can

1236
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,220
if you have 10 to chip in now

1237
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,220
and you do that and then you get paid

1238
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,220
and you're like hmm, money in my pocket

1239
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,220
Better throw it at the PCP

1240
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,220
You can go in and up your pledge

1241
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,220
and choose a new tier and everything

1242
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,220
When I gotta go update the whole

1243
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,220
stretch goal section with the new

1244
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,220
Digiteers and stuff

1245
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,220
That's it anyway

1246
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,220
How long is the PCP

1247
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,220
a light novel gonna be?

1248
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,220
It depends

1249
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,220
I kept the first chapter short

1250
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,220
just because it's free

1251
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,220
It's easily digestible

1252
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,220
and it's a nice start

1253
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,220
of the journey

1254
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,220
The second chapter

1255
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,220
will have to be considerably longer

1256
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,220
Just think of it this way

1257
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,220
Every chapter will be multiplying

1258
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,220
the number of characters

1259
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
The sheer amount of time it takes

1260
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,220
to even have one interaction

1261
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,220
will naturally lengthen the chapters

1262
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,220
by way of how many characters are involved

1263
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,220
I wanna be written about

1264
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,220
so get that to the

1265
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,220
when am I coming in

1266
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,220
like the last one or near the last one

1267
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,220
I think you're the third

1268
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,220
Next is Ben and I

1269
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,220
Weird number

1270
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,220
Not to spoil too much

1271
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,220
but the idea is

1272
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
generally that the first three chapters

1273
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,220
each introduce two

1274
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,220
people and then the last two chapters

1275
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,220
will be the

1276
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,220
you know, the actual

1277
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,220
attempt to get our

1278
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,220
shit together

1279
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,220
Right

1280
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,220
Epic journey

1281
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,220
I kind of like

1282
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,220
I was out with Munchie

1283
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,220
yesterday and

1284
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,220
he was just sort of offhandedly mentioned

1285
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,220
that we were talking about new stretch goals

1286
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,220
and so I'd come home and I

1287
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,220
just find this whole

1288
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,220
light novel

1289
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,220
scheme just kind of like fully formed

1290
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,220
and already in action

1291
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,220
and I'm just like well, okay

1292
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,220
I guess that's happening too

1293
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,220
That's what happens when you're off the grid

1294
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,220
I suppose

1295
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,220
Yeah, out with no phone

1296
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,220
God's barely even being alive at that point

1297
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,220
Man, I'm not sure

1298
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,220
I might not be able to stream without my phone

1299
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,220
because my twitch account is like

1300
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,220
after authenticated

1301
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,220
You should just like

1302
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,220
contact them and like try to tell them

1303
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,220
that's gotta be a thing that happens

1304
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,220
You should

1305
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,220
take a little go to get in there

1306
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,220
I bet they can help you out somehow

1307
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,220
I think there's ways to

1308
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,220
simulate

1309
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,220
phone apps on your desktop

1310
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,220
but I'm not sure that would work

1311
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,220
for twitch authentication

1312
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,220
Yeah, I don't know

1313
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,220
I'll figure it out tonight I guess

1314
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,220
Losing your phone fucking

1315
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
sucks ass

1316
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,220
It sure does

1317
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,220
I bet it was Brad

1318
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,220
Fucking Brad

1319
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,220
When I saw

1320
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,220
that the accounts had been hacked

1321
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,220
my first thought was somebody found my phone

1322
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,220
and got into the PCP account through it

1323
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,220
Everybody thought

1324
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,220
the death of the PCP

1325
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,220
was gonna be like our content

1326
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,220
going downhill

1327
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,220
or all of us fighting each other and hating each other

1328
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,220
but no, it's just losing access to all our fucking channel

1329
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,220
No, it's just just Russian hackers

1330
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,220
All in one fells

1331
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,220
it's just like I'm just logged in

1332
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,220
to these accounts

1333
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,220
I mean you don't think that just being just logged in

1334
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,220
is going to put you in danger

1335
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,220
It seems like it's a pretty sophisticated

1336
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,220
program

1337
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,220
This was definitely very sophisticated

1338
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,220
Never download anything

1339
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,220
Don't download more RAM guys

1340
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,220
Do not do it

1341
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,220
It's not good

1342
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,220
By the way, Ben, I forgot

1343
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,220
Right in front of me, I have your package with your precious vape juice

1344
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,220
that I need to check out

1345
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,220
I know we've got a lot on our minds lately

1346
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,220
but frankly I'm disgusted

1347
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,220
Tell you what

1348
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,220
I crave the juice

1349
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,220
I will check if the mail is closed

1350
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,220
If it is open, I will go immediately after we're done recording

1351
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,220
If not, I'll do it tomorrow

1352
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,220
I crave the Flav

1353
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,220
Indeed

1354
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,220
I understand

1355
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,220
This is because of

1356
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,220
weird draconian

1357
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,220
laws put in place

1358
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,220
about certain kinds

1359
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,220
Have I explained this already?

1360
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,220
I don't want to be redundant

1361
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,220
I think in general

1362
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,220
These are vape juices that they will no longer

1363
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,220
sell in Massachusetts

1364
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,220
I had to order them to send them to you

1365
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,220
so you could send them to me

1366
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,220
because vendors are

1367
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,220
handcuffed

1368
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,220
On YouTube, I'm pretty sure

1369
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,220
in several places I've seen ads

1370
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,220
and I think I was just listening so I wasn't watching

1371
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,220
but I've heard that

1372
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,220
they're trying to get kids addicted to flavored vape

1373
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,220
You wouldn't buy a flavored cigarette, would you?

1374
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,220
Say no to vape

1375
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,220
It's untested and dangerous

1376
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,220
Who wouldn't buy a flavored cigarette?

1377
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,220
What the fuck are they talking about?

1378
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,220
Something like that

1379
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,220
Some of the people that came to

1380
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,220
RFCKCon, like Smoke and or Vape

1381
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,220
and elsewhere too

1382
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,220
They talked to a bunch of people that are like

1383
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,220
I was vaping but now I can't get them

1384
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,220
so I'm smoking again

1385
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,220
What the fuck?

1386
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,220
Congratulations

1387
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,220
It's almost like this was

1388
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,220
the tobacco industry's plan the whole time

1389
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,220
It's almost like

1390
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,220
100%

1391
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,220
It really makes you think

1392
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,220
Surely the tobacco company would have

1393
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,220
got in, tried to

1394
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,220
worm and drizzle that way into this new thing

1395
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,220
That's what I've heard

1396
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,220
Well they probably want to destroy the old

1397
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,220
Do own a lot of the vaping companies though

1398
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,220
They must know

1399
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,220
But they're going after Jewel

1400
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,220
almost exclusively, right?

1401
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,220
Isn't Jewel the one suffering the most from this?

1402
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,220
I mean it's the biggest company so I would assume

1403
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,220
They're just trying to get their biggest competition out of the way

1404
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,220
And then

1405
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,220
They don't care

1406
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,220
They're making money from cigarettes anyways

1407
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,220
They'll probably get into the market

1408
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,220
as soon as Jewel is obliterated

1409
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,220
Once they can buy it out

1410
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,220
At least in the American market

1411
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,220
I know they're putting all these regulations so the vapes

1412
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,220
are in the same category and you can't do them

1413
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,220
But cigarettes

1414
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,220
They're falling off a cliff in terms of usage

1415
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,220
nationwide as I understand it

1416
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,220
This vaping was like hey

1417
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,220
What if smoking didn't have to be a miserable

1418
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,220
experience that you just got your nicotine

1419
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,220
And then the rest was just

1420
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,220
mediocre

1421
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,220
Just a cool cloud

1422
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,220
I enjoy smoking cigarettes a lot more than vaping

1423
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,220
Well

1424
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,220
You don't need any individual experience

1425
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,220
It's not exactly the same

1426
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,220
They have a slightly different appeal

1427
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,220
That being said, when I had

1428
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,220
access to vape

1429
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,220
I completely quit smoking

1430
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,220
After I hadn't smoked for a while

1431
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,220
I was like, cigarettes disgusting

1432
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,220
Gross

1433
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,220
Are you still of that opinion?

1434
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,220
No, I'm back on the analogs

1435
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,220
And I hate it

1436
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,220
You see what you've done vapes?

1437
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,220
Thanks Charlie Baker

1438
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,220
I don't know, like Marlboro NXT's

1439
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,220
or Camel Crush or whatever

1440
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Type 2 Magnum Extra Large

1441
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,220
Just like a few

1442
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,220
I'm not like

1443
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,220
Never been like a pack a day smoker or anything

1444
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,220
But I wanted to end

1445
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,220
Just call our mother

1446
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,220
Tell her you're stepping into your fucking grave Ben

1447
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,220
Just tell her with your own two words

1448
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,220
It's a filthy habit

1449
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,220
Especially for a star athlete

1450
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,220
That's true, no doubt about it

1451
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,220
How are you ever going to hit your 600 pound squat like this Ben?

1452
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,220
How? Tell me how

1453
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,220
It's not going to happen

1454
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,220
The dreams

1455
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,220
600 pound

1456
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,220
It's doable

1457
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,220
That's a reasonable goal

1458
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,220
Reasonable

1459
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,220
I personally

1460
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,220
Spotted a guy in high school

1461
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,220
Who was squatting 500 pounds

1462
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,220
Was he going parallel?

1463
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,220
I can't remember

1464
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,220
I was too aroused by his wriggling muscles

1465
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,220
I was distracted

1466
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,220
If he went full parallel

1467
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,220
That would be an impressive squat

1468
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,220
I mean he looked like the kind of man

1469
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,220
I want to look like

1470
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,220
So honestly that's the only reason I work out

1471
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,220
A high school boy

1472
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,220
That's right

1473
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,220
For the record I was younger than him at the time

1474
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,220
To be clear about

1475
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,220
What's going on here

1476
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,220
So there I was 28 years old

1477
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,220
Squatting teens

1478
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,220
Spotting them at the gym

1479
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,220
Just my usual haunt

1480
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,220
If they're doing a cool 500

1481
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,220
I mean

1482
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,220
They're clearly able to consent

1483
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,220
They know something

1484
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,220
Nate aren't you

1485
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,220
Are you 30 yet?

1486
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,220
I'm 29 still

1487
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,220
I'm creeping up there

1488
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,220
I'm going to be dead

1489
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,220
It's depressing

1490
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,220
It's very depressing

1491
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,220
Dab dab dab

1492
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,220
There's just no hope for this world

1493
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,220
I've basically given up on

1494
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,220
Technology progressing

1495
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,220
To me being immortal

1496
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,220
It's fine we're all going to die really soon

1497
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,220
The coronavirus is going to kill us all

1498
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,220
Thanks China

1499
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,220
I guess that's true

1500
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,220
I started hearing about this coronavirus

1501
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,220
Is that okay?

1502
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,220
Are we good?

1503
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,220
Short answer no

1504
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,220
Long answer if you find out that it has

1505
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,220
Arrived in your city

1506
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,220
Don't go outside

1507
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,220
That's what they said about

1508
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,220
The flu

1509
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,220
The chicken flu

1510
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,220
The bird flu

1511
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,220
It never amounts to anything

1512
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,220
And everyone gets all excited

1513
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,220
That's not true

1514
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,220
Sometimes it amounts to something

1515
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,220
It amounts to some amount of death

1516
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,220
Ebola was bullshit

1517
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,220
Ebola killed like 7 people

1518
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,220
Coronavirus has so far

1519
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,220
Killed at least 60 people

1520
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,220
We know there to be

1521
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,220
Hundreds of thousands of people infected

1522
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,220
Most Chinese cities are locked down

1523
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,220
It has come to America

1524
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,220
It is spreading through Texas

1525
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,220
It's in France, it's in Orange County

1526
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,220
It's been identified somewhere in Virginia

1527
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,220
With only one case

1528
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,220
The place we're all going to

1529
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,220
Excellent

1530
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,220
Not that survival rate though

1531
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,220
Thousands infected 60 dead

1532
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,220
That's pretty good

1533
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,220
That's not the survival rate

1534
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,220
The infection lays dormant

1535
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,220
In you for weeks on end

1536
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,220
It's suspected that there are hundreds

1537
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,220
Of thousands of people carrying it

1538
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,220
Who don't know about it yet

1539
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,220
Potentially in the air

1540
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,220
It is very easy to get

1541
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,220
And very hard to notice

1542
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,220
If you have it

1543
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,220
I'm asymptomatic

1544
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,220
And if it's on simp

1545
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,220
There are some light parts to this though

1546
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,220
You can be immune to it

1547
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,220
It mostly kills older people

1548
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,220
People with weakened immune systems

1549
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,220
We're finally getting rid of the boomers

1550
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,220
Ben and Tom are vulnerable

1551
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,220
Ben and Tom are going down

1552
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,220
It's got to take out the boomers before the election

1553
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,220
Go coronavirus

1554
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
This is the final bid against Bernie

1555
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,220
This is their last ditch attempt

1556
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,220
The BNC is at the core of this guy

1557
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,220
This is going to propel Bernie into office

1558
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,220
Because only the young voters will be left

1559
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,220
I guess that's true

1560
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,220
Won't he be dead though?

1561
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,220
I was thinking won't like all of the candidates

1562
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,220
For the Democrats be dead

1563
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,220
Yang just wins by default

1564
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,220
Tulsi Gabbard is finally going to get her chance

1565
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,220
Tulsi V. Yang

1566
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
Tulsi V. Yang is all that's going to be left

1567
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,220
Thank god, what a fucking future that would be

1568
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,220
It's just going to be Pete, Pete Buttigieg

1569
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,220
Oh right, that's right Pete

1570
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,220
Who's going to vote for PM?

1571
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,220
I'm just saying if Pete Buttigieg does the floss dance

1572
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,220
At one debate he's got my vote

1573
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,220
I'm glad Yang's polling above Pete

1574
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,220
I mean it's not a huge accomplishment

1575
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,220
It's a fucking joke

1576
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,220
I certainly like Yang more

1577
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,220
He seems more like a solid dude

1578
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,220
Did you guys see how the other day

1579
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,220
When there was that completely natural

1580
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,220
Vote for Bernie hashtag

1581
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,220
That was going around

1582
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,220
That the next morning there was a

1583
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,220
Obviously very planted and fake

1584
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,220
I'm voting for Pete hashtag

1585
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,220
If you were to click on it

1586
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,220
Most of them were

1587
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,220
I'm not hashtag voting for Pete

1588
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,220
Because he's clearly a CIA plant

1589
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,220
Like that's like

1590
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,220
He's going to take our weed guys

1591
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,220
I saw hashtag

1592
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,220
Hot girls for Bernie

1593
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,220
That's a powerful one

1594
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,220
That's a powerful one

1595
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,220
I'm all for Mommy Tulsi though

1596
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,220
I'm all in on

1597
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,220
Tulsi's too hot, she can't be president

1598
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,220
She is too hot, it's weird

1599
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,220
It's not right

1600
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,220
Don't you want to be able to say

1601
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,220
You jacked off to the president

1602
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,220
Did you see the Stefan Mullen you tweet about Tulsi

1603
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,220
He did it again

1604
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,220
Did he do the eggs thing?

1605
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,220
He did the egg thing

1606
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,220
He's like, she's 38

1607
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,220
Second marriage, no kids

1608
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,220
Hope she thinks about having kids soon

1609
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,220
Imagine how fun it would be to grow up in Hawaii

1610
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,220
Times running out, ambition alone

1611
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,220
Won't keep you company in old age

1612
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,220
Oh, I mean

1613
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,220
As always Stefan

1614
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,220
Spot on analysis

1615
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,220
But perhaps not the right

1616
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,220
Timer plays

1617
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,220
No, no this is it

1618
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,220
He generated

1619
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,220
A lot of buzz with the last one

1620
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,220
So he's at it again

1621
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,220
I totally believe that he did it

1622
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,220
Knowing the kind of reception he gets

1623
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,220
He knows what response the Taylor Swift one got

1624
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,220
Yeah, no doubt

1625
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,220
He's not stupid

1626
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,220
I don't need

1627
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,220
Okay, I put in some stats into

1628
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,220
Likeability

1629
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,220
As a normal person

1630
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,220
He's like, I'm cashed and I don't need that anymore

1631
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,220
Are you trying to say that calling

1632
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,220
Taylor Swift a dead egger is an unlikable move

1633
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,220
Cause that sounds fucking hilarious

1634
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,220
Dead egger

1635
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,220
To some, to the feeble minded

1636
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,220
Yeah

1637
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,220
He's a mad lad, there's no doubt about it

1638
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,220
I think he's overreacting

1639
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Oh my god

1640
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,220
I mean, you can't make an awit without a few dead eggs

1641
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,220
Rewind that and play it back again

1642
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,220
That was too good

1643
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,220
If that's not the title of this episode

1644
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,220
I don't know

1645
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,220
Holy shit

1646
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,220
Fuck

1647
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,220
No, you can't title it, I don't want it to be spoiled

1648
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,220
You know, that's a good point

1649
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,220
So I got on Twitter today

1650
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,220
This morning

1651
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,220
And I see

1652
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,220
Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash

1653
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,220
That's a funny meme

1654
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,220
That's real though

1655
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,220
It did happen

1656
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,220
I thought it was a meme because

1657
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,220
Didn't LeBron just beat

1658
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,220
His career score record

1659
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,220
Like yesterday

1660
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,220
I don't know bro

1661
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,220
Basketball

1662
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,220
I feel like yesterday I just happened to see

1663
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,220
A trending hashtag

1664
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,220
Because LeBron had just surpassed Kobe

1665
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,220
In terms of overall career scoring

1666
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,220
And then the next day Kobe explodes

1667
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,220
I mean, does anyone know

1668
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,220
What happened

1669
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,220
Maybe someone intentionally

1670
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,220
Murdered them, maybe he

1671
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,220
Was this

1672
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,220
I have no idea but like

1673
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,220
As I pointed out in the chat

1674
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,220
Somebody predicted this

1675
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,220
Eight years ago

1676
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,220
In a tweet that had shit tons of retweets and likes already

1677
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,220
So I assume that

1678
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,220
Maybe he's just a man who took a lot of helicopters

1679
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,220
And people just thought this was going to happen eventually

1680
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,220
I have no idea

1681
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,220
I was saying

1682
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,220
If this happened to Bill Burr, I would have understood it

1683
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,220
Because he historically is

1684
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,220
He flies helicopters, he loves helicopters

1685
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,220
And Kobe is an enthusiast or used a much

1686
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,220
But clearly

1687
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,220
He is rich, no doubt about that

1688
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,220
His daughter was in it too

1689
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,220
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me

1690
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,220
No, yeah, him and his daughter were on the helicopter

1691
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,220
Jeez, that's Christ

1692
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,220
To me

1693
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,220
That rules out the suicide

1694
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,220
Because I don't think the man would kill his daughter

1695
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,220
I'm just saying

1696
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,220
Did he crash his own helicopter

1697
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,220
Because he was so fucking mad about his American being beaten

1698
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,220
Wait, wait, wait

1699
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,220
He's so mad, like the specific emotion

1700
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,220
Is he seething with the raid

1701
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,220
I'll show you LeBron

1702
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,220
He's on twitter

1703
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,220
He sees the hashtag trending with his right

1704
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,220
He's like darn it, just like veers into the ground

1705
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,220
I believe towards despair

1706
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,220
I don't think so

1707
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,220
Probably not

1708
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,220
I don't know who was flying it, I don't know anything

1709
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,220
I don't think he was personally piloting it

1710
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,220
I knew nothing about Kobe other than

1711
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,220
He was a good basketball player

1712
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,220
He had a good smile, seemed like a good chap

1713
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,220
Rest in peace, bro

1714
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,220
I'm just a little embarrassed

1715
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,220
Because I saw a tweet from Misanthropony

1716
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,220
Of all people who was just like

1717
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,220
Boy, sure is sad that Kobe Bryant died

1718
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,220
In the helicopter crash, I thought it was a joke

1719
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,220
About his record being beaten, I'm like

1720
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,220
Classic

1721
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,220
Classic map, classic irreverence

1722
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,220
Yeah, so he gave that a like

1723
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,220
Turns out

1724
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,220
I mean, to be fair

1725
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,220
I probably would have assumed that as well

1726
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,220
If I hadn't seen it from a news source

1727
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,220
Like when it came on right

1728
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,220
Boy LeBron

1729
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,220
You really got egg on your face now

1730
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,220
Should have held off

1731
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,220
beating that record

1732
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,220
For shame

1733
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,220
Have you no sense of decency, sir

1734
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,220
Rest in peace

1735
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,220
Rest in power, Kobe

1736
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,220
That's all I got

1737
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,220
I don't know anything else about Kobe

1738
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,220
I guess fortunately for myself

1739
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,220
Since I don't have to feel sad

1740
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,220
Fair

1741
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,220
Fair

1742
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,220
I want to talk a little bit

1743
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,220
About San Gatsunolain

1744
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,220
The shogi boy anime

1745
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,220
Because I've been watching the second season

1746
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,220
And it's beautiful and great

1747
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,220
And

1748
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,220
I have

1749
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,220
In conjunction with my brother

1750
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,220
HGB guy

1751
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,220
Who you can find on YouTube and he makes weird videos

1752
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,220
Go check him out lol

1753
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,220
He does a lot of woodworking stuff

1754
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,220
And builds chairs now

1755
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,220
He literally lets chairs

1756
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,220
And

1757
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,220
He is like

1758
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,220
He has the tools and the manpower

1759
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,220
I think what we're doing together

1760
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,220
I've told him about this anime

1761
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,220
We're both watching it

1762
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,220
And we're gonna make our own shogi board

1763
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,220
So that we can click

1764
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,220
The pieces on the little thing

1765
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,220
Do you have any desire to actually learn

1766
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,220
How to play or just to click the pieces down?

1767
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,220
I think

1768
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,220
It's gonna be like a solid

1769
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:59,220
3 hours of clicking the pieces

1770
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,220
But then we might learn

1771
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,220
I actually learned how to play shogi

1772
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,220
When I was a young man

1773
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,220
It's really not that much more complicated

1774
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,220
Than normal chess

1775
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,220
Except that like

1776
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,220
I played chess for 2 years

1777
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,220
It's not like go at all

1778
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,220
Go is the insanely complicated one

1779
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,220
This is

1780
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,220
But shogi is like

1781
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,220
Shogi is more like chess

1782
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,220
Shogi does have more

1783
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,220
I think shogi does have like a multitude

1784
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,220
More like possibilities

1785
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,220
Than chess though

1786
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,220
The pieces can evolve like in checkers kind of

1787
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,220
So that's a big factor

1788
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,220
I tried to learn it in high school

1789
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,220
I printed out like a set on paper

1790
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,220
And cut out pieces

1791
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,220
Good to know that shogi is stealing

1792
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,220
Both of you

1793
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,220
Obviously need to watch

1794
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,220
Since you actually know anything about shogi

1795
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,220
I know a little bit

1796
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,220
Show ever

1797
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,220
I kind of wanted to watch

1798
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,220
I read much of the akagi manga

1799
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,220
Which is obviously about gambling mahjong

1800
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,220
I do not understand the rules of mahjong

1801
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,220
One fucking bit

1802
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,220
And I had no idea

1803
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,220
And I think it actually did hurt my enjoyment

1804
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,220
Because they're trying to be like

1805
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,220
Oh, he's got like a shitty hand

1806
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,220
And they're like misleading you for when it's revealed

1807
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,220
He actually turned it into a really good hand with these moves

1808
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,220
But because I don't understand the difference between the two

1809
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,220
I'm like fine

1810
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,220
So they make it very clear

1811
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,220
Through

1812
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,220
Like visual aid and

1813
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,220
You know mind narration

1814
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,220
Of certain characters

1815
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,220
To make it like

1816
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,220
Very easy to follow along

1817
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,220
I have no idea what's going on most of the time

1818
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,220
Mostly because shogi

1819
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,220
Looks at a glance impossible

1820
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,220
To understand because they're all like

1821
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,220
Japanese characters on the things

1822
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,220
Right, if you don't know that, sure

1823
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,220
So like even if I'm learning a little bit

1824
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,220
In the brief moments where they show the board

1825
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,220
From top down view

1826
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,220
And you're supposed to

1827
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,220
You know if you know shogi

1828
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,220
You might be able to see what's going to happen

1829
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,220
They spell it out

1830
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,220
So nothing like goes over my head

1831
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,220
And I can follow along fine

1832
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,220
It's just so fucking

1833
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,220
Good of a show in general

1834
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,220
It's not like

1835
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,220
I would compare it a little bit to

1836
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,220
I mean my anime

1837
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,220
And manga like knowledge

1838
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,220
Is lacking but

1839
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,220
I shield 21, Nate

1840
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,220
It has that same sort of

1841
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,220
It's one of my faves and bends as well I think

1842
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,220
Just in terms of like making a

1843
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,220
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

1844
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,220
In terms of making a show about a sport

1845
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,220
Really good

1846
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,220
No the racist part was my favorite part Ben

1847
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,220
But yeah

1848
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,220
I remember that

1849
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,220
It's pretty good racism as racism

1850
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,220
It's not like the same sort

1851
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,220
Biological essentialism Ben

1852
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:45,220
It's not the same sort of

1853
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,220
It's just black people's muscles

1854
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,220
Can never be great athletes

1855
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,220
Sorry again please

1856
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,220
It's not exactly the same sort of

1857
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,220
Show in any like

1858
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,220
Train montage thing but like

1859
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,220
I don't know

1860
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,220
Is it racist to say another race

1861
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,220
Is better than yours

1862
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,220
Well I mean

1863
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,220
It depends really what you mean by the word better

1864
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:09,220
In that context cause I mean

1865
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,220
Is it racist to say

1866
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,220
I think I believe Inuits are better

1867
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,220
At surviving in cold temperatures

1868
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,220
Is that right I mean maybe

1869
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,220
By some definitions

1870
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,220
The thing about I Shield 21 is that

1871
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,220
It's like the moral

1872
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,220
Is not like like the white guy

1873
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,220
Is mad that like the black guy was

1874
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,220
Like a better athlete than him but the moral

1875
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,220
He learns to get over that though

1876
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,220
It kinda comes down to like

1877
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,220
It's not like oh well you know

1878
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,220
You just gotta you know everyone

1879
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,220
Everyone has a great chef

1880
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,220
A great chef can come from anywhere

1881
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,220
It's uh oh black people are actually just

1882
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,220
Better athletes

1883
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,220
I mean look it's true

1884
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,220
Look at the NBA bro

1885
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,220
I mean there's been

1886
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,220
People who have said things like that

1887
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,220
Throughout history you know

1888
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,220
Like Hitler

1889
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,220
Sure

1890
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,220
I mean the message at the end is like

1891
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,220
Despite the natural

1892
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,220
Genetic advantage that at least Panther has

1893
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,220
That yes is heavily associated with black

1894
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,220
People's muscles in those words

1895
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,220
It's like Sena

1896
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,220
Sena is gonna just try hard

1897
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,220
Sena has his own

1898
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,220
It's a similar

1899
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,220
Sort of

1900
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,220
Thing where like sometimes

1901
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,220
You'll never reach the top but you gotta keep going

1902
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,220
It's just also happens to be about race

1903
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,220
And that's what makes it weird

1904
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,220
It's pretty weird

1905
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,220
I like that part in Song God's No Lion

1906
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,220
Where they were like despite being

1907
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,220
Really high intellect east Asians

1908
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,220
With those damn Askenaji Jews

1909
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,220
With their higher percentage of IQ

1910
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,220
We just can't compete against them damn it

1911
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,220
So close

1912
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,220
What are Askenaji Jews

1913
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,220
Ashkenazi

1914
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,220
I actually don't know exactly what the difference is

1915
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,220
But they're the ones that everyone says are

1916
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,220
Smart

1917
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,220
I just know it from people saying that

1918
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,220
That's all I know, I couldn't tell you

1919
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,220
You guys know Sean, he's a bread tube guy

1920
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,220
He didn't really

1921
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,220
Fuck off, Sean's great

1922
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,220
He's really good, he did a video

1923
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,220
Fuck you, he did a video about

1924
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,220
The bell curve

1925
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,220
The book, the bell curve, you know that one

1926
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,220
The one that's like

1927
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,220
You know intelligence is heritable

1928
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,220
And it just goes into how

1929
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,220
Right

1930
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,220
It's not just

1931
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,220
People being like oh you can't say that

1932
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,220
Like that's unacceptable

1933
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,220
Science, you can't

1934
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,220
The book, no the book like set out

1935
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,220
With a deliberate agenda to push a certain narrative

1936
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,220
It doesn't

1937
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,220
In a weird way

1938
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,220
That isn't like

1939
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,220
Scientifically rigorous

1940
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,220
It's a good video

1941
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,220
If you say so

1942
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,220
I've heard arguments to the contrary

1943
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,220
From people like Sam Harris

1944
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,220
He said that it was pretty well sourced

1945
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,220
And good, I could be wrong

1946
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,220
Sam Harris keeps bad company

1947
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:55,220
And I don't trust him

1948
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,220
Don't actually know anything about Sam Harris

1949
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,220
But whatever

1950
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,220
For his religious stuff

1951
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,220
And his

1952
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,220
Not determinist

1953
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,220
But like self control

1954
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,220
Self determination

1955
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,220
Yeah, versus determinism

1956
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,220
Free will, sorry free will was the word I was looking for

1957
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,220
Free will aka that thing that's not real

1958
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,220
Exactly

1959
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,220
Exactly correct

1960
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,220
But it seems like it is so it's almost as good

1961
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,220
About something that's no lying

1962
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,220
I was going to say that like

1963
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,220
I was surprised to hear from Digi's

1964
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,220
Video recently about like the best anime of the last decade

1965
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,220
That was his number one which was you know pretty cool

1966
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,220
And I really want to check it out

1967
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,220
I watched episode one

1968
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,220
And loved the animation and I remember

1969
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,220
Vividly my favorite scene was when he like

1970
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,220
Comes home to that family

1971
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,220
And everything goes from dark to like warm and fuzzy

1972
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,220
And so

1973
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,220
That's like

1974
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,220
All the girls are so fluffy and glowing

1975
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,220
That aspect of the show

1976
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,220
I think is one of its most like divisive

1977
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,220
Elements because there are some people

1978
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,220
Who they don't like the

1979
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,220
The tone shifts

1980
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,220
Like the way that it goes from like so extreme

1981
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,220
That is the point

1982
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:05,220
That's literally the point

1983
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:07,220
I love that shit because it's the way that he

1984
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,220
You know he's like completely in his own head

1985
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,220
Just like all these dark dots

1986
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,220
Swirling and it's like the super dark color palette

1987
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,220
And then he enters that house and it's like

1988
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,220
You know it's like he literally can't

1989
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,220
Be the person you would normally be

1990
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,220
That's like having a conversation on twitter

1991
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,220
And then meeting up

1992
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,220
With your friend in real life

1993
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,220
Oh my god yeah it's exactly like that

1994
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,220
It's literally like when I get up the internet

1995
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,220
And do anything else

1996
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,220
I love how much the show

1997
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,220
Is

1998
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,220
It's about his growth

1999
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,220
In ways that like

2000
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,220
A normal

2001
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,220
Thing about a guy who's good at

2002
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:47,220
Ex sport or whatever

2003
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,220
It usually isn't about

2004
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,220
He's a

2005
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,220
Prodigy or like a middle schooler

2006
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,220
Like a professional

2007
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,220
And

2008
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,220
My first thought is like

2009
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,220
Okay so this is gonna be about him

2010
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,220
Meeting like shogi players

2011
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,220
And then beating them and then training

2012
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,220
And beating them and one after the other

2013
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,220
But it's so much not really about that at all

2014
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:11,220
It's all about him

2015
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,220
And all of the stuff

2016
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,220
That surrounds shogi in his life

2017
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,220
Yeah

2018
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,220
Nate did you ever watch honey and clover

2019
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,220
No I just saw a little bit of it here and there

2020
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,220
It's the same author so it's very similar

2021
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,220
It does look similar

2022
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,220
Update on the brad situation

2023
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,220
Brad Garlinghouse has been streaming

2024
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,220
For three hours

2025
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,220
He is up to 3.4k

2026
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,220
Live viewers

2027
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,220
That can't be right

2028
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,220
It was definitely up before 12 when I woke up

2029
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,220
Maybe he started

2030
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,220
He did

2031
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:45,220
It got taken down and restarted at one point

2032
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,220
Brad just killed it

2033
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,220
The adsense after this all comes back

2034
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:51,220
Hopefully

2035
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,220
I would assume not because adsense

2036
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,220
Is tied to your google account

2037
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:57,220
So probably the adsense for this will go to

2038
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,220
Whatever

2039
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,220
Google account the channel is tied to

2040
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,220
Anything done during this time

2041
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,220
I would estimate so like all of my videos

2042
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,220
That are still getting views here and there

2043
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,220
Probably I'll go into his account

2044
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,220
If it's just like one month's worth of pay

2045
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,220
That ain't gonna break the bank

2046
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,220
A couple of adsense money

2047
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,220
Brad Garlinghouse is a spine

2048
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,220
As we go on

2049
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,220
I hope

2050
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,220
Obviously it's fucked up

2051
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,220
Please give it back Brad

2052
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:27,220
Come on now

2053
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,220
We're all gentlemen here

2054
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,220
We're both businessmen Brad

2055
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,220
You and I we can work something out

2056
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,220
As I pull back

2057
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,220
The trigger on my revolver

2058
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,220
Directly at the back of his head

2059
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,220
Just log into the account

2060
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,220
Transfer it on over

2061
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,220
Peacefully

2062
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,220
Shall we go to voicemails

2063
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,220
I'm ready

2064
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,220
It's already been over an hour

2065
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,220
That was a fast hour

2066
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,220
We had a lot to talk about today

2067
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,220
Time goes by fast

2068
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,220
And despite everything bad going on right now

2069
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:01,220
It is kind of fun to talk about

2070
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,220
Oh there was one thing I was gonna say

2071
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,220
Which was just like

2072
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,220
I am so excited to play the victim card

2073
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,220
I cannot wait to get out there

2074
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,220
Mix it up

2075
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,220
We have some victim status to cash in on

2076
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,220
Oh boy

2077
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,220
You just brought up something that I do think is

2078
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,220
Kind of an interesting topic

2079
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,220
Something I don't understand

2080
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,220
About people on the internet

2081
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:25,220
Is everybody takes themselves

2082
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,220
So fucking seriously

2083
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,220
And their opinions so seriously

2084
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,220
And I really

2085
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,220
I have to feel like if you are

2086
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,220
Capable of taking all this stuff so seriously

2087
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,220
You must not realize how bad things

2088
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,220
Really are

2089
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,220
Did you be fucking you just kill yourself

2090
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,220
Like if I took

2091
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,220
If everything that

2092
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,220
Happened that I found out about

2093
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,220
That was terrible like affected me

2094
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,220
To the extent that it should

2095
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,220
I would just be dead in an afternoon

2096
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,220
Like there's so much

2097
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,220
Fuck shit on this planet earth

2098
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,220
And I just spend all day thinking about it

2099
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,220
And the only way to get through it

2100
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,220
Is to just make it funny for yourself

2101
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,220
I mean we've talked about this before

2102
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,220
How like I don't understand

2103
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,220
How people can say like oh you can't joke about that

2104
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,220
It's like well then how am I supposed to deal with it

2105
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,220
But like I seriously think those people

2106
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:15,220
Must just not realize like

2107
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,220
How bad things really are

2108
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,220
I mean there's one like

2109
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,220
There's one operation going on there

2110
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,220
Which is like in your life

2111
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,220
You selectively can decide

2112
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,220
What it is you choose to spend your time

2113
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,220
Thinking about and dwelling on

2114
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,220
And you could be like a mother Teresa

2115
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:33,220
And choose to dedicate your whole life

2116
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,220
To like individual suffering

2117
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,220
Like getting down to the

2118
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,220
Made in Australia style from Demon Souls

2119
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,220
And taking all the filth of the entire world

2120
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,220
On your shows to like try to help

2121
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,220
I mean what I'm saying is like

2122
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,220
Cause I feel like I do go out of my way

2123
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,220
To find out like what bad is happening

2124
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,220
And it's not that I don't care

2125
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,220
It's that like acting serious about it

2126
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,220
Will kill you

2127
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,220
Like the stress, the depression

2128
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,220
The just like the thinking

2129
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,220
Like just thinking about it

2130
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,220
It's like fuck it's like

2131
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,220
I don't make jokes about it

2132
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,220
I don't know how you could deal with it

2133
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,220
If you literally were like paying attention to it

2134
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,220
Like just thinking about what's going on right now

2135
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,220
It's like we you know

2136
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,220
Are in conflict in the Middle East

2137
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,220
Still there's missiles

2138
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,220
Going around even I think today

2139
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,220
Like Iraq or some

2140
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,220
There was missiles landing

2141
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,220
By our bases in Iraq or whatever

2142
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,220
Who by the way had like a

2143
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,220
Million man protest to try to get us out of their country

2144
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,220
Which of course we're ignoring

2145
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,220
Reporting on

2146
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,220
You've got the coronavirus

2147
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,220
You've got the Epstein scandal

2148
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,220
Still going on

2149
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,220
No one knows where Gisela and Maxwell is

2150
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,220
Still like I mean it's just like there's so much stuff

2151
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,220
I and again

2152
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,220
Like if you don't joke about it

2153
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,220
I really don't think that

2154
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,220
Anybody who knows how much is going wrong

2155
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,220
Could survive taking it

2156
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,220
As seriously as the way people take the few things

2157
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,220
They do care about on Twitter

2158
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,220
Here's my hypothesis

2159
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,220
I think it's these people do know the world

2160
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:03,220
Is fucked up so they choose to ignore it

2161
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,220
And just try and delve into media and stuff

2162
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,220
And so when small little infractions

2163
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,220
Happen in the media that's their escapism

2164
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,220
They blow a gasket because they have no

2165
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,220
That's probably true

2166
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:15,220
To deal with conflict

2167
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,220
That's true on all sides

2168
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,220
The people I see who act like babies

2169
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,220
About that kind of content

2170
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,220
Are the people who seem to have the least perspective

2171
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,220
On like how fucked things are

2172
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,220
So I think you might be on to something there

2173
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,220
I think these people are sheltering themselves

2174
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,220
And so they don't even realize

2175
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,220
How bad it really is

2176
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,220
And they're complaining about shit that doesn't matter

2177
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,220
Like I mean considering like the

2178
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,220
Hacks and stuff going on right now

2179
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,220
I mean for me I think I'm a pretty

2180
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,220
I'm a pretty open-eyed guy

2181
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,220
I mean in general I know I've got my own perspective

2182
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,220
And all that stuff I'm not thinking about the wars

2183
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,220
Going on every second of the day and all that stuff

2184
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,220
But like when it comes to something like this

2185
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,220
I try to just gather all the information

2186
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,220
And I'm like okay

2187
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,220
The worst case scenario

2188
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,220
The worst case scenario here

2189
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,220
Is that like these channels are gone forever

2190
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,220
I'm like okay if that happens

2191
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,220
You know it's not like everybody who is interested in my work

2192
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,220
Is gone from the world

2193
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,220
You know I'll rebuild and like hey

2194
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,220
I'm not gonna lie I think about things like

2195
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,220
Historically I remember to this day

2196
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,220
Like moments when like Dr. Wolf's channel got taken down

2197
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,220
He came back and like doubled a sum count in a day

2198
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,220
I mean hey there's probably some kind of silver lining

2199
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,220
I didn't know that happened to Dr. Wolf

2200
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,220
I mean that was like early days

2201
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,220
I think about that as an example

2202
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,220
Like Mumki Jones when his channel got taken down

2203
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,220
They come back and obviously later on

2204
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,220
Things got worse for him but early on

2205
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,220
He did experience some stuff like this

2206
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,220
So like in the grand scheme of things

2207
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:37,220
Like in my overall arc of life

2208
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,220
Of just trying to survive doing YouTube

2209
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,220
Like is this a setback?

2210
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,220
Sure

2211
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,220
But will I be able to one like make it funny

2212
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,220
And possibly you know

2213
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,220
Entertain people with a funny story that happened

2214
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,220
Probably, probably

2215
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,220
To just sit around and be upset

2216
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,220
I got all that out of the way

2217
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,220
Like when I first noticed but now I'm over it

2218
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,220
Remember when Mumki's channel got taken down

2219
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,220
And he went around talking about how his life was over

2220
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,220
And got addicted to drugs and started cheating on his girlfriend

2221
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:05,220
And now his channel is up to 150,000 subscribers again

2222
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,220
What a fucking pussy

2223
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,220
You know that's a pretty good example

2224
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,220
You know whatever you say about Mumki it's all fine

2225
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,220
But I mean when we all saw that we were like

2226
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,220
I mean yeah Mumki this is really bad

2227
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,220
That's true but like this seems

2228
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,220
Too dramatic a reaction

2229
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,220
Masterson built him a website

2230
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,220
Like what the fuck I would be

2231
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,220
I would love to have a website built by Dick Masterson

2232
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,220
I mean you know I suppose I could say

2233
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,220
Like what position am I in to judge someone

2234
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:31,220
Who's lost their website

2235
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,220
Except that at this very moment

2236
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,220
He has lost multiple YouTube channels

2237
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,220
And shit

2238
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,220
So I don't know

2239
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,220
Not even just yours but collaborative products

2240
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,220
No like all of yours too

2241
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:45,220
Whoops sorry guys

2242
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,220
And thank God you guys are all

2243
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,220
So far

2244
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,220
But Nate the thing is we're actually having a secret meeting

2245
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,220
Once it's over to vote on kicking you

2246
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,220
Sorry

2247
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,220
Obviously we're just waiting until Radcon

2248
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,220
When we have you in person

2249
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,220
Let me just say alright that makes sense

2250
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,220
You should wait until after Radcon

2251
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,220
Until the money gets paid out cause right now

2252
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,220
It's all going to my bank

2253
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,220
So like you're just gonna want to wait until

2254
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:11,220
Don't say that Brad's always listening

2255
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,220
He'll go for that next

2256
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,220
Ah shit

2257
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,220
There it all goes guys

2258
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,220
There goes the kick started too

2259
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,220
At least it seems like

2260
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,220
Think about this though

2261
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:25,220
Like this thing was on your computer

2262
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,220
It could have affected more than your YouTube channel

2263
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,220
That's what I said

2264
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,220
That's why I said to reformat immediately

2265
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,220
Yeah and I'm going to reformat

2266
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,220
I would have done it already

2267
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,220
I don't want to have to redo months

2268
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,220
Of work so

2269
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,220
I'm currently using other machines

2270
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,220
Just gonna redo years of savings when his bank account's emptied

2271
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,220
I mean maybe

2272
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,220
I'm changing my passwords I'm doing all the stuff I should do

2273
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,220
But

2274
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,220
It seems like the one

2275
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,220
Consider the fact these guys approach me

2276
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,220
Through an email they're like hey

2277
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,220
You're a known YouTuber we want you to sponsor this video

2278
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,220
Seems like their main target was

2279
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,220
YouTube and obviously they could have put other stuff in there

2280
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,220
But like you know it seems like

2281
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,220
That's the only thing I've noticed any effectiveness with

2282
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,220
The only thing that like

2283
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,220
Really could have been targeted the way they did it so

2284
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,220
Overall I'm not too worried about the rest of my life

2285
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,220
I don't want to be destroyed or anything

2286
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,220
So I guess we'll see

2287
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,220
Just the important part

2288
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,220
Just kind of like the main livelihood

2289
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,220
Thrust I mean that you know

2290
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:23,220
I'll survive

2291
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,220
It's almost

2292
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,220
A little bit relieving that the stream

2293
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,220
Went up because we at least know what their goal was

2294
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:31,220
Up until that point

2295
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,220
There were days of just like well

2296
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,220
All the accounts have been stolen we don't know why

2297
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:37,220
Or for what fucking purpose

2298
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:39,220
That's true and considering like I said

2299
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,220
Before like the stories that people have gotten

2300
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,220
Their accounts back after like maybe two weeks or so

2301
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,220
I mean it's already been you know

2302
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,220
Three four days hopefully

2303
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,220
You know we're already well into that timetable

2304
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,220
I don't know I guess we'll see

2305
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,220
It's reassuring that you're talking to a human

2306
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:55,220
Yeah fine

2307
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,220
Like you start with a bot

2308
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,220
You get a ticket created and then they put you through via email

2309
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,220
To what appears to be an actual human

2310
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,220
Alright well it's 444

2311
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,220
So in the name of Jay-Z let's listen to voicemails

2312
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,220
Yeah sounds good

2313
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,220
Alright so okay so again fucking

2314
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,220
The damn bot is broken so we gotta listen to him

2315
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,220
By clicking on them but if you want to leave voicemails

2316
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,220
Go to the speak pipe link down below

2317
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,220
Which miraculously is still

2318
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,220
Active and people can submit voicemails to

2319
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,220
Even though we haven't paid and we're way beyond

2320
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,220
The total capacity

2321
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,220
I can't explain it and neither can anyone else

2322
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,220
But we're gonna listen to him here so leave your voicemails

2323
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,220
There

2324
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,220
Alright first one is from cringe

2325
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,220
You guys have it pulled out?

2326
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,220
Yeah are we good?

2327
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,220
Oh you got it

2328
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,220
Oh okay on the count of three

2329
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,220
Let's all click on cringe here we go

2330
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,220
One, two, three

2331
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,220
Hey PCP all this radcon 4

2332
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,220
Creative hype has me

2333
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,220
Wanting to try and put myself out there

2334
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,220
In the form of video game streaming

2335
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,220
Thing is I'm an introverted motherfucker

2336
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,220
And last night on my very first

2337
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,220
Ever stream within an hour

2338
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,220
I had 200 of my facebook

2339
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,220
More me friends watching my stream

2340
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,220
Hopping in chat

2341
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,220
Now the thing is

2342
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:07,220
I am a total cringe lord

2343
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,220
I don't know how to deal with this many people

2344
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,220
And I was just wondering how all of you do it

2345
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,220
Gib what's your advice

2346
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:15,220
You seem more the introverted type like myself

2347
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:17,220
How do you put yourself out there

2348
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,220
For the internet people

2349
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,220
I'd really like to try and get myself out there

2350
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:23,220
And make a hobby out of this if nothing else

2351
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,220
No monetary goals in mind

2352
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,220
Any input would be highly valued

2353
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,220
Thanks for your time guys

2354
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,220
What the fuck introvert has 200 facebook friends

2355
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,220
If you're getting 200 viewers

2356
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,220
That's like

2357
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,220
You're like the top 1% of twitch

2358
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,220
Yeah that's staggering

2359
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,220
I am games rarely broke 100

2360
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,220
Viewers in its entire existence

2361
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,220
On youtube I was able to get

2362
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,220
Significantly more streams than I

2363
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,220
Or viewers than I did on there

2364
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,220
Maybe facebook is also way better

2365
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,220
Was he streaming on facebook?

2366
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:55,220
Yeah I think so

2367
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:57,220
Speaking personally

2368
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,220
I have 79 friends on facebook

2369
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,220
So literally not enough for this to happen

2370
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:05,220
He was asking you

2371
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,220
I clicked the thing but it took a while to load

2372
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,220
So I was out of sync

2373
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,220
So I may have missed

2374
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,220
What was his question exactly

2375
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,220
He said he's a cringe lord

2376
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,220
And he's introverted

2377
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,220
But he did a stream yesterday

2378
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,220
Got 200 viewers on facebook it seems

2379
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,220
But he feels I guess nervous about it

2380
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,220
Cause he got more people than he expected

2381
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:27,220
He was asking for advice

2382
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,220
I don't know how to make a hobby out of it

2383
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,220
If you have like a big chat

2384
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,220
You can kinda just ignore the chat

2385
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,220
I mean not completely

2386
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,220
But you can kinda just let the chat interact with itself

2387
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,220
For like long stretches

2388
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,220
For significant stretches

2389
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,220
You don't have to worry too much about it

2390
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,220
I mean in terms of like being introverted

2391
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,220
And putting yourself out there anyway

2392
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,220
It's just a matter of

2393
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:51,220
Doing it a lot of times

2394
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,220
I mean if you listen to like

2395
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,220
Early episodes of the pcp

2396
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,220
I am like a

2397
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,220
Even more meek than now

2398
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,220
I'm still like not the loudest person

2399
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,220
But like in general

2400
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,220
I've improved a lot

2401
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,220
In terms of being able to speak

2402
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,220
Not just on podcasts

2403
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,220
But like in conversations

2404
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:13,220
So yeah just do a lot of streams I guess

2405
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,220
It's interesting that he chose

2406
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,220
The word introvert

2407
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,220
Cause like I would consider myself an introvert

2408
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:21,220
I don't think of streaming

2409
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,220
As talking to people

2410
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,220
It's just talking to myself in front of people

2411
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,220
That might be why

2412
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,220
It's easier for me

2413
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,220
The abstraction of the fact that

2414
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:33,220
It's just names that I don't know who they are

2415
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,220
Makes it not feel like

2416
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,220
I don't feel like I'm public speaking

2417
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,220
Yeah maybe he knows all these people

2418
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,220
That would definitely be a different feeling

2419
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,220
I mean yeah I would not want to stream

2420
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,220
To what he said

2421
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,220
Quote normie friends on Facebook

2422
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:49,220
First of all get rid of these fucking normie friends

2423
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,220
What the hell

2424
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,220
I mean if they're

2425
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,220
If you don't like them

2426
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:57,220
If they are donating get them the fuck out of there

2427
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,220
Yeah this is a pay to play community

2428
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,220
Here on my Facebook guys

2429
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,220
Gotta turn those players into payers

2430
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:07,220
Oh no

2431
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,220
Well

2432
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:11,220
Wail is over

2433
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:13,220
You clearly like doing it

2434
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,220
Here's just a plan you can use

2435
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,220
I would say the more you do it the more comfortable you'll be

2436
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,220
So that's fine

2437
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,220
Like a little bit of make a plan for yourself

2438
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:23,220
Like know what you're gonna do

2439
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,220
How long you're gonna do it you can

2440
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,220
Post ahead of time if you want people to know

2441
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,220
Then like it's a known quantity

2442
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,220
You start and stop at a time

2443
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,220
There's no pressure on you to do more

2444
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,220
And you can just relax

2445
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,220
Interact with the chat as much as you please

2446
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,220
And just get the experience under your belt

2447
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,220
And you'll be fine

2448
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,220
If there's too many people watching you're already doing something right

2449
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,220
I think the most important thing is that

2450
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,220
You just started it's not gonna be amazing

2451
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,220
That being super entertaining

2452
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,220
Is part of the process

2453
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,220
Practice is gonna make you much better at speaking

2454
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:55,220
You're gonna get a feel for not only

2455
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,220
How you like interacting on stream

2456
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:59,220
But what your audience responds to it's a give and take

2457
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,220
Between like the viewers and you

2458
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,220
And you'll just kind of like

2459
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:05,220
Become more comfortable with it

2460
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,220
I just think the best thing to do is just keep pushing onward

2461
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,220
I mean Kobe Bryant

2462
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,220
Wasn't a great helicopter pilot in his first day

2463
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:13,220
Oh

2464
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,220
Shit

2465
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:17,220
Too soon dude

2466
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,220
I'm sorry Kobe

2467
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,220
He's dunking in heaven

2468
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,220
Alright let's go to the next one

2469
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,220
Even I feel bad about that one

2470
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,220
Alright let's go to the next one

2471
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,220
I haven't even absorbed that fact

2472
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,220
It's so weird that I actually haven't in my life

2473
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,220
It is very strange it feels like a family guy

2474
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,220
Skate more than like a real

2475
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,220
Some people joke to cope

2476
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,220
Alright let's go to the next one

2477
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,220
This is a camel quandary

2478
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,220
Is our next voicemail

2479
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,220
Alright on the count of three

2480
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,220
Here we go one two three

2481
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,220
Hey PCP I'm gonna try and keep

2482
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,220
This short and sweet

2483
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,220
As I'm sure you're well aware

2484
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,220
Camels are quite adept at dispensing

2485
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,220
Bile great distances

2486
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,220
They spit as a self defense mechanism

2487
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,220
What kind of on command for their amusement

2488
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:05,220
If you were to have a camel

2489
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,220
Genetically modified to dispense

2490
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,220
Any liquid in this manner

2491
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,220
You so desire what liquid

2492
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,220
Would that be and why

2493
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:15,220
For the purposes of this exercise

2494
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:17,220
Camel must be all green

2495
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,220
And the liquid selection

2496
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:21,220
Will not affect the camel's well being

2497
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:23,220
Let's say you chose something like lava

2498
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,220
The camel could then spit the lava

2499
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,220
And it would not

2500
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,220
Catch on fire from the inside

2501
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,220
Curious to know your thoughts on this

2502
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,220
Coconut milk

2503
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:35,220
Anything keto is fine

2504
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:37,220
Come

2505
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,220
No doubt

2506
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:41,220
Camels already do that

2507
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,220
I guess I'd take huel

2508
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,220
Just squirt huel everywhere

2509
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,220
I don't want to catch fucking camel spit

2510
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,220
We all go straight to like liquid

2511
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,220
We want to consume from its mouth

2512
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:53,220
How can we use this camel to nourish ourselves

2513
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,220
It just saves money dude

2514
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,220
It just saves money

2515
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,220
My choice is of course weed

2516
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:03,220
That's not a liquid

2517
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,220
It can be a liquid

2518
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,220
The oil, the vapable oil

2519
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:09,220
I was trying to remember

2520
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,220
The word, the oil was the word

2521
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,220
I was looking for

2522
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,220
Start hurting camels, you just run around with buckets

2523
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,220
Trying to catch spit

2524
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,220
I was going to say stevia

2525
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,220
Cause that's just expensive

2526
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,220
Stevia

2527
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,220
That's also a salad, isn't it

2528
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,220
You can get it liquid

2529
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:29,220
Okay, okay

2530
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,220
Just pop open one of my fucking seltzers

2531
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:33,220
I want it to be a little sweeter

2532
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,220
I've got it, water

2533
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,220
They've already got their own water

2534
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,220
Like if I'm on the desert in a camel's spit

2535
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,220
And water, that's great

2536
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,220
Aren't they already spitting water?

2537
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,220
It's spit though

2538
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,220
You can't drink that

2539
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,220
If it was like pure clean drinking water

2540
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:51,220
If it was like pure clean drinking water

2541
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,220
Pure clean drinking water isn't bad

2542
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,220
We should get

2543
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,220
In Dungeons and Dragons

2544
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,220
There are a bunch of different dragon types

2545
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,220
Everyone has a different type of breath weapon

2546
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:03,220
These are probably like their younger cousins

2547
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,220
Speaking of Dungeons and Dragons

2548
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,220
I made a tweet a few days ago saying

2549
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:09,220
I was like getting into critical role

2550
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,220
Like hardcore cause I am, I'm addicted

2551
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:13,220
And a bunch of people have responded

2552
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,220
To that tweet saying do D&D at Radcon 4

2553
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,220
Make it a stretch go we pay for it

2554
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,220
Dude, oh yeah, oh I talked about this

2555
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,220
I thought we should play the Chuck Tingle

2556
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:23,220
Pen and paper RPG

2557
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,220
Oh my god

2558
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,220
A live stream of a D&D

2559
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:29,220
Session is a pretty good idea

2560
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,220
I mean that's what critical role is

2561
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:33,220
It doesn't even need it

2562
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,220
We could like make it with good production

2563
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,220
Every now and then I have this idea

2564
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:39,220
Man we should do like a PCP D&D game

2565
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:41,220
Or something and I absolutely think we should do it

2566
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:43,220
I'm not as interested

2567
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,220
In doing D&D as

2568
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:47,220
So you guys don't know about this

2569
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:49,220
But Don Jolly, my friend

2570
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,220
Has a role playing game that he made

2571
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:53,220
Called Gorefest

2572
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,220
That's really fucking cool

2573
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,220
And there's a video of him doing a live Gorefest session

2574
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,220
They actually got a venue in New York City

2575
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,220
To play a live Gorefest

2576
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:03,220
And it's basically a game

2577
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:05,220
That is meant to emulate

2578
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,220
Like 80's action movies

2579
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:09,220
But it's very streamlined

2580
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,220
It's way less

2581
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:13,220
Rule intensive

2582
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:15,220
The way it plays

2583
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,220
Is how we would want to play D&D

2584
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,220
So I think we should look into doing

2585
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:21,220
Gorefest

2586
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,220
It definitely does not have to be

2587
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,220
D&D specifically

2588
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:27,220
Like nobody cares

2589
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,220
In general though

2590
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,220
Okay

2591
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,220
It's a good idea

2592
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:35,220
Is there like a GM for Gorefest as well?

2593
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,220
Yeah you need a GM

2594
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:39,220
I was talking

2595
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:41,220
My friends IRL

2596
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:43,220
Are big into tabletop games

2597
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,220
And my friend was telling me

2598
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,220
He told me about the chuck tingle

2599
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,220
The tingle verse pen and paper game

2600
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:51,220
Which sounds pretty funny

2601
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,220
There's also one, this is an official thing

2602
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,220
There is a Wendy's

2603
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:57,220
Yes there is

2604
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,220
And you gain bonuses in combat

2605
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,220
By eating Wendy's menu items

2606
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,220
You do

2607
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,220
Like literally in real life doing that?

2608
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,220
Yes, in real life

2609
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,220
So we should definitely get on that

2610
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,220
I really hope there's a Wendy's near Radcon

2611
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:15,220
I'm gonna link you guys

2612
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,220
The video of the live Gorefest

2613
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,220
It was about the mission to kill Jeffrey Epstein

2614
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,220
For assassins

2615
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,220
Had to compete

2616
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:25,220
Regardless of whether I want

2617
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,220
To play this game

2618
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:29,220
That does sound good

2619
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,220
You gain bonus XP if you can recover the flight logs

2620
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,220
Alright

2621
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,220
Let's go to our next voicemail already

2622
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,220
We got a bunch

2623
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,220
Number 3 is just fan meetup please

2624
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,220
Are you ready to click?

2625
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,220
Yeah

2626
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,220
I'm ready

2627
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:49,220
On the count of 3

2628
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:51,220
Yes

2629
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:53,220
On the count of 3

2630
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,220
Hello PCP

2631
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,220
A couple episodes ago there was mention

2632
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,220
Of a possible fan meetup during Radcon 4

2633
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,220
And I was wondering

2634
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,220
If you guys were still having that idea

2635
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,220
To fit that into the busy

2636
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,220
Radcon 4 schedule

2637
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,220
I know you guys already have so many

2638
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,220
Backer

2639
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,220
Rewards

2640
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,220
But I'm sure there are so many people

2641
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,220
Who would love to meet you

2642
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,220
I personally would have to buy a plane ticket

2643
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:21,220
To a place to stay

2644
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,220
But I would do that in a heartbeat

2645
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:25,220
If it meant that I got to meet my favorite content creators

2646
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:27,220
So I'm wondering if that was

2647
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,220
The idea you guys were having

2648
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,220
Thank you

2649
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:33,220
There you go

2650
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:35,220
We were talking about it

2651
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,220
In the discord group

2652
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,220
Our discord

2653
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,220
I think it's a good idea

2654
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:43,220
It is a good idea

2655
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,220
I didn't weigh in at the time but I like the idea

2656
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,220
I had reservations mostly because

2657
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,220
Of potential

2658
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,220
Problems with

2659
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,220
I don't know

2660
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:55,220
People flying out and finding a place to say

2661
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:57,220
And then the weather

2662
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,220
We don't have a venue and it's

2663
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,220
It's lame

2664
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:03,220
I saw that conversation

2665
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,220
And Munchie was talking

2666
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:07,220
I basically agree with Munchie 100%

2667
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,220
If we just

2668
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:11,220
Say a time and a place

2669
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,220
It's up to them to figure it out

2670
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,220
Let me just say

2671
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,220
There was talk

2672
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,220
For Munchie of

2673
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,220
Letting everyone into the house

2674
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,220
I don't think we should have the meetup

2675
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,220
At the house

2676
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:27,220
As long as we don't do that

2677
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:29,220
That's against our house rules

2678
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,220
We couldn't do that anyway

2679
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,220
I have an actual point I can make

2680
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,220
Against that

2681
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,220
We all really like that idea

2682
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,220
We would definitely put some big asterisk

2683
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,220
Go at your own risk

2684
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:43,220
We cannot promise a good time

2685
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,220
We can promise that

2686
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,220
I guess around the grand scheme of things

2687
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,220
Every child is born with

2688
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:51,220
Only a guarantee of suffering and nothing else

2689
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,220
We also cannot promise that people

2690
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,220
Will even enjoy the content from Radcon

2691
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,220
For

2692
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,220
At least they know from our

2693
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,220
History what our content

2694
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,220
Whereas if they were actually at Radcon

2695
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:05,220
They know what a bunch of disgusting degenerate losers

2696
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,220
Who don't do anything cool we all are

2697
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:09,220
And how we selectively pick

2698
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:11,220
And falsely represent our real lives

2699
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:13,220
I do think the idea of a fan meetup

2700
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:15,220
Is a good idea

2701
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,220
Where Radcon For is taking place

2702
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,220
In Virginia

2703
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,220
I don't think it will be

2704
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:23,220
That fun of a place to have a meetup

2705
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,220
But

2706
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,220
I do think it would be a good idea

2707
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,220
After

2708
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,220
Whenever the next Radcon time rolls around

2709
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:33,220
To do what you guys were saying earlier

2710
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:35,220
And literally do a convention

2711
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:37,220
Like get an actual space

2712
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,220
I think we can do both

2713
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:41,220
I don't think being in Virginia beach

2714
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:43,220
Is like a problem

2715
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,220
Like any place we wanted to do it

2716
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:47,220
Would present its own

2717
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,220
Logistical challenges and I mean this is when

2718
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:51,220
The most of us are going to be in one place at one time

2719
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,220
It seems like a natural time to do it

2720
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,220
I'm just saying

2721
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:57,220
A meetup at Radcon For

2722
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,220
Will be

2723
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,220
Potentially pretty cool

2724
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:03,220
And most likely expensive

2725
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,220
For whoever needs to get there

2726
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,220
What do you guys think we would do

2727
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,220
At this Radcon

2728
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,220
I had one thought

2729
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:13,220
Meet us at the park

2730
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:15,220
Literally

2731
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,220
I just thought it might be fun

2732
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,220
For example to have a volleyball game

2733
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:21,220
Or something like that

2734
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:23,220
That was literally what I thought would be fun

2735
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,220
It's just an excuse to hang out

2736
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:27,220
With people

2737
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,220
And maybe get some cool footage for Victor

2738
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,220
Here's an idea

2739
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,220
That might work

2740
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,220
Which would be if we did it

2741
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,220
So where Radcon

2742
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,220
Is actually happening

2743
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,220
Is not technically in Virginia beach

2744
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:43,220
It's in Norfolk

2745
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:45,220
But Virginia beach

2746
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,220
The actual ocean front

2747
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:49,220
Is a gigantic huge commercial

2748
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,220
Tourist beach

2749
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,220
That is just a line of about 200 hotels

2750
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,220
So

2751
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:57,220
And the hotel on the very end of that

2752
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:59,220
Is fairly cheap

2753
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,220
So if everybody was going to stay there

2754
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,220
And we did it at the actual beach

2755
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,220
Which means we come to them

2756
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:07,220
That would be good

2757
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:09,220
There's literally volleyball nets

2758
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,220
They're already set up

2759
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:13,220
That sounds great

2760
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:15,220
I love the ocean

2761
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:17,220
We marched down the beach in a giant mob

2762
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,220
And we protest legalized

2763
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,220
PCP

2764
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:23,220
You stole

2765
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,220
The rfckcon slime protest idea

2766
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,220
I will say

2767
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:29,220
For slime

2768
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,220
But we can do it again

2769
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,220
The ocean front is crawling with cops

2770
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,220
So I would be a little bit

2771
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:37,220
Not trying to draw too much attention to ourselves

2772
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:39,220
Did I mention that

2773
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,220
The slime protest

2774
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,220
The cops actually rolled up

2775
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,220
And stared at us

2776
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:47,220
And left

2777
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,220
In the first week

2778
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:51,220
That Pokemon Go came out

2779
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:53,220
Everyone was hanging around at UC

2780
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:55,220
The Cincinnati University

2781
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,220
Everybody was there

2782
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,220
The cops rolled up

2783
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,220
And just kept on going

2784
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,220
There was an unbelievably large amount of people

2785
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:05,220
In this one little entrance

2786
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:07,220
Where there was like four polka stops

2787
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:09,220
Directly next to each other

2788
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,220
Understandably so

2789
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:13,220
The cops are good boys

2790
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,220
If we did it at the ocean front

2791
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,220
It would be reasonable

2792
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,220
Because even if people weren't just coming to see us

2793
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,220
It's a tourist location

2794
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:23,220
There's automatically things

2795
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:25,220
I will say though

2796
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:27,220
Have money if you're going to do this

2797
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:29,220
This girl right here

2798
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:31,220
I'll take care of myself

2799
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,220
I want to hang out

2800
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:35,220
If they know going

2801
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:37,220
With their eyes open

2802
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:39,220
That's cool

2803
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,220
We don't really have to do

2804
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,220
Or provide much of anything else

2805
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,220
Beside we will be there

2806
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:47,220
That's the main thing

2807
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,220
The only thing I'm worried about

2808
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:51,220
If it rained that day

2809
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:53,220
If someone goes wrong

2810
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:55,220
We'll just go inside

2811
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,220
And let people know where we're at

2812
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:59,220
Or something

2813
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:01,220
We'll probably do something like that

2814
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,220
As long as we're at the ocean front

2815
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,220
There will be plenty of places we can bus

2816
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:07,220
It's a place that is designed

2817
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:09,220
To host large numbers of tourists

2818
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:11,220
The Virginia Beach beach

2819
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,220
Is it okay to film

2820
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,220
I assume it would be

2821
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:17,220
With Victor's camera and everything

2822
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:19,220
I filmed music videos there

2823
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,220
If you want to see the spot I'm talking about

2824
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:23,220
Watch the sad boy

2825
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,220
It's all filmed at the ocean front

2826
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,220
Because we could make

2827
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,220
A lot of footage from that

2828
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:31,220
Be part of the OVA

2829
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:33,220
Because that stretch goal is reached

2830
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:35,220
That's exactly what I was thinking

2831
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,220
Where would we film those things

2832
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:39,220
Synergy

2833
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,220
Be an extra in the OVA

2834
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,220
But don't come if you have money problems

2835
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:45,220
If you're interested

2836
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:47,220
We're not responsible for anything

2837
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:49,220
Should this be a stretch goal

2838
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,220
I don't know

2839
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:53,220
I think we should do it

2840
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,220
We're already pretty

2841
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,220
Kitted out on stretch goals

2842
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:59,220
My fear is

2843
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,220
That people who would donate more

2844
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,220
Will instead buy plane tickets

2845
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,220
Maybe we'll be like backers only

2846
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:09,220
I think it should be a sad thing

2847
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,220
Nothing's going to stop people

2848
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,220
Nothing could stop them from just showing up

2849
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,220
It's true

2850
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,220
We will work this out later

2851
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,220
We'll keep you posted on

2852
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:23,220
What the fuck's the deal people

2853
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:25,220
We'll get back to you

2854
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:27,220
Let's go to our next voicemail

2855
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:29,220
Which is I'll Die

2856
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,220
On getting a Hewlett sponsorship

2857
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,220
Ready to click everybody

2858
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:35,220
Good to go

2859
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,220
Count of three

2860
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:39,220
Nate, if you're really serious about

2861
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:41,220
Getting this Hewlett sponsorship

2862
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:43,220
Then you need to do one vital thing first

2863
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,220
And that stops giving you free advertising

2864
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:47,220
You always talk about

2865
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,220
How you love the product

2866
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,220
And you think it's great

2867
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:53,220
And that they need to give you a sponsorship

2868
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:55,220
But why would they start paying you

2869
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:57,220
To do something that you are already doing

2870
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,220
You're already an advocate for the company

2871
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,220
That would just be a loss for them

2872
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:03,220
And would make your message seem a little less trustworthy

2873
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,220
Because now you're getting paid to say it

2874
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:09,220
So by this logic

2875
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,220
You should express

2876
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:13,220
No positive feelings about a product

2877
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:15,220
Until you're sponsored

2878
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,220
I think that's probably true

2879
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:19,220
For monetary gain

2880
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,220
There's some credibility to that

2881
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,220
But I do think that if

2882
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,220
Your audience sees how much you hype

2883
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:27,220
Fuel and then they actually

2884
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,220
Did something for you

2885
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,220
The audience would respect that

2886
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:33,220
That's true

2887
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,220
I know for a fact

2888
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:37,220
Many people have gotten into Hewlett

2889
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:39,220
Due to my love of the product

2890
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,220
I literally did free promo

2891
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,220
For fucking Kona Grill BBQ sandwiches

2892
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:45,220
And they eventually sent me

2893
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:47,220
Two $25 gift cards to Kona Grill

2894
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:49,220
Which I have not been able to use

2895
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,220
Because they shut down

2896
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,220
Almost all the Kona Grill

2897
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,220
It was that that put them over the edge

2898
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:57,220
That cut into their profit margins

2899
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,220
They were like

2900
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:01,220
We're gambling it all on these

2901
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:03,220
Two $25 gift cards

2902
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,220
Also the nearest one

2903
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,220
To me is in Baltimore

2904
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:09,220
The one that we've been to so

2905
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:11,220
Maybe one day

2906
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,220
But fucking if

2907
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:15,220
Okay, so perhaps I will

2908
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:17,220
Tamp down on the Hewlett

2909
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:19,220
Praise and up my attempts

2910
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:21,220
To actually reach someone at the company

2911
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,220
Until something gives one way or another

2912
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,220
Alright, next one

2913
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:27,220
Next one is simply called

2914
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:29,220
I Hate Teenagers

2915
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,220
Teenagers, it says

2916
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,220
I might have misspelled that

2917
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:35,220
Let's call them Teenagers

2918
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:37,220
Alright, the count of three, here we go

2919
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:39,220
One, two, three

2920
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:41,220
My wife for her job

2921
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:43,220
Works with teenagers

2922
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,220
And so that means

2923
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,220
Far more often than I would like in my life

2924
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:49,220
That I have to be around teenagers

2925
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:51,220
And I fucking hate them

2926
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:53,220
It sounds miserable

2927
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:55,220
As a bunch of guys in their late 20s

2928
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:57,220
Or early 30s

2929
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:59,220
Who are constantly surrounded by annoying

2930
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,220
Teenagers in their fan base

2931
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:03,220
How the fuck do y'all do it

2932
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,220
How do I spend more than 15 minutes

2933
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,220
Around these awkward fucks

2934
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:09,220
Trying to blow my brains out

2935
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,220
It helps that we're

2936
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:13,220
Interfacing with them through the internet

2937
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,220
Where you don't have to deal with this much of it

2938
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,220
I think we might have to cancel that meetup guys

2939
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:21,220
I mean a lot of the people at RFKanK

2940
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:23,220
Were like late teens

2941
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:25,220
Like probably

2942
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:27,220
A good third of them were under 20

2943
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:29,220
Or something

2944
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:31,220
And you know what, it wasn't that cringe

2945
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:33,220
It wasn't very cringe

2946
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:35,220
Obviously there are plenty of teenagers

2947
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:37,220
Munchy was a teenage

2948
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:39,220
Was like 12 when we fucking first met him

2949
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:41,220
Yeah, something like that

2950
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,220
Teenagers who like

2951
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,220
I think there are certain teenagers who just like

2952
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,220
And I mean everybody says this

2953
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:49,220
But they get it in their head

2954
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,220
That they just know everything already

2955
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:53,220
When you interact with those people

2956
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:55,220
And they're like

2957
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,220
I think there are some teenagers

2958
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:59,220
Who, yeah, they're smart

2959
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,220
And you can have a conversation with them

2960
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:03,220
But they kind of expect

2961
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:05,220
That they will not know

2962
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:07,220
As much about the world as you do

2963
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:09,220
As an older person

2964
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:11,220
And when you talk to a teenager who doesn't seem

2965
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,220
To think that that would be the case

2966
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:15,220
It's so frustrating

2967
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:17,220
It's like how can you not understand

2968
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:19,220
How little perspective you have

2969
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:21,220
Because you're a fucking in school

2970
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,220
Like it's, being in school

2971
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,220
Is totally different from living life

2972
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,220
Outside of school

2973
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:29,220
You learn so much just from

2974
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,220
Like the first second

2975
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,220
You're not in that controlled environment

2976
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:35,220
That your perspective is radically different

2977
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,220
And so the moment you have

2978
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:39,220
You're responsible for paying your own bills

2979
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:41,220
And like maintaining your own place of residence

2980
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,220
And getting all your own food

2981
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:45,220
Like I feel like I became an adult

2982
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:47,220
The second that was my responsibility

2983
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,220
And not until that point

2984
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:51,220
Which was at like age like 24

2985
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,220
Or 25 or something

2986
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,220
Pretty much when I moved out on my own

2987
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:57,220
Well, really it was when my parents moved out

2988
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:59,220
Of my house

2989
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:01,220
I think humans are kind of like beasts of burden

2990
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:03,220
And by applying a burden to them

2991
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:05,220
They actually rise to the challenge

2992
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:07,220
And grow and evolve as beings

2993
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:09,220
And that this is kind of a helpful

2994
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,220
State of being for the species to be in

2995
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:13,220
To some degree

2996
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:15,220
I just solved the case

2997
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,220
I just cracked it wide open

2998
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:19,220
By the way, I was going to say about teenagers

2999
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:21,220
The other thing about that is

3000
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:23,220
We always say that Munchie was an outstanding teenager

3001
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,220
And still is

3002
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,220
He's 18 or 19 now

3003
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:29,220
So still a teenager

3004
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:31,220
But Munchie, as long as I've known him

3005
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:33,220
Has been way ahead of the curb

3006
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:35,220
In terms of like other people his age

3007
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:37,220
I mean his intellect is astounding

3008
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,220
It is substantial

3009
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:43,220
And even if it's not like raw

3010
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,220
I don't know if it's like an IQ or whatever

3011
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,220
It's his initiative is like the real X factor

3012
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,220
Like responsibility

3013
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,220
We're talking about a guy who figured out how to

3014
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,220
Not need to attend high school

3015
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,220
So I don't know what the magic he pulled

3016
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:57,220
But he clearly knew way the fuck

3017
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,220
More than I did when I was his age

3018
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,220
Just take for example

3019
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:03,220
Our discussion about having a meetup

3020
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:05,220
At Radcon 4

3021
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,220
For example, that girl who called

3022
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:09,220
I don't know how old she is, maybe she's in her 20s

3023
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:11,220
Maybe she's 30s, I don't fucking know

3024
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:13,220
But it could easily see her being a teenager

3025
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:15,220
Along with lots of other people who might want to show up

3026
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:17,220
And also take the people at RFC K-Con

3027
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:19,220
Or RFK-Con, whatever

3028
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:21,220
All those people are pretty young, a lot of them fly in

3029
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,220
But what did it actually take them

3030
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,220
To that point, they didn't just wake up

3031
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,220
And let mommy and daddy do everything

3032
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,220
They had to be involved in a community

3033
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,220
Actively participate

3034
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:33,220
Find out about events, arrange to be there

3035
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,220
At a time and date and make all this happen themselves

3036
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:37,220
Only the ones that were capable of that

3037
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:39,220
Actually made it

3038
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:41,220
It's making it to the end of the fucking Naruto

3039
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:43,220
Chunin exam, if you survive to the end point

3040
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,220
You have needed out the week

3041
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:47,220
In high school I would not have been

3042
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:49,220
Equal to the task of

3043
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:51,220
Scheduling my own trip

3044
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,220
And paying for my own plane to get no fuck

3045
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:55,220
We were babies

3046
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:57,220
I'm thinking about all the times I went to convention

3047
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:59,220
It wasn't until pretty much when I was forced

3048
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:01,220
To drive Ben and DeVue to Atlanta

3049
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:03,220
Because Victor flaked

3050
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:05,220
That was the first time I ever did

3051
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:07,220
Any kind of major travel

3052
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,220
Where I was in charge

3053
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:11,220
I had to make any decisions at all

3054
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:13,220
And even then it was just to drive

3055
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:15,220
But from that

3056
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,220
That experience opened my world considerably

3057
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,220
I traveled the whole country after that

3058
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:21,220
I was scared to drive

3059
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:23,220
I mean you hated driving up to that point

3060
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:25,220
Or sometime around there

3061
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:27,220
It's not scared of me anymore

3062
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:29,220
Because I just do it every day

3063
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,220
One of the things that makes me less

3064
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:33,220
Worried about who should I be

3065
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:35,220
To even get here

3066
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:37,220
Means you have a baseline level of competence

3067
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:39,220
And it's like these people are going to be

3068
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,220
At least kind of decent

3069
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,220
Hopefully they have a baseline level of competence

3070
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:45,220
Hopefully they have a baseline level of competence

3071
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:47,220
A lot of the teenagers

3072
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:49,220
Or involved have already crossed

3073
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:51,220
At least a few of these thresholds

3074
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:53,220
If we do end up having a meet up at Radcon

3075
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:55,220
And you are a teenager just know

3076
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:57,220
That we probably will at some point

3077
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,220
Want to go into the bars

3078
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:01,220
That litter the shoreline

3079
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,220
Of Virginia Beach

3080
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:05,220
And you will not be able to follow

3081
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:07,220
You can go into the bar

3082
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,220
You just can't order any drinks

3083
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:11,220
I mean they're not going to ID you at the door or anything

3084
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:13,220
I mean some places they don't let you to go

3085
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,220
Most of them are restaurant bars

3086
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:17,220
You're in a tourist area

3087
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:19,220
They expect you to go with family

3088
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:21,220
That's fair

3089
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:23,220
For the guy's call though

3090
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:25,220
His question was like

3091
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:27,220
My wife works with kids

3092
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,220
She's probably a teacher or something

3093
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:31,220
Those kids had to cross zero hurdles

3094
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:33,220
To be involved in your life

3095
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:35,220
That's the problem here

3096
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:37,220
There's no skill floor

3097
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,220
No

3098
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:41,220
It goes all the way down

3099
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:43,220
So

3100
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,220
I would just say just minimize contact

3101
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,220
That's all I would do

3102
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,220
Divorce is your only option

3103
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:51,220
Consider

3104
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,220
You know I would say

3105
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:55,220
Just try to find the ones that are at least

3106
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:57,220
Kind of decent

3107
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:59,220
It's me or the children

3108
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:01,220
Repeat after me

3109
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:03,220
Me or them

3110
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:05,220
Me or them

3111
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:07,220
Next voice

3112
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:09,220
This one's simply called where

3113
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:11,220
And let's click on it

3114
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:13,220
One, two, three

3115
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:15,220
Where is the Tarantino podcast

3116
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,220
I wanted

3117
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:19,220
I mean the Tarantino cast

3118
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:21,220
Whatever

3119
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,220
Nate you promised that there will be more episodes

3120
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:25,220
Than one

3121
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:27,220
We'll record the next one

3122
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,220
If you don't want to

3123
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,220
Watch the next one

3124
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:33,220
And I'll be like a backer

3125
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:35,220
Behind the scenes content

3126
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:37,220
Like we did for

3127
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:39,220
Pulp Fiction

3128
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:41,220
And then we'll do a podcast

3129
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,220
There we go

3130
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:45,220
That's a great idea

3131
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:47,220
On a somewhat similar

3132
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:49,220
I think it would be cool

3133
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:51,220
If I made my

3134
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:53,220
Long awaited debut on the Poe D

3135
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:55,220
Cast at Radcon

3136
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,220
I'll finally catch up at one piece

3137
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,220
That would be great

3138
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:01,220
We'd love to have you

3139
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:03,220
So where are you now

3140
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,220
Oh god

3141
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:07,220
Did you make it to Big Mom yet

3142
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:09,220
Yeah I'm on

3143
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:11,220
So you're in the realm of things that have been covered

3144
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:13,220
On the Poe D

3145
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,220
They've met up with Jinbae again

3146
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:17,220
I think I'm maybe like a hundred chapters to go

3147
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,220
Before I'm

3148
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,220
That's not bad

3149
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:23,220
Wow it only just occurred to me

3150
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:25,220
A potty cast has been going for like three years

3151
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:27,220
Hasn't it

3152
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,220
Long fucking time on the potty cast

3153
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,220
Yup

3154
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,220
It's a good time

3155
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:35,220
Well Ben we would love that

3156
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:37,220
Fuck it for one piece

3157
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,220
Who knows

3158
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:41,220
Maybe five more years until the series ends

3159
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:43,220
I guess we'll see

3160
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:45,220
That sounds like a great idea

3161
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:47,220
I think like three years ago

3162
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:49,220
Or so Oda said

3163
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:51,220
In five years

3164
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:53,220
He might have said five or seven

3165
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,220
The arcs are getting longer

3166
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:57,220
I'm not just imagining that

3167
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,220
The arcs are definitely getting longer

3168
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:01,220
Dressrosa was the longest of all time

3169
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:03,220
Wano was already I believe

3170
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,220
Among the longest ever

3171
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:07,220
So they're even longer than Skypea

3172
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,220
Dude Skypea is

3173
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:11,220
Pretty long but compared to like

3174
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:13,220
Dressrosa it's like nothing

3175
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:15,220
Looking back on it

3176
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:17,220
And Dressrosa was like the worst arc too

3177
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:19,220
Which is

3178
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:21,220
Dressrosa isn't even bad all the way

3179
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:23,220
Anyway let's go to the next one

3180
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,220
I'm really excited for this one guys

3181
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:27,220
So you thought that Steel on my channel was bad

3182
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:29,220
Well I've got even more bad news for me

3183
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:31,220
Here's Nate Bestman

3184
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:33,220
This one's really gonna stain my reputation

3185
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:35,220
But let's give it a listen

3186
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,220
On the count of three

3187
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:39,220
One, two, three

3188
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:41,220
Listen buddy, only problem with that

3189
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:43,220
It was just too long

3190
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:45,220
Damn

3191
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:47,220
That's the long

3192
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:49,220
And short of it ladies and gentlemen

3193
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:51,220
Alright let's go to the next one

3194
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,220
Okay let's follow this up

3195
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:55,220
With a powerful voicemail

3196
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:57,220
From Homeless Ben

3197
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,220
He left three

3198
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:01,220
And I kept the two that got me to chuckle

3199
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,220
So let's hear that

3200
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:05,220
Okay first Homeless Ben

3201
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:07,220
Saga begins on the count of three

3202
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,220
One, two, three

3203
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:31,220
And a pot to piss in while you're at it

3204
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:33,220
A pot to piss in and a sink to shit it

3205
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:35,220
If there's anything left over sure

3206
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:37,220
These are the truly the two basic needs

3207
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,220
On like Maslow's hierarchy

3208
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,220
Those are the two lowest level ones

3209
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:43,220
Please guys help him

3210
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:45,220
Alright next Homeless Ben

3211
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:47,220
It's technically part three but it's our next one

3212
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:49,220
Alright on the count of three

3213
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:51,220
One, two, three

3214
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,220
Hey guys drunk Homeless Ben here again

3215
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:55,220
Today I asked my brother

3216
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:57,220
Nate for help but it was all a trick

3217
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:59,220
As soon as he let me in his house

3218
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:01,220
I took a shit in his sink too

3219
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:03,220
That'll choke capitalism

3220
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:05,220
The plan is going smoothly

3221
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:07,220
Did he say the one more

3222
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:09,220
Did he say the plan is going smoothly

3223
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:11,220
That's right Ben

3224
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,220
This is a narrative

3225
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,220
I'm thinking that might not be the real Ben

3226
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:17,220
Cause I don't think he would have left Nate's house without those fucking

3227
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:19,220
Wait Ben already has the shoes

3228
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:21,220
God damn it I fuck it all up

3229
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:23,220
Let me tell you Ben

3230
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,220
Those boots I got this Christmas

3231
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:27,220
When we were together I saw you

3232
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:29,220
I and my boots Ben

3233
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:31,220
I didn't even want my boots

3234
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,220
I didn't even want my boots

3235
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:35,220
I have boots

3236
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:37,220
Mom and dad were just dead set on buying us all boots

3237
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:39,220
Even though I told them I do not need boots

3238
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,220
Mom messaged me

3239
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:43,220
And she was like Nate you want some boots

3240
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:45,220
I was like I would love some boots

3241
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:47,220
These are cool and so she got them

3242
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:49,220
She was like oh how about Ben

3243
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,220
I'm like I don't know what shoes he has

3244
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:53,220
But like if you want to get him boots

3245
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:55,220
Mom's fucking up this operation again

3246
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:57,220
She's going to become redundant in the system

3247
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:59,220
She wouldn't make the cut

3248
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:01,220
She wouldn't meet the skill floor

3249
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:03,220
To make it to Radcon 4

3250
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:05,220
To make it to Radcon 4

3251
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:07,220
We should make a stretch to help our mom

3252
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,220
Make it to Radcon 4

3253
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:11,220
Pay for a chauffeur

3254
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:13,220
Alright next one

3255
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:15,220
Pancakes

3256
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:17,220
Another Ben St. Yikes

3257
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:19,220
I don't know exactly what that means

3258
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:21,220
You typed it

3259
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:23,220
Yeah but like there were colons

3260
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:25,220
In suspicious places that like

3261
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:27,220
Changed the meaning of the following words

3262
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:29,220
You know how it is

3263
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:31,220
One, two, three

3264
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:33,220
Hey PCP

3265
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:35,220
You won't believe it but I got myself into another little

3266
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:37,220
Pickle here

3267
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:39,220
So I was listening to the new PCP episode

3268
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:41,220
Ironically of course

3269
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:43,220
When I heard something coming from the trunk

3270
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,220
I opened it up and it was the girl

3271
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:47,220
And she said hey

3272
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:49,220
It's really hard to breathe back here

3273
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:51,220
Leave the trunk open

3274
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:53,220
And I said what do you think I'm stupid or something

3275
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,220
So I shoved her back in

3276
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,220
And closed the trunk

3277
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,220
And then shot it a couple times you know letting some air

3278
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:01,220
Wrong story short

3279
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:03,220
I just got back from taking a 6 feet hole

3280
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:05,220
And I was wondering you know

3281
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:07,220
If I should go to the funeral

3282
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:09,220
Because I just met her

3283
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:11,220
And I don't think I'm socially obligated to go

3284
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:13,220
And it'd be total cringe

3285
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:15,220
I have a met her parent right now

3286
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:17,220
But

3287
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:19,220
I look pretty cute from what I can tell from her phone

3288
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:21,220
So what am I supposed to do

3289
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:23,220
Oh and before I forget

3290
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,220
I did find a wallet

3291
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:27,220
It has Yang 2020 on it

3292
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,220
With a Yang scratch down replaced with Bernie

3293
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:31,220
So would you send it to my P.O. box

3294
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:33,220
Send it to my P.O. box

3295
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:35,220
Please, please return that kind sir

3296
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:37,220
Right it was a saga

3297
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:39,220
Grabbed a girl that's right thanks Pancakes

3298
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:41,220
With update

3299
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:43,220
No comment

3300
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:45,220
Well I mean I guess he wanted advice

3301
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:47,220
Go to the funeral and fuck the sister

3302
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:49,220
Yeah that's yes

3303
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:51,220
Do it on top of the open casket body

3304
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:53,220
A guilty man would never show up

3305
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:55,220
To his own victims funeral

3306
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:57,220
So you'll be in the clear

3307
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,220
That's true

3308
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:01,220
That's so true

3309
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:03,220
Get ready for a wacky situation where you two

3310
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:05,220
The sister are making out over the dead body

3311
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:07,220
Over the casket and then you're like oh no someone's coming

3312
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:09,220
So you jump inside grab her

3313
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:11,220
Close the casket on top of the two of you

3314
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:13,220
And you get buried alive

3315
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,220
And wacky hijinks ensue

3316
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:17,220
Pretty wacky

3317
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,220
The sax plays the whole time

3318
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:21,220
That's right

3319
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:23,220
The sister requested to be buried

3320
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:25,220
With a little mini speaker that played the acuity sax

3321
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,220
Oh like the two of them

3322
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,220
As the casket being carried

3323
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:35,220
They're both like horsed out

3324
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,220
They're like burst out of the bottom and they start running around

3325
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,220
As like they're chasing them

3326
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:43,220
When they see this they're like oh hey now

3327
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:45,220
Cut that out they shove the legs back in

3328
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:47,220
They put it in the coffin in the whole new barriers

3329
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:49,220
Yeah the happy ending

3330
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:51,220
They're just like oh you're not getting away this time

3331
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:53,220
We've had too many this week

3332
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:55,220
Alright anyway let's go on to our next one

3333
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:57,220
This is the number one

3334
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:59,220
Hewle again on Hewle version

3335
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,220
3.0 we've got a review coming in

3336
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:03,220
Let's hear what the Hewle world is like today

3337
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:05,220
On the count of three

3338
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:07,220
One, two, three

3339
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,220
Alright enough

3340
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:11,220
Primary retardation aside

3341
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:13,220
Hewle 3.0

3342
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:15,220
My current review

3343
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:17,220
After drinking some

3344
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:19,220
Right now

3345
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:21,220
Pretty solid

3346
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:23,220
It's much smoother

3347
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:25,220
I think the taste is also better

3348
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:27,220
It's worth boys it's worth

3349
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:29,220
Well there you go

3350
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,220
Until I have a chance to taste it

3351
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:33,220
If it's solid then how is he drinking it

3352
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,220
Wait

3353
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:39,220
It's powder god damn it

3354
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:41,220
They have bars too though maybe he got the bars

3355
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,220
He's got to mean

3356
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:45,220
Like he said like the textures better

3357
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,220
He's got to mean he's got to mean

3358
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:49,220
I was doing a joke

3359
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,220
I was rolling with the joke but then Nate

3360
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:53,220
Took it totally seriously and it ruined everything

3361
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:55,220
I just didn't understand I apologize

3362
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:57,220
Get out of here Brad

3363
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:59,220
He clearly stipulated no memes

3364
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:01,220
No jokes, no japs on this voicemail

3365
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:03,220
Hewle version 3 seems to be worth it

3366
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:05,220
I have two bags of Hewle 3.0

3367
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,220
You do?

3368
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:09,220
I haven't had any

3369
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:11,220
Cause I'm on keto and they're not keto at all

3370
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:13,220
Why the fuck did you buy them

3371
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,220
If you're on keto then god damn it

3372
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:17,220
Because literally

3373
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:19,220
Like five days after

3374
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:21,220
I ordered them we decided hey

3375
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:23,220
Let's do this whole beach themed rad con 4

3376
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:25,220
And I'm like well now I have to get hashtag not fat

3377
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:27,220
So I have to go on keto again

3378
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:29,220
Oh okay now's a good time to check in

3379
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:31,220
This will be I think this will come out at the end of the month

3380
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:33,220
So me, Ben and Tom made a little

3381
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:35,220
Wager or well I mean we just made

3382
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:37,220
An agreement that we would work out

3383
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:39,220
Have you guys been on point

3384
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:41,220
I have not

3385
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:43,220
I'm down 12 pounds

3386
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:45,220
12 pounds down so far

3387
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,220
Wait since New Year's

3388
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,220
Yes that's pretty good

3389
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:51,220
That's fantastic we started a little bit before

3390
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,220
No rckkcon completely threw me off

3391
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:55,220
I did lose the weight that I gained over the holidays

3392
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:57,220
But then rckcon hit

3393
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:59,220
Okay well hey as long as

3394
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:01,220
Fucked it all

3395
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:03,220
Alright well stay strong

3396
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:05,220
Brother I will say that

3397
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:07,220
I floundered

3398
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:09,220
For the beginning of the month

3399
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,220
It is true

3400
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:13,220
And so I would say I'm

3401
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:15,220
Probably like about the same weight

3402
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:17,220
I might be up or down like one pound

3403
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:19,220
But I'm roughly equivalent

3404
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:21,220
My goal was just to work out three times a week was my goal

3405
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:23,220
I failed that for the beginning of the month

3406
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:25,220
I am doing better

3407
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:27,220
In this latter half of the month

3408
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:29,220
My goal was to set a trend

3409
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:31,220
I'll make another deal

3410
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:33,220
Let's do it again

3411
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:35,220
I'm going to Hawaii

3412
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,220
In like fucking 10 days or so

3413
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:39,220
For my little actual vacation

3414
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,220
With Michelle and her family

3415
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,220
And I'm gonna be gross

3416
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:45,220
And ugly and fat

3417
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,220
And everyone's gonna laugh

3418
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:49,220
But hopefully I'll like lose it

3419
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:51,220
By living to island lifestyle

3420
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:53,220
Is it nice in Hawaii

3421
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:55,220
What could possibly be worse

3422
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:57,220
It's nice in Hawaii

3423
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:59,220
It's not as bad as last year

3424
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:01,220
Yes it's perfect all the time

3425
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:03,220
I haven't even thought about

3426
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:05,220
Getting beach body ready

3427
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:07,220
For the fucking thing

3428
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:09,220
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do

3429
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:11,220
Is there like a guide

3430
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:13,220
For skinny boys

3431
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:15,220
Aren't you just naturally beach body ready

3432
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:17,220
You're just like slim

3433
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,220
I'm slim but I'm not like

3434
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:21,220
I'm like a skeleton sometimes

3435
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:23,220
You gotta eat lots of protein

3436
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:25,220
There's one important factor

3437
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:27,220
That's being beach body ready

3438
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,220
And it is so overlooked by gentlemen

3439
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,220
Of our persuasion

3440
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:33,220
And it is being tan

3441
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:35,220
You gotta have

3442
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:37,220
You don't want to walk out there

3443
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:39,220
Like you're a fucking comp sign major

3444
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:41,220
I'm not gonna get it

3445
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:43,220
How the fuck am I gonna get a tan

3446
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:45,220
Before much

3447
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:47,220
I'll tell you how Gib

3448
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:49,220
You do it the way that I do it

3449
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:51,220
Oh wait you're in London

3450
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:53,220
You got like clouds and shit

3451
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,220
I'm gonna be the pale beauty

3452
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:57,220
I'm gonna be the one

3453
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:59,220
The beautiful geisha

3454
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:01,220
Or like the Scottish Highlands person

3455
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,220
They got white skin

3456
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:05,220
I'm white I can do that

3457
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:07,220
I'm just gonna be so hashtag

3458
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,220
Not fat by rad con

3459
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:11,220
That no one's gonna even notice

3460
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:13,220
A ghost

3461
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:15,220
I'll be rocking my usual hardcore

3462
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:17,220
Farmers tan that I have from driving

3463
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:19,220
All the time

3464
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,220
That sounds good

3465
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:23,220
I mean like a month prior

3466
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:25,220
I will have spent like 10 days in Hawaii

3467
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:27,220
So that tan that I will acquire

3468
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:29,220
Will probably last at least a little bit

3469
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,220
Until when I get back

3470
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:33,220
So hopefully I'll be able to coast off that

3471
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:35,220
For that time

3472
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:37,220
Alright let's hear about fucking this Brad Garling house fan

3473
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:39,220

Here we go one two three

3486
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:05,220
So I've got a question for Brad

3487
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:07,220
So like how's Ripple gonna

3488
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:09,220
Like turn out like

3489
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:11,220
Is this crypto gonna be

3490
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:13,220
A thing I should worry about or

3491
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:15,220
Like I don't know much

3492
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:17,220
About the crypto man

3493
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:19,220
Should I just should I use your code

3494
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:21,220
Should I not

3495
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:23,220
I don't know about this Ripple stuff

3496
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:25,220
Okay

3497
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:27,220
Like fuck dawg

3498
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:29,220
You started making anime then you revealed

3499
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:31,220
Your names actually Brad like what the fuck

3500
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,220
Brad

3501
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:35,220
It was an orthodox business move

3502
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:37,220
On my part but let me tell you guys

3503
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:39,220
Hashtag Ripple

3504
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:41,220
Hashtag XRP

3505
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:43,220
Hashtag cryptocurrency

3506
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,220
I mean you're definitely gonna want to like sell

3507
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:47,220
And give me full access to your bank account

3508
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:49,220
By clicking the link in my currently active stream

3509
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,220
The only way to mine

3510
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:53,220
Cripple is at night

3511
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:55,220
Like you there's no way to do it

3512
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:57,220
During the day so like you'd have to

3513
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:59,220
Sell your soul in multiple ways

3514
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:01,220
The only currency to be mined at night

3515
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,220
Uh yeah it's like

3516
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:05,220
It's like when you evolve an EV at night

3517
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:07,220
With max friendship it turns into an Umbreon

3518
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:09,220
Just when you mine crypto at night it turns into

3519
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:11,220
Cripple or Ripple

3520
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:13,220
Close enough I like Cripple

3521
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,220
Alright let's do our last voicemail

3522
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:17,220
Boys from the man himself

3523
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:19,220
Me, Brad Garlinghouse

3524
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:21,220
Is calling in CEO of Ripple

3525
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:23,220
Let's hear what I have to say

3526
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:25,220
On the count of three one two three

3527
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:27,220
Poor little Nate

3528
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:29,220
Swinging his pickaxe at the dead of night

3529
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:31,220
You thought that you could mine cryptocurrency

3530
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:33,220
While everyone else was asleep

3531
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:35,220
Well too bad

3532
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:37,220
I have assumed direct control

3533
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:39,220
Hacking was easy

3534
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:41,220
All I had to do was swing my silk touch

3535
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,220
Pickaxe at the screen and your channel

3536
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,220
Popped off right into my pocket

3537
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,220
Now I will reap the rewards

3538
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:49,220
Of all the cryptocurrency your subscribers

3539
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:51,220
Can provide

3540
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:53,220
This is what you get Nate

3541
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:55,220
This is what you get for mining at night

3542
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:59,220
This is going to be directly quoted in chapter two

3543
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:05,220
Brad Garlinghouse voice grail

3544
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:09,220
You know voice grail

3545
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,220
I don't know

3546
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:13,220
If we put him in the voice grail he might steal all those too

3547
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:15,220
Yeah we can't give him access to the voice grail

3548
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:17,220
As well

3549
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:19,220
But he earned it though

3550
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:21,220
This is a maritime and voice jail

3551
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:23,220
Let him take the souls of the lowly bunch

3552
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:25,220
In voice jail

3553
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:27,220
If he earns his way into the voice jail

3554
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:29,220
And he fair and square steals all of them

3555
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,220
Hacks all of their accounts

3556
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,220
Takes all of their ad rev I think he deserves it

3557
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:35,220
What if we make Brad Garlinghouse the guard

3558
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:37,220
Of voice jail

3559
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:39,220
He can't be trusted

3560
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:41,220
He can steal all the security footage

3561
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:43,220
So all the people in voice jail can

3562
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:45,220
Mysteriously kill themselves

3563
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:49,220
We should put him in the voice chain

3564
02:04:49,220 --> 02:04:51,220
Oh yeah

3565
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:53,220
The voice block chain

3566
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:55,220
It can't be stolen

3567
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:57,220
That's blockchain technology right there

3568
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:59,220
Yeah whatever that is

3569
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:01,220
There you go that's where you are Brad

3570
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:03,220

He's been playing this for months

3578
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:19,220
Yeah I'm sure you're right

3579
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,220
What else we got

3580
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:23,220

3582
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:27,220
And belljape and everything else

3583
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:29,220
Belljape and lord of ghosts are the best ones though

3584
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:31,220

02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:45,220
So if you see something new and shiny

3592
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:47,220
You're just like I gotta have that

3593

02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:51,220
You can always up your pledge

3595
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:53,220
Maybe we should go in

3596
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:55,220
Maybe you pledged that

3597
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:57,220
That's what I just finished

3598
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,220
No you said you can pledge it

3599
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:01,220
I said you can up your pledge at any time

3600
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:03,220
Okay well don't

3601
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:05,220
You cut out

3602
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:07,220
It's discord's fault

3603
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:09,220

02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:27,220
We can definitely link it on the patreon

3613
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:29,220
Nothing but the channels

3614
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:31,220
Only the channels are affected

3615
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,220
The kickstarter, the patreon

3616
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:35,220
Well that's fine

3617
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,220

3627
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:57,220
Primarily be tweeting from mine

3628
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:59,220
Remember when I learn more updates

3629
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:01,220
I'm not going to like between every second

3630
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:03,220
Of every detail but when there is meaningful things

3631
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:05,220
To let people know, I will let them know

3632
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:07,220
But you can expect, I don't know

3633
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:09,220
From the time you hear this, probably like a week

3634
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:11,220
Could be a reasonable time to expect before anything changes

3635
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:13,220
So you know

3636
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:15,220
Keep your expectations in check

3637
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:17,220
And keep your ear to the ground for more

3638
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:19,220
I guess that's it everybody

3639
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:21,220
And of course there's more voicemails

3640
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:23,220
Kickstarter, check out Lord of Ghost, etc etc

3641
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,220
And we will see you next week

3642
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:27,220
Save us

3643
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:29,220
By the way

3644
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:31,220
If we do not have the video up

3645
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:33,220
This might be on Digi's channel

3646
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:35,220
Could be somewhere else, I don't know

3647
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:37,220
We'll try to get the channel back as soon as possible

3648
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,220
But obviously as soon as the PCP is back up

3649
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:41,220
Everything will be re-uploaded there

3650
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:43,220
And we will continue as normal

3651
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:45,220
So here's hoping that happens fast

3652
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:47,220
Alright see you then everybody

3653
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:49,220
Bye

3654
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:57,220
Thank you
