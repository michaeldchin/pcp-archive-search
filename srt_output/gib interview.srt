00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to yet another Pro Crastinators Podcast interview series.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,400
I am here with the one and only Hippocrit.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,700
Yep, he is.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,000
Hippo, um...

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,700
I'm curious about the fact that a lot of the time on the show, people call you Gibbon.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
Why is this?

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,600
That is because it used to be our secret brony names. We all have them. That's our secret identity.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,600
That's my one. I'm a Gibbon.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
It's just my old channels. Gibbontake.youtube.com.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Yeah, that's really all it is. It's a nicer name to say than Hippo, so some people couldn't get into the habit of saying Hippo all the time.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,900
Yeah, it's that we called you Gibbon for so long, and then you changed to Hippocrit.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:12,900
But because you've always kept both channels active, it's kind of like how with Jesse, we all call him Jess, or we called him drowning in footwear for a long time, even though he had other channels that were even bigger.

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,300
Well, we called him Jesse Wood most of the time.

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Right. But with you, it was like, because we've never called you by just your name, which if you want to let the audience know what it is, then...

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
There's other places where they can find out.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh yeah? You're going to leave it mysterious?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure people know already. They can put it on that quiz.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, was it?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That procrastinators quiz.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So yeah, we have the hardest time deciding. I usually say Hippo. Nate usually says Gibbon.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think Ben usually says Hippo.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It really doesn't matter. People know that I'm being addressed.

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,700
I just wonder if it's confusing for anybody who doesn't know about your old channel, you know?

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Yeah. Well, that's it. It's give and take. On that channel, you'll find my Brony stuff, and a huge amount of weird, crazy nonsense that may or may not be entertaining.

25
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Surely you've done more weird vlogs than you have Brony content by now, right?

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I have. I think by now it's mostly just weird shit.

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Which is usually great. In fact, it's always great.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I don't know about always, but yeah, it's very experimental. I like it.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
So how did you get your start on YouTube?

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Well, my very start on YouTube, I think I made in like 2007 or 2008.

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:52,100
And I had Windows Movie Maker, and I made a video about putting Google images set to a Beatles song.

32
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,100
And I thought it was really cool, and my dad liked it. I don't know why I made it, but I made it, and I made a YouTube account because it was a thing.

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,100
And I put it on there. And that was the very beginning.

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,800
After that, I did a few stop motion things, and then when I really started doing stuff with the pony fandom, with all the stuff,

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I tried doing YouTube poops at first because I was really into that.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
They weren't that good, but I kind of laughed once.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,800
And after that, I got into doing compilations, which...

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,800
The first compilation was like... I don't know where I came up with the idea, but it was like a summer after school,

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,100
and I wasn't doing anything, and I was really bored, and I was into the pony fandom, so I thought,

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,100
I'll just make a video of all the times every pony says no.

41
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,100
And it was a huge undertaking because they say it a lot of times, and it took a long time, and I made it,

42
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,100
and I got like thousands of subscribers within a few hours, days, and it was overwhelming.

43
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,100
And after that, I just felt like I had to continue, and I did.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,400
So, when you made these compilations, every single one you made, you had to watch the entire show, right?

45
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Yes. Well, I didn't have to watch the entire show. What I did...

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm trying to think...

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,400
The way I went about it changed over time. At first, I was just going through, and I had a little notepad open,

48
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,400
like a digital notepad, and every time I'd have all the characters' names, or I would...

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,200
No, what I did, I went to the scripts, the online transcripts of the episodes, and I would control F for the word,

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
and then I would go to that point in the episode by memory, like when they say this line,

51
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,200
oh, I kind of know where that is, that's like five minutes in. I go in there, and then I see them say it,

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,200
and I pause, I tally one on the thing, and I just keep going.

53
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,200
And, yeah, it's really retarded and autistic when I think about it, but it was kind of fun.

54
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I've always wondered how ridiculously familiar you got with the show through doing that.

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Did you watch the episodes like a hundred times?

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:20,200
It sort of waded me out to... It made a very big difference in how I view or think about those episodes compared to the ones

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,200
that came after I stopped doing the compilations, like Season 4, because Season 4 was when I started doing the analysis,

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,200
and that carries its own sort of like... I remember those for having to watch them twice and think about them,

59
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,200
and the other ones I just know lots and lots of little parts of them all over the place,

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,200
and it's a very big disconnect from each, like Season 3 to Season 4 and then beyond.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Season 5 is actually the first season I feel like I watched as a guy watching the show, because of all that nonsense.

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:01,200
So, those compilations, I remember it, because I saw them from fairly early on to them being created,

63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,200
because they would get promoted really heavily on Equestria Daily. They'd get a whole post to themselves.

64
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I guess they were seen as something very valuable because of the effort that they took, or just the sheer weirdness of their existence.

65
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I think what I... I was pretty happy with the fact that I had come up with this idea, because the amount of work put in,

66
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I felt like nobody would go to the trouble of actually trying to compete with me, so I could just have all those posts to myself,

67
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,200
so I would just do all the words I could think of and get a billion subscribers, and it kind of worked.

68
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I had like 15,000... No, that was later. I think I got to like 9,000 or something through that alone.

69
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,200
So, you actually... Among the procrastinators, you had one of the bigger pony channels, like other than me and Tom,

70
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,200
you were probably the biggest out of everybody, right?

71
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,200
At that point, yeah, I mean, T-Bap I think overtook me at one point.

72
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I plateaued at... During the analysis stuff, I plateaued around 16K, or maybe 15K, and they went further.

73
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:22,200
So, you would do all these videos with the show, but then what really brought you to my attention was when you did the same thing

74
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:30,200
with actual analysis videos for the word analysis. How long did that take?

75
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Oh, well, that started because I did that one compilation of all the analysis people.

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Like, I found... It was ridiculous, because that was the biggest one, but nobody cares about it.

77
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,200
It's the one where I went through all of your videos, all of Tom's videos, all of...

78
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Basically, like a hundred different people, maybe. I looked into all of their videos and watched all of them,

79
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
and since there wasn't any transcripts, I had to literally watch every single video.

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I think I'd tell you... I can't remember how long it was, but it was... Maybe not thousands of hours.

81
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Hundreds of hours of watching these shitty videos, and after that, I did the analysis assemblage thing.

82
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
So, I already knew about a lot of these people, so I could just sort of go,

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:27,200
uh, okay, I guess I'll get all the opinions of everybody together, because usually people say the same thing over and over,

84
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,200
and if I can get the unique parts of everybody's conversation, it could be an interesting thing.

85
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
It kind of was, but probably not really that much.

86
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Well, I was first referring to the one that was just analysis, analysis, analysis, the compilation,

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:47,200
where it was every time anyone used the word analysis in an analysis video, and you compiled them all,

88
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,200
and I had like 150-something uses or something like that, like some ridiculous number, right?

89
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah.

90
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Like I said it fucking constantly, and it was really funny, and I remember taking it

91
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,200
and setting it to like this insane, like, noise song that like me and Victor had put together,

92
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
and just like put that over it, and it was like, did you put it after dark?

93
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I remember seeing that, I remember seeing that and being really, really happy that you had enjoyed it that much.

94
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Yeah, it was great.

95
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,200
And then, yeah, and then after that you started, it was with season four, right, that you did the analysis assemblage,

96
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,200
where it was like taking everyone's, a new episode would come out, everyone would release a video,

97
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,200
and then you would assemble all the best points they made into a video, right?

98
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Is that how you'd put it?

99
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Assembling all the different points, like if people were arguing with each other, I would bring up each other's topics,

100
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:54,200
but really they're not very, the people coming up with things is like, there's only so many ways you can view a certain episode,

101
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,200
and it's, yeah, I got bored of it pretty quickly.

102
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
So then you decided to throw your hat into doing it yourself, doing analysis videos.

103
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Yeah, which was much more fun, because it was me, and I'm important, and I'm cool.

104
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:16,200
And the way I remember the trajectory going was that at first you were trying more to be like an analysis guy,

105
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,200
and then very quickly you seemed to stop caring about that angle and wanted to just do jokes,

106
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
and they became much more comedy oriented.

107
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Yeah, I think it was the Christmas one or something, like it was over Christmas,

108
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
and I hadn't done the video because it was Christmas time and stuff was happening,

109
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,200
so I was like, ugh, I don't know, blah blah blah, and it was hilarious, and I really liked it, and everyone really liked it,

110
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,200
so I just thought I'd be more funny instead of caring too much about reviewing the show.

111
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:56,200
And then Jesse, I found Jesse's videos, and he introduced me to all different types of ways of being a brony

112
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
and enjoying the show and hating everyone, and that was cool.

113
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
So that sort of became the second wave, and then I died.

114
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
What was it?

115
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I know that I knew about you, but how did Jesse find out about you,

116
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,200
because I assume you would have said something about him at some point to draw his attention.

117
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I think Jesse had seen that I had mentioned him in one of my first analysis assemblage videos,

118
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,200
so he noticed that. I don't think he had talked to me then, but I think I talked to you.

119
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I remember when I first became Skype friends with you, we were playing that MMO, the Pony MMO, what Legends of Equestria,

120
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,200
and I saw you in the game, and I was like, holy shit, it's him, so I'll see if I can be friends,

121
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,200
and I jumped onto a video you were making, and then after that...

122
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,200
For anyone, I don't expect anyone to track this down, but me and this dude, DJ Calcos, had done...

123
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,200
It was like, did you and Calcos do Equestria? We were playing the betas of this, or alpha rather, of this Pony MMO that they were making,

124
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,200
and the second video we did, we just happened to run into give and take, but you didn't have a mic, so we were just kind of like,

125
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
just showing you in the video.

126
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I think I did have a mic.

127
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Did you? I don't remember you saying anything in the video.

128
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I didn't say much, that was the thing, I was like really nervous, like holy shit, he's an internet celebrity,

129
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,200
and I'm being with him, it's cool, and I'm scared.

130
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,200
But I do remember that, that was probably the first thing we had that was like a collaboration in any way.

131
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Yeah, and then what happened after that? I think, Jesse, I think I talked to you about making the Faggot compilation,

132
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,200
because I found out about Jesse through you, and I looked at all these videos, I thought this guy's great,

133
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll do a compilation to get his attention, and I told you about it, and I told you not to tell him, because I knew you were friends with him,

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,200
and then I made it, and he saw it, and it was cool, and I think I added him on Skype somehow.

135
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
That's still up, right on, give and take?

136
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah.

137
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Yeah, go to give and take and look up the Faggot Faggot compilation, every time Jesse says Faggot in any of his videos.

138
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:24,200
That was great, and you even, how did you get his older stuff, because you had the Tucker Todd Ferguson character,

139
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,200
you had the stuff from videos that are no longer on his channel.

140
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I think, I went to his Blip channel, actually, and I found, like his old Final Fantasy 7 Let's Play,

141
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,200
and I battled Toads and Double Dragon Let's Play, and I looked through all those, and the old school podcast with,

142
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
No, what was it?

143
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,200
There's a Johnny Old School, and his friends, those games, that podcast.

144
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Aiden, and Cinemascist.

145
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, I listened to those, and I basically just, I actually went on his Facebook account,

146
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I typed in his name, I found him on Facebook, and I got an image that I used for the thumbnail.

147
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,200
So I really, I basically stalked everything I could find of Jesse, just so I could make that video.

148
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Yeah.

149
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
It was cool.

150
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
And it was good.

151
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,200
So yeah, I guess that's probably when we all started talking, because at some point we all did a horse cast together,

152
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,200
where we brought you, or first it was that you and him did one because I was gone,

153
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,200
and he wanted to do a podcast, and then the three of us did one together before we brought in T-Bap,

154
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
and became the horseshoe crew.

155
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
So, yeah.

156
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,200
And then, I think that first podcast with me and Jesse was really awkward.

157
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
It was pretty bad.

158
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I remember listening to it, because I was at my girlfriend's house at the time, and that's why I couldn't be on.

159
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,200
And it came out, and I listened to it at some point, and I was just like, what the fuck are they talking about?

160
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:03,200
It was like 40 minutes and lots of pauses, and like a long period of time between dialogue.

161
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,200
See, I didn't expect that, because I didn't think of Jesse as like a quiet person like me,

162
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,200
but if you think about how we act in the procrastinators' podcasts, we are the guys who say nothing for a long time,

163
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
and then chip in with a little thing.

164
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I've always said that.

165
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Only us in a podcast is a fucking nightmare.

166
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah, I mean if you listen to it, if you listen to any of the old horse casts,

167
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I was always talking way more than Jesse.

168
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I would just go on and on and on, and then he would come up with a big point,

169
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,200
and it's like the stuff he says is more memorable, but if you actually listen to it, it's like mostly me.

170
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And I really don't think it was until the blue glow that I ever felt like Jesse could just go on by himself, you know?

171
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
And like the early blue glows have way more editing, where like he has to cut a lot more,

172
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
and now he's gotten better at just like stream of consciousness talking,

173
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:02,200
so I definitely think it's a skill he's developed, but at the time, not so much.

174
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Stream of consciousness talking is fun.

175
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Yeah.

176
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
It's hard to get going.

177
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I can occasionally do it on my own gaming channel that I have, but I haven't been using it recently.

178
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Yeah, GivenGaming.org.

179
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I very much enjoyed your Dark Souls 2 videos on Given Gaming.

180
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:28,200
It's just the most spiteful, angry, even more so than mine, because mine are more bitchy.

181
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Yours are just like, I hate the world.

182
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
It feels so raw and real.

183
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Yeah, what was I doing?

184
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I was killing what I didn't realize was like the second to last boss of the game,

185
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,200
and I was just running back down through that dark cavern and going insane because they were annoying.

186
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
That's a good video, even though it's kind of shitty looking.

187
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,200
The one I remember more is the Aldi is Keep one where you're just like,

188
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,200
you hadn't realized yet that you were playing with the covenant that makes the game three times harder,

189
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,200
and you're just so mad, and I was watching you like, this looks like,

190
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,200
just getting my blood boiling, this game is so fucking bad.

191
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,200
It was a direct result of those videos of yours that I ended up trying to do my own Dark Souls 2 videos,

192
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,200
because it reignited my hatred for that game, and I was like,

193
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,200
somebody's got to do it, someone's got to kill it, but then my videos were stupid.

194
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Just so people know, I did beat the game on that difficulty setting, because I was like, fuck it,

195
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
I've gone this far, I don't care anymore, and I killed them.

196
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,200
At level 180, I want to say, that you beat the game at.

197
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,200
And you're generally great at Dark Souls, like Dark Souls 1, right?

198
00:17:50,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Yeah, I am infamous among a few people that I killed Onstein and Smo, and Manus,

199
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,200
no, not Manus, Artorias on my first try through the game,

200
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,200
and my brother can vouch for that because he was watching me, and he was like, holy shit, you did it.

201
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Because you leveled your endurance to a comically high degree, right?

202
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You did insane grinding or something like that?

203
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I don't know whether I leveled my endurance so much, I think I was just using fat rolls and wearing really strong armor,

204
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,200
and had a lot of health, but yeah, there was a point in fighting Artorias for the first time,

205
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,200
he hit me with one of his charging attacks, and I was drinking Maestus, and I didn't get knocked down,

206
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
and I thought that was worth mentioning to you guys.

207
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
And you were like, what?

208
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I blew my mind into a thousand tiny pieces, and now you do challenge runs all the time, right?

209
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Oh yeah, I did a challenge run of endurance by leveling just endurance,

210
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,200
which is actually not that difficult because it makes sure that you can roll all the time,

211
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:09,200
and you have really good shield usage, so you could, at the end of the game with 99 endurance,

212
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I could wear the entire Giants set plus 5, and I could do fast rolls, and it was really cool.

213
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
That is fucking intense.

214
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Yeah, and after that I started doing a Faith one, which I leveled only Faith to 99,

215
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,200
which actually was also not so bad after I got to level 70 in Faith,

216
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,200
because then I got this thing, the Wrath of the Gods, which is like an area of effect,

217
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:47,200
blasts that damages things, and so I could run into that little place in the painted world of Ariamis with all the slime guys,

218
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,200
and I could blow them up, and kill them all at once, and then run back, and just grind like that.

219
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
That sounds beautiful.

220
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
It was.

221
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:05,200
It sounds like a, like a, like a, I don't know, what's a phrase that means really good thing?

222
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
A true complete mental play.

223
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
So, um.

224
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
It's Sublime.

225
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,200
So Hippo, you are a man of many interesting talents.

226
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I am.

227
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Besides being a funny man, a punmeister for sure,

228
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,200
someone whose Twitter is nothing but weird puns and fucking bizarre jokes,

229
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,200
and general comedic guy, YouTuber, but you're also a musician, yeah?

230
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah.

231
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I've never been in a sort of a professional band sort of thing,

232
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,200
but I play guitar, and I can play bass and drums, and stuff.

233
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
I very rarely play keyboards, but I can.

234
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
But guitar is my main thing, and I'm pretty good at it.

235
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Haven't you played at a few live shows, like with your dad?

236
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh yeah, I played with, my dad's a drummer, my dad's cool.

237
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,200
He's a drummer, and he drums in a band, two bands.

238
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
There's a band that he formed with dads from my old school,

239
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:22,200
and they called it Dad's Own, and then there's a band that he had with this jazz band he was in.

240
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I don't know whether he's in that anymore, but yeah.

241
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,200
And he had like two pretty good bands that I've been listening to recently, actually,

242
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,200
because he's got all these old cassettes of his, like, studio recordings and stuff,

243
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,200
and I've been going through them, and recording them onto, you know, big...

244
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,200
I've got this, like, cassette to a USB thing, so I can download them and make them digital for them.

245
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
And yeah.

246
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Cool.

247
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
So yeah, I've played in a few live bands.

248
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm actually going to be playing in a live rock concert at Aguna Re, which is a whole other thing.

249
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Aguna Re is this camp for disabled kids, where I volunteer and help and stuff.

250
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,200
And this year, we've organized a rock concert, and I'm going to be playing a bunch of rock songs for them.

251
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
And that's cool.

252
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Nice.

253
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
So yeah.

254
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,200
You can play a lot of classic dad rock.

255
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Yeah, I like all that sort of stuff.

256
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Whenever we talk music in the PCP, Hippo has very specific tastes.

257
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,200
You like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd.

258
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
What are some others?

259
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Queen, David Bowie.

260
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I mean, there's loads.

261
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Whenever I think of, like, a list of bands, I forget all of them.

262
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
ACDC is a pretty good one.

263
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
But anything that's cool.

264
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Yeah, cool.

265
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,200
And from the 70s or early 80s or 60s, I guess.

266
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I like rock from any time period.

267
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I mean, Muse is one of my favorite bands, and they're still going strong.

268
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,200
They're one of the biggest bands in the world at the moment.

269
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:17,200
But I'm not very much into weird indie shit like you are, I guess.

270
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,200
You seem to like guitar-driven rock, stuff where the guitars are prominent.

271
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,200
And generally, it usually is massively popular just by happenstance.

272
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Right.

273
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,200
In the procrastinator's discord room, we have our PCP channel,

274
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
and then we have the musical corner.

275
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
And every so often, Hippo will just pop into the musical corner

276
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,200
and start playing a bunch of, like, Beatles and Led Zeppelin songs on his acoustic guitar.

277
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
And we'll just come in and listen to him.

278
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,200
And it's like, it's the most relaxing possible experience in the world.

279
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm glad you like it.

280
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,200
I didn't expect that to be cool, but I guess it is.

281
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Yeah.

282
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I made that corner, I don't know why, really.

283
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I guess I was just, like, imagining me playing for you guys or something over the internet.

284
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,200
But I assumed the internet would make it all annoying to listen to, like with lag and stuff.

285
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I mean, it sounds like shit, but it's still fun to listen to.

286
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,200
It's kind of like, I mean, I mean, I listen to a lot of shitty sounding music, you know?

287
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Like, I listen to a lot of black metal, which is deliberately recorded badly for the atmosphere.

288
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,200
So to me, it kind of has this atmosphere of, like, it sounds like if you were outside,

289
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,200
next to a babbling brook, and someone about 30 feet away was playing acoustic guitar,

290
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,200
and you're just hearing the acoustic guitar mixed in with all the other atmospheric noise,

291
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,200
then that's kind of what it sounds like.

292
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
But with, like, weird digital pop in and pop out.

293
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
So it's like all of that, but it's inside the internet.

294
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
It's like a cyberpunk future thing.

295
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
It's an electronic babbling brook.

296
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Yeah.

297
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Yeah, that's nice.

298
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,200
There's going to be a VR future where we can actually make that exact scenario I described happen.

299
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:26,200
So what would you say is your outright favorite band, Beatles or Led Zeppelin, or something else?

300
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,200
It's usually Led Zeppelin, but I don't really like having a favorites.

301
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
I like having a ton of favorites.

302
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I don't like choosing one out of all of them, because it depends on what I feel like listening to,

303
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,200
and how long it's been since I've listened to my quote-unquote favorite.

304
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Do you have a favorite song to play?

305
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,200
I have quite a lot of songs I've learned to play, and I can't remember my favorite one.

306
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I guess at the moment it's back in black by AC DC, because that riff is really cool.

307
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
That's the one that's like...

308
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,200
You saw them recently with Axl Rose as the lead singer?

309
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Yeah, the guy, what's his name?

310
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I've only gotten into AC DC recently.

311
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I knew they were cool, but I only started listening to them recently, so I don't know the guy's name.

312
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,200
It was sick, and Axl Rose was singing for him, and I went to see him live at the London Olympic Stadium.

313
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Well, the beginning of the month.

314
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:44,200
It was really good. They had cannons and a giant fat inflatable lady, and a giant cool bell that was tolling.

315
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
It was the hell's bells it was. It was great.

316
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,200
What were the cannons shooting?

317
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Blanks, hopefully.

318
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I saw a Coldplay show once, and they had cannons that shot confetti out over the audience.

319
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,200
That's a fake cannon. These were real cannons, because they were actually super loud.

320
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Oh, full-sized cannons.

321
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
There were like nine of them, and that was the finale.

322
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
For those about to rock, we salute you. Boom!

323
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
It's like, whoa! It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

324
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
That's fucking intense. That's awesome.

325
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
So, yeah, your dad performed in these bands. You are a musician.

326
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Both of your brothers are musicians, too, right, on some level?

327
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Yeah, well, my brother, Henry, is kind of a budding bassist, but he hasn't really been getting into it as much as my other brother, Charlie,

328
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:56,200
who got really into ragtime music, you know, all that sort of stuff you see in, like, YouTube videos where they're trying to be old-timey, and they stock ragtime music.

329
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
He actually knows how to play all that on the piano, which is really cool.

330
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:10,200
And then he got into a lot of Motown and stuff, Stevie Wonder and David Bowie, and he knows a lot of cool shit, and he's good.

331
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,200
He's really good at it. He's good at piano, he's good at bass.

332
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
He's going to be playing with me in that rock concert.

333
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,200
To ask you more, like, who are your brothers? How old are they, and what do they do?

334
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Because they're fairly interesting as well.

335
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:39,200
They are. Well, fairly. Henry's two years old, younger than me, so he'd be 20, I think, and Charlie is my youngest brother.

336
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,200
He's the piano guy, and he is 19, I guess. I can't remember.

337
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I mean, I don't pay too much attention to their literal age, I just know when their birthday is.

338
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:59,200
But yeah, Henry's actually kind of a neat at the moment, but he's cool.

339
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I mean, he's not depressed or anything. He's got his new room and stuff.

340
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
He's just not doing shit.

341
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Yeah, he's not doing much, but it's okay. I believe in him.

342
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,200
One of them has a YouTube channel, right?

343
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:24,200
That's Henry. He's got a little YouTube channel. He puts some confessional sort of things, not too in-depth,

344
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:32,200
but it's interesting to listen to from my perspective, because it's the sort of thing he doesn't say to me directly all that much.

345
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,200
And some other weird stuff.

346
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,200
And he's worked on some of your weird-ass give-and-take videos, like holding the camera.

347
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Yeah, he's usually the cameraman when I need one. He's up for all that sort of stuff.

348
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
He likes my channel. He likes all the procrastinators.

349
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I've actually gotten him into the PCP procrastinated podcast has allowed him to get into everybody who, you know,

350
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,200
into Jesse, into you, into Davoo, into all the other guys. He likes them all.

351
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,200
And through Nate, he's actually started watching anime, starting with Gurren Lagann.

352
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,200
And he's the one who dressed up as Bloodborne, right?

353
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Yeah, he likes buying really cool outfits that he never wears, because he never goes anywhere.

354
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,200
The fucking Bloodborne thing came out of no ways.

355
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,200
You just came into my room dressed like that, and you said, oh, and I was like, oh, shit, I'll get a bit of fullness.

356
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Whenever I see you guys' videos, I feel like you communicate largely through laughs.

357
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:48,200
We do. You know, it's weird, because it's hard to explain an example.

358
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,200
But say, for example, there's dinner is coming, dinner time. Mom calls up the stairs and only I hear it.

359
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
So I go to the door, I open it, and I go, yeah, and then they know exactly what to do.

360
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
They just come out. It's not like, yeah, is the word.

361
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,200
It's just the fact that I came to the door and didn't say anything of worth means that it's dinner time.

362
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I know exactly what you're talking about, because I'll go into Victor or Shadesbury would just be like,

363
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,200
just peek open the door, and I was like, yeah.

364
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,200
And they'll be like, yeah, and I'm like, yeah.

365
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
And they're like, what do you want?

366
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Oh, there's food. That often happens. I know.

367
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
That's cool.

368
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Oh, man. Little brothers. It's fun that we're both, me, you, and DeVoo are all the eldest of three siblings.

369
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Oh, yeah. I think Ben is too.

370
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:56,200
I meant to ask Nate this when I finally get to his interview, because I'm pretty sure they have a sister that Ben just never brought up in his interview.

371
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Yeah, I don't know why they don't talk about it at all.

372
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Yeah, we never mention her. I don't know the first thing about her.

373
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Apparently she's a tattoo artist.

374
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Oh, yeah, I do know that because Nate said it on Twitter the other day.

375
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,200
But enough about them. This is your fucking interview.

376
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,200
So do you have any plans with your musical career?

377
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:28,200
You have a band camp, which probably not a lot of people know about, but it has some great songs like Chicken and a Basketball.

378
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
That's a fan favorite.

379
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Yeah, Ben loves that fucking song and he always brings it up.

380
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,200
You recently did a rap song about being sick, and that was fucking...

381
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,200
I did a whole album about being sick. I was sick.

382
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:55,200
And for seven days or so, I think I recorded a song in whatever state I was, and I got worse over the course of the album, and then I got better by the end, and it was really cool.

383
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
And it just so happened to end on the day Homestuck ended.

384
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Which has nothing to do with it, but it's cool.

385
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,200
It was completely disgusting, but great in that way.

386
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,200
It was the kind of thing where I was listening to it and I was like, oh no, yeah.

387
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,200
What is the band camp's URL anyways?

388
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I think it's just a hypocrite, like one word, band camp slash hypocrite, I don't know.

389
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,200
You can find it, not too hard. I think I've got it linked on one of my channels.

390
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,200
But yeah, go check that out. There's not too many songs and some of them are pretty good.

391
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I think from the sick album, I'm a piece of shit, it was pretty good. A lot of people like that.

392
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:58,200
So then, aside from music and YouTube, you also are an animator.

393
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,200
That's what you actually just finished college for, right? You got your degree?

394
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Yeah, I got my degree in animation. I'm an animator. I make things removed.

395
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Is that an associate bachelor's degree, right?

396
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Bachelor's, yeah.

397
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:22,200
And you made this great student film, Spiders or People 2, which is currently up on Gibb and Take, I think.

398
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Everyone watched that. It's fucking great. I watched it again and I liked it just as much as the first time.

399
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Yeah, I like all the student films I've made. I'm pretty proud of them.

400
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I'm not sure about animation in general, though. I'm good at it, but I'm not a fucking fine artist when it comes to animation.

401
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I can make them and they're fun, but they take a long time.

402
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm going to be doing more animation, I think. I've got a potential documentary thing I'm doing.

403
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,200
My parents are probably going to be looking for work for me, which is nice of them, but I don't know.

404
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I think in the case of your animation, personally, I'm less impressed with the animation as I am with the directing of the animation, where your comedic timing is always perfect.

405
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Yeah, everybody has always said that. My comedic timing in editing is my strongest point, and it's true. I know when to start a joke.

406
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:41,200
And also just knowing the storyboarding element. I don't know if you actually storyboard them, but they're very coherent and easy to follow in a way that I think is incredible.

407
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:52,200
It's amazing to me that you did everything on Spiders of People, too, because a lot of skillsets went into that. Even the sound effects are great.

408
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Yeah, I guess I'm good at sound design as well. I don't know how. I picked it up and I'm good at noticing when a shot is good and using it in my own stuff, but I don't really go over the storyboards too many times to get them perfect.

409
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Let's do it from over the shoulder, or behind the thing, or from a weird wide angle, I don't know. And it usually works out really well, so I guess I just have a knack for that as well. It's good. I'm good at it.

410
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I agree.

411
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:54,200
So I would say that this also applies to the live-action segments of your videos. I always find them to be highly inventive and entertaining, and you do lots of little stop-motion stuff.

412
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:03,200
I think when I look at your videos versus, like, let's say John Tron, whom I know you're in my camp of thinking he's totally gone to shit.

413
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
John Tron?

414
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Yeah, right?

415
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Oh, sorry, you cut out while you said John Tron. I thought you didn't say his name.

416
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,200
I was saying that you're in my camp of thinking John Tron's gone to shit, right?

417
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
But he was a huge influence on you.

419
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:32,200
He was a very huge influence. I mean, the idea that he had started in 2010, and at the time, like, everybody who was big had started, like, as soon as YouTube had started.

420
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:40,200
And he started in 2010, and he got that big. I was like, whoa, you can still just start whenever you need to, and if you're good, you'll make it.

421
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:48,200
So, yeah. And he was, like, the best I had seen, aside from AVGN, and I really wanted to...

422
00:37:48,200 --> 00:38:02,200
It rekindled my desire to be one of those guys, because I always thought I wanted to, but I sort of fell out of the idea once I realized how difficult it would be to begin at this stage.

423
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Yeah.

424
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,200
But, I mean, I'm still beginning, kind of, but I'm doing okay. I'll get there.

425
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:20,200
So, the reason I brought John Tron up is that, like, he's got these videos now where you can take one look at it at any shot, and you'd be like, oh, this is shot on a nice camera.

426
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,200
The sets look expensive. You know, it's, like, quote-unquote, high effort.

427
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,200
But I think the writing and delivery of the jokes is always just kind of, like, whatever.

428
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:38,200
And when I think of, like, a great use of effort, I think of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone opening, where there's a part where, like,

429
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,200
like a hooded cape, like, stop motion animates onto your body.

430
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
It looks amazing.

431
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,200
That wasn't stop motion. That was just me filming it in reverse. Well, I filmed it falling off me, and then I did it in reverse.

432
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Oh, okay.

433
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
It looked like it was just flying up into me.

434
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Yeah.

435
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:06,200
It looks hilarious, though. And, like, you've done a lot of tricks like that where you really just do something inventive with the camera.

436
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Lots of green screen, especially all the weird shit on Give and Take.

437
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Like, most of those videos is, like, you had one idea of a cool thing to do with a camera and base the whole video around that, and it's...

438
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I'm always like, man, that's fucking ingenious. Why didn't I think of doing something like that, you know?

439
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Yeah. Really, Give and Take is my experimental grounds, and if something really works, then I'll try and use it in a Hippocrite video.

440
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Yeah.

441
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah, I like doing weird shit with the camera.

442
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,200
It's funny, because all that sort of skit stuff, I never really plan it.

443
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:51,200
I sort of just say, alright, I know what the voiceover is going to be in the script, and I have ideas for, like, what the slapstick will be in the skit.

444
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,200
But I don't know how I'm going to film it until I'm there, and I tell my brother, alright, stand here, and sort of zoom in as I say this, and then he does.

445
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,200
And then we look at it, and it's like, yeah, that's good, alright, let's make the next thing.

446
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,200
And then I go into the editing thing, and everything looks pretty good.

447
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,200
And even when it doesn't, I can sort of make it look good with, you know, fast cuts and stuff.

448
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Right.

449
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
It's fun.

450
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:24,200
The whole Sly Cooper live-action skit where you break into, like, the, what was it, a museum, that felt so real.

451
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Because it was just your brother who was dressed up as a guard, right?

452
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,200
But he had, like, a legit, is that one of the random outfits he buys?

453
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Like, did he just have that?

454
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I think he just had some cool black gloves, and that made him look official, and some, like, combat, like, black combat trousers.

455
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:53,200
And he had this weird hook that came off of wardrobe, and he stuck it in his pocket, and on the hook, we put these iron, wrought iron keys that I bought, like, at a souvenir at a castle once.

456
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,200
And it just looked, it was just perfect.

457
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I had this walking stick as a hook, as a cane, and I got him.

458
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Apparently, people went up to him thinking that he was a real bodyguard, and just saying, no, it's just, it's nothing, I'm no one.

459
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
That's fantastic.

460
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Like, I really appreciate that kind of stuff, because, you know, I made all those old Project Awesomeness videos, as you've seen, where we really would just, like, take whatever was lying around.

461
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Whatever was lying around the house, and, like, that's our props.

462
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:35,200
And if you can use those, and make it still look good, and communicate the point, then to me it's even funnier than, like, having the real thing, you know?

463
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Yeah.

464
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,200
It's that sort of, like, homemade quality that, you know, Jon Tron's lacking at the moment.

465
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,200
He's got all this cool stuff, and it's like, okay, you know, it would have been funnier if...

466
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
You cut out.

467
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
I can't hear you anymore.

468
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Oh no, you're cutting out.

469
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Cut out what happened.

470
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
My computer's weird.

471
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,200
So you have this strong fixation on the PlayStation 2, it seems.

472
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
What's up with that?

473
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Yeah, it's my, it's my favorite console of all time.

474
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
All the best games are on it.

475
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
And it, it's the best, it's the best one.

476
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
All, all, all of them suck except that one.

477
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Was that your first console, or did you have one before it?

478
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,200
No, I had a PS, PlayStation 1, but I didn't have many, very many games for it.

479
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,200
The PlayStation 2 was when it all sort of got knocked into 12th gear.

480
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,200
And I got all my favorite games were on that.

481
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:42,200
And then the real reason I think I like the PlayStation 2 so much, or rather that I base my channel off of it,

482
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:48,200
is because not many people make PS2-based videos, and if they do, they're not very good.

483
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Like there's not a Jon Tron off the PS2 area.

484
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
So I am that guy.

485
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Yeah.

486
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Which is odd to think about, but it's, it's true.

487
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Like there's a lot of, like when I got into those, those people like Jon Tron and AVGN,

488
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,200
like I had never played those old games.

489
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,200
So to me it was like, they're talking about a forgotten era.

490
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Like it didn't even occur to me that those were games they actually grew up with.

491
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,200
It's like, I thought they were going back to like before they're even their own time.

492
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,200
Because for me, like PS2 would be, like your videos are like,

493
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
gonna take me back to the past.

494
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Like that's how I feel.

495
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Watching Ratchet and Clank.

496
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm like, oh Ratchet and Clank, that's, I remember, I was a lad, you know.

497
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Um.

498
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Yeah.

499
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
So.

500
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
I like, I like all that nostalgic stuff.

501
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah.

502
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
And also the PS3 sucks.

503
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
That's another thing.

504
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I wanted you to get into that because what is it about everything after the PS2

505
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,200
that you hate besides the Souls games?

506
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Well, what, oh yeah, the Souls games are great.

507
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,200
But I think it was mostly, it was a lot of things.

508
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,200
One of the things was that all my favorite franchises had either been dropped

509
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,200
or replaced with something that sucked, like Uncharted.

510
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Jack was better than Uncharted.

511
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,200
But there's other things like the new Ratchet and Clank game on PS3 wasn't that good

512
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,200
and it ended on a cliffhanger that annoyed me.

513
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,200
And in general, AAA gaming at that time felt more like,

514
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
let's see how realistic we can make everything,

515
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,200
rather than let's have a fun, cool world where you can do things.

516
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Right.

517
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Like, I don't know.

518
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,200
It just felt like all my favorite things about the PS2, the colors, the stuff,

519
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,200
the cool characters, the wacky worlds, that was seen as childish.

520
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,200
And now we've got to be making lens flares and shadows that look really pixely

521
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,200
when you look at them, but they're sort of moving, so it's cool.

522
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,200
It's all about the lighting effects and the rendering, and I didn't care for it.

523
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,200
And I just sort of grew out of playing games for a long time.

524
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Yeah.

525
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Yeah.

526
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:13,200
And since then, you've sort of, like, what games have you liked since the PS2 era?

527
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,200
I've liked plenty of games since the PS2 era.

528
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,200
I think after I got annoyed with the PS3, I sort of went to the DS,

529
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,200
and I played DS games and stuff.

530
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:30,200
But in console games, it was really just been Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Demon Souls.

531
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
I really have had, like, a lot.

532
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,200
They're cool things.

533
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,200
And it's been a long time had it in my head that, to me, the DS was, by far,

534
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,200
the best console for games over the last generation.

535
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Because it really did follow up with the PS2.

536
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,200
The PS2 had an unbelievably huge library of tons of totally unique games,

537
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
and the DS had the same.

538
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,200
It had this unbelievably large library of great games.

539
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,200
It's like the best-selling console of all time, but no one talks about it.

540
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
It's got Phoenix Wright.

541
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
It's got Professor Layden.

542
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Yeah.

543
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Goddamn.

544
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Goddamn things on it.

545
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,200
I think it's a combination of no one knowing how to capture from the DS.

546
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,200
I think that's really hamstrung it from being talked about in games media.

547
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,200
It's so hard to take footage from it and talk about it.

548
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,200
I feel like whenever someone talks about Phoenix Wright,

549
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,200
I know tons of Phoenix Wright fans, but I've seen no Phoenix Wright analysis videos,

550
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,200
with the exception of the one you did on Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright.

551
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
How the fuck did you capture footage for that?

552
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Did you steal it all?

553
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,200
Well, I stole it all.

554
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,200
I either filmed my DS with a camera, or I stole it,

555
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,200
because that's the easiest way to do things.

556
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,200
I don't want to ruin my DS just so I can capture footage.

557
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:57,200
And even if you get a DS emulator, you still have to fill half the screen with the text box,

558
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,200
and it's weird to put on a YouTube video.

559
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Yeah.

560
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,200
It really works.

561
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,200
It's terrible for filming.

562
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,200
But I do think it had a fuckload of great games,

563
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,200
but they're on the DS, and it pisses me off that they're not all on the Wii U.

564
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,200
If I were the president of Nintendo, I would have said,

565
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,200
hey, we just made a console with two screens, and one's a touchscreen.

566
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Let's make the entire library of the DS available on it,

567
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,200
and it would be worth owning a Wii U just for that,

568
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,200
just to have all the DS games available,

569
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,200
because that's the biggest fucking library of great games of the last 10 years.

570
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,200
I would buy that, even if it was like $200.

571
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Yeah.

572
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,200
What's more than $200?

573
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,200
It's probably $300, but it's worth it.

574
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,200
I bought a PS4, and there were no games for it,

575
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,200
and yet I managed to buy a bunch of games.

576
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,200
I bought a PS4.

577
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
I bought a Bloodborne machine, too.

578
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,200
Yeah.

579
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,200
I think I talked you into it, right?

580
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,200
Like, I goaded you and Jesse into it.

581
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,200
I think I just wanted to play Bloodborne in general, but yeah.

582
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
Have you used it for anything other than Bloodborne?

583
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Oh, wait, no.

584
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,200
The one reason that I actually went over and bought things other than Bloodborne

585
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,200
is that I learned that Dark Cloud was coming onto it as an HD,

586
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
and I bought the HD Dark Cloud, and it's great.

587
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,200
I love it.

588
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,200
The only thing that's wrong with that port or version of Dark Cloud

589
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,200
is that the main theme that plays, for some reason,

590
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,200
I don't know how they fucked it up, but there's like one drum in the beat.

591
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,200
I guess it's like a MIDI track or something,

592
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,200
but there's one drum that's just out of time with the rest of the thing,

593
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
and it keeps getting faster and slower, and it's like,

594
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,200
no, guy, you're ruining it.

595
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,200
You're ruining the song.

596
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,200
It's supposed to be the cool bit, because it plays at the title screen,

597
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,200
and then later, like in the last bus, where you're in the Sun Giant,

598
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,200
and you're fighting the Dark Genie in space,

599
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,200
and it plays, and it's just fucking awful, and I cried.

600
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Oh, that's a sad story.

601
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,200
But yeah, aside from that, you should buy a PS4 for Dark Cloud.

602
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,200
I haven't on my PS4.

603
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,200
I have not played more than 45 minutes for that one Let's Play when I was sick.

604
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
That's it.

605
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Oh, yeah.

606
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,200
And I'm determined to beat it before I buy Dark Cloud 2, because it's also on there.

607
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Yeah, I don't know whether you should play the whole of Dark Cloud before Dark Cloud 2.

608
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,200
I mean, I love it, but I know that the sequel is more streamlined and a better game in general,

609
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,200
and it has very little, if anything, to do with the first in terms of story.

610
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,200
And a lot of people played the sequel first.

611
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,200
So, you know, I don't blame people for liking that one over the original,

612
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,200
but I still like the original a lot.

613
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,200
Well, I want to play the original anyways, just because it's a classic action RPG,

614
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,200
and that's kind of my thing, is that whole genre.

615
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,200
And it's interesting, if nothing else.

616
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,200
I didn't even, like, I mean, I'd played it as a kid, but never gotten very far in it,

617
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,200
and then, like, your video, when you're like,

618
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,200
oh, there's like five different characters you get to play as.

619
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,200
I'm like, what the fuck?

620
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,200
I didn't even know there were other characters you got at all.

621
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,200
That was a great video, incidentally.

622
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,200
I've said this before, I said this before to you,

623
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,200
but your videos have the highest rate of making me want to play the games immediately.

624
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Like, I actually went out, like, I spent a while trying to track down Dark Cloud for the PS2,

625
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,200
like, because I had seen it one time at a local game store,

626
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,200
and then, like, as soon as your video came out, I went back and tried to find it,

627
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,200
and they didn't have it, and then I would just, like, hunt for it at game stores,

628
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,200
because I didn't want to buy it online, because, ugh.

629
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:56,200
And then, once it hit the PS4, I was like, oh, yeah, immediately buy that.

630
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:02,200
And I also bought Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright because of your video, like, immediately,

631
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,200
and then never played it for more than 30 minutes.

632
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,200
I'm good at making people spend their money, but not by having fun.

633
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,200
I mean, and I also really wanted to play Jak and Daxter after your video,

634
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,200
but I remember that the exact reason I didn't, and this is probably true of all of them,

635
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,200
but it was because it's always been hard for me to justify playing a game

636
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,200
if I'm not going to make a video about it, and you had already just made a video about it.

637
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,200
So, like, that's always the catch-22 with video game videos,

638
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,200
is it's like, oh, cool, that analysis really made me want to play that game,

639
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,200
but now I can't make an analysis of the game because it already exists,

640
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,200
so I can't play the game.

641
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,200
I totally know how you feel about not feeling right playing a game

642
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
when I'm not going to make a video about it,

643
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,200
because that's the whole reason I started the Let's Plays,

644
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,200
aside from the fact that I thought Let's Plays might be fun

645
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,200
and I could maybe get better at talking through them.

646
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,200
I just wanted to play these old games, like I played Rayman 2, which was great,

647
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,200
and I actually beat it for the first time in the Let's Play,

648
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,200
but I would have never played it again,

649
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,200
even though I owned it through digital download or whatever.

650
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,200
I would have never played it if I didn't have a video planned for it,

651
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,200
so that was why I did all those Let's Plays, and then I got bored.

652
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,200
And now I'm doing, like, GRPJ, which is my excuse to play games,

653
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,200
really long games, and not have to record any of the things in them,

654
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,200
so it's more fun.

655
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Good reason to play GRPJ.

656
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,200
It is a very good reason to play GRPJ.

657
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,200
That's, like, for me, when me and Victor started Digi Bros.

658
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,200
The biggest problem I've had with it the whole time

659
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,200
is that Victor will only do it if he gets to play the games,

660
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,200
so I would love to be able to finally play all these video games

661
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,200
and make Let's Plays out of them and make that my excuse,

662
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,200
but I can't do it because Victor won't watch me play video games.

663
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,200
So it never happens.

664
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,200
But I have tried to do that myself.

665
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Like, I really wanted to just play a game,

666
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
and I'm like, okay, we're just going to turn on a recording.

667
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,200
And, like, Dark Souls 3, I was convinced I would write something about it,

668
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
and I never did.

669
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,200
But I'm finally getting over it, and maybe you can too.

670
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,200
Like, with Doom, that was the moment.

671
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,200
I finally just played a game because I liked it,

672
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
with no intentions of writing about it,

673
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,200
and it was a really good time.

674
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Yeah, I mean, I've been playing Twilight Princess today

675
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
because I got a TV, and that's cool.

676
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,200
And I have no intention of ever making a video about that

677
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,200
unless, you know, I really feel like it.

678
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,200
But, you know, Zelda games are so well documented,

679
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
it's kind of pointless.

680
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
What console are you playing it on?

681
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,200
On the Wii.

682
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,200
I got the games.

683
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Wii RectaPray!

684
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Yeah, I would, thank you.

685
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,200
I would let you into my house.

686
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,200
I, uh...

687
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,200
I hate the Wii.

688
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
You hate it?

689
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
How do you feel about the Wii?

690
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,200
I actually...

691
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
I mean, because the PlayStation 3 annoyed me,

692
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,200
and I never cared for the Xbox,

693
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,200
the Wii was my favorite of that generation,

694
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,200
purely by, you know, being the other one.

695
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,200
And I did kind of like Wii Fit,

696
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,200
because it actually made me a jog on the spot,

697
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,200
which I never did, and I have never done since,

698
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,200
because I stopped playing that game.

699
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Not that you need to lose weight or anything,

700
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
since you're like 90 pounds.

701
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
No, but I don't exercise at all.

702
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
Yeah, I'm very small.

703
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
I don't eat food.

704
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,200
But I don't go out of my way to go get something.

705
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
I just eat what's put in front of my plate.

706
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,200
Or on my plate, rather.

707
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
So, uh...

708
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,200
You've covered mostly on your channel

709
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,200
like your favorite games, right?

710
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
Yeah.

711
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
You sort of make a point to like highlight games

712
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,200
that you really loved from your childhood,

713
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,200
or that still hold up today.

714
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,200
Yeah, it's...

715
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,200
I kind of don't like the whole,

716
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,200
oh, fuck all these shitty games, am I right?

717
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Because, I mean, it's funny to be mad at something,

718
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,200
but it's more interesting when you're mad

719
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,200
at something that fucking tore your soul apart.

720
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,200
Like the Banjo-Kazooie nuts and bolts video.

721
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Like, I don't have something of that equivalent.

722
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Or maybe I do. I don't know.

723
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
I'll figure it out if I do.

724
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,200
I mean, if Dark Souls 2 wasn't so well covered,

725
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
I'd probably be a good candidate.

726
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Yeah, I would.

727
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,200
But I like just making videos about stuff

728
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,200
that I like with the intent

729
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
that I can tell people about it.

730
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,200
Because with all those other sort of games

731
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
that people talk about, like Zelda,

732
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
I know that those are massively popular

733
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,200
and everybody, oh, is it not recording?

734
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Am I not recording? What's going on?

735
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
I had to kick Nate out,

736
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
because he made your internet so bad

737
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
that I couldn't hear you anymore.

738
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
Okay, what was I saying?

739
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
Oh yeah, I wanted to make videos about good games,

740
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
because other games like Zelda,

741
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
they get massive coverage,

742
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
and I know loads of people love them.

743
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,200
I don't need to make a video about why Zelda is good.

744
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,200
But I do feel like I need to make a video about

745
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,200
why Wretched and Clank is good,

746
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,200
because I don't hear as many people talk about Wretched and Clank,

747
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,200
or, you know, some more obscure games

748
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,200
like the Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright,

749
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,200
which I heard nobody talk about ever.

750
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,200
And it's fucking brilliant.

751
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,200
I saw all these cool things I want to talk about Okami.

752
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
People haven't made a really good Okami video.

753
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
I'm sure there is one or two.

754
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,200
Well, you know, I've always thought that was fucking weird,

755
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,200
because I loved Wretched and Clank back in the day,

756
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
and even back then, I knew,

757
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,200
I've always known that the games sell really well.

758
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
Obviously, they keep making more of them.

759
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,200
They've always been considered like a mascot for Sony.

760
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,200
And they get really well critically reviewed.

761
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,200
The three were both like, especially three,

762
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,200
was like hugely well reviewed.

763
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
I would see them on...

764
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,200
Yeah, three is great.

765
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
I'd see them on TV.

766
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
You know, they had like mainstream advertising.

767
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
And like, if you go into like a character poll

768
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,200
or a best game ever poll,

769
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
then like, they usually do okay.

770
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,200
But yet, no one talks about them.

771
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
And I've never understood it.

772
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
Like, I've never known anybody in person

773
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,200
who knew Wretched and Clank

774
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,200
until like, you know, some of my friends that I met,

775
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,200
like, later on.

776
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,200
And like, they get no critical analysis.

777
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Nobody ever talks about them

778
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,200
when they're talking about their favorite games.

779
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
I'm like, what the fuck?

780
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Like, why does no one talk about these games that are great?

781
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,200
And then you finally came along.

782
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,200
I think, it just feels like

783
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,200
the market of video game reviews

784
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,200
is dominated by early Nintendo fags.

785
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
They just like all those early games.

786
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
They were there before,

787
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
and they were big and good and stuff.

788
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
It's like, everything is either...

789
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
No one cares about the new stuff.

790
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
I think the reason that that era gets glossed over

791
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,200
is that like, everyone wants to talk about new stuff

792
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,200
because it's relevant to everybody.

793
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,200
And then people like to talk about the first classics

794
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,200
because they said a lot of the rules of what stuff came after.

795
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
And also, I think they're just easier to talk about.

796
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,200
Like, it's pretty simple to blast through a 30-minute NES game

797
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,200
and deconstruct what makes it great.

798
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,200
Whereas like, I think the PS2 is right in that era

799
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
where it wasn't like new ideas.

800
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,200
It was just perfecting ideas, you know?

801
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,200
But I mean, I guess we have like Devil May Cry games

802
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,200
for some reason get like, really well covered by everybody.

803
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,200
So it's not like all PS2 games go by the wayside that way.

804
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Yeah, I think it's mostly the goofy platform of things

805
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,200
because I feel like a lot of people

806
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
see Ratchet and Clank and Jack and Dax or anything.

807
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,200
Banjo-Kazoo is better, you know?

808
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,200
They did the mascot animal thing first.

809
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Not at all true.

810
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Not at all.

811
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
I mean, I haven't played all of Banjo-Kazoo.

812
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Banjo-Kazoo has the clunkiest fucking controls

813
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,200
and the worst live system ever.

814
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
I don't think it's a bad game,

815
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,200
but that game does not hold up with the ease

816
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
that like Ratchet and Clank 2 holds up.

817
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Like, you could still play Ratchet and Clank 2 or 3 today

818
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,200
and you'd still have a good time.

819
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Banjo-Kazoo has a lot of antiquated things that like...

820
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
I can't help it, I'm sorry.

821
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
It's a nightmare.

822
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Hmm?

823
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
It...

824
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
What? Hippo?

825
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,200
Don't mean to make you cry.

826
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,200
You're popping in and out, fading.

827
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,200
And you sound like a ghost on the shelf.

828
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Carry on, carry on.

829
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,200
I just hear every...

830
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,200
every so many seconds I hear...

831
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,200
I forgot the next lyric.

832
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Am I a scrub or what?

833
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
Hey everyone, welcome to the...

834
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
Hippo, come back!

835
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
...podcast, podcast with me.

836
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,200
What?

837
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Oh, you came back.

838
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Oh, you're there.

839
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,200
That whole last minute or so you've been cut out

840
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
and I've been singing.

841
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Yeah, all I heard was just you going like...

842
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,200
Every once in a while I was like,

843
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,200
oh god, he's a ghost.

844
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,200
Yeah, what were you saying?

845
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
I don't even know.

846
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Well, I'll just let that be a clusterfuck

847
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,200
for the people to listen to.

848
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Yeah, I'll probably edit some of that out.

849
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
I know you won't because it's like an hour in

850
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,200
and you won't find it.

851
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,200
I edited the one I did with Jesse

852
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,200
to remove a bunch of fuckups like that, so...

853
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,200
So, are there any games that you definitely want to cover

854
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
on your show that you haven't yet?

855
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I have a list.

856
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,200
I can't find it at the moment,

857
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
but I know I want to do Okami.

858
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,200
I want to do the other Wretched and Clank games.

859
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
I want to do the other Jack and Dexter games.

860
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,200
I want to do...

861
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,200
What else do I want to do?

862
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
There's lots.

863
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Wait, I can look at my...

864
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
I can't look at my thing.

865
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
My shelf.

866
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
My shelf is blocked by a cupboard

867
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
and if I move it, it'll be loud.

868
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Here we go, though.

869
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,200
I'm just going to move my cupboard.

870
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,200
Here we go.

871
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
It wasn't that loud.

872
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
It wasn't that loud.

873
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
You know what?

874
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
I can't see them because they're behind other games,

875
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
but forget it.

876
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
I have a lot of...

877
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,200
I have a list.

878
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
I have a list of cool games to talk about.

879
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,200
It's not just the action platform of mascot things.

880
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,200
It's cool games from the PS2 era.

881
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,200
All the RPGs.

882
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
All of them.

883
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,200
Every single one.

884
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
I'm going to do all the GRPGs.

885
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,200
I'm going to play all the cool games.

886
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
So...

887
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Oh, Ape Escape.

888
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,200
That was a one.

889
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Ape Escape 2.

890
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
We were going to do a thing with Jesse, weren't we?

891
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Oh, yeah.

892
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,200
Because Jesse loves Ape Escape

893
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,200
and you love Ape Escape 2.

894
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
And then you found out...

895
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Well, I love all the Ape Escapes.

896
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,200
But one of the Ape Escapes had a girl protagonist

897
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
and you were like,

898
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Digi, you can do that one

899
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,200
and we can all cover Ape Escape.

900
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,200
That is a great idea.

901
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
I totally forgot about that.

902
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,200
I got it out, sir.

903
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
But yeah, are you still there?

904
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
I'm going to have to pull a plug.

905
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
He's a goner.

906
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
And I'm the guy with the plug.

907
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
See, this is the thing.

908
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,200
My internet's terrible.

909
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Okay, don't worry about it.

910
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
It's just terrible

911
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
and I can't speak and I can't talk

912
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
and he can't hear him.

913
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
And I'm sorry.

914
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,200
I didn't mean for this to happen.

915
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Technical difficulties.

916
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Hello?

917
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
Hello?

918
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,200
Is there anybody in there?

919
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
Just nod if you can hear me.

920
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Well, if you nod,

921
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,200
I can't see anything really.

922
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,200
So don't nod.

923
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Make a sound if you can hear me.

924
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
Hello?

925
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
Oh, I was back for a second.

926
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Hey!

927
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
Hey!

928
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Hello?

929
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
All I've been hearing is...

930
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

931
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,200
Every couple of minutes.

932
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Oh, this is a train.

933
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
But it's not wrecked yet.

934
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,200
We've got it still on the rails.

935
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,200
It's a crazy train.

936
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,200
It's going off the rails.

937
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,200
How much of what I was saying...

938
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,200
It's just gone again.

939
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,200
It's just...

940
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
Immediately it's gone.

941
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
See, this is what I have to deal with

942
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
the latest engines.

943
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,200
I just...

944
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
You're looking at me

945
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
for internet advice.

946
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
Don't.

947
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,200
It's bad.

948
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
I don't know how to fix it.

949
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,200
I don't know what I'm doing.

950
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
Goodness gracious.

951
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
Are you back?

952
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
I'm back.

953
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,200
Is someone doing something on your computer right now?

954
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,200
On one of them or something?

955
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Making it worse?

956
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
No, I just have terrible internet.

957
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,200
I could ask my brothers to turn their computers off.

958
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,200
I don't know if it'll help.

959
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,200
If they're not actually doing anything on them.

960
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
They might be.

961
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,200
I was describing the apescape thing

962
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
when you cut out...

963
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
And I think it's a good idea

964
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,200
that we should still do at some point.

965
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,200
Yes.

966
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,200
Oh god, I don't remember my follow-up question.

967
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,200
Oh.

968
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Oh.

969
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
G-RPG.

970
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
How'd it happen?

971
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,200
Yeah.

972
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,200
Well, I like RPGs.

973
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
And there are tons of RPGs I haven't played.

974
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
And I wanted to...

975
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,200
You know, it's like before with the Let's Plays.

976
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,200
It's an excuse to play a whole one of them

977
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,200
and make a video about it.

978
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,200
But I didn't want to record the whole RPG

979
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,200
because I know from Spoonie's videos

980
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
he's made reviews of Final Fantasy VII and stuff

981
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
and Final Fantasy VIII, I mean.

982
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,200
And they take up huge amounts of hard drive space recording

983
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
and then you have to look through it

984
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
and that idea is terrible.

985
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
I don't like that idea.

986
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,200
So I just thought I would steal footage from YouTube

987
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,200
and then talk about it on camera

988
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,200
in a sort of unscripted but kind of scripted way.

989
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
And that's why they exist.

990
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
Do they actually...

991
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Do they actually take way less effort than a normal video?

992
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,200
Because they end up being long as fuck

993
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,200
and you usually do put in relevant footage.

994
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,200
So...

995
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,200
They're pretty intensive,

996
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,200
but compared to making a full review of an entire RPG

997
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,200
there's not even close to the amount of effort I would have had to put in.

998
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,200
So it's preferable, definitely.

999
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
I like putting in relevant footage

1000
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,200
just so people get a...

1001
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,200
If there's like a cutscene I'm talking about

1002
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
you can see it.

1003
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,200
Because one thing I hate is when...

1004
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,200
It's when somebody's talking about something

1005
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,200
and the thing that's on screen is just the clip

1006
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,200
that's been playing for the last five minutes

1007
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,200
and it's actually got nothing to do with what they're saying

1008
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,200
and I can't visualize what they're talking about

1009
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,200
because they're not showing it.

1010
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,200
10 minutes ago and I'm like...

1011
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,200
Well, I can't go back.

1012
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
Can you just show it now?

1013
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
I just hate that sort of stuff.

1014
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
With your last GRPJ

1015
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,200
Victor was watching it and he was complaining

1016
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,200
because you had the laptop right in the middle of the screen

1017
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
and he was like,

1018
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,200
I can't ever tell what the fuck's happening in the cutscenes

1019
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
because giving slaps tops are the way it.

1020
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,200
I was like, well, I don't know if you're really supposed to pay attention to what's on screen.

1021
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,200
Why did he edit it to be all relevant footage?

1022
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,200
That is the one thing that I'm stupid about.

1023
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
I don't know, man.

1024
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,200
I thought of doing a weird green screen thing as the first thing

1025
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,200
and now that's going to be the thing.

1026
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,200
I'm going to have a weird green screen.

1027
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,200
Partially because I don't want to get copyrighted in just in case

1028
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
and also because it's hilarious.

1029
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,200
But I guess I could just let things...

1030
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,200
I can't help it though.

1031
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
I see the editing thing and I'm like,

1032
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,200
well, now I'm going to talk... I'm talking about this.

1033
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
I'll just show some footage of whatever.

1034
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
And now I'm talking about a specific thing.

1035
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
Oh, I got to get that scene.

1036
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
I mean, I got to get it.

1037
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:24,200
I don't think it would be a problem if not for the giant laptop sitting in front of the screen.

1038
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,200
I'll try and figure out a way to make it better for the next one, I guess.

1039
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,200
Yeah.

1040
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,200
I enjoyed those though.

1041
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,200
I hadn't actually watched the Final Fantasy 7 one when it came out

1042
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,200
and then after the Kingdom Hearts one I went back and watched the Final Fantasy 7 one

1043
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:43,200
because the FF7 one came out at a time before I just watched every random long ass video.

1044
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,200
And I was like, well, I haven't played Final Fantasy 7

1045
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,200
so I'm not going to understand or care about any of this.

1046
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,200
And then I went back and I was like, oh, this is actually good.

1047
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,200
You actually edited this video.

1048
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
Yeah.

1049
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
But I definitely want to...

1050
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,200
It's disguised as a ramble but it isn't really.

1051
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,200
I want to copy the format myself.

1052
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:13,200
Actually, really, that might have been the direct inspiration for the laying around videos that I've been doing this month

1053
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,200
where it's like laying around watching Non-Nun Biori until I like it

1054
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,200
where I'll watch an episode of the show and then just turn on the camera and ramble at it

1055
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:28,200
because I like this idea of covering the entire thing

1056
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,200
just every random thought you had about it through playing

1057
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,200
and then just throwing that all out there.

1058
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:41,200
And it's not something that's super reshareable and revisitable the way that a main video is

1059
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:46,200
but if people just want to hear someone talk about Kingdom Hearts, then that could be interesting

1060
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:52,200
which I thought it was interesting and I haven't played that game in fucking 11 years.

1061
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,200
Yeah.

1062
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
A lot of people found it interesting.

1063
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:59,200
I've been getting like a lot of comments from people who are clearly not subscribed.

1064
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
They just found it.

1065
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,200
I guess it's been shared among Kingdom Hearts fans

1066
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,200
and people are agreeing with my points even though they still think it's a good game

1067
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,200
despite its flaws and I don't know, it's nice.

1068
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:18,200
It's nice that something like this conversational sort of like just talking about a thing

1069
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:23,200
not really with a big point can still get across to a lot of people and they can enjoy it.

1070
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:29,200
I mean what I came to realize over time is that like the amount of effort you put into your video

1071
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:34,200
has nothing to do with how many people will watch it or how much they'll care about it.

1072
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
It's what the subject matter is.

1073
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:44,200
Like I'm sure that the Kingdom Hearts video probably has as many views as most of the other videos on your channel, right?

1074
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,200
Yeah.

1075
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:52,200
So it's like even though it's a lower effort in terms of like being a big cool comedy thing,

1076
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,200
I don't imagine people would like patron you as much for those kind of videos,

1077
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:01,200
but people will still watch it and enjoy it and get something out of it

1078
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,200
and that's why I've sort of turned to doing like a lot of these 45 minute long vlogs about anime

1079
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,200
where it's like people just want to hear me talk about anime.

1080
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,200
It doesn't really matter if I have something interesting like or like profound to say.

1081
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,200
It's just, hey, what did you think of that show?

1082
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,200
Well, let me tell you everything I thought of that show.

1083
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,200
So yeah, GRPJ is pretty cool.

1084
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:30,200
I'm copying it wholesale for myself and I'd love it as a GRPJ for myself

1085
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,200
because I need a good reason to play these fucking JRPGs.

1086
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,200
You could steal the formula if you credit me at the beginning of everything.

1087
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
Oh, I certainly would.

1088
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
I don't know if I'd steal your categories or anything.

1089
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,200
I would probably just fucking unscripted rant about them or something,

1090
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,200
but I would love a GRPJ.

1091
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,200
I'm jealous of the fact that you found a GRPJ

1092
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,200
because like in the mid-2000s, I was obsessed with JRPGs.

1093
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,200
I never beat any of them.

1094
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:12,200
Actually, I think I made a pact with myself that I would finish Persona 3 before the year was over.

1095
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Which year?

1096
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,200
This year.

1097
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Like, I've been putting it off for 10 years and I think I said,

1098
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,200
oh, you know what it was?

1099
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,200
It was that I have to try to beat Persona 3 and 4 before Persona 5 comes out, I think, was my deal,

1100
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,200
which is like this October, probably.

1101
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,200
Good luck.

1102
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,200
All right, Hippo.

1103
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:43,200
Do you have anything to say about video games other than what I've been asking you

1104
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,200
for this interview?

1105
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,200
I like shitty graphics.

1106
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,200
I like low-resolution things.

1107
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,200
Really big pixelated textures like PS1 sort of stuff.

1108
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,200
It's really, really cool.

1109
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,200
I like the aesthetic more than I like actually good-looking, realistic stuff.

1110
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,200
You know, those PS1 games, what bothers me the most is the wobbly thing.

1111
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
I love the wobbly thing.

1112
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,200
It makes me feel dizzy and sick.

1113
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,200
I tried to play a vagrant story.

1114
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:27,200
You should put that on your GRPJ list because that's a great JRPG.

1115
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,200
It's supposed to have one of the deepest stories in an RPG,

1116
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:37,200
but it's got that wobbly effect to such an extreme that it really makes me want to die.

1117
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Even though the aesthetic of the game is great other than that.

1118
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,200
I don't know.

1119
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:49,200
I think that I just love, I don't know what it is about the wobbly thing.

1120
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,200
It's just like you turn the camera and it moves a little and you like you can see

1121
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,200
like things popping in and out of being like correct and wrong.

1122
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,200
I don't know.

1123
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Something about this just really...

1124
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,200
It's like a glitch in the Matrix.

1125
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,200
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1126
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
I can't explain it.

1127
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,200
It's just cool.

1128
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,200
Well, I guess for me it's weird because I didn't grow up with it

1129
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,200
because I had an N64 which did not have that same thing.

1130
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,200
Yes, it's weird.

1131
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,200
I guess it's the same generation, so it's not really an upgrade,

1132
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,200
but N64 looks much better in general.

1133
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,200
Yeah, well it had...

1134
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:27,200
It was the problem with the N64 was that it had better graphical power,

1135
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,200
but it had less space because they kept cartridges

1136
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,200
and discs could hold more and you could have more of them.

1137
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,200
So Final Fantasy VII would never have fit onto an N64 cartridge

1138
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,200
because it was four fucking discs or three fucking discs.

1139
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,200
So that's why there were no RPGs on the N64 except for Quest 64

1140
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
which everyone thinks is fucking garbage,

1141
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,200
but otherwise it was not a single RPG because they were too fucking big.

1142
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,200
Nintendo and their fucking weird decisions.

1143
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,200
They never seemed to...

1144
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:09,200
Ever since the N64, I feel like they never have the developer's best interest in mind

1145
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,200
when they make their systems.

1146
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,200
I don't know.

1147
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,200
I think the Wii U is pretty good,

1148
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,200
but I don't think people were on board for developing for it because of the Wii.

1149
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
They thought it was just another gimmick thing.

1150
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Well, the Wii U obviously has much higher graphical capabilities and stuff,

1151
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
but you still can't do...

1152
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,200
You couldn't run uncharted on there or something, you know?

1153
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:40,200
I mean, I'm sure that there's a lot of games that would have been cross-platform to the Wii U,

1154
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,200
but can't be.

1155
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,200
But I don't know.

1156
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,200
I don't know to what extent that goes.

1157
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:54,200
Hippo, how about you tell me some stuff about your life?

1158
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,200
My history.

1159
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,200
Your backstory.

1160
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,200
Where does Hippo come from?

1161
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,200
You live in London.

1162
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,200
You're not even in the United States.

1163
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,200
That's true.

1164
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:08,200
I mean, I don't know whether people could tell that I'm English from my accent,

1165
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,200
but I am.

1166
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,200
I would hope so.

1167
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:16,200
I've had a lot of people over the years, I guess it is now, years,

1168
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:22,200
be surprised when they learn that I'm English instead of like a weird Australian something or other.

1169
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,200
That's because most people hear Australians and think they're fucking British.

1170
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,200
That is true also.

1171
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,200
No one can apparently tell the difference.

1172
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
But yeah.

1173
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:37,200
And I think it's that a lot of people think Yatzee is Australian because he lives in Australia,

1174
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,200
and so people get those accents confused.

1175
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,200
And people think Anthony C is...

1176
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,200
No, wait.

1177
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,200
Anthony C is British, but he lives...

1178
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,200
He's British Australian.

1179
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,200
Yeah, that's the combo.

1180
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:57,200
No, I live in England, London Place, and that's about that.

1181
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,200
I don't know what to say about my backstory.

1182
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,200
I went to school.

1183
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
I didn't like it.

1184
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:11,200
I wanted to be on the school podcast, but I think I was either asleep or the internet didn't work.

1185
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
But there's school things.

1186
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,200
I went and did a lot of art.

1187
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,200
I liked art until they kicked me out for drawing.

1188
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Not drawing, but like writing.

1189
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,200
I want to kill everybody in my art book.

1190
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,200
That was the story I wanted to bring onto the school podcast.

1191
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Is that I got kicked out of school.

1192
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,200
I'd go ahead and tell it here.

1193
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,200
Okay.

1194
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:39,200
Well, one day, I was an angry depressed teenager boy, and I wrote my art book.

1195
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,200
Fucking, I hate everybody.

1196
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,200
Kill, die, murder, or whatever.

1197
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:48,200
Exactly what I said, and I was feeling a bit nervous about it because I knew they would see it,

1198
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,200
but I kind of wanted them to see it and read it and be like, oh my goodness.

1199
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,200
And they did, but they did more than I thought they would, and they banned me from school.

1200
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,200
They said, you can't come in.

1201
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:05,200
And the reason which was hilarious to me and my parents was that I'm a danger to myself and fellow classmates

1202
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:11,200
because they thought I was either suicidal or homicidal from those few words I wrote in my art book.

1203
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,200
So I just came into the school the next day.

1204
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
They didn't even phone me or anything.

1205
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,200
They just said, excuse me, you're not allowed in.

1206
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,200
You have to go home.

1207
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,200
I said, well, I can't.

1208
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,200
My mom dropped me off.

1209
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
I was like, oh, we'll call your mom.

1210
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:29,200
So I just had to sit there being like, what the fuck?

1211
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:39,200
And then they sent me away from home and they said they needed a written doctor's note saying that I was sane or whatever.

1212
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,200
Jesus fucking Christ.

1213
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:45,200
It's it was the most overreaction thing that I've ever experienced at school.

1214
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,200
And I just fucking, it made me angry.

1215
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:53,200
It made me more angry and more, you know, liable to actually attack people.

1216
01:17:53,200 --> 01:18:01,200
And if they had just, you know, given me detention or something, because it was so presumptive.

1217
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,200
I don't know.

1218
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,200
That's my school story.

1219
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,200
It doesn't work.

1220
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,200
Although I did have, I did have a lot of fun at doing art in school.

1221
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:19,200
I made a lot of, I did fine art in GCSE, which is good.

1222
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:29,200
I made a lot of sculptures and paintings and I made a man out of tape and he lived in a giant tube out of tape, like black gaffer tape.

1223
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,200
And it was all shiny and black and he was shiny and black.

1224
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:41,200
And I made, no, the man was made out of a suit of tape that I made that I could wear and I can still wear because I'm really small.

1225
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,200
And it's really weird.

1226
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,200
But yeah, art's cool.

1227
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,200
And then I went on to college to do a foundation degree because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

1228
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:55,200
I was kind of feeling interested in animation, but I didn't feel ready for it.

1229
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:00,200
So I did a foundation year in college and that was fun.

1230
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,200
I met a few friends that I now don't talk to, but whatever.

1231
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,200
And then I went to, oh, are you going to say someone?

1232
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,200
No, you can continue.

1233
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:16,200
And then I went to uni and I did my three year animation degree and I met friends that are really cool.

1234
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,200
And I'm keeping in touch with them, which is cool.

1235
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:29,200
We played D&D on, well, we played one session of D&D and I got an animation degree and that's my school career, I guess.

1236
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,200
My school journey.

1237
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
Yeah.

1238
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
You kind of left unresolved.

1239
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,200
After you got expelled from that school, did you get back in or what?

1240
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,200
Oh, yeah.

1241
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:45,200
Well, it was just like, I was out for a couple of weeks or maybe a month or something.

1242
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:51,200
And we asked the doctor and they said, we need a fucking note to say that I'm sane.

1243
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,200
And they're like, what?

1244
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,200
The doctor was like, the fuck?

1245
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,200
So she just wrote a note and she said, just let him in.

1246
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:02,200
Like he's fucking, he wrote a little thing in his art book, who cares?

1247
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,200
And then the school was like, okay.

1248
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:12,200
And I felt like the reason, no, it was the reason, the reason they sent me home was not so much because they were afraid of me attacking students.

1249
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,200
But they didn't want to be responsible for me attacking anybody.

1250
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,200
So like if I attacked somebody at school, they didn't want to be seen as the reason.

1251
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,200
So like if I was going to a kill myself, they wanted it to be at home.

1252
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:30,200
So that they didn't get in trouble, which was fucking really, I hate them.

1253
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,200
I hate them all.

1254
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,200
School sucks.

1255
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:38,200
I gotta say, that's the first time I've ever felt lucky about my story that it didn't get to that point.

1256
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,200
You heard mine right in the school podcast.

1257
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:49,200
I haven't listened to it yet, but I might have heard it before, but I'll listen to it.

1258
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:55,200
So how did that month treat you?

1259
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
I mean, it sounds like it was awesome.

1260
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
You got to not go to school for like a month.

1261
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,200
It was kind of awesome.

1262
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,200
But at the same time, I think it wasn't GCSE.

1263
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,200
I think it was in A level.

1264
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:13,200
So in A level, you choose three subjects and I would chose art, art and photography, I think, and physics.

1265
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
But I dropped physics.

1266
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:19,200
So it was basically fun times all the times because I liked art and I liked the art department

1267
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:24,200
and I liked sitting in the art department doing whatever I was doing and not going and talking to anyone.

1268
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:32,200
So staying at home was not actually that fun because the only things I could do was play games

1269
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:39,200
and the only game I had at the time that I was trying to be good at playing was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

1270
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,200
because all the people at school were playing it.

1271
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:46,200
And I felt like I needed to be into a game that everybody was into in order to be popular,

1272
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:53,200
which was what I was trying to do, but I was playing that so much and I got so angry at it that I nearly broke it.

1273
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,200
I nearly broke my controller and everything.

1274
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,200
So I hate Call of Duty.

1275
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,200
Jesus.

1276
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
It wasn't a good time.

1277
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,200
I felt really sad.

1278
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:12,200
So what does the future hold for the hippo man if everything goes according to plan?

1279
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,200
The future.

1280
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:20,200
Well, I want to make a bunch of videos by the end of the year and then after that,

1281
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,200
well, I'm going to Radcon, your house, the Radconference.

1282
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,200
Yes.

1283
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:37,200
And that is somewhat of a test out, a try out for potentially me living either with you or near you

1284
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:46,200
in the future to be able to do more collaborative things with the rest of the PC, the TCP, TPCPC members.

1285
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,200
Yeah, that's essentially the purpose of Radcon is.

1286
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,200
Yeah.

1287
01:22:50,200 --> 01:23:01,200
So let's do things together and see what we can do together and see if like logistically how we could possibly all live together in the future.

1288
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,200
Yeah.

1289
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:12,200
So after that, you're the hardest one to move in though because you're in another country and currently no income.

1290
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,200
Yeah, not really.

1291
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,200
I mean, a Patreon is tiny.

1292
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:23,200
It's like $50, $60 a month, which is not good enough, guys.

1293
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,200
Come on, give me some more.

1294
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
That's my Patreon plug.

1295
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,200
There it is.

1296
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,200
That's all I got to say about it.

1297
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:45,200
But I want to be making videos so that after Radcon, if I've decided that I want to go to America and it's like seems like a good idea possible to do,

1298
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:55,200
I will try to make as many videos that will get me Patreon money and AdSense money and get growing big channel, big, big money, big, get money, get big money and I want to get big money

1299
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,200
so that I can move out safely.

1300
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:05,200
I don't want to go to America and then die in the streets because that's probably what would happen if I went now.

1301
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:15,200
Probably because of the plane ticket alone to get there and then, you know, buying a house, I mean, I don't know, renting an apartment.

1302
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:21,200
It would feel weird and also I'd have to get like a visa or a change the nationality.

1303
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,200
I don't know how any of that stuff works.

1304
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,200
It's a scary idea to go and live in America forever.

1305
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:32,200
So I want to make sure I'm getting a decent income because it doesn't matter where I do my YouTube videos.

1306
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,200
It just matters that I do YouTube videos and I can make money.

1307
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,200
Well, that's kind of where I live.

1308
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:46,200
The whole basis of us all moving in together is like that it doesn't matter where you do YouTube from.

1309
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:59,200
So like all of us, like the only people who who like absolutely we know can't just pick up and leave are you because you can't leave England that easily and you don't have any income.

1310
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:06,200
And then Nate because he has a real job and for anyone else it's like the sky is the limit.

1311
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,200
Like it doesn't matter where we are.

1312
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:15,200
You can do YouTube from anywhere as long as you have a decent internet connection, which is why Davoo particularly wants to get out of where he is to get a better internet connection.

1313
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:23,200
And Jesse where we don't know about because he takes care of his family and everything.

1314
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:32,200
But yeah, that's pretty much the idea is hey, if we could do it from anywhere, why not do it from right next to each other where we could do way more shit.

1315
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,200
It just seems like a good idea.

1316
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,200
It'll be really cool, especially having Victor do all our skits.

1317
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:44,200
Yeah, if he's still around, which who knows.

1318
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:49,200
I mean, I haven't seen that motherfucker in like a month because he's been constantly working.

1319
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,200
I actually saw him for a brief glimpse like two days ago.

1320
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:01,200
He came in and he was all like, I'm going to Hope's house and then left.

1321
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,200
That was it.

1322
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,200
That was all I saw of him all week.

1323
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,200
I'm not even joking.

1324
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
That's exactly what he did.

1325
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:16,200
Oh God, he's got a lot of hope in the future.

1326
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:25,200
So you actually you're you're closer to Davoo on the scale of watching all the shit I make.

1327
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
At least you watch all the Digi Bros.

1328
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,200
Yeah.

1329
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,200
Yeah, I watch all the Digi Bros.

1330
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,200
I watch the Digi Bro.

1331
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,200
I watch as much as I can.

1332
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:38,200
I haven't been watching your After Dark vlogs recently because my internet's been so poor.

1333
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,200
I have to really pick and choose which videos I let buffer all day.

1334
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,200
So I haven't been watching those.

1335
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
What the fuck is the deal with your internet right now?

1336
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
What is this nightmare that you've been living in?

1337
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:53,200
All right, hopefully by the time this podcast comes up, it will be sorted.

1338
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,200
Although I don't know how long you're going to take to make it to put it up.

1339
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,200
Next Tuesday, so six days from now.

1340
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,200
All right, probably won't be sorted by then.

1341
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:08,200
But the idea is we had an internet service provider and they went bust.

1342
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:13,200
And then we got shoved into this other one, which was like it consumed it.

1343
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,200
I don't really know the specifics.

1344
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:19,200
I just heard this from my parents that they had an internet service provider and it died.

1345
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:23,200
And then we have been swept all the way into this other one, which is absolute garbage.

1346
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:32,200
And it's very difficult to get out because of a weird thing with my dad's company who pays the phone bill.

1347
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,200
And it's confusing and I don't get it.

1348
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:38,200
And all it means is that the internet is absolutely abysmal.

1349
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:43,200
So long as there are more than two people using a computer at once in the house.

1350
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,200
And there usually is.

1351
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,200
That all sounds like it should be illegal.

1352
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,200
Yeah.

1353
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,200
I don't like it.

1354
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
I'm sad.

1355
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:00,200
I made a single rage tweet on Twitter about it.

1356
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:05,200
And a guy said, if your internet is so bad, how come you're on Twitter, you idiot?

1357
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,200
Or whatever.

1358
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,200
You use those arrows, the 4chan arrows.

1359
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Twitter is like the easiest fucking site to load in the universe.

1360
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,200
It doesn't take a huge load on your internet.

1361
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,200
Fuck that guy.

1362
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,200
I did.

1363
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,200
Fuck your listening. Fuck you, guy.

1364
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
I mean, I don't really hate him.

1365
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
It's just in the moment.

1366
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:31,200
And after I responded to him, I said, fucking, I explained that I didn't say all of my internet.

1367
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,200
I said, some of my internet, fuck you, guy.

1368
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:37,200
And then he replied with salt.

1369
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,200
And then I blocked him because fuck that guy.

1370
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,200
That's a very good reaction.

1371
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,200
Anyone who uses the word salt deserves to be blocked.

1372
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
Salt and pepper.

1373
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,200
Pepper's okay. Say pepper instead.

1374
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,200
Say paprika, anything.

1375
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,200
Let's go through some words I know you hate.

1376
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:01,200
Salt, cringe, get good.

1377
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,200
Well, you actually enjoy cringe, though.

1378
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,200
I enjoy cringe.

1379
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,200
It's fun.

1380
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,200
It's hilarious.

1381
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:12,200
I know you have a problem with people who try to be dismissive by acting cool.

1382
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:16,200
Like, your opinion doesn't matter because I'm cooler.

1383
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,200
You need to get good and stuff like that.

1384
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,200
Oh, get good.

1385
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:24,200
Yeah, well, that's the specific term get good is annoying because it exemplifies that.

1386
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:33,200
I guess I just don't like people assuming much of me based on the small things that I say.

1387
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,200
And when they look down on me, I'm like, who the hell are you, bitch?

1388
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,200
Don't you get angry ever?

1389
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:49,200
You were cut out through half of that sentence, but it's okay because you said the whole thing and it'll be on the recording.

1390
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,200
Yep.

1391
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,200
How do you spend your time on the internet?

1392
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,200
How would you say it's divided between?

1393
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,200
Well, a lot of it is YouTube.

1394
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:09,200
A lot of the time, I'm just either watching a YouTube video.

1395
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:14,200
Like, it's very rare that I have no YouTube videos ready to watch.

1396
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:22,200
There's usually I watch Creparion, which is a Hearthstone YouTuber, and he makes two videos a day and they're always interesting to watch because Hearthstone is just fun to watch for me.

1397
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:26,200
And then there's all the stuff the TPC members do.

1398
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,200
And I've cut out all of my podcasts.

1399
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:35,200
The only podcast I listen to is the procrastinators podcast if I wasn't on it.

1400
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:41,200
And I think the sleepycast, yeah, those are the only two podcasts I listen to.

1401
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
I used to listen to a bunch more.

1402
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:50,200
I made a whole ramble about it on my Give and Take channel about how I need to cut out all this stuff because YouTube has taken up so much of my time in general.

1403
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,200
I just needed to stop it.

1404
01:30:54,200 --> 01:31:04,200
Aside from YouTube, I usually check Twitter a lot and I check Tumblr somewhat, but not really that much anymore.

1405
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:09,200
Because it's generally just kind of...

1406
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:17,200
It's not really a thing you go back to check an update because none of the notifications I get or asks I get are interesting.

1407
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,200
I actually don't get asks anymore.

1408
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:28,200
So Twitter is my main sort of let's see what's happening thing and then other than that it's YouTube and I don't think anything else.

1409
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:34,200
I don't do... I don't like streams at all.

1410
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:41,200
Well, you were cut out for me for like the last two minutes and it sounds like you just kept talking.

1411
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:45,200
So that's great.

1412
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,200
Did I cut out again or did you cut out?

1413
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,200
Jesus Christ.

1414
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,200
Damn it.

1415
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Hey darkness, my old friend, come in, have a cup of tea.

1416
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:00,200
You don't like tea? You like coffee? Black? Sure.

1417
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200
You are? Darkness? My old friend.

1418
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:08,200
Hey, how's the thing? How's your wife? She's dead? Good. I don't care for her either.

1419
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,200
We're halfway there.

1420
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,200
Living on a prayer.

1421
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:21,200
Take my hand and make it out there.

1422
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Living on a prayer.

1423
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:30,200
Is it? No? No? You made a little noise. You made a little it and that's it. Also, I could hear.

1424
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,200
Oh dear.

1425
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:39,200
I can't wait to hear the entire secret other podcast you've been doing with yourself.

1426
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,200
All these times that you've cut out.

1427
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,200
It's gonna be interesting.

1428
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,200
Are you actually here this time?

1429
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,200
Yeah, oh.

1430
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,200
Hippo.

1431
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,200
Hippo.

1432
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,200
As soon as you say something.

1433
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,200
Hippo!

1434
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:55,200
Fucking gun, you're dead. I'm dead, we're dead. This is the dead podcast.

1435
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,200
Hey, you know what? I like murder.

1436
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,200
I like murdering internet service providers.

1437
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:05,200
That's fun. You go to their house, they say, excuse me, who are you?

1438
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,200
And I just stab you in the brain.

1439
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,200
Woo, in the brain. Right there.

1440
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,200
I bypass the skin. I bypass the skull.

1441
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
I stab you directly in the brain with my brain knife.

1442
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,200
It cuts only your brain.

1443
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,200
I made it especially for you. You sick fuck.

1444
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,200
Why do you do this to me?

1445
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,200
Why do you do this to this podcast?

1446
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,200
I mean, it's probably interesting. Probably hilarious.

1447
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,200
Seeing both of us flounder.

1448
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,200
Okay, you're back.

1449
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,200
Are you back, though?

1450
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,200
Okay, you are back. You are actually back.

1451
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,200
We are actually back.

1452
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,200
For another all too brief period.

1453
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:43,200
Let's see how long that lasts.

1454
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,200
It's already over, isn't it?

1455
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,200
Are you gone?

1456
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,200
Oh.

1457
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,200
It's already over.

1458
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,200
It's already over.

1459
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,200
It's already over! It's already over!

1460
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Hippo!

1461
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,200
Hippo!

1462
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,200
Hippo!

1463
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:02,200
Come back to me.

1464
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

1465
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:12,200
do you understand the implications of this?

1466
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,200
I forgot the rest of that.

1467
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:19,200
Oh, Aaron Hansen.

1468
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,200
You don't even try, dude.

1469
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,200
Don't even try.

1470
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,200
This is the two-way podcast.

1471
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Streams.

1472
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,200
We're on two different universes now.

1473
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:33,200
Both of us sailing along on the Milky Way.

1474
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,200
Individual.

1475
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,200
All individually.

1476
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,200
And that's the way the cookie rumbles.

1477
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,200
That's the way...

1478
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,200
That's the way it's meant to be.

1479
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,200
That's the way...

1480
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:53,200
That's the way it ought to stay.

1481
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,200
You know what?

1482
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:14,200
Wait right there, everyone.

1483
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,200
Here we go.

1484
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,200
Let's start with a good old...

1485
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:23,200
This...

1486
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,200
Oh, fuck.

1487
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,200
I did it wrong.

1488
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:29,200
Let's do it again.

1489
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,200
Blackbird singing in the dead of night.

1490
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:38,200
Three deep broken wings and learned to climb.

1491
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,200
All your life.

1492
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:52,200
You were only waiting for this moment to arrive.

1493
01:35:52,200 --> 01:36:06,200
I hate it.

1494
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,200
I hate it.

1495
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:16,200
It sucks.

1496
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,200
Internet.

1497
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:25,200
Internet.

1498
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,200
Here's a solo.

1499
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:32,200
But I've been...

1500
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,200
Are we here?

1501
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,200
You spoke too soon, you fool.

1502
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,200
Oh, you fool.

1503
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:59,200
You spoke too soon.

1504
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Fuck this shit, I'm dead.

1505
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,200
Very good at improved guitars.

1506
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:25,200
But here's one from the ages.

1507
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:30,200
Oh no, we're not here.

1508
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
You're silly, Digi.

1509
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,200
You think it's okay.

1510
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,200
It's not.

1511
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,200
You're gay.

1512
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:46,200
We're in the thing.

1513
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,200
The thing that which...

1514
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200
I can't think of the word.

1515
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,200
You know what?

1516
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,200
It's like the limbo?

1517
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,200
That's a bad word.

1518
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,200
Limbo.

1519
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,200
You were in the limbo.

1520
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,200
The limbo of the limbo.

1521
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:03,200
On the window of the windowsill.

1522
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,200
It's bad here.

1523
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,200
I don't like it very much.

1524
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,200
It's got graham on the side.

1525
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:10,200
It's a bad game.

1526
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,200
It's not a game.

1527
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:15,200
I'm not talking about a game.

1528
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,200
Here's another classic.

1529
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:47,200
You know, I'm not actually very good at that.

1530
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,200
Let's click the knuckles.

1531
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,200
Alright.

1532
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,200
I can't...

1533
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,200
Alright, I can.

1534
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,200
That's the way you look at the world.

1535
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,200
I can.

1536
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,200
That's out of tune.

1537
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,200
That's why it sounds bad.

1538
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,200
It's not me.

1539
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,200
Let's do a whole fucking...

1540
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,200
I'm tuning my fucking guitar while Digi is like...

1541
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:12,200
Oh, I wish the podcast was working.

1542
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,200
But you know what?

1543
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,200
Maybe he'll cut his own bit out and this will just be me.

1544
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,200
Me and you.

1545
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,200
You like TPC?

1546
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,200
I like it.

1547
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,200
I don't listen to it.

1548
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,200
Because I'm usually there.

1549
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,200
But when I'm not there, I try to listen to it.

1550
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,200
It's fun.

1551
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,200
It's nice.

1552
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,200
I like being these guys' friends.

1553
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,200
They're all my best friends.

1554
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,200
They're soul to best times.

1555
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,200
I love you all.

1556
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,200
I'm burping.

1557
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,200
Alright.

1558
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,200
You all know the words to this one.

1559
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,200
I don't.

1560
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,200
I don't.

1561
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,200
I don't.

1562
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,200
I don't.

1563
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,200
I could finish the song, but I messed up.

1564
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,200
I'm sorry.

1565
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,200
Oh, you heard it.

1566
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,200
Oh, he heard it.

1567
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,200
He heard some of it.

1568
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,200
He was trying to sing along.

1569
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,200
I should finish it for him.

1570
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:12,200
I skipped to the other bit.

1571
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:37,200
I don't know what to do.

1572
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:42,200
I don't know what to do.

1573
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:47,200
I don't know what to do.

1574
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:52,200
I don't know what to do.

1575
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:59,200
I don't know what to do.

1576
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:05,200
I don't know what to do.

1577
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:12,200
I don't know what to do.

1578
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:17,200
I don't know what to do.

1579
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:21,200
So, Hippo, give me a state of the Hippo address.

1580
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:24,200
How do you feel about how your life is going right now?

1581
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,200
The address?

1582
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,200
State?

1583
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,200
I feel my life is okay.

1584
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:35,200
I feel my life is actually pretty great.

1585
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:38,200
I'm at home with my parents, but my parents are cool,

1586
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,200
so that's not an issue.

1587
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,200
They love me, and I love them.

1588
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
I've got a room.

1589
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,200
The construction at my house is finished.

1590
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,200
They've got an extension.

1591
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,200
So now the house is really cool and new,

1592
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,200
and I have a new room, and I have a new TV,

1593
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,200
because it's my birthday,

1594
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,200
and everything's looking up, really.

1595
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:01,200
All I've got now is to focus on my career,

1596
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,200
my money making,

1597
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,200
and really, that's going well as well.

1598
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,200
Actually, I can't complain.

1599
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,200
Aside from the internet,

1600
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,200
that'll be fixed within a month, probably.

1601
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,200
So, my life's great.

1602
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,200
How was yours?

1603
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,200
What kind of frequency can we expect

1604
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,200
new Hippo Crit videos with?

1605
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:27,200
I'm trying to get them out to a month,

1606
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,200
like one every two weeks.

1607
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,200
That would be beautiful.

1608
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:35,200
That would be a reality I want to live in.

1609
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,200
Yeah.

1610
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:42,200
I've got a follow-up to the miniclip games video coming,

1611
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,200
but I don't know whether I'm already too late for that

1612
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,200
to become two weeks later.

1613
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,200
I don't think so.

1614
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,200
I think either it's this week or next week,

1615
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,200
well, obviously, it's this week or next week,

1616
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,200
but it might be next this week.

1617
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,200
I mean, the upload time alone

1618
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:01,200
might make it come out a week later.

1619
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,200
That's true.

1620
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,200
I actually don't think the upload is that bad.

1621
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,200
It's just staying connected.

1622
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,200
Like, the connection is just wobbly in it.

1623
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,200
It's like, okay, and then it's suddenly gone completely,

1624
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:16,200
and then it's okay, and then it's gone completely.

1625
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,200
I guess you could just hear.

1626
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,200
It was like that just then.

1627
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,200
So, I don't know how much you can say about this,

1628
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:32,200
but there's also some contract work you've been doing, yeah?

1629
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,200
Yeah.

1630
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:38,200
I don't think it's, like, it's secret,

1631
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:42,200
but I've written a pilot for a...

1632
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:47,200
not necessarily ever going to be made TV show for teenagers,

1633
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,200
a cartoon, animation cartoon,

1634
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,200
because a person came to me and said,

1635
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,200
I think your animations are funny.

1636
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:57,200
Would you like to help us write a comedy script?

1637
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,200
And I did.

1638
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,200
I went and talked to them.

1639
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,200
I helped design the characters and the idea of the show,

1640
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,200
and I helped write the pilot.

1641
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,200
I did write the pilot the script, and I sent that in,

1642
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,200
and now they're using that in their animation studio

1643
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:15,200
to pitch to a bunch of different studios' channels,

1644
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,200
that is, to get them green lit and stuff.

1645
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:21,200
That's all that's going on with that.

1646
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:24,200
So, I don't know whether that will become anything,

1647
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,200
but I'm sure I'll work with them in the future.

1648
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,200
So, that's cool.

1649
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:31,200
I had been under the impression it was a children's show you guys were making.

1650
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:35,200
It was like a pre-bubescent children's,

1651
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,200
sort of like 13, 12, sort of,

1652
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:41,200
because it's for kids, but it's kind of dark,

1653
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,200
because it's about death.

1654
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,200
It's a train of ghosts.

1655
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:48,200
It wasn't really a train of ghosts.

1656
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,200
It started off as a train of ghosts,

1657
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,200
and it was going to be spirited away.

1658
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,200
That's the idea that I had in my head of what it would look like.

1659
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,200
But like a show set on a train,

1660
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:00,200
filled with mythical beasts and creatures and witches

1661
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:03,200
and cool things like that.

1662
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Creatures of Greek myths and stuff,

1663
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,200
you know, death, the grim reaper himself would be a character,

1664
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
and he would be cool.

1665
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:18,200
He would be all reserved and read the newspaper and stuff.

1666
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:22,200
Just, you know, sit in the corner and not talk to anybody.

1667
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,200
Be really shy. That was the thing with death.

1668
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,200
He's really shy.

1669
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:27,200
He doesn't like talking to people,

1670
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:30,200
because, you know, he kills them eventually.

1671
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,200
So, it's just sort of like, oh, no, no, that's fine.

1672
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,200
I'll just sit here.

1673
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:40,200
But yeah, the point of the show is there's a little girl

1674
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,200
and she's an orphan,

1675
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:45,200
and the orphanage is horrible and evil and despicable,

1676
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,200
and the person there is evil, and she runs away

1677
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,200
and she finds a magic train, she jumps on,

1678
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:53,200
and before she thinks about where the train would be going.

1679
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,200
And it turns out it's a ghost train with ghosts,

1680
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:01,200
and it's cool, and she has adventures on the train.

1681
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:03,200
I think in the scripts that I wrote,

1682
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,200
she meets the spider girl, which is basically Muffet,

1683
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,200
but a little girl Muffet from Undertale,

1684
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:12,200
which is adorable to me,

1685
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:16,200
especially the character design they based off of that.

1686
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,200
I don't know whether I can show anybody the character designs,

1687
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,200
but I don't think there's much point to it,

1688
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,200
seeing as the show may never be made,

1689
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,200
but it's cool.

1690
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,200
Specifically, the person who brought you on to do this

1691
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,200
was Anna Esther Volos, right?

1692
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,200
That's how you pronounce her name.

1693
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,200
Yeah, I don't know either, but Anna Esther Volos,

1694
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,200
she's great, she's cool, you're cool,

1695
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,200
you might be listening to this.

1696
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:45,200
The longest time and highest paying patron

1697
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:48,200
of a lot of the PCP.

1698
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,200
Yeah, it's kind of impressive.

1699
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,200
She was my biggest patron for a very, very long time,

1700
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,200
but she also has her own YouTube channel

1701
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,200
called Anna Stays At Home,

1702
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,200
where she did a couple of really short anime analysis,

1703
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,200
one for Ava and one for Utana,

1704
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,200
specifically the ending of Utana,

1705
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,200
like the last episode,

1706
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,200
and a part of End of Ava as well,

1707
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:17,200
and then this long-ass Rambley vlog about Dragon Age.

1708
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:21,200
Which one had the Madagascar comparison?

1709
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,200
That's the Ava one.

1710
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:28,200
I always think of that one as the Madagascar one.

1711
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:31,200
It's such a cool comparison to make.

1712
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:36,200
Yeah, I never would have imagined someone

1713
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:41,200
using Madagascar to analyze Ava.

1714
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,200
I feel like there's not a lot of crossover

1715
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,200
in people who have even seen both of those.

1716
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,200
I certainly haven't seen Madagascar.

1717
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,200
That's a good show.

1718
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,200
I think Nate, for some reason,

1719
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,200
doesn't like the idea of Dreamworks at all,

1720
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,200
so he hasn't watched any of those things.

1721
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:58,200
Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar are a great series of trilogies.

1722
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,200
You should watch them if you like kids films.

1723
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,200
I just heard that Madagascar was shit,

1724
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,200
so that's why I never watched it.

1725
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,200
It's not the best thing ever,

1726
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,200
but Kung Fu Panda is fucking amazing.

1727
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,200
Kung Fu Panda is the new Shrek.

1728
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,200
Shrek is good,

1729
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,200
and then Kung Fu Panda is the next one up.

1730
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,200
Madagascar is kind of worse than both of them,

1731
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,200
but it's still alright.

1732
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,200
I really want to watch Shrek,

1733
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,200
because I've gotten the impression

1734
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,200
people don't look back fondly on Shrek.

1735
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,200
It's become like a meme,

1736
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,200
and it seems like people really hate that movie,

1737
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,200
and I remember loving it as a kid.

1738
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,200
I watched it a lot of times.

1739
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:38,200
What I think is people remember it as a kid,

1740
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,200
and then they look back at it,

1741
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,200
and they're like,

1742
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,200
whoa, all this is weird,

1743
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,200
and then they made a meme out of it because of that,

1744
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,200
but then, you know, as memes stewed,

1745
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,200
they just became...

1746
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,200
I really hate Shrek.

1747
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,200
Well, they're dumb.

1748
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,200
It's got great comedy.

1749
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,200
Some animation fans, you know?

1750
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,200
Yeah, I mean, it was a fun movie.

1751
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,200
I don't remember anything about it that I'd be like,

1752
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:04,200
oh, fucking Shrek is garbage.

1753
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,200
I remember being pretty okay.

1754
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,200
Shrek is great. Shrek 1 is great.

1755
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,200
Shrek 2 is brilliant,

1756
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,200
and then Shrek 3 and 4 is just sort of like,

1757
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,200
yeah, I guess.

1758
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,200
That's how they went,

1759
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,200
but nobody can argue that Shrek and Shrek 2

1760
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,200
are terrible or bad.

1761
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:24,200
They're stupid if they do.

1762
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,200
Yeah.

1763
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,200
Yeah.

1764
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,200
Ooh, what are some of your favorite movies, Hippo?

1765
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,200
Are you into movies?

1766
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:36,200
I'm not actually into movies that much,

1767
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,200
mostly because I don't like sitting down

1768
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,200
and not being able to just leave.

1769
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,200
Like, with a TV show...

1770
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,200
Yeah, that's a big part of why I didn't get into movies

1771
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,200
for a long time.

1772
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,200
There was the last hour, maybe,

1773
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:53,200
or 30 minutes or something,

1774
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,200
and if you don't want to watch another one,

1775
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,200
it's easy to just stop.

1776
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:00,200
But the movie, it doesn't feel right to pause a movie

1777
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,200
and then come back to it,

1778
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,200
especially since DVDs, the early DVDs,

1779
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,200
they didn't save your place.

1780
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,200
They used to. They now do,

1781
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
but they didn't use to,

1782
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:13,200
and you couldn't really just leave it

1783
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,200
until another day.

1784
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,200
Yeah, movies.

1785
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:20,200
I like Reservoir Dogs.

1786
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,200
I like A Terminator.

1787
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,200
I like...

1788
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,200
I don't know. I like Alien 1.

1789
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:29,200
I haven't seen that many,

1790
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,200
but I have seen a lot of good classics.

1791
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
A lot of animated movies.

1792
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:37,200
I like a lot of Disney stuff.

1793
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:40,200
What's your favorite Disney?

1794
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,200
Ooh.

1795
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,200
The favorite.

1796
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,200
I like Lilo and Stitch.

1797
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,200
Oh, that is a good one.

1798
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,200
Yeah, I think...

1799
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,200
It's hard,

1800
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,200
because every time I think of my favorite,

1801
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,200
I forget...

1802
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,200
I did mention this before.

1803
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,200
I forget all the other ones.

1804
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,200
I can only think of Hercules because

1805
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,200
I just listened to the Munchie podcast

1806
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,200
and he said he liked Hercules.

1807
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,200
I also like Hercules a lot.

1808
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,200
I like Hercules a lot more,

1809
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,200
but I can't remember.

1810
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,200
But I think my favorite animated movie

1811
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,200
is The Brave Little Toaster,

1812
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,200
which I know Jesse is a fan of.

1813
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,200
Oh, yeah, you mentioned this.

1814
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,200
You're a huge fan of The Brave Little Toaster.

1815
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,200
Yeah, Brave Little Toaster 2 and 3

1816
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
were...

1817
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,200
Disney took the sequel,

1818
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,200
the rest of the sequels,

1819
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,200
which are not even slightly as good.

1820
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,200
Brave Little Toaster 1

1821
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,200
is like a super amazing adventure

1822
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,200
and you definitely see it.

1823
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
It's the grace...

1824
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,200
Yeah.

1825
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,200
It's like a meatloaf song

1826
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,200
in the middle of the movie.

1827
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,200
It's awesome.

1828
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,200
Have you seen it?

1829
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,200
Yeah, I saw the first one probably

1830
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,200
like three or four times,

1831
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,200
and then I know I saw the second and third

1832
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,200
and I remember even as a kid being like,

1833
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,200
these suck!

1834
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,200
They just kind of did the same thing again,

1835
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,200
but with none of the emotions.

1836
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:08,200
Yeah.

1837
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,200
And the music, I think...

1838
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,200
I'm not sure,

1839
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,200
but I think the music in Brave Little Toaster

1840
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,200
made me interested in becoming a musician

1841
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,200
down the line.

1842
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,200
Because I just love those songs so much.

1843
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,200
I had the old VHS tape

1844
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,200
and I would go to the songs part,

1845
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,200
any of the songs,

1846
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,200
apart from the first one, which is sort of a sing-song thing.

1847
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,200
But like the techno one at the end

1848
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,200
with all the high-tech computers,

1849
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,200
I would get to that point

1850
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,200
and rewind and listen to it again,

1851
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,200
and I would dance all the time.

1852
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,200
This is my favorite song ever.

1853
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,200
I love that fucking movie.

1854
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,200
Yeah, oh man.

1855
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,200
I'm just looking at the soundtrack.

1856
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,200
I was trying to see

1857
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,200
if anyone...

1858
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,200
They have the spooky one in the middle.

1859
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
Yeah.

1860
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,200
I just remember how much,

1861
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,200
like, Worthless is like a legit

1862
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,200
classic rock song.

1863
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,200
It's like a full-on,

1864
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,200
full-on or something.

1865
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,200
It's great. Good music.

1866
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,200
Cool movie.

1867
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,200
So, recently...

1868
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,200
I guess not too recently

1869
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,200
at this point, but

1870
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,200
you kind of got into anime

1871
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,200
through the PCP, yeah?

1872
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,200
Yeah.

1873
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,200
Before I met

1874
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,200
you and Nate and all that,

1875
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,200
I had watched a few anime, I think.

1876
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,200
Well, I've watched Naruto Bleach in One Piece

1877
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,200
and Lucky Star

1878
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
and that's about it.

1879
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,200
I think I watched

1880
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
On a Guy Teacher or something weird

1881
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,200
as well.

1882
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,200
But I've never really

1883
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,200
gotten into it

1884
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,200
aside from liking One Piece so much

1885
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,200
that it's my favorite thing.

1886
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,200
But you're a huge manga guy, though, right?

1887
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,200
Or much bigger of a manga guy.

1888
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,200
Only because

1889
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
I stopped watching the anime because

1890
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,200
the manga was coming out quicker.

1891
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
I don't just mean of One Piece,

1892
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,200
but you seem to have read a lot

1893
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,200
of the long-running

1894
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
great manga. You've read Bakumon

1895
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,200
in I-Shield 21 and...

1896
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,200
Once I started reading the manga

1897
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,200
of One Piece and stuff

1898
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,200
and Naruto and Bleach,

1899
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,200
I think I...

1900
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,200
I didn't read the manga of Death Note.

1901
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,200
I was a fan of Death Note as well, anime.

1902
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,200
But on those sites,

1903
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,200
I saw all these things. I was like,

1904
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,200
I'm bored. I'll read I-Shield 21

1905
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,200
and it just so happened to be the fucking

1906
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,200
thing I've ever seen in terms of sports

1907
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,200
manga. And then there's

1908
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,200
there's a...

1909
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,200
What did you say, Bakumon?

1910
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:36,200
I think it was just because those ones were like

1911
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,200
high up on the popular

1912
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,200
list next to One Piece.

1913
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,200
At a certain time, I was like, oh cool,

1914
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,200
I'll check it out. I actually

1915
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,200
read Kimi Nii Torokai

1916
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,200
as well because that was up there for a while.

1917
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:52,200
How did it... did it frustrate

1918
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,200
you to no end while reading it?

1919
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,200
That the two never fucking

1920
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,200
hooked up for so fucking long?

1921
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
I think I actually

1922
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,200
gave up of reading it, but it was kind of

1923
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,200
cute.

1924
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,200
There's quite a lot of

1925
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,200
manga I kind of forget about that I've

1926
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,200
read. Like Ichigo 100%.

1927
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,200
I think I was into

1928
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,200
that sort of romance sort of stuff for a while.

1929
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,200
That was cool, except

1930
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,200
it wasn't because it took too long

1931
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,200
for anything to happen.

1932
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,200
Did you ever get into like Negima

1933
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,200
or Love Hina or any of those?

1934
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,200
Love Hina, I got into the dating

1935
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,200
sim that was around. The Flash

1936
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,200
dating sim of Love Hina. I didn't know what Love Hina

1937
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,200
was, but it was a dating sim

1938
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,200
and it was like, ugh,

1939
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,200
the girls, you date them.

1940
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,200
Like a fan made pornographic dating

1941
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,200
sim, right?

1942
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,200
I don't think I ever got to the porn part

1943
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,200
if there was.

1944
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,200
But yeah, it was probably fan made. I didn't know

1945
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,200
anything about it, but it was really shitty

1946
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,200
looking and it was a really shitty sort of flash

1947
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,200
game with gradients everywhere.

1948
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,200
You know, the sort of flash gradients.

1949
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,200
Yeah. So what

1950
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:02,200
animes are you into now?

1951
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:04,200
I'm going to go ahead and guess the same ones

1952
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:06,200
the rest of the PCP are into, which is

1953
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,200
all the Gainax shows.

1954
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,200
Yeah, there's Cowboy Bebop,

1955
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,200
Space Dandy, Killer Kill,

1956
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,200
Gurren Lagann, Gurren Lagoon,

1957
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,200
Neon Genesis

1958
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,200
Ava, and

1959
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,200
what else?

1960
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:24,200
It's basically just stuff that I've heard you say

1961
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,200
is considered

1962
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,200
really a classic.

1963
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,200
And I felt like I wanted to get into all the classics

1964
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,200
because they're at least guaranteed to be

1965
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,200
good. Like I didn't want to go into

1966
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,200
experimenting.

1967
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,200
I think it's something to do

1968
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,200
with the kinds of people

1969
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,200
we all are and the kinds of shows

1970
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,200
that Gainax makes, that

1971
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,200
there's definitely a correlation there

1972
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,200
because we all love Gainax shows.

1973
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:50,200
Like we all love Ava, we all love

1974
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,200
Killer Kill and Gurren Lagoon.

1975
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:54,200
I guess Nate doesn't love Killer Kill that much, but like

1976
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,200
he's been a weirdo

1977
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,200
about that. He clearly

1978
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,200
would like it. He just feels that Gurren Lagoon

1979
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,200
is my baby and it's similar.

1980
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,200
Fuck it. Stupid.

1981
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:06,200
Well, what did you think of, did you see

1982
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:08,200
Fully Coolie?

1983
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,200
Oh yeah, I saw Fully Coolie as well. That was good.

1984
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:12,200
I didn't get it, but I like it.

1985
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,200
Something about

1986
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,200
those shows, it's just

1987
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,200
like that studio

1988
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,200
the way they make shows

1989
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,200
because I mean those are all popular, but they're not like

1990
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,200
you know, everyone

1991
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,200
loves them and yet within our chat

1992
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,200
everyone loves them.

1993
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:30,200
Like there's no dissenting opinion

1994
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,200
about Gainax shows

1995
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,200
in our chat. And like there's kind of a

1996
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,200
period at the start of

1997
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,200
2015

1998
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,200
where like

1999
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:42,200
we all simultaneously

2000
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,200
watched like a bunch of them

2001
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,200
because it was like you and Jesse

2002
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,200
both watched Killer Kill at like

2003
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,200
the same time.

2004
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,200
I think it was, I don't know

2005
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,200
whether it was me.

2006
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,200
I feel like my decision, oh yeah

2007
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,200
I watched Gun Buster and Die Buster

2008
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
as well and K-On, I forgot.

2009
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,200
Yeah, well because K-On was

2010
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,200
like I definitely remember that

2011
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,200
I got you to start watching K-On

2012
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,200
and then Jesse started watching K-On

2013
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,200
and then

2014
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,200
I as a result of that

2015
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,200
made my K-On video

2016
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,200
like because you guys were watching it

2017
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,200
it got me watching it again

2018
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,200
whenever any of us

2019
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,200
are like revisiting something and talking about it

2020
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,200
in the chat you get all hyped about it

2021
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,200
like if you or anyone

2022
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,200
were playing a game that I had made a review on

2023
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,200
and you'd never played it before

2024
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,200
and you were talking about it and be like yeah cool

2025
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,200
it's this

2026
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,200
sort of thing because like I remember I was watching

2027
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,200
Ava and talking about it in the chat and Jesse

2028
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,200
was like oh shit Ava's so cool and then

2029
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,200
I feel like that prompted him to go

2030
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,200
on his crazy Ava binge

2031
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,200
and start writing fan sexy stuff.

2032
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,200
That did happen. Yeah it was

2033
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,200
all like early

2034
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:52,200
2014, early 2015

2035
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,200
there was this period where we were all kind of

2036
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
watching the same anime like you watched

2037
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,200
Kill La Kill, Jesse watched it and then

2038
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:00,200
as a result of you guys watching it

2039
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,200
I watched it again and then

2040
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,200
that also inspired my

2041
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,200
Guru on the Gun vs. Kill La because then you watched Guru on the Gun

2042
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,200
and so I watched both shows back to back

2043
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,200
and wrote that video

2044
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,200
comparing them and then

2045
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,200
you started watching Ava and I started

2046
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:16,200
doing my Ava videos not long after that

2047
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:18,200
so like pretty much whatever

2048
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,200
you were watching we all

2049
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,200
ended up watching at the same time

2050
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
and that sort of

2051
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:26,200
spawned some of those old videos

2052
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,200
it was great

2053
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,200
it was a great time and then

2054
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,200
it kind of stopped I guess because

2055
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,200
we watched all the...

2056
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:36,200
the run out of cool anime

2057
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,200
I guess because of the fact that

2058
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,200
those are all shows that both Nate and Jesse

2059
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,200
also know about then

2060
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:46,200
it's easier for me to be like

2061
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:48,200
we all kind of like Ava so of course

2062
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,200
you had to watch it or Cowboy Bebop

2063
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,200
it was like me because I was

2064
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,200
the new but I was new to it

2065
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:58,200
and you were like you were all

2066
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,200
feeling my new good

2067
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,200
vibes about it

2068
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,200
and not too long later like

2069
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,200
DeVoo watched all those shows once he joined the chat

2070
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,200
because like we kept talking about all of them

2071
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:10,200
you know

2072
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:12,200
well I don't know I guess he'd already seen Kill La Kill

2073
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,200
and Girl in the Gaunt but he definitely watched

2074
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,200
Cowboy Bebop and Ava like once he started

2075
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,200
hanging out with us and shit

2076
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,200
but yeah like

2077
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:22,200
I guess that's like the TPC canon

2078
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:24,200
is like all the guy next shows

2079
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,200
and Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy

2080
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,200
have you not watched Samurai Shampoo yet?

2081
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:30,200
I have not

2082
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:32,200
but you should probably

2083
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,200
watch that one because it's the

2084
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:36,200
it's like the third

2085
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,200
in the trilogy of Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy

2086
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,200
and Samurai Shampoo

2087
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:42,200
or it's the one in the middle

2088
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,200
which me and Jesse are both long time fans of

2089
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,200
though Jesse

2090
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,200
has said he can't watch Samurai Shampoo

2091
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,200
the one that Jesse really likes

2092
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,200
the ninja one

2093
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,200
there's a ninja one

2094
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,200
that Jesse really likes

2095
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,200
I forget it

2096
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,200
a ninja

2097
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:02,200
oh ninja scroll

2098
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,200
yeah the movie

2099
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:06,200
oh is it a movie? well I'll watch it

2100
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,200
it's like a movie from the

2101
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,200
mid 90's that's just like nothing but violence

2102
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,200
and kicking gas

2103
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,200
it's great and tits

2104
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:16,200
tits violence and kicking gas

2105
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,200
um

2106
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,200
yeah

2107
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,200
it's harder for me to like

2108
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:24,200
get you to watch

2109
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,200
other anime that I like

2110
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:28,200
because

2111
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,200
it's hard to get

2112
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,200
everyone into something

2113
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:34,200
I feel like I'm the only guy

2114
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,200
in the PCP who

2115
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,200
people say this thing is good

2116
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,200
and I immediately want to check it out

2117
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:42,200
everyone else seems to really need to have

2118
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,200
their arm twisted

2119
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,200
in order to get into something

2120
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,200
yeah me more than most

2121
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:50,200
I feel like my time is

2122
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:52,200
precious even though I don't do much with it

2123
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:54,200
a lot of the time

2124
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,200
I have so many other things to

2125
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:58,200
get into that I already know that I want to

2126
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,200
get into why would I get into this new thing

2127
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,200
you know

2128
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,200
I mean I totally get it

2129
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:06,200
with like you say

2130
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:08,200
berserk is great and you would really like it

2131
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,200
I'm like sure

2132
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,200
yeah we got you to read berserk I forgot

2133
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,200
then I eventually did and it's the greatest

2134
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,200
fucking thing ever

2135
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:18,200
well that was one that like

2136
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,200
I very deliberately wanted you

2137
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,200
to read berserk because

2138
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:24,200
knowing your taste I felt like it was perfect

2139
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:26,200
for you

2140
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,200
because it's got like you know

2141
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,200
it's fantasy with skeletons

2142
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,200
and it's got this dark plot

2143
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:34,200
and this like really strong main character

2144
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:36,200
and you like shows like Breaking Bad

2145
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,200
and stuff like that and I felt like it's along those

2146
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,200
lines in a way

2147
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:42,200
so I felt like

2148
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,200
you needed to read berserk

2149
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,200
and I was not going to stop

2150
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:48,200
talking about it until you did it

2151
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:50,200
yeah there are actually quite a lot of like

2152
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:52,200
really

2153
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:54,200
saddening moments like not saddening but like

2154
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,200
really

2155
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:58,200
like you just feel like shit after

2156
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,200
like that bit where there's like

2157
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:02,200
that how do you explain it

2158
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,200
it's like a big sack of

2159
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,200
ooze and they throw the women in it

2160
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:08,200
and they get

2161
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,200
raped through the ooze and then they

2162
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,200
spawn demon babies

2163
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:14,200
and that's just a fucking

2164
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,200
and it's like oh

2165
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,200
disgusting but I kind of like it

2166
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,200
there's definitely a period

2167
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:22,200
like I guess it's like right around when shirk

2168
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:24,200
showed up and like

2169
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:26,200
it was kind of becoming like a little too

2170
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:28,200
magical girly and then I think maybe

2171
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,200
he wanted to like throw it back in the other direction

2172
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,200
and just made like a lot of rapes happen

2173
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:34,200
like in a row and it was like

2174
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,200
this has gotten exponentially

2175
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,200
rapier

2176
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:40,200
um yeah

2177
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:42,200
there's a lot of rape in berserk

2178
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,200
I remember reading this like

2179
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:46,200
one of my first exposures to berserk was this like

2180
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,200
4chan copypasta was just

2181
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,200
this guy going on a rant about how he was like

2182
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,200
every single fucking

2183
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:54,200
chapter I see some new kind of dick

2184
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:56,200
it's like mirage just sits around dreaming up

2185
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,200
new kinds of demon dicks I've seen every

2186
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,200
kind of dick imaginable raping

2187
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,200
every kind of human imaginable

2188
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,200
and I was like yeah that's

2189
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,200
that's pretty accurate that's what berserk

2190
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,200
is

2191
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:10,200
myriad colors phantom dicks

2192
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,200
uh

2193
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,200
so I guess that's

2194
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:18,200
all the animes

2195
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:20,200
what's your favorite anime

2196
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:22,200
what's the best one I guess one piece

2197
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,200
well I don't know what yeah the manga

2198
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,200
the manga is the best one ever I don't know about the anime

2199
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:30,200
I mean I watched like

2200
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:32,200
I don't know how many episodes there are

2201
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:34,200
I guess 300 I watched

2202
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:36,200
400 I don't know a lot of

2203
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:38,200
episodes of that anime because I didn't know

2204
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:40,200
like anime could be more than just

2205
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:42,200
what that show was which was kind of

2206
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:44,200
limited like it it looked like

2207
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,200
the manga but it wasn't as

2208
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,200
well produced as

2209
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,200
other anime that I've seen since

2210
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:52,200
um so I don't know whether I'd like

2211
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:54,200
that the most but I think

2212
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:58,200
it's either Gurren Lagann

2213
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,200
plus the movie the second

2214
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,200
movie with the giant guy

2215
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:04,200
giant Kamina space Kamina

2216
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,200
that's important you need that I don't know

2217
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,200
why that didn't know why that wasn't wasn't

2218
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,200
in the show because I kept saying I kept

2219
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:12,200
seeing that that scene

2220
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,200
of him you know

2221
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,200
be a huge Kamina and he wasn't

2222
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,200
in the show and I was like oh what

2223
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:20,200
happened um

2224
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,200
so it's either that or

2225
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,200
uh K-On I think

2226
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:26,200
yeah

2227
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,200
I'm not I'm not sure probably

2228
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,200
both together

2229
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,200
I gotta talk about this in this podcast

2230
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:34,200
because I don't know when else I'd get the opportunity

2231
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,200
the

2232
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:38,200
like the specific

2233
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,200
instance that caused me to rewatch

2234
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,200
K-On and write about it and actually

2235
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,200
I think this instance is what made K-On

2236
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:46,200
into my number one favorite anime and it's all

2237
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,200
because of you because

2238
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,200
of Otacon

2239
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,200
2014 because

2240
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:54,200
I mean not Otacon uh BronyCon

2241
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,200
2014 because that's the year you didn't get to go

2242
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,200
and you went to

2243
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:00,200
uh that camp

2244
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:02,200
thing you were talking about where you take care of disabled kids

2245
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:04,200
um

2246
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,200
and there's a

2247
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:08,200
two-part episode of K-On

2248
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:10,200
in season two it's episodes four and five

2249
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:12,200
where in episode four

2250
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,200
um all the older girls

2251
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,200
go on this trip to

2252
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,200
oh what was it Kyoto I think

2253
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,200
yeah um

2254
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:22,200
yeah they go on a trip to Kyoto and they all hang out

2255
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:24,200
and like

2256
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,200
you know they're telling all these stories to each other

2257
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,200
and like they come up with these

2258
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,200
memes with within themselves

2259
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,200
like where they all just up at night saying skull

2260
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,200
and lycopene

2261
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:36,200
for some reason and uh

2262
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,200
it's just it's

2263
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,200
it's really adorable but like uh

2264
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Azusa the youngest member

2265
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,200
didn't get to go um

2266
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:46,200
cause she was in you know another grade

2267
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,200
so then in the next episode we see what

2268
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:50,200
she was doing like at home

2269
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,200
with the with her other two friends

2270
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,200
and like you know like she keeps getting

2271
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,200
texts from the other girls and she's like

2272
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:58,200
totally jealous that she didn't get to go

2273
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,200
but uh you know she has her own little adventure

2274
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,200
and like

2275
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,200
the parallel between the

2276
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:06,200
horseshoe crew and and you

2277
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:08,200
not getting to go and you being the youngest

2278
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:10,200
member and you having to do something else

2279
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,200
it was like spot on

2280
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,200
how accurate it was you know

2281
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:16,200
we came back with our memes are

2282
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:18,200
the lord of shit mountain meme

2283
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:20,200
that we were all saying and stuff and

2284
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:22,200
and then I literally

2285
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:24,200
just thinking about this like once I

2286
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,200
realized cause I had already been

2287
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,200
thinking that our adventure

2288
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,200
reminded me of episode four like when we

2289
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,200
were up all night like saying these things and giggling

2290
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:34,200
I was like oh this is just like that scene from K-On

2291
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,200
and then once I realized

2292
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:38,200
that you were Azunyan I remember like screaming

2293
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:40,200
in the chat about it like oh my god

2294
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:42,200
Gibbons Azunyan and

2295
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:44,200
I just started fucking crying

2296
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:46,200
like I just started losing my shit

2297
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,200
all over the place over the fact

2298
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,200
that I had just lived out a

2299
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,200
K-On arc and like

2300
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,200
that legitimately was like such a powerful

2301
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,200
feeling that I was like K-On might be

2302
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:58,200
the best anime ever

2303
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,200
and then I watched it again

2304
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:02,200
and I cried during those episodes

2305
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,200
just thinking about it like I actually

2306
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,200
cried a lot at the like

2307
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:08,200
I was a little like

2308
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,200
I think I was on painkillers at the time cause

2309
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:12,200
I had broken my foot I don't know if that made me

2310
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:14,200
more emotional but I like consistently

2311
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,200
kept crying while watching K-On

2312
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,200
and thinking about you

2313
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:20,200
and how you were Azunyan and I kept

2314
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,200
messaging you like as I was watching the show I was like

2315
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:24,200
everything about Azunyan is what you are

2316
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,200
she's into Dad Rock

2317
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:28,200
her parents are musicians

2318
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,200
yeah I was gonna say like

2319
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:32,200
she made a reference to Jimi Hendrix

2320
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,200
and no she made a difference

2321
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,200
a reference to Jimi Page which is the lead

2322
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:38,200
guitarist of Led Zipna it was like

2323
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:40,200
whoa nobody does that everybody talks about Hendrix

2324
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:42,200
nobody talks about Page she's the coolest

2325
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,200
I like her so yeah

2326
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:46,200
even on that level

2327
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:48,200
as a character I identify

2328
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,200
with her more than the others

2329
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,200
I had said out that I thought

2330
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:54,200
um

2331
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,200
Jesse

2332
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,200
I think I said Jesse was Yui

2333
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,200
and that cause the way he

2334
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:02,200
acted around you was like Yui and Azunyan

2335
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:04,200
where Jesse always like acted

2336
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:06,200
very like protective of you and like you were

2337
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:08,200
his little brother and like you're his favorite

2338
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:10,200
kind of thing

2339
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:12,200
and it just really reminded me of Yui and Azusa

2340
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,200
and like Nate is obviously

2341
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:16,200
fuckin

2342
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,200
Ritsu and Ben would be

2343
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:20,200
Mio but that's not really a good

2344
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:22,200
comparison and then I think I had myself

2345
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:24,200
as Sumugi

2346
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:26,200
and Tom

2347
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:28,200
as Notoka

2348
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:30,200
and I guess now we have Jeff so he has to be

2349
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,200
like

2350
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,200
Jun-chan I guess

2351
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,200
I don't know

2352
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:38,200
I don't know who he would be I guess uh

2353
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:40,200
Mage can be Yui

2354
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:42,200
why not I just

2355
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:44,200
I had to go through all of them but yeah

2356
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,200
it was just really striking

2357
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:48,200
and I kept that was what got you to watch

2358
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,200
Kaon I think was that I kept saying

2359
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,200
uh like I kept saying

2360
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,200
you're just like Azusa and then you decided

2361
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,200
to watch it on that basis and then we

2362
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,200
kind of like finished it up around the

2363
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:00,200
same time and uh

2364
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:02,200
and you got to the movie which was in London and it was

2365
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:04,200
like literally your hometown

2366
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,200
yeah the place

2367
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:08,200
where they play on the big grass thing

2368
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:10,200
is actually a place that I know

2369
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,200
so there was a few places like that

2370
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,200
but I just like oh I know that I know

2371
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,200
that sign I know that corner they obviously

2372
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,200
went to London to get reference

2373
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:20,200
images which is really cool

2374
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:22,200
yeah it's a perfect show

2375
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:24,200
it's a

2376
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:26,200
it's a 10 out of 10

2377
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:28,200
it's the best anime ever

2378
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:30,200
makes me uh makes my

2379
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,200
makes my pee pee go poo poo

2380
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:34,200
I guess

2381
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,200
that's a good thing

2382
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,200
yeah

2383
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,200
that's a good question hippo

2384
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,200
what makes your pee pee go poo poo

2385
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:48,200
uh

2386
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:50,200
a titi

2387
02:12:58,200 --> 02:13:00,200
that's a perfect answer

2388
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,200
tell me about your waifus

2389
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:06,200
oh yeah

2390
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,200
um

2391
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:10,200
I talked about this a bit in the waifus cast I think

2392
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,200
I can't remember

2393
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,200
I have a bunch

2394
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,200
yeah that's like the second one

2395
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,200
yeah

2396
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:20,200
um there's a vriska

2397
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:22,200
who is my number one I think

2398
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,200
yeah vriska from homestuck

2399
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:26,200
diamond tiara from my little pony

2400
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,200
I try to collect one from each thing I like

2401
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,200
a lot um

2402
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,200
I think uh

2403
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:34,200
who else is there

2404
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:36,200
it's Marceline from Adventure Time

2405
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:38,200
uh

2406
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,200
uh and Undyne from

2407
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,200
Undyne from Undertale

2408
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:44,200
and Raven from Teen Titans

2409
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:46,200
you I think you

2410
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:48,200
you did mention at one point that I

2411
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:50,200
I tend towards gray girls

2412
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:52,200
and it just so happens that I did love

2413
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:54,200
Raven as well

2414
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,200
so yeah all of them are either like

2415
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:58,200
other than diamond tiara they are all

2416
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,200
literally gray skinned

2417
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:02,200
how the fuck does that happen

2418
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,200
that's like the oldest coincidence

2419
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:06,200
I mean they all like

2420
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,200
they'll have similarities in their

2421
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:10,200
personality that even if they weren't

2422
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:12,200
gray you would understand why you liked

2423
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:14,200
all of them but the point

2424
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:16,200
stands that they are all gray skinned

2425
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:18,200
uh with the exception of

2426
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:20,200
the pink pony

2427
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:22,200
yeah who just so happens

2428
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:24,200
to have a gray skin

2429
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:26,200
counterpart that I'm not into

2430
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,200
as much

2431
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:30,200
a weird missed opportunity there

2432
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:34,200
but I guess the exception proves the rule

2433
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:36,200
yeah so my wife who's

2434
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,200
if you know those characters

2435
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,200
you can tell that they're all bitches

2436
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,200
they're all bitchy they're all

2437
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:44,200
powerful strong independent women

2438
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:46,200
they boss

2439
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:48,200
people around and I guess

2440
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:50,200
I like that in a woman I'm not sure

2441
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,200
oh my god have you seen

2442
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,200
panty and stocking with garter belt

2443
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,200
I know I didn't

2444
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:58,200
oh I think you would really like that show

2445
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:00,200
I think you will like all the girls in that

2446
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:02,200
show

2447
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,200
all bitchy powerful crazy women

2448
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:06,200
I can't

2449
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:08,200
think of which one will be your favorite because I don't

2450
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,200
I don't know if it'd be panty or stocking

2451
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:12,200
it'd probably be one of the demon girls

2452
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:14,200
scanty and knee socks

2453
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:16,200
because they're more of like the domineering

2454
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:18,200
type they both believe in like

2455
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,200
absolute order

2456
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:22,200
but they're like the bad guys

2457
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,200
because the main characters are all about anarchy

2458
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:26,200
but they're the good guys

2459
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:28,200
it's great you will love that fucking show

2460
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:30,200
okay I

2461
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,200
definitely guarantee it's the same director as

2462
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:34,200
girl in the gun and kill I kill

2463
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:36,200
and uh

2464
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:38,200
Davoo's a big fan Jesse hated it

2465
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:40,200
but he only watched the first two episodes and he watched

2466
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,200
them dubbed and he really

2467
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:44,200
hated that the girls

2468
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:46,200
swear constantly and it sounds

2469
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,200
terrible

2470
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:50,200
it does sound terrible dubbed I looked at it

2471
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:52,200
um well because of the swearing

2472
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,200
yeah that's the funny thing about it

2473
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,200
is that like people constantly say that

2474
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,200
you like that's one of those shows that everyone's like

2475
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:00,200
oh you have to watch it dubbed because the swearing

2476
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:02,200
is so funny and I'm like no the swearing

2477
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:04,200
sounds gross in English

2478
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,200
because what makes it funny in Japanese

2479
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,200
is that they use English

2480
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:10,200
swear words randomly

2481
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:12,200
in their sentences and it's really

2482
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:14,200
fucking hilarious because they'll say like

2483
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,200
oh do that

2484
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:18,200
you know and it's really fucking funny

2485
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:20,200
one of my favorite things in anime

2486
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:22,200
is Japanese voice actors

2487
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:24,200
saying English words

2488
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:26,200
yeah I just love that so much

2489
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:28,200
they do it constantly and it's mostly bitch

2490
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:30,200
they'll say

2491
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:32,200
bitch

2492
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,200
like what the fuck

2493
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,200
happens a lot

2494
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:38,200
it's great I find that way funnier

2495
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:40,200
than some like

2496
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,200
American girl just going what the fuck

2497
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,200
you fucking bitch

2498
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,200
and I'm just like oh come on

2499
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:48,200
that's tacky

2500
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,200
you know

2501
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,200
yeah

2502
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:54,200
I should watch that then that's one on the list

2503
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,200
yes it's

2504
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:58,200
pretty short so you could probably do it in like a day

2505
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:02,200
but it's got that

2506
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:04,200
old school cartoon

2507
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,200
episode setup where each episode is

2508
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:08,200
like two 15 minute parts

2509
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:10,200
that have like an opening title

2510
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,200
card type thing like Ed and Nettie used to

2511
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:14,200
have and stuff like that

2512
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,200
it's pretty cool

2513
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,200
people always talk about it's very influenced by

2514
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,200
western cartoons but not to the extent

2515
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:22,200
that people make it out like it is

2516
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,200
people make it out like that's all the show is

2517
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:26,200
is like a reference to western cartoons

2518
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:28,200
but it is it's definitely

2519
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:30,200
heavily influenced by them and it's

2520
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:32,200
a good

2521
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,200
yeah

2522
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:38,200
yeah I'm still here

2523
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,200
that's where you might have cut out again cause DeVoo

2524
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:42,200
joined in and I'm like oh no

2525
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,200
it's gonna be just like when Nate joined in

2526
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:46,200
it feels stable

2527
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:48,200
we can keep going

2528
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,200
we've been going strong for a good little while

2529
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:54,200
so

2530
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:56,200
you have made the remark

2531
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:58,200
that you think that you're not a good

2532
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:00,200
drawer

2533
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:02,200
yeah

2534
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:04,200
yeah I mean

2535
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,200
the draw costs

2536
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:08,200
both of them I'm ashamed of

2537
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:10,200
because the first one I was being like haha

2538
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:12,200
I'm bad but then

2539
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:14,200
they were all so good it was like

2540
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,200
why did I do that why didn't I try

2541
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,200
like even if I tried my best

2542
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:20,200
it wouldn't have been as good as them

2543
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,200
at least I would have looked not terrible bad

2544
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,200
and then the second one I thought

2545
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:26,200
I'll try really good but then everyone was

2546
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:28,200
like hilarious and interesting

2547
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:30,200
and I was like damn

2548
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:32,200
I should have been hilarious and interesting for this one

2549
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:34,200
I just fucked up both times

2550
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,200
so people don't know

2551
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:38,200
unless they see my deviant art

2552
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:40,200
what I'm good at drawing at

2553
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:42,200
I don't know I'm not

2554
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:44,200
like I used to be really good

2555
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:46,200
I mean I could draw like a

2556
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,200
really good life drawing of a person

2557
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:50,200
I have lots of good

2558
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:52,200
drawings that I've done

2559
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:54,200
but when it comes to a tablet

2560
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:56,200
I'm generally just sort of

2561
02:18:56,200 --> 02:18:58,200
fucking I'm bad I'm worse

2562
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,200
I gotta learn

2563
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,200
how to use a tablet better

2564
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:04,200
even though I've made three animated films with it

2565
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,200
but you said

2566
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:08,200
that's why you like animation because it hides

2567
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:10,200
how bad you are at drawing

2568
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,200
yeah yeah you can

2569
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:14,200
you can draw some like

2570
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:16,200
my first film the fish at the door one

2571
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,200
the reason all the frames wobble

2572
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:20,200
so much is because I drew the first guy

2573
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,200
I was like

2574
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,200
it doesn't look right

2575
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,200
it doesn't look good I can't keep him on

2576
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,200
screen for more than one second

2577
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:30,200
but I gotta so I just drew the same frame

2578
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:32,200
over again and made it loop

2579
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:34,200
so that it was deliberately wobbly

2580
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,200
and then it was cool

2581
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:38,200
yeah it was adorable

2582
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:40,200
yeah people liked it

2583
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:42,200
yeah yeah

2584
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,200
yeah yeah

2585
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:46,200
huge

2586
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:48,200
I don't know why I keep

2587
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:50,200
lapsing into gudra these days

2588
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:52,200
I think a gudra bit me

2589
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,200
and I've just been like

2590
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:56,200
like wear gudraing

2591
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:58,200
got a weird gooey rash on your back

2592
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,200
yeah oh god

2593
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,200
oh gudra

2594
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,200
that's disgusting

2595
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:08,200
oh my god it's like a

2596
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:10,200
ren and stimpy image in my head now

2597
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:12,200
oh no

2598
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:16,200
uh

2599
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:18,200
I always liked your art style

2600
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:20,200
I still think your drawings are good

2601
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:22,200
I liked your gudra

2602
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:24,200
I liked the face on it

2603
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:26,200
I described it as a gormless expression

2604
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:28,200
I think

2605
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:30,200
yeah I mean I don't think

2606
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:32,200
I'm bad at drawing I just

2607
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:34,200
like in comparison to people

2608
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:36,200
like Ben even

2609
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:38,200
people like Ben I mean Tom and major

2610
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:40,200
like they can draw like pro

2611
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:42,200
fashionals and Ben's like really

2612
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:44,200
got a unique style that's very

2613
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:46,200
Ben and it works and it's

2614
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,200
cool and then I've got mine which is

2615
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:50,200
like it's a style

2616
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:52,200
but it's very easily

2617
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,200
replicatable I think

2618
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:56,200
because it's simple I don't know I could

2619
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:58,200
tell your style immediately when I see it

2620
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:00,200
like every time you ever drew

2621
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:02,200
like a pony character

2622
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,200
I would know that you had drawn it

2623
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:06,200
oh well yeah now that you say that I guess

2624
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:08,200
that is true my pony Osea was

2625
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:10,200
very different from everyone else's

2626
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:12,200
because I drew it myself

2627
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:14,200
and it was good

2628
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:16,200
both you and Ben had that

2629
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:18,200
like that kind of style where like

2630
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:20,200
because me and Jesse got like you've drawn

2631
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:22,200
both mine and Jesse's

2632
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:24,200
ponies I think in your style

2633
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:26,200
for like use in different

2634
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,200
things and

2635
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,200
I draw your guy

2636
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,200
once for the analysis

2637
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,200
compilation and then I made a bunch

2638
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,200
of poses for Jesse for a horseshoe

2639
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,200
finale when he wanted to act

2640
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:40,200
like me which was cool

2641
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,200
yeah

2642
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,200
yeah

2643
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:46,200
I had to stop myself before I

2644
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:48,200
go full goo

2645
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:50,200
you

2646
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:52,200
you're trying

2647
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:54,200
your main career goal

2648
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:56,200
is to be a YouTuber right like that's the

2649
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:58,200
one you want to pursue the most

2650
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,200
yeah

2651
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:02,200
I

2652
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:04,200
I mean I'm

2653
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:06,200
it's kind of weird because like the

2654
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:08,200
communities I have I could become

2655
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:10,200
an actual animator or

2656
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:12,200
a writer or a musician if I just

2657
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:14,200
went in one direction or the other

2658
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:16,200
I was already a pretty good musician by the time

2659
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,200
I was considering going for an animation

2660
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:20,200
degree

2661
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:22,200
and it was like what do I do do I do

2662
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:24,200
music do I go on the road or become

2663
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:26,200
a band guy or do I do animation and do

2664
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,200
all that I don't know whether I like

2665
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:30,200
animation so I had to make a decision

2666
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:32,200
then I chose animation and now

2667
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:34,200
after doing three years of it I'm not sure

2668
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:36,200
I would like to do that for my entire life although

2669
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:38,200
I could I just and then

2670
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:40,200
YouTube became a possibility

2671
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:42,200
that I was getting better at and I made

2672
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:44,200
a few videos and they were good and I really like

2673
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:46,200
them and I think I could be better I could be

2674
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,200
one of those 900k

2675
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:50,200
sub weirdos

2676
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:52,200
in the gaming community

2677
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:54,200
like if I try this like

2678
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:56,200
I have opportunities and there's too

2679
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:58,200
many good ones to pick and it's kind of hard

2680
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:00,200
to decide but I guess YouTube right

2681
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:02,200
now I'm doing YouTube

2682
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:04,200
while I wait for

2683
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:06,200
potential other things

2684
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:08,200
but I want YouTube to

2685
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:10,200
if it if while I'm

2686
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:12,200
waiting to do other things my YouTube grows

2687
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:14,200
to a point where I can say okay

2688
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:16,200
that's what I'm gonna do and that's what

2689
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,200
I'll do

2690
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:20,200
well I think what's great

2691
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,200
about YouTube is that it's

2692
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,200
pretty easy to imagine how

2693
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:26,200
all of those talents can be used

2694
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:28,200
in YouTube videos

2695
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:30,200
like you know you can

2696
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,200
pretty easily like incorporate

2697
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:34,200
animations and music and all that

2698
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:36,200
into a video we all just

2699
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:38,200
saw I mean Nate didn't make

2700
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:40,200
the music itself but what he did with

2701
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:42,200
that Kenny Logan song and his

2702
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:44,200
new video was like yeah we should

2703
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:46,200
be this is a good idea like

2704
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:48,200
this is a good way to make a funny YouTube

2705
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,200
video is to like

2706
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:52,200
if you can sing then sing in a

2707
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:54,200
video you know if you can play guitar

2708
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:56,200
find a way to get guitar in there

2709
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:58,200
or like Yotam Perrell where

2710
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:00,200
he does like his animations

2711
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:02,200
with songs and shit and

2712
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:04,200
and then just makes like whole albums out

2713
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:06,200
of nowhere really the

2714
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:08,200
YouTube is most likely

2715
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:10,200
the best

2716
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:12,200
like out of the best decision

2717
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,200
to go for but

2718
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:16,200
it's been slow so I don't know I just

2719
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:18,200
I just need to be making more videos

2720
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:20,200
more quickly and putting

2721
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:22,200
them on the internet yeah I think

2722
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
that's like the the big fear

2723
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:26,200
that I have like with or not fear

2724
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:28,200
so much is like what I need to see with you

2725
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:30,200
and Nate is like

2726
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,200
we all kind of are

2727
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,200
under this mindset of like we're never

2728
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:36,200
gonna know for sure if you would be

2729
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:38,200
successful until you get fast

2730
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:40,200
because like if you

2731
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
do put out like 30 videos

2732
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,200
in a year and

2733
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:46,200
you still don't get big

2734
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:48,200
then it'll be like okay maybe

2735
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:50,200
maybe it's not happening you know

2736
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:52,200
but what it's only like two videos

2737
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,200
a year like you did in the last year

2738
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:56,200
that it's like well we can't really say

2739
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:58,200
for sure until you know

2740
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:00,200
we get a better read on the same with Nate

2741
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:02,200
where it's like his channel is growing really slow

2742
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:04,200
because he's putting out videos

2743
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:06,200
really slow

2744
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,200
and like

2745
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:10,200
he's got more subs than me though that fuck

2746
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,200
yeah

2747
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:14,200
but then you've got like Jesse over there who's

2748
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:16,200
puts out videos constantly and doesn't grow

2749
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,200
but he has a huge

2750
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:20,200
Patreon so like you know maybe

2751
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:22,200
that maybe you guys will end up like that like it's really

2752
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:24,200
hard to say but until you have enough

2753
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:26,200
videos I don't think any

2754
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:28,200
I just don't think we can judge it you know

2755
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:30,200
that's why I'm trying to do

2756
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:32,200
two per month until the end of the year to see what happens

2757
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:34,200
yeah

2758
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,200
I really gotta buckle down

2759
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:38,200
yeah I'm looking forward to it

2760
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:40,200
because

2761
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:42,200
number one thing I want

2762
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:44,200
in the world is

2763
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:46,200
more best guy ever more

2764
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:48,200
hypocrite

2765
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:50,200
and more of my Japanese anime

2766
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:52,200
as opposed to

2767
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:54,200
more edless chess blogs

2768
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:56,200
in blue glows

2769
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:58,200
not that I don't enjoy those

2770
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:00,200
but god damn it

2771
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:02,200
I need to see everybody on top

2772
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:04,200
of the world

2773
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:06,200
not just me and Jeff

2774
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:08,200
Jeff with his fucking

2775
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:10,200
like 10 avenues of income

2776
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:12,200
that he has now that son of a bitch

2777
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:16,200
fucking Jeff

2778
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:18,200
who is he

2779
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:20,200
I don't know I can

2780
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:22,200
I don't know him

2781
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,200
we talked once about

2782
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:26,200
about playing Game Boy Advance in bed

2783
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:28,200
and that's it

2784
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:30,200
that's true you haven't really talked to him

2785
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:32,200
much at all

2786
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:34,200
he makes too much money

2787
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,200
and therefore he's

2788
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:38,200
piece of shit

2789
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:44,200
who are your favorite YouTubers

2790
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,200
currently and of all time

2791
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,200
currently

2792
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:56,200
I don't know I really

2793
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:58,200
I'm only really watching the

2794
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,200
procrastinators plus

2795
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:02,200
the Sleepycast

2796
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,200
and

2797
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:06,200
that Hosto and Guy Creparion

2798
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:08,200
and Creparion's fun

2799
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:10,200
but he's not like a really great YouTuber

2800
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,200
right

2801
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:14,200
yeah I don't know

2802
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:16,200
I forget all of the ones that I like

2803
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,200
all of the ones

2804
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:20,200
I know you like

2805
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:22,200
yeah go ahead

2806
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:24,200
you said Yotam Peril

2807
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:26,200
is a girl animator

2808
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:28,200
yeah

2809
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:30,200
he's cool I like his stuff I like

2810
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:32,200
Hot Diggity Demon as well

2811
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:34,200
really great animations like

2812
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:36,200
ridiculously good for YouTube

2813
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,200
he doesn't get paid enough

2814
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:40,200
he puts way too much work

2815
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:42,200
into his animations

2816
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:44,200
they come out very

2817
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:46,200
very rarely and I often

2818
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,200
feel like

2819
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:50,200
the quality of the writing

2820
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:52,200
does not deserve the level of

2821
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:54,200
animation he puts into them

2822
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:56,200
I don't often find them that funny

2823
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,200
I'm just like blown away

2824
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:00,200
by how much effort he put into something

2825
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:02,200
that is sometimes just weird

2826
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,200
not even really funny

2827
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:06,200
I guess

2828
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:08,200
you commissioned an art piece from him

2829
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:10,200
of Riska

2830
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,200
I did he was doing commissions

2831
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,200
and he never does those

2832
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:16,200
so I paid him

2833
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:18,200
a bunch of money

2834
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:20,200
for Riska with a hippo

2835
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,200
with a little hat

2836
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:24,200
and that's cute and I love it

2837
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:26,200
he's

2838
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:28,200
I think it's just his art style and his animation skill

2839
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:30,200
that I really like so much

2840
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:32,200
um

2841
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:34,200
in terms of favorite you oh

2842
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:36,200
ABGM is probably my favorite YouTuber

2843
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:38,200
because

2844
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:40,200
he's got such a great

2845
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:42,200
background

2846
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,200
he's really charming and I love him

2847
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:46,200
and he's still not shit

2848
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,200
yeah

2849
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:50,200
there was a portion

2850
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:52,200
of ABGM

2851
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:54,200
in episodes during which he was

2852
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:56,200
filming his movie

2853
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:58,200
that were sort of

2854
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,200
I don't know but then afterwards

2855
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:02,200
there was only like four or five of those

2856
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:04,200
that were just sort of okay

2857
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:06,200
but they were never bad

2858
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:08,200
they always were decent enough

2859
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:10,200
you know better than most

2860
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:12,200
it's amazing that he's

2861
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:14,200
gone so far I mean he's

2862
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:16,200
clearly a genius

2863
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:18,200
clearly got the

2864
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,200
power

2865
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:22,200
I know you used to be a big

2866
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:24,200
total biscuit fan right

2867
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:26,200
oh yeah I like total biscuit

2868
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:28,200
he doesn't really make

2869
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:30,200
he's never really made um

2870
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:32,200
single videos that have like blown me away

2871
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:34,200
I just really respect him as like a

2872
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:36,200
journalist or not really a journalist

2873
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:38,200
but like a commentator

2874
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,200
like he has a lot of correct opinions

2875
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:42,200
about lots of issues about gaming

2876
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:44,200
news and stuff

2877
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:46,200
I always love his content patch

2878
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:48,200
I used to love listening to him

2879
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:50,200
on the podcast because that was fun

2880
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:52,200
but the podcast takes too long

2881
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:54,200
and it's not that fun

2882
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:56,200
not fun enough to waste like

2883
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:58,200
three hours every week

2884
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:00,200
right

2885
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:02,200
but I like him he's really good

2886
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:04,200
at the news thing

2887
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:06,200
you used to be a big

2888
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:08,200
Game Grumps fan right

2889
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:10,200
oh yeah

2890
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:12,200
yeah John Grumps is my favorite let's play

2891
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:14,200
series of all time

2892
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,200
I recently rewatched

2893
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:18,200
basically all of it

2894
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:20,200
which was kind of you know

2895
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:22,200
I tried to watch from the very beginning

2896
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,200
in order of playlists

2897
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:26,200
um

2898
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,200
and I got like

2899
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:30,200
I got quite close to the end

2900
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:32,200
I think I was like at Mario

2901
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:34,200
for something

2902
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:36,200
something that I didn't remember really

2903
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:38,200
watching the first time

2904
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:40,200
and then I got bored

2905
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:42,200
but yeah that's like

2906
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:44,200
a huge amount of my favorite comedy

2907
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:46,200
comes from John Era Grumps

2908
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,200
Dan Era Grumps is also great

2909
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:50,200
but it feels different and

2910
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:52,200
well you know actually now I think about it

2911
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:54,200
that's also got a huge amount of hilarious moments

2912
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:56,200
yeah

2913
02:30:56,200 --> 02:30:58,200
but we all kind of like Grumps is great

2914
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:00,200
there was like a huge

2915
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:02,200
mass exodus of TPC

2916
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:04,200
members from watching Game Grumps

2917
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:06,200
like at the start of this year

2918
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:08,200
yeah they just

2919
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:10,200
they were doing the fucking Mario Maker

2920
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:12,200
thing and they got

2921
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:14,200
they finished Bloodborne they did Mario Maker

2922
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:16,200
and some of the game

2923
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,200
that nobody cares about and they just kept doing

2924
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:20,200
Mario Maker and it was boring

2925
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:22,200
and we all gave up

2926
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:24,200
and quit and I don't think any of us

2927
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:26,200
have really gone back except to

2928
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,200
occasionally look at the weird celebrity guests

2929
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,200
that you've been getting

2930
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:32,200
like that what's the guy

2931
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:34,200
Stevo

2932
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:36,200
I ended up listening to that

2933
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:38,200
fucking Sanchez I don't want to get into that again

2934
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:40,200
my Digi Rose fans are fucking

2935
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:42,200
sick of hearing about that

2936
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:46,200
but yeah

2937
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:48,200
what happened I don't understand

2938
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:50,200
yes it's weird

2939
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:52,200
I mean

2940
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:54,200
so much of that early

2941
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:56,200
not early YouTube stuff but like

2942
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:58,200
I think it was mostly the pony era

2943
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:00,200
where

2944
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:02,200
John Trun was amazing and Game Grumps was also

2945
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:04,200
amazing and it was that really cool

2946
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:06,200
and we were all like

2947
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:08,200
you know that's why I used that banana

2948
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:10,200
the banana shoe song at the end of the

2949
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:12,200
brony con videos that I made

2950
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:14,200
it was like oh yeah that's sort of

2951
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:16,200
that's sort of a thing

2952
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:18,200
that's sort of a pony thing

2953
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:20,200
almost

2954
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:22,200
banana shoes it's great

2955
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,200
it's a classic

2956
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:26,200
it takes you back to a bygone era

2957
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:28,200
and really like

2958
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,200
it's like yeah

2959
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:32,200
times were once good

2960
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:36,200
John Trun used to be great

2961
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:38,200
Aaron used to be great

2962
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:40,200
hell that he wasn't in that song

2963
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:42,200
but Dan used to be great too

2964
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:44,200
now they're all washed up

2965
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:46,200
has been

2966
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:48,200
although did you see that new video that Barry

2967
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:50,200
made about Skyward Sword

2968
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:52,200
that was pretty good

2969
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:54,200
it's got a lot of that Barry

2970
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:56,200
almost funny humor but it

2971
02:32:56,200 --> 02:32:58,200
it works I liked it

2972
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:00,200
it was the best thing to come out of

2973
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:02,200
the Game Grumps all year probably

2974
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:04,200
yeah

2975
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:06,200
but the whole Game Grumps

2976
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:08,200
and John Trun being shit

2977
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,200
it's sort of

2978
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:12,200
changed the way I view

2979
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:14,200
YouTube and it's less about

2980
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:16,200
being a consumer of

2981
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:18,200
stuff I mean I still watch a lot of

2982
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:20,200
YouTube but like I feel less like

2983
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:22,200
a consumer on YouTube

2984
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:24,200
and more like a creator

2985
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:26,200
where I'm probably the best guy I know

2986
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:28,200
at what I do

2987
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:30,200
aside from James Rolfe

2988
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:32,200
I would definitely say that

2989
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:34,200
it seems like for you and Nate

2990
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:36,200
especially since you were both such big

2991
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:38,200
John Trun fans like

2992
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:40,200
him turning to shit in some ways

2993
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:42,200
did more good than harm

2994
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:44,200
because it like made it so there were shoes

2995
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:46,200
that everyone kind of wanted to fill

2996
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:48,200
you know

2997
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:50,200
John Trun sucks now that means we can

2998
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:52,200
we can now be

2999
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:54,200
the new one you know like

3000
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:56,200
he needs to be replaced we need to kick him

3001
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:58,200
off his throne let's get

3002
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:00,200
up there

3003
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:02,200
would you say that it inspired you

3004
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:04,200
in that way

3005
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:06,200
I'm not sure whether it would

3006
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:08,200
like it was a direct inspiration I think

3007
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:10,200
it was just sad but I felt good about

3008
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,200
myself in general

3009
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:14,200
at the same time I don't know whether it's directly

3010
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:16,200
related but I feel better

3011
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:18,200
about my own videos

3012
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:20,200
in general because I'm like yeah

3013
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:22,200
because people like you

3014
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,200
and Victor have said you know I'm better

3015
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:26,200
than John Trun now and I'm like

3016
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:28,200
you know what you're right I am

3017
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:30,200
I am better than he is

3018
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:32,200
and that's weird and cool

3019
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:34,200
oh John

3020
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,200
you bastard what happened

3021
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:38,200
you're so beautiful

3022
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:40,200
for a time

3023
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:42,200
really Ethan

3024
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:44,200
is like the new funny guy

3025
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:46,200
I watch H3H3

3026
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:48,200
I forgot to mention him

3027
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:50,200
I uh

3028
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:52,200
I watch all the H3H3

3029
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:54,200
and Ethan and Ela videos but they're never like

3030
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:56,200
great

3031
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:58,200
you know it's usually just like

3032
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:00,200
yeah alright that was pleasant

3033
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:02,200
every once in a while you get one that's like

3034
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:04,200
memorable but you know

3035
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:06,200
I think the stuff he does in public

3036
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:08,200
where he's being a weirdo is like

3037
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:10,200
yeah

3038
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:12,200
it's like

3039
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:14,200
for the fact that the jokes aren't that great

3040
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:16,200
it's just like the spectacle of him

3041
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:18,200
making an ass of himself in public

3042
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:20,200
is like whoa cool

3043
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:22,200
yeah and he does it in a

3044
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:24,200
not douche baggy way

3045
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:26,200
whereas some I think a lot of those

3046
02:35:26,200 --> 02:35:28,200
people like you know

3047
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:30,200
because he's it's funny because he's so

3048
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:32,200
close to being the stuff he makes

3049
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:34,200
fun of like the prank bros

3050
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:36,200
and everything but it's just like the important

3051
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:38,200
difference is that he's just not an ass

3052
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:40,200
while doing it you know

3053
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,200
those people are those people are like

3054
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:44,200
damaging and

3055
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:46,200
scary and why are they out

3056
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:48,200
in public doing that whereas with Ethan

3057
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:50,200
he's always the butt of the joke

3058
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:52,200
yeah

3059
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:54,200
I mean I think he was saying

3060
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:56,200
you're done with filthy frank or someone

3061
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:58,200
was done with filthy frank maybe Jesse

3062
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:00,200
because he was doing all those things

3063
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:02,200
both me and Jesse

3064
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:04,200
like he was doing these things that are

3065
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:06,200
just as bad as all the prank bro things

3066
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:08,200
because he's just being a weirdo at people

3067
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:10,200
and he's not making any attempt

3068
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:12,200
to make it like charming it's just

3069
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:14,200
as weird as possible

3070
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:16,200
I'm like yeah that like when he's had

3071
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:18,200
that ravioli in his pocket

3072
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:20,200
I was that I forget what that was

3073
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:22,200
I don't know it was weird

3074
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,200
he's going around to people with it

3075
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:26,200
yeah

3076
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:28,200
well

3077
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,200
like I have a lot of like the

3078
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,200
reason I followed filthy frank for a long

3079
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:34,200
time is just I have a lot of respect for

3080
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:36,200
like the physical comedy

3081
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:38,200
like when like I mean with Ethan

3082
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:40,200
too that it's that he'll

3083
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:42,200
like when he did the fucking boy band thing

3084
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:44,200
and it's like he really changed

3085
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:46,200
his whole fucking appearance just for this

3086
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,200
video you know you know like shave

3087
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:50,200
off his head and fucking spray paint

3088
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,200
himself with tanning spray and just

3089
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:54,200
become this monster for often

3090
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:56,200
like days

3091
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:58,200
or weeks on end you know

3092
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:00,200
like going through this physical transformation

3093
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:02,200
for the comedy and I really appreciate

3094
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:04,200
that and like filthy frank will do

3095
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:06,200
stuff like there's one video where he

3096
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,200
like just like

3097
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:10,200
falls out of a car door while it's

3098
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:12,200
moving it just like

3099
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:14,200
like rolls on the pavement

3100
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:16,200
it was just like oh my god that looked

3101
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:18,200
painful as shit

3102
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:20,200
but I do think that filthy frank

3103
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:22,200
stuff has gotten to the point where like

3104
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:24,200
it's

3105
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:26,200
it's just kind of crass and I mean I know

3106
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,200
that's the point but it's

3107
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:30,200
it's not quite tongue in cheek enough

3108
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:32,200
for me to think that he's not just

3109
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:34,200
being a dick you know

3110
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:36,200
and he's not really being a funny

3111
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:38,200
dick nest like there's way I think it

3112
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:40,200
would be possible to just be a total

3113
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:42,200
asshole and for that to also be hilarious

3114
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:44,200
if it was so over the top

3115
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:46,200
but it's not it's like he's afraid

3116
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:48,200
of crossing that line and so he doesn't

3117
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:50,200
quite become like a total dick

3118
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:52,200
that would be funny to watch you know

3119
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:54,200
voyeuristically

3120
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:58,200
but uh

3121
02:37:58,200 --> 02:38:00,200
that's just what I thought of off the top

3122
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,200
of my head

3123
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:04,200
that could all be

3124
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:06,200
totally unsubstantiated

3125
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:08,200
and uh just

3126
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:10,200
me wanting to not like filthy frank

3127
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:12,200
I

3128
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:14,200
hate the whole

3129
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:16,200
circle jerk between Frank, John

3130
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:18,200
Trott and Ethan I just

3131
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:20,200
I'm not impressed by it and now

3132
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:22,200
potentially donkey as well

3133
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:24,200
yeah donkey seems to be like

3134
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:26,200
on the fringes of it

3135
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:28,200
just because it's I mean we

3136
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:30,200
don't circle jerk a lot but

3137
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:32,200
but all of our content

3138
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:34,200
is good and we don't circle

3139
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:36,200
jerk any like what bothers me about

3140
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:38,200
it is that like they're all

3141
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:40,200
putting each other in their main videos

3142
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:42,200
just to have them there

3143
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:44,200
yeah somewhere else like that it'll be

3144
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:46,200
like they're watching a John Trott video

3145
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:48,200
then suddenly Ethan's there and he's not there

3146
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:50,200
to like serve I mean it was funny in the

3147
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:52,200
Kool-Aid Man one but like

3148
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:54,200
when they went to that like karate dojo

3149
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:56,200
it was like why these two why is

3150
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:58,200
this happening this is just

3151
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:00,200
it's just for the sake of having them both on screen

3152
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:02,200
in the same video you know

3153
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:04,200
I don't think it enhanced

3154
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:06,200
anything to have them both there which is like

3155
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:08,200
all of us TPC members have been

3156
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:10,200
since the pony days pretty strict

3157
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:12,200
about not doing frivolous

3158
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:14,200
collaborations it went

3159
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:16,200
pretty poorly when me and you did it

3160
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:18,200
yeah I was gonna say

3161
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:20,200
we I tried

3162
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:22,200
to make it it was weird as well because

3163
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:24,200
we weren't even we

3164
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:26,200
hadn't really talked even that much

3165
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:28,200
right but I was I asked

3166
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:30,200
you for a color I can't remember why we

3167
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:32,200
did it but we did it

3168
02:39:32,200 --> 02:39:34,200
I came to you about it because

3169
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:36,200
oh yeah that's why I didn't want to talk

3170
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:38,200
like oh my god it's didgy

3171
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:40,200
right it was just that I didn't want

3172
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:42,200
to cover the episode myself because I

3173
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:44,200
that was at the point in season

3174
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:46,200
four where I was like doing weird shit

3175
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,200
and I was busy with other stuff and I

3176
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:50,200
was just like this episode fucking blows

3177
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:52,200
and I don't want to talk about it so I'll just

3178
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:54,200
jump in on somebody else's

3179
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:56,200
video and I'll jump in on you because

3180
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,200
you were one of the people I respected

3181
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:00,200
so you know I always had this

3182
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:02,200
mindset of like I wanted to collect

3183
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:04,200
the people who I like the most

3184
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,200
so like if I thought your videos

3185
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:08,200
were great then I wanted some way to

3186
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:10,200
associate us so that it would like you know

3187
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:12,200
help you out in a way

3188
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:14,200
so I was like yeah I'll be in a hippo

3189
02:40:14,200 --> 02:40:16,200
video and that'll draw more attention to

3190
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:18,200
hippo and I don't have to make a video about

3191
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,200
it and then it was we didn't

3192
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:22,200
put a lot of effort into making it like

3193
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:24,200
work it just kind of sucked

3194
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:28,200
like particularly the the collaborative

3195
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:30,200
bit of it was just like awkward and

3196
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:32,200
terrible

3197
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:34,200
probably my fault because I'm not funny

3198
02:40:36,200 --> 02:40:38,200
well I think we just didn't really try

3199
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:40,200
on the script like you wrote what you

3200
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,200
were going to say about the thing and then I wrote a sentence

3201
02:40:42,200 --> 02:40:44,200
and then that was it we didn't go over it

3202
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:46,200
again

3203
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:48,200
yeah I'm just really all I

3204
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:50,200
wanted to do was I wanted to avoid

3205
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:52,200
the the the classic

3206
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:54,200
that guy with the glasses whoa

3207
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:56,200
what are you doing here so

3208
02:40:56,200 --> 02:40:58,200
I just said oh you're here

3209
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,200
and then we talked

3210
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:02,200
but yeah it was it didn't make up for the

3211
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:04,200
fact that we didn't really have anything to do with each other

3212
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,200
in the video

3213
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:08,200
right I really want us to do

3214
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:10,200
more like the best

3215
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:12,200
I think best guy ever is monster musume

3216
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,200
is the best collaboration that we

3217
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:16,200
have ever done as a group

3218
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,200
like it was so because that's

3219
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:20,200
the only way to like he integrated all

3220
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:22,200
of us but it didn't matter that it was

3221
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:24,200
us it just mattered that it was

3222
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:26,200
some guy doing something

3223
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:28,200
weird with a monster character

3224
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:30,200
you know like

3225
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:32,200
it could have been anybody really

3226
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:34,200
so it wasn't about like oh hey

3227
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:36,200
my friends are all in the video it was

3228
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:38,200
like that was a bonus to the fact that it also

3229
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:40,200
made sense in the context of the video

3230
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:42,200
and that's what I want collabs to be

3231
02:41:42,200 --> 02:41:44,200
I don't I don't want to just put Jesse

3232
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:46,200
in the video because he's Jesse it has to

3233
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:48,200
be that he serves a function

3234
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:50,200
you know

3235
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:52,200
yeah

3236
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:54,200
that was that one other

3237
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:56,200
collab thing where you asked me and Jesse

3238
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:58,200
just to do to do some like

3239
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:00,200
yeah at the end of your video and that one went

3240
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:02,200
well because it was

3241
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:04,200
that it was the leap of faith

3242
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:06,200
video

3243
02:42:06,200 --> 02:42:08,200
and it's like 15 minutes long and it's a part

3244
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:10,200
basically the script was really

3245
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:12,200
depressing and I was

3246
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:14,200
worried that it was like too

3247
02:42:14,200 --> 02:42:16,200
depressing and edgy sounding

3248
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:18,200
so I was like what if

3249
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:20,200
I like drew attention to this fact

3250
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:22,200
by having jokes in there but

3251
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:24,200
the joke is that like I tell you guys

3252
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:26,200
to lighten up the mood and you make nothing

3253
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:28,200
but cancer jokes

3254
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:30,200
in a video where I was talking

3255
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:32,200
about my mom having had cancer

3256
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:34,200
I think like I think I bring that up in

3257
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:36,200
the video so it was like

3258
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:38,200
you know

3259
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:40,200
like no one could say oh you can't

3260
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:42,200
cancer jokes because like I just talked about

3261
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:44,200
like dealing with it like personally

3262
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:46,200
so

3263
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:48,200
the joke is I'm like give in tell a

3264
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:50,200
joke and you're like

3265
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,200
then you just like

3266
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:54,200
I fucked up I didn't

3267
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:56,200
do it

3268
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:58,200
it was great

3269
02:42:58,200 --> 02:43:00,200
yeah

3270
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:02,200
you should rewatch that

3271
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:04,200
sometime just for the ending bit because

3272
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:06,200
like both both of

3273
02:43:06,200 --> 02:43:08,200
you sent me like too much

3274
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:10,200
but it was all good

3275
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,200
so I put like a little bit of it

3276
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:14,200
in the middle and then I like left in

3277
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,200
all the other jokes you made at the end

3278
02:43:16,200 --> 02:43:18,200
and there's like two minutes of you just

3279
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:20,200
like rambling

3280
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:22,200
incoherently about clouds

3281
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:24,200
having silver lining but then you get

3282
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:26,200
like diseases from the silver

3283
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:28,200
or something like that

3284
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:30,200
it's classic

3285
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:32,200
everyone should go look it up

3286
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:34,200
you won't find it it's in a playlist somewhere

3287
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:36,200
on my channel

3288
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:38,200
on my channel

3289
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:40,200
my little pony episode

3290
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:42,200
yeah it's a good

3291
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:44,200
I watched it recently and I laughed

3292
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:46,200
a bunch

3293
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:48,200
and then I died

3294
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:50,200
I killed myself

3295
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:54,200
so

3296
02:43:54,200 --> 02:43:56,200
how do you feel about the whole pony

3297
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:58,200
era of videos

3298
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:00,200
and about the show itself like in retrospect

3299
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,200
well the way

3300
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:06,200
I mean I like it the pony era

3301
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:08,200
because it's how I started

3302
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:10,200
getting into youtube and making

3303
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:12,200
things frequently

3304
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:14,200
and getting better and that's sort of what

3305
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:16,200
allowed me to get the courage

3306
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:18,200
to begin hypocrite really

3307
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:20,200
was that I was making videos and people liked them

3308
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,200
and I was like whoa I could really

3309
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:24,200
do what I really want of video games

3310
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:26,200
um as for the

3311
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:28,200
show though I don't know

3312
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:30,200
I liked a few

3313
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:32,200
episodes it was the most recent

3314
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:34,200
season six is it six now

3315
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:36,200
yeah

3316
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:38,200
yeah I watched a few of those

3317
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:40,200
the first three were terrible

3318
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:42,200
and after that it's pretty great

3319
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:44,200
so I think I still like the show

3320
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:46,200
I'm just not too invested in

3321
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:48,200
anything to do with the fandom at all

3322
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:50,200
right

3323
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:52,200
I think we all kind of concluded that we

3324
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:54,200
didn't want to be involved with the fandom

3325
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:56,200
yeah I mean really

3326
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:58,200
there isn't much to the fandom anymore

3327
02:44:58,200 --> 02:45:00,200
it's just you know all the musicians

3328
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:02,200
I just sort of

3329
02:45:02,200 --> 02:45:04,200
tired of it all the artists

3330
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:06,200
I just sort of doing the same thing

3331
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:08,200
and the analysis crew is

3332
02:45:08,200 --> 02:45:10,200
they're all just in it for the money

3333
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:12,200
and the analysis people

3334
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:14,200
are fucking cancer so

3335
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:16,200
they are awful you had

3336
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:18,200
a lot of experience with those people

3337
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:20,200
like you were in that chat for a lot longer

3338
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:22,200
and you talked to them for longer

3339
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:24,200
the bro analysis

3340
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:26,200
Skype chat

3341
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:28,200
where I think

3342
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:30,200
were you even invited to that

3343
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:32,200
yeah I was there at first

3344
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:34,200
and I left after like a month or so

3345
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:36,200
yeah

3346
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:38,200
it's weird because at the top I think Skype

3347
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:40,200
usually says who used to be in the thing

3348
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:42,200
and who's left or maybe no

3349
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:44,200
maybe it's just the people who just never

3350
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:46,200
talked yeah because I saw

3351
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:48,200
Tommy Oliver was in there but he never said anything

3352
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:52,200
but all those people in there

3353
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:54,200
I don't really

3354
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:56,200
want to get into it because it's sort of

3355
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:58,200
wrong a lot of stuff to say

3356
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:00,200
but just they suck

3357
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:02,200
most of them suck

3358
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:04,200
I'm glad to have left it

3359
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:06,200
there's a good reason that none of us

3360
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:08,200
are going to BronyCon again

3361
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:10,200
because uh

3362
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:12,200
I mean I don't know I like the con kind of

3363
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:14,200
but it is weird I would rather

3364
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:16,200
go to a different con

3365
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:18,200
if I could

3366
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:20,200
but instead you're going to a

3367
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:22,200
conference

3368
02:46:22,200 --> 02:46:24,200
in Virginia Beach Virginia

3369
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:26,200
I almost said my address

3370
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:28,200
for some reason

3371
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:30,200
yeah don't do that

3372
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:32,200
I almost went through my entire address

3373
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:34,200
and I was like wait a minute

3374
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:36,200
why am I doing that

3375
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:38,200
not that my address is probably hard to find

3376
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:40,200
or anything

3377
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:42,200
I do want to open a PO box soon

3378
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:44,200
so have you thought about

3379
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:46,200
expanding and doing videos

3380
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:48,200
about anything other than video games

3381
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:50,200
um

3382
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:52,200
perhaps

3383
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:54,200
I was thinking maybe

3384
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:56,200
I could try an analysis of an anime

3385
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:58,200
just so that you know

3386
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:00,200
because you always want one from people

3387
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:02,200
you want more anime analysis

3388
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:04,200
and I guess I could analyze

3389
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:06,200
one piece anime but I don't know

3390
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:08,200
I don't know

3391
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:10,200
there's nothing

3392
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:12,200
well yeah after Nate's done his

3393
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:14,200
but then you'd probably say everything

3394
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:16,200
I

3395
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:18,200
I could analyze movies really

3396
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:20,200
I just want to talk about stuff I like

3397
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:22,200
so if it just happens to be something that isn't a video game

3398
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:24,200
then I'll talk about it anyway

3399
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:26,200
it's a very nostalgia based channel

3400
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:28,200
I mean that's like

3401
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:30,200
theoretically

3402
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:32,200
my channel has never been

3403
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:34,200
an anime channel

3404
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:36,200
it's just that I only talk about anime

3405
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:38,200
like it's

3406
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:40,200
it's never been like

3407
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:42,200
this is just the only thing I care about

3408
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:44,200
because I've done like a couple

3409
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:46,200
video game videos in there and like a couple

3410
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:48,200
film analysis but it's like

3411
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:50,200
I don't care about anything other

3412
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:52,200
than anime so

3413
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:54,200
it's clear that your fans like

3414
02:47:54,200 --> 02:47:56,200
they know

3415
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:58,200
that you're smart enough to talk about things

3416
02:47:58,200 --> 02:48:00,200
like Dark Souls because everybody loved that video

3417
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:02,200
well that video

3418
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:04,200
I think that video hit it big

3419
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:06,200
outside of my main audience

3420
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:08,200
because it has a

3421
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:10,200
fuckload of comments and most of them are from people I don't recognize

3422
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:12,200
so I really think

3423
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:14,200
it just got big in like the gaming circle

3424
02:48:14,200 --> 02:48:16,200
and the Bloodborne fandom

3425
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:18,200
or Dark Souls fandom like as opposed to

3426
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:20,200
my main audience for the most part

3427
02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:22,200
I guess

3428
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:24,200
but uh

3429
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:26,200
yeah I'm definitely seen as an anime

3430
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:28,200
YouTuber I mean which is completely fair

3431
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:30,200
it's all I cover but like I it's never

3432
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:32,200
been technically an anime channel

3433
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:34,200
um

3434
02:48:34,200 --> 02:48:36,200
but Hippocrite so far

3435
02:48:36,200 --> 02:48:38,200
has been exclusively video games

3436
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:40,200
and I guess skeletons

3437
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:42,200
yeah

3438
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:46,200
what is it with you and skeletons

3439
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:48,200
what's the deal with that

3440
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:50,200
oh finish what I'm going to say first

3441
02:48:50,200 --> 02:48:52,200
I forgot what I was going to say

3442
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:54,200
and now I want to talk about skeletons

3443
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:56,200
skeletons are cool

3444
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:58,200
because

3445
02:48:58,200 --> 02:49:00,200
they don't need to say any words

3446
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:02,200
they just swing their sword I think I mentioned

3447
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:04,200
I actually didn't really go into much depth

3448
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:06,200
in the skeletons video

3449
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:08,200
but I love skeletons because of the

3450
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:10,200
cauldron skeletons which are really creepy

3451
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:12,200
and spooky and cool and dangerous

3452
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:14,200
and

3453
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:16,200
the skeletons from Dark Cloud

3454
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:18,200
because I don't know I love Dark Cloud

3455
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:20,200
and skeletons in that

3456
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:22,200
I think there's just something about

3457
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:24,200
the way a skull it looks

3458
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:26,200
like a face because it's obviously a human

3459
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:28,200
skull

3460
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:30,200
but it's like it's got this innate

3461
02:49:30,200 --> 02:49:32,200
spooky quality

3462
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:34,200
because the eyes are black

3463
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:36,200
and if you know anything about you know

3464
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:38,200
shitty deviant art

3465
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:40,200
creepypasta stuff everybody always makes

3466
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:42,200
the eyes black to make it scary

3467
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:44,200
if you got like a cursed Mario game

3468
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:46,200
that's why everybody's afraid of black people

3469
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:48,200
yeah well

3470
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:50,200
badum tish

3471
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:52,200
badum shh

3472
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:54,200
that's why people are scared of you because you wear

3473
02:49:54,200 --> 02:49:56,200
black glasses

3474
02:49:56,200 --> 02:49:58,200
sunglasses

3475
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:00,200
but yeah I don't know

3476
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:02,200
I could go into the analysis

3477
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:04,200
of why a skeleton is

3478
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:06,200
a symbol of death

3479
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:08,200
and death is really cool

3480
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:10,200
I don't know

3481
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:12,200
I don't know why I like skeletons

3482
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:14,200
I think I like the fact that

3483
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:16,200
they're a symbol of death but they can be really goofy

3484
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:18,200
because they can't talk

3485
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:20,200
and they're just like uh

3486
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:22,200
fall apart

3487
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:24,200
yeah

3488
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:26,200
I guess it's like

3489
02:50:26,200 --> 02:50:28,200
there's something moe about skeletons

3490
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,200
in that like they simultaneously

3491
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:32,200
are imposing but also very fragile

3492
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:34,200
yeah I actually had this idea

3493
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:36,200
it was really weird

3494
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:38,200
and it would

3495
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:40,200
I don't know whether it ever

3496
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:42,200
exist

3497
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:44,200
in any form but there's

3498
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:46,200
idea for an anime where the main girl

3499
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:48,200
main girl character

3500
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:50,200
gets turned into a skeleton

3501
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:52,200
and it's like oh no my chest

3502
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:54,200
is flatter than that other girl now

3503
02:50:54,200 --> 02:50:56,200
or something

3504
02:50:56,200 --> 02:50:58,200
which would be one of the things

3505
02:50:58,200 --> 02:51:00,200
but the main thing is obviously trying to fit in

3506
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:02,200
because she doesn't have any skin

3507
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:04,200
so she's got to wear clothing all over herself

3508
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:06,200
and people are like what's wrong

3509
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:08,200
why don't you show me your face

3510
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:10,200
why don't you speak

3511
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:12,200
I don't have a voice box anymore

3512
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:14,200
and she has to learn sign language

3513
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:16,200
and she becomes

3514
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:18,200
friends with the death kid

3515
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:20,200
that nobody likes

3516
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:22,200
this would make an amazing one shot

3517
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:24,200
you really need to make a one shot out

3518
02:51:24,200 --> 02:51:26,200
it's like 45 pages

3519
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:28,200
it's just the idea of having

3520
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:30,200
like a cute girl but she's a skeleton

3521
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:32,200
and that's

3522
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:34,200
I don't think that's been done before

3523
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:36,200
I could totally see that working

3524
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,200
it being

3525
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:40,200
like a weird

3526
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:42,200
offbeat magazine in Japan

3527
02:51:44,200 --> 02:51:46,200
because it, frank and fran

3528
02:51:46,200 --> 02:51:48,200
you might like the manga frank and fran

3529
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:50,200
I just bought the first two

3530
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:52,200
omnibus volumes of it today but it's a

3531
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:54,200
it's sort of

3532
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:56,200
that combination of like

3533
02:51:56,200 --> 02:51:58,200
like cuteness

3534
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:00,200
but mostly gruesomeness

3535
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:02,200
it's like a

3536
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:04,200
it's about a girl named fran who

3537
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:06,200
was like

3538
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:08,200
she's basically a frank and sign monster person

3539
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:10,200
but she's also like a doctor

3540
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:12,200
and she lives out in this mansion in the middle of nowhere

3541
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:14,200
and like she'll repair people

3542
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:16,200
but she always turns them

3543
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:18,200
into like some kind of Kafka-esque nightmare

3544
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:20,200
so like

3545
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:22,200
someone will come in and they'll be like I broke my leg

3546
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:24,200
and she's like I can fix it

3547
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:26,200
I have to mutate it with this other

3548
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:28,200
animal and then like

3549
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:30,200
she'll turn them into some kind of freakish monster

3550
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:32,200
and like it'll alter their personality in some way

3551
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:34,200
and it's fucking great

3552
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:36,200
I think you might enjoy it

3553
02:52:36,200 --> 02:52:38,200
and fran is adorable

3554
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:40,200
so uh

3555
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:42,200
there's lots of cute girls

3556
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:44,200
I've just realized one thing about skeletons

3557
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:46,200
which is the reason I don't like some skeletons

3558
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:48,200
is that they can't have an expression

3559
02:52:48,200 --> 02:52:50,200
like if a skeleton were

3560
02:52:50,200 --> 02:52:52,200
to just be a guy and you call him over

3561
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,200
and he turns around he'd just have that completely

3562
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:56,200
blank face because he doesn't have any face

3563
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:58,200
muscles and he'd just be looking at you

3564
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:00,200
you couldn't tell what he was thinking

3565
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:02,200
like when the people

3566
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:04,200
have skeletons and they give them angry skeleton

3567
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:06,200
eye holes it's like

3568
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:08,200
silly

3569
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:10,200
the way you would do it with the anime or

3570
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:12,200
manga version is that you use

3571
02:53:12,200 --> 02:53:14,200
just all those like manga

3572
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:16,200
like blush and stuff

3573
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:18,200
yeah somehow

3574
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:20,200
sweat drops and stuff like that

3575
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:22,200
yeah

3576
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:24,200
cause they're usually like drawn over the face

3577
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:26,200
more so than on it anyways

3578
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:28,200
so I think it would work

3579
02:53:28,200 --> 02:53:30,200
I think it's a great idea

3580
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:32,200
I want to read it back like I have a picture in my head

3581
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:34,200
of what it would look like and it seems really good

3582
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:36,200
and I really want to read it

3583
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:40,200
and I could totally see it

3584
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:42,200
being a chapter of Frank and Fran

3585
02:53:42,200 --> 02:53:44,200
hilariously enough

3586
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:46,200
oh shit

3587
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:48,200
David Boney I'm afraid of a skeletons

3588
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:50,200
one of my

3589
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:52,200
one of my favorite music videos on the internet

3590
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:54,200
on the Hippocrite channel

3591
02:53:54,200 --> 02:53:56,200
which I heard

3592
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:58,200
that long before I actually

3593
02:53:58,200 --> 02:54:00,200
tried to find the actual song

3594
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:02,200
and I don't like the actual song

3595
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:04,200
nearly as much

3596
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:06,200
cause the version you used is like this

3597
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:08,200
it was like a weird karaoke version

3598
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:10,200
you found I guess

3599
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:12,200
and I just kinda like the instrumental

3600
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:14,200
in that better than the actual song

3601
02:54:14,200 --> 02:54:16,200
and you mumbling about

3602
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:18,200
skeletons over it

3603
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:20,200
it's really funny

3604
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:22,200
it's the best

3605
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:24,200
I'm afraid of skeletons

3606
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:28,200
I'm afraid of the world

3607
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:30,200
yeah I'm proud of that

3608
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:32,200
the way I

3609
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:34,200
filmed that was I got

3610
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:36,200
my dad has these

3611
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:38,200
rotating like

3612
02:54:38,200 --> 02:54:40,200
colored lights that he uses

3613
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:42,200
for like a stage performances

3614
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:44,200
and stuff

3615
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:46,200
and they were just in the

3616
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:48,200
the room so I was like

3617
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:50,200
let's plug them in and get all the halloween

3618
02:54:50,200 --> 02:54:52,200
decorations and just go nuts

3619
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:54,200
and it was me and both of my brothers

3620
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:56,200
were just having a fucking

3621
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:58,200
blast being idiots

3622
02:54:58,200 --> 02:55:00,200
and yeah

3623
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:02,200
I asked Henry to film

3624
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:04,200
me singing and then I filmed

3625
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:06,200
them doing everything else

3626
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:08,200
and I just filmed it over and over until I had

3627
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:10,200
a bunch of weird shots and then it put it together

3628
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:12,200
and it worked

3629
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:14,200
it's great

3630
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:16,200
it's definitely one of the most fun

3631
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:18,200
things that has ever happened

3632
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:20,200
like it's just pure enjoyment

3633
02:55:20,200 --> 02:55:22,200
every time I watch it I'm like

3634
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:24,200
yeah this is great

3635
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:26,200
um

3636
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:28,200
we're actually gonna be part of the

3637
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:30,200
the 20 skeletons video

3638
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:32,200
but I made it a separate thing

3639
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:34,200
cause I felt like people would wanna rewatch

3640
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:36,200
the cool music video and not have to go through

3641
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:38,200
all the bullshit so

3642
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:40,200
yeah I'm glad you made that decision cause I have watched it a bunch of times

3643
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:42,200
so we're

3644
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:44,200
getting towards the end here

3645
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:46,200
do you have anything you really wanted to say

3646
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:48,200
on this podcast that you haven't had a chance to

3647
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:50,200
uh

3648
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:52,200
not really

3649
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:54,200
I mean I

3650
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:56,200
probably will remember something like

3651
02:55:56,200 --> 02:55:58,200
two hours from now like fuck

3652
02:55:58,200 --> 02:56:00,200
but right now I can't think much

3653
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:02,200
else that I wanna say I think I've talked

3654
02:56:02,200 --> 02:56:04,200
about myself

3655
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:06,200
I talked about what I like and what I do

3656
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:08,200
uh

3657
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:10,200
go subscribe to Hippocrite

3658
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:12,200
YouTube

3659
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:14,200
and it's spelt like Hippo as in

3660
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:16,200
Hippopotamus and Crit as in Critic

3661
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:18,200
there will be a link in the description

3662
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:20,200
I know but

3663
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:22,200
I know but Google still

3664
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:24,200
changes it to Hippocrite

3665
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:26,200
and it's wrong

3666
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:28,200
Hippocrite is the real world

3667
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:30,200
and I don't like it

3668
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:32,200
I invented Hippocrite

3669
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:34,200
it's mine

3670
02:56:34,200 --> 02:56:36,200

3671
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:38,200
