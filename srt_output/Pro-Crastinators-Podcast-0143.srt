00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm the best guy ever, and thank you for joining in a very unfortunate episode because

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Ben Saint is here.

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Oh boy, best guy ever.

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,040
You gotta do something about that cough, you gotta take care of your lungs, I'm vaping,

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm vaping into the microphone, I'm vaping into the microphone, that's what I'm saying.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Mage is here, Mage is here.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Hello, I'm in a good mood, I ate like three chocolate bars in a row.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,640
You know that according to Harry Potter, that's pretty good for your mood.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Remember it kills the de-no, it staves off the dementors.

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,640
It doesn't stave them off.

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:14,640
It staves off the deleterious mental effects that proximity to the dementors have.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
That's true, that's true. Hippocrit's here.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Hey it's me, it's me, I'm here.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
And Tom Oliver.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Hey guys, sorry I haven't made a video in a while.

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Just been too busy hanging out on The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the best podcast for artists everywhere.

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Where are the reason people are dying? Nobody said it, so I will say it every time.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm really happy that you're taking charge on that.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Is this our new catchphrase guys?

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
It is.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,640
What's the other one? Oh, just being cool.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
And we're also just being cool.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,640
We need a new theme song contest, but this time you have to, the lyrics have to be,

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,640
hey guys sorry I haven't made a video in a while.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
That's good, that's good.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Speaking of things in that vein, I'm fucking sick.

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
I feel sick, I am sick.

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but I do feel shitty in general.

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
So sickness, I feel sick, times you were sick, discuss.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Tell us your symptoms.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
I was quite recently sick, if you remember.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Me too, I got a cold, I got a fucking cold.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
You might remember as of a couple weeks ago I was coughing like on every episode.

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I was very sick for maybe a week there, it sucks, I could fuck with my sleep.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,640
I have been blitzing myself, I got a huge fucking bag of clementines right here.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
I have been chowing the fuck down.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,640
I've got these vitamin C concentrated cocaine packs that I've been pouring into my water

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
and chugging by the gallon.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,640
And I do feel I am successfully staving off the march into Poland of Hitler's troops,

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,640
of the sickness that is progressing through my body.

42
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
And I feel like Poland is actually going to win this one baby.

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Our horse cavalry is going to turn those tanks around with sheer vitamin C force.

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,640
I don't know if vitamin C actually makes a difference, but I'm banking on it and it's all I got.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,640
It's like ammunition, you're supplying your troops with more ammunition.

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
No, no, no, it's like the Poles had those winged hasars or whatever,

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
like the winged horse riders, we're just adding more wings,

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,640
more wings equal more power to fight back the tanks.

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,640
The winged knights like sweet robins in the veil.

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Fuck off Preston Jacobs.

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Your theories are shit, dude.

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,640
No man, their quake is fucking using the moon to bounce signals off of to spy on Daenerys.

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,640
That fucking boy, he finds one tiny justification, makes a 45 minute video about it.

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,640
He's just as bad as your soy boys or any of your fucking theory crap, your motherfuckers.

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Okay, okay, yes, I blinked for a second.

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
What are we talking about?

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Is this like the Game of Thrones version of A-Cross right now?

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Is that what we're talking about?

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,640
I don't want to skip this because this is a huge ideological divide.

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,640
I was saying on the other episode that we shouldn't be afraid to delve into the real shit.

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
This is the real shit.

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Preston Jacobs is an unsung genius because, see the thing is, his theories sound...

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,640
He thinks sweet robin is the most powerful character in Game of Thrones.

64
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,640
He's an idiot, he thinks way more shit about things than he should.

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
His theories are bunk.

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
You're fucking bunk, and here's why.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
The reason...

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Okay, yeah, if you listen to some of what Jacobs says, it sounds totally nuts,

69
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,640
but everything that he says is...

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,640
It's all justified by the fact that similar things happen in other George R. R. Martin stories.

71
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Almost every one of his theories is based in George R. R. Martin wrote another story,

72
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,640
and basically this is what happened, so let's assume that something similar is going on in Ice and Fire.

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Dude, I watched a fucking video of his about how Quentin might...

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Okay, he didn't say he was definitely alive, but he said he was leaning hard on the fact that Quentin is alive.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,640
If you remember people, Quentin was the martel who went to try to steal the dragons from Danny and got face melted.

76
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,640
I mean, he was on fire, he was burned.

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,640
He goes into this whole big fucking theory about how...

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,640
No, no, no, no, no, he was holding an oily whip at the time when it's described that something was burning.

79
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,640
It was the oil on the whip. He's only a little burnt, he's totally fine.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,640
And he goes into all this fucking mind reading about the characters, like there's one character who never expresses emotion.

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,640
When he expressed emotion that Quentin was dead, that must indicate that he's lying to fool people.

82
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Not that just narratively, maybe he cares more about his fucking lord than the random other fucks who die.

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Quentin, you're overreaching, my dude. You're overreaching, and that's why I hate theory crafters.

84
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Yeah, when you say it like that, it sounds crazy, but he gives a huge list of reasons why.

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,640
That example, you just said, yeah, it's like, oh, why wouldn't someone show emotion?

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Well, I mean, he's an ironwood, which is the second house under the martels in the books.

87
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Secondary houses are always the ones that are vying for power and try to take over their lords.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,640
The ironwoods probably don't have any love for the martels.

89
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,640
You know, the whole mission was probably sent with them because they're not interested in martel rule.

90
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,640
There's all these reasons why the party doesn't actually care about Quentin.

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:39,640
And then there's all these other reasons why they act weird and the lies they tell after he dies don't make any sense.

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:48,640
I admit, I love Occam's Razor, and I use it liberally all the time, and I just feel that this boy's videos are ripe for it.

93
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Super fucking ripe.

94
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
I don't care about...

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, all right.

96
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Here's the real thing about that is that I have a cold.

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,640
You know, a few podcasts ago I was talking about having the eternal cold?

98
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,640
It has not stopped. I am still constantly kind of under the weather at all times, but I feel like Mr Burns.

99
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Is that Sweeney Todd London atmosphere, bro?

100
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
It's killing your mind.

101
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
It's called getting older.

102
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
As an old man, I can confirm.

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,640
And Ben can confirm with me that it happens.

104
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Eventually being kind of sick is just normal once you get older.

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
I don't think that's true at all.

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm happy to say that no, no, I honestly don't feel any different.

107
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I don't feel any different.

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Well, then I guess I'm just broken and need a robot body immediately.

109
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,640
But it has benefits, because I have no idea what is causing it or whether it's even a thing,

110
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,640
but it's like I feel sick more so than I was when I was a little boy, or like a teenager.

111
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
So I assume I actually have a cold.

112
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,640
And like there's evidence to suggest that it is sort of like a Mr Burns.

113
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Like I have too much stuff and therefore I can't get sick.

114
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Because like I haven't had like a cold in, well, the whole time.

115
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I've never had like a sniffle.

116
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
The whole time.

117
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
But whatever that means.

118
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I've never had a cold in the whole time.

119
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Like, you know, I go out in Boston.

120
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh, it's so cold out here.

121
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh, and I don't sneeze.

122
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
I don't sneeze.

123
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I get a little runny nose, but like I never feel like, you know, like, you know,

124
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
snap fingers and now I'm bedridden.

125
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Like I haven't felt like that in years.

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,640
The only times, I've gotten sick maybe twice in the last like several months.

127
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,640
And that was almost the only time I've been sick in like recent memory.

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,640
And both times were when I was out of the house like visiting Digi's.

129
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,640
And I think it was just like being out of the house in the cold for the journeys.

130
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Got me sick both times.

131
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,640
I wear shorts out in the snow a lot.

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,640
And maybe that combined with public transportation and exposure to germs and all that.

133
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,640
This is almost definitely spurned on by the recent trip to Boston and whatnot.

134
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I was exposed to the cold quite a bit.

135
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Yeah.

136
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
But doing a lot of snow moving and pushing around and stuff.

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm sure that's relevant to this.

138
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm just, I'm so proud of myself for fighting it back.

139
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I feel like I'm over the hump and it's only going to get better from here, baby.

140
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
It's great.

141
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
It's great.

142
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I think I just, I'm debating if I should exercise or not.

143
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I don't know if it'll make me sicker or will help blast out the demons.

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
One of those two.

145
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I love that feeling of blasting out the demons in a sense.

146
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Me too.

147
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,640
When you, you know, you're really like dying and you're like, no, I'm just going to tense

148
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,640
all my muscles as hard as I can until it's gone.

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm just going to go, I'm just going to smoke out of my ears.

150
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Like the demon.

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
There it is.

152
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Like, fuck you.

153
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Kick it into the sewers.

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I'm just going to immerse myself.

155
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I'm just going to boil a cauldron and dunk myself in it.

156
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Let's talk about, let's talk about times we were super sick though, because that's interesting.

157
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Stop me if I've told this story before, but there was a time when I was really young

158
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
and I had a crazy high fever.

159
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Have I told this before?

160
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I remember that.

161
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I remember the dead made me think you were going to die.

162
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,640
I know I've said this before, but I remember they measured my temperature and it was something

163
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,640
like, I think it was like 106.7 and there's something about how brain damage starts at

164
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
like 107 or something like that.

165
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Well, now we know.

166
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Right on the edge.

167
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,640
This is why I am the way I am, but I was so delusional and out of my fucking mind, I

168
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,640
had these crazy dreams about Lord Ooze from the Power Rangers movies that still haunt

169
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
me to this day.

170
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Ivan Ooze.

171
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
That's right.

172
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
With his Ooze.

173
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Yeah.

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,280
It just, I was completely out of my mind and I don't remember what was happening in

175
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
the real world.

176
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,640
I only remember what happened in the Ooze world, the better world, where I wanted to be.

177
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Do you think Ivan Ooze is...

178
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
It was the first visit to Slime City.

179
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Yeah.

180
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
I was the pioneer.

181
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Yeah.

182
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Is Ivan Ooze a rowdy or a killer?

183
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
He's definitely a rowdy.

184
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Well, you know, look at him.

185
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
He strides the line, I guess.

186
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
He dresses like a killer.

187
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
You know, I guess you're right.

188
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I was thinking that Ooze-ness made him rowdy, but now I think about it.

189
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Everyone's a ooze.

190
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Yeah.

191
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
That describes the territory.

192
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I guess he is a killer now that I think about it.

193
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Yes, we got him.

194
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
We got him, boys.

195
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Ivan Ooze has been recruited.

196
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,640
A guy I know in real life messaged me on Discord the other day being like, I tried to play,

197
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I was enjoying your game until someone...

198
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Until he actually started playing.

199
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Until someone killed me, and I was like, haha, was it a rowdy or a killer?

200
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
And also, I hope you enlisted killers.

201
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
And he was like, I did enlist killers, but also it was a killer that killed me.

202
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
And I said, yes, we bullied you into joining.

203
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm giving the guy who did it a promotion.

204
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Nice job, Coonrat.

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Good kill.

206
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Way to go, dude.

207
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Wasn't Coonrat a rowdy?

208
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
He switched a little while ago.

209
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Oh, okay, okay.

210
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
Fucking traitors.

211
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I have no respect for traitors at all.

212
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
There's a lot of them these days.

213
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I know.

214
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
There's so many.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I've never switched.

216
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
No one is clean except...

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
The cleanest of all...

218
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,640
The cleanest of all are the mud puddle knights in the mud puddle Discord.

219
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
The Discord war is still happening except nobody cares at all.

220
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Yeah, nobody cares.

221
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
It's a cold war now.

222
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
It's a funny meme, I guess.

223
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
But hey, guys, tell me more about when you were sick.

224
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I want to know when you were sick.

225
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,640
The worst times that I've been sick...

226
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I have huge tonsils, naturally.

227
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I have huge and asymmetrical tonsils.

228
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,640
And sometimes, the right kind of illness will swell your tonsils up.

229
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,640
And that is awful for me, especially.

230
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Does it choke you or something?

231
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:06,640
I mean, I can still breathe, but it just feels so bad to swallow or even just to exist.

232
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
That is the thing that I fear most when I get sick.

233
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Is that my tonsils will swell up.

234
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,640
It's just a horrible, horrible experience.

235
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,640
It hasn't happened in a little while, which I'm glad for.

236
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,640
There was this one time where I thought I was going to die because I had a cold.

237
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,640
And it was just like an extreme situation where I had a cold for a while.

238
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Sneezing and spluttering and the throat cold where it's all stuffed up and clogged up.

239
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
You got to have a drink.

240
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,640
And we were out driving somewhere and we were stopping.

241
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,640
And we got out to look at some cows or whatever.

242
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I don't really remember.

243
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,640
But I had a fit of sneezing and coughing and I couldn't breathe.

244
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,640
My throat closed up with the stuff and I was like, oh shit.

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm not in the safety of my home.

246
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I'm not very close to a nice drink of water.

247
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,640
We're out on the road, out in the field.

248
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,640
And I'm like, what happens?

249
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,640
What will happen if I can't draw a breath right now?

250
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm going to die right here.

251
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:26,640
And that panic increased the floundering and the spluttering.

252
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,640
And eventually I managed to cough it up.

253
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,640
But that was the closest I ever felt like I was going to die because of a cold.

254
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I hate how fucking vulnerable.

255
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I've said this before, but I'm terrified of getting stuffed up and choking to death.

256
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,640
This is giving me deja vu because I think I've told that story and then you followed up with that exact thing.

257
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
I think you're right.

258
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Nonetheless, it still haunts me.

259
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
We're so vulnerable to just lack of air.

260
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
It's fucked up.

261
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
It's fucked up.

262
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
One body is weak.

263
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Robot body is now. Transhumidism now.

264
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
How does she tag H plus?

265
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Something that can really easily freak myself out is thinking about how we're basically in an ocean of air.

266
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
We're basically in a soup.

267
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,640
It's like a gas soup, but we're in this chemical soup that keeps us alive.

268
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,640
And if we were taken out of it, we would choke and die like a fish out of water.

269
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,640
And it's weird to think that what astronauts have to do is they have to preserve that aura around them.

270
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
They have to bring soup with them.

271
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
They have to bring the soup.

272
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
They have to bring that atmosphere with them in their little soup.

273
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
They have to keep themselves in a little artificial bubble of it.

274
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Did you hear about the Chinese astronaut people?

275
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
They were trying to grow stuff on the moon.

276
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,640
They had a little cubicle and they had this little plant that they had.

277
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
I don't think it was bot flies.

278
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
There were some sort of flies in there.

279
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
They had fly eggs and plants.

280
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,640
And what they wanted to happen was the plant would grow and then create carbon dioxide.

281
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,640
And then the flies would create oxygen.

282
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,640
And then the flies would emerge because of the oxygen and then an ecosystem would form.

283
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:15,640
But it all died because on the other side of the moon, the nighttime of the moon is like minus 730 degrees centigrade.

284
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
It's like super duper freezing.

285
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
And it's dead.

286
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
And they fucked up.

287
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
And I don't know why they couldn't see that coming.

288
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
There's no way to even deal with that.

289
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
More important question.

290
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Who the fuck allowed the Chinese on the moon?

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Trump needs to get on that shit.

292
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
That's not allowed.

293
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Our flag is up there.

294
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Correct me if I'm wrong.

295
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
People think that the moon landing is fake.

296
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Some people think that.

297
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I thought we hadn't been to the moon since.

298
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Correct? Or am I crazy?

299
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I can imagine things have been to the moon.

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,640
I thought only America and Russia had a space program.

301
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,640
I thought the conspiracy was that the initial moon landing is fake, but we have since been there for real.

302
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
I wasn't sure.

303
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
I don't know either.

304
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I thought that it was possible we had never been to the moon if the moon landing was fake.

305
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I hear of things.

306
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,640
There's a radiation belt in space that a human could never pass through.

307
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,640
They die if they actually try to go to the moon, so it's impossible.

308
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
This is false, by the way.

309
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
These are all false lies.

310
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Yeah.

311
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
But they may be false, but I still believe them.

312
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,640
We got any moon truthers in here?

313
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Raise your hand if you're a moon truther.

314
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Raise his paw.

315
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Praise Luna.

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Praise the moon.

317
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

318
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Luna should have taken care of that flower on the moon, that bitch.

319
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Yeah, that fucking slag.

320
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
The flower that died?

321
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
The plant.

322
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Why didn't Luna take care of it?

323
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
What an uncaring bitch.

324
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Tell me more about times you were sick.

325
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Mage, I bet you were sick.

326
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
You're a real sick puppy there, Mage.

327
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Tell me more about it.

328
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,640
I have been sick so many times in my life.

329
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Was it ever really bad?

330
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Quite a few times, my favorite.

331
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Actually, quite recently, when I was sick recently, my favorite had gone up to almost 39 Celsius.

332
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm not sure how much that's in Fahrenheit.

333
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
What's that in real numbers?

334
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,640
102-ish, maybe a bit more.

335
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Okay, it's pretty high.

336
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Yeah, it was, yeah.

337
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
But it only lasted for like a day, so thankfully I survived.

338
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:41,640
I think I told you guys about the time when I got super really ill, when the gallbladder thing happened.

339
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Yes, and you went to some kind of camp?

340
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
It's a health camp, yeah.

341
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
They put you in a concentration camp?

342
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Yeah, that sounds terrifying.

343
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,640
No, it was a health camp, but oh man, the health camp was like...

344
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,640
A health camp or a hell camp?

345
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Both.

346
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,640
You told me about this, and I don't know if we do health camps over here.

347
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
I've never really heard of such a thing.

348
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Unless you were a Japanese during World War II, we never did health camps.

349
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:23,640
It was amazingly terrifying, because it was held in a building that survived since World War II, and it was really really old.

350
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,640
And the bathroom was absolutely terrifying.

351
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Don't get me started about the showers.

352
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,640
I was going to say, they knew you were a weeb, which is why they put you in this concentration camp.

353
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Any traces of Japanese culture had to be, you know...

354
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,640
No, man, the Japanese were the master race of the East, of the Orientals.

355
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Yeah, but we did, well, okay, only the U.S., I think, did concentration camps.

356
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
Oh, we're talking about Japanese internal camps.

357
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
I don't know anything about all that.

358
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Yeah, it was just... it was like very unpleasant to look at it.

359
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I did not look forward to going to that.

360
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
What was the benefit of even going to a health camp?

361
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Is that where doctors are or something?

362
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah, there were quite a few.

363
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Doctors had me monitored what I had to eat, because I couldn't eat a lot of things, because of the whole gallbladder thing.

364
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,640
I don't remember the details, and I couldn't really describe it, but there were like a few treatment stuff,

365
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
and there were massages, and now you think massages are nice.

366
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Those massages gave me...

367
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
I hate massages, but that's just me.

368
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Like bruises. It was terrible, and it was even worse, because right before the trip towards the health camp,

369
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,640
I had like a really nasty fall, and like...

370
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,640
I hit my ribs on a very hard surface,

371
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,640
and I burned... it wasn't exactly burned, but when I tripped, it was like on...

372
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Oh, like friction burn?

373
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Yeah, friction burn. Yeah, it was friction burn on my foot, and some skin just was missing, so...

374
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Dude, that was the worst.

375
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Yeah, it was just before they tripped as well, so it was just...

376
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Forget my gallbladder! Fix this!

377
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Was everything in Japanese internment camps that they call it massages,

378
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
but actually just the guy would go in, and then two guys would hold them by the arms,

379
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
and a third guy would just work them over with brass knuckles,

380
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
just like punch them in the torso a bunch of times.

381
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Was that what was going on?

382
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
It sounds about right.

383
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,640
But yeah, so the time I was actually sick before the camp, it was terrible,

384
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,640
because when I read about how people have experience with the whole pains of the gallbladder,

385
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,640
some people don't even have pains, and some people have mild pains,

386
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,640
and some people have pains that lasted up to four hours.

387
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Mine, at the worst, lasted 16 hours.

388
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,640
I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I lost a lot of weight,

389
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,640
and I was just constantly suffering for a month.

390
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Oh man, I want to use weight, maybe I should fuck my gallbladder up.

391
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
What a story, man!

392
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,640
At some points, I went to the ER at least two times, I think,

393
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,640
and there were points, I just had to...

394
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,640
I was just crying with frustration, because I couldn't do anything.

395
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Was this in the UK?

396
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,640
The pains started in the UK, and I went to the camp as soon as I got to Lafiania,

397
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
because the camp was in Latvia, so...

398
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Little shit, bruh.

399
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,640
I mean, I got a mean tweet once, so I think I know a little something about the pain.

400
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,640
That lasts all damn day. Emotional pain is the real exquisite.

401
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey, you know, speaking of mean tweets, I did a little drawing last night.

402
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
I drew mega-clifable, aka cliffangel.

403
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
That was nice.

404
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,640
And it's only got 57 likes, and I don't think that's enough.

405
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Oh, that's the suffering.

406
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Is there a worse pain?

407
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Listen, no, it's really clever, guys, because I based its shape on mega-gangar,

408
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
because, like, gangar is cliffable shadow.

409
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Why don't people appreciate me?

410
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,640
I didn't know that. You should really spell that out, so it's obvious.

411
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
You gotta really drill it home for the stupid people out there.

412
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Yeah, I said it in a reply to someone else's, but now the vast people who don't engage with the tweet will never know.

413
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Ben, it's because it wasn't pornography. You gotta have to make it pornography.

414
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I used the fairy-type background from Pokemon Go, you know?

415
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,640
I did everything for these people, and they stabbed me in the back.

416
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:42,640
I googled USSR bathrooms, and I found a picture, and this bathroom is a lot nicer than the one I was stuck with.

417
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,640
That sucks, bruh.

418
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Where's the...

419
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,640
This looks like the bathroom that I think I've talked about.

420
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:04,640
When I was living in Poland, the company I was working for set me up with a real nice apartment,

421
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:17,640
and then when I got fired, basically, I had to downgrade to moving downstairs and sharing a set of rooms with some 90-year-old woman.

422
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I had a real shit bathroom that I had to heat the water manually.

423
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,640
It kinda looked like this, but darker, much darker. Dark, dark, yet darker, you might say.

424
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:38,640
The last apartment I lived in was gross and disgusting, but with the bathroom specifically, it was a...

425
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Okay, it was better than this. It was definitely better than this, but there were roaches.

426
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Moving out here, roaches have just become a part of life.

427
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,640
This might freak people out a little bit, but maybe every two days, every three days, a tiny little baby roach.

428
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I'll just be at my desk working. I will see one walk across my desk.

429
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Which means 100% there's way more somewhere else, and I don't know where.

430
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
That's disturbing to me.

431
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,640
One of the guys I live with, he saw a mouse, like a mouse just ran across his desk.

432
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Oh, Christ.

433
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,640
This was a while ago, and we have killed lots of mice.

434
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Excellent.

435
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,640
It is a fucking slaughterhouse. You don't want to talk about a constant... It's like mouse Auschwitz in here.

436
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
No, please don't talk.

437
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
You're gonna make that mouse skull throne, right? I mean, that's in the cards.

438
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:43,640
We haven't really seen them much, but last night, I saw one running around in the living room, and I was very incensed.

439
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,640
We have a bunch of traps still out. They haven't caught me in a while because their population has declined.

440
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:57,640
We've been on a genocide run, and I knew they wouldn't be gone that easy.

441
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Dude, Sans is gonna be so mad at you.

442
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:09,640
No, we've reduced the population enough that I no longer hear them scrabbling around in the ceiling above my room every single night, which was going on for a while.

443
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Well, that's good.

444
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,640
And the thing about that, see, I think it was mice, but something about the acoustics amplified the sound.

445
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,640
It sounded like a full fucking raccoon was running around, like feet above my head, which was very, very upsetting.

446
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,640
God, talk about sickness. We live in a sick world where you have to still deal with the fact that things besides humans live in this fucking planet.

447
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
They're gross. I wasn't gone.

448
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
We get out of here.

449
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
It is pretty gross.

450
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
We should really segregate.

451
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
We need to.

452
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,640
My least favorite, surprisingly, is Big Old Spiders.

453
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,640
When I see a Big Old Spider, because they're so slow, they're so, like, keep to themselves.

454
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,640
At the moment, there's been a Big Old Spider just in the bathroom, and occasionally, you know, I just walk in there and, oh, he's in that corner now.

455
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
He's just hanging out in the top corner.

456
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
But, like, he doesn't do anything.

457
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
At the moment, he's, like, squished his arms in.

458
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,640
So he's just trying to get comfortable, trying to get warm in the crevice, like, in between the wall and the ceiling.

459
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
It just looks kind of funny.

460
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
So I'm like, you know what? You can stay. I don't really give a shit.

461
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Actually, though, since I have a cat, I don't want him to get numb.

462
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
So what I do is, like, I have, like, this...

463
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,640
I have specifically set aside, like, a little plastic container that has, like, the Q-tips for ears stuff.

464
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Like, so I have an empty one.

465
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,640
So whenever I see a spider, I place one on top of the spider, then I slip a piece of paper or something like that under it

466
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,640
so I can pick up the spider, and then I release it into the wild through the window or the door or whatever.

467
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah. You know, I don't like spiders.

468
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Everyone tells me, like, oh, but Ben, oh, what do you mean? They eat the other insects.

469
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,640
I think I've said this before, like, yeah, they eat the other insects, but they themselves are the worst and most disgusting of them all.

470
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
No.

471
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,640
The things I hate most are the things that are small and fast.

472
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:03,640
A small and fast spider is gross because you blink and it could be anywhere, and then it could go up your butt in the middle of the night.

473
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
When a spider jumps, I am spooked.

474
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,640
That's pretty freaky, yeah.

475
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,640
You know, the average American eats hundreds of thousands of spiders every year and they're asleep.

476
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
That's an exaggeration.

477
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
They just, they just cry.

478
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,640
As soon as you fall asleep, just they march in a line, just a huge army of them just cry.

479
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Like, one giant spider shows up, like, pulls open your mouth and just shoves handfuls of spiders.

480
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,640
And just gives birth into your mouth, and like, they entire, they're entire, they're entire.

481
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
What?

482
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
No!

483
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Dude, it's like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets following the spiders into your mouth.

484
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
What do you think you're fighting?

485
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,640
I'm full of spiders! They're fighting their way out!

486
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Oh, it's fucked up, bro.

487
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Hey, but you know what? You know what, though?

488
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Spiders? Fucking keto.

489
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
They're jokes on them, dude!

490
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Yeah, that's good, that's good.

491
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:03,640
You know, I have a, my friend Chelsea sent me a, a while ago sent me a bag of a fucking, oh, cricket flower.

492
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Which is made of crickets.

493
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Right.

494
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,640
This is like a thing now, I don't know if it's a fad thing, or if it's something that is, I don't know if it's new,

495
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,640
or if it's something that's like, comeback, or just going to Vogue for whatever.

496
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,640
But, but eating with spiders, like, or eating with bugs, like bug ingredients.

497
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,640
I saw the worst thing yesterday of, of my life.

498
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I suppose I want to try, I really want to try cooking with it, but I don't know what the fuck to make out.

499
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Like, I don't know what cricket flower tastes like.

500
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
I'm sure you can find a recipe for it.

501
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Just sub it in for regular flowers, but dude, okay.

502
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
I don't know, maybe.

503
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Oh, was that, was at the gym on Friday, about to do a Q&A, and I totally...

504
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Yeah, don't!

505
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Wait, what?

506
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Wait, did you know about this?

507
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
No, what the fuck is that?

508
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Did we talk about this on the PCP?

509
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
I don't think we have.

510
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Please explain.

511
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
You want to explain, Tom?

512
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Yeah, okay.

513
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:57,640
So there's this weird meme that Kaze started of, of, there was this one time, I do, sometimes on Friday,

514
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I'll just say, hey, I'm bored, ask me questions on Instagram.

515
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Viewer engagement, great stuff, 10 out of 10, gets me in that algorithm.

516
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
I do the research, I know how it works.

517
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
But I guess one time I said...

518
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
SEO, SEO, SEO, yeah.

519
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,640
There's not much SEO on Instagram, there's not a lot of search.

520
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Well, I guess there's kind of, whatever, doesn't matter.

521
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Point is, I came back from the gym and said, oh, I just got back from the gym, I'm bored, ask me questions.

522
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,640
And then like two weeks later, Ben and Kaze and Munchie are all laughing at me saying,

523
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I do Q&A at the gym all the time.

524
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm like, this happened once.

525
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
No.

526
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
But now I'm just leaning into it, because it's fucking hilarious.

527
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Kaze just, she brought up, she was like, hey, do you guys know about Tom on Instagram?

528
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
And I'm like, no.

529
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,640
And she's like, yeah, he's always just like, hey guys, just got back from the gym to have a little Q&A.

530
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Dude, he goes to the gym.

531
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,640
The way she said it was so fucking funny.

532
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
And I'm like, wait, really?

533
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
And she's like, yeah, I'll prove it.

534
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
Let me look and find his latest Instagram.

535
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,640
And it's him saying like, hey guys, just got back from the gym, you know, let's do a Q&A.

536
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
And I'm like, oh, okay, I guess that's proof.

537
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,640
He does this every day, like every day to just get back to the gym.

538
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Tom puts on his gym clothes.

539
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
He goes to the bench rack.

540
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
He lies down under the bench bar and he fires up Instagram.

541
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
And he's like, guys, just have a workout in my brain.

542
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Send me those questions right now.

543
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
He's like in the leg press machine.

544
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
He's doing a little Q&A, like between each rep.

545
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Oh dude, Tom goes, he stands in the squat rack to do his Q&A.

546
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
He's ready to go.

547
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Well, people line up around the block to use that fucking epic legendary machine.

548
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,640
But Tom's going to need that to do his fucking Q&A.

549
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
I'm working out the algorithm.

551
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

552
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Damn, okay.

553
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Excellent.

554
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
So you're at the gym doing a Q&A.

555
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Anyways, Ben, I was at the gym doing Q&A.

556
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
And all of a sudden I stopped and freeze because there's a TV on.

557
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,640
And the TV's advertising the keto diet as like a cool thing you should do.

558
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Oh fuck.

559
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Whoa.

560
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Who makes money off an ad like that?

561
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,640
There's just some company was selling keto powder.

562
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
What was it?

563
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Was it bulletproof?

564
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Was it bulletproof?

565
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
No.

566
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
It was like some other, they just said keto in the name.

567
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
They're just like, you got to get on the keto diet.

568
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
People have been promoting it.

569
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,640
And all these fucking single moms talking about how they're losing weight and shit.

570
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Jillian Michaels is against the keto diet.

571
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
It's going mainstream.

572
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,640
There's been a big spat over that.

573
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Yeah, that was trending on Twitter a little while ago.

574
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Yeah, that's because there was like a big tussle.

575
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,640
I think I'm going to talk about this less than what's-her-face and Al Roker.

576
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
They were in a little bit of a debate about keto.

577
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Oh, Al Roker.

578
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Oh shit.

579
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Al Roker, he was one of the guys who was pushing it on like the daily show, whatever the fucking

580
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,640
it is, the morning show, something.

581
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,640
He was like a big pro keto guy, but you know, whatever.

582
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Anyway.

583
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,640
It's mainstream and it's not cool anymore is what I'm saying.

584
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
We got to dig further.

585
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
We got to dig deeper.

586
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Got to find something even sicker now.

587
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
Yeah.

588
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
What was the end of that Jim Q&A story?

589
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Oh, the keto diet.

590
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Just the keto.

591
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah, you saw that.

592
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
It's on TV.

593
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
It's mainstream now.

594
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
It's terrifying.

595
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Once keto becomes moved off the internet.

596
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,640
What comes next after keto?

597
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I mean, keto is just like the latest iteration.

598
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,640
You know, there was the Atkins diet, which is basically the same.

599
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Yeah, you're right.

600
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
You're right.

601
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Look, the next thing is just once we start seeing fuel ads on TV, that's when we know

602
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
all is lost because there's nowhere to go from there.

603
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Where do you go from post food?

604
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
There's no food.

605
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
I just kill yourself.

606
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,640
I mean, I want to go straight to Blade Runner world of, well, okay.

607
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
I suppose Matrix World.

608
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Like every shop only sells nutrition slop.

609
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,640
I only want the option to eat perfectly balanced nutrition slop.

610
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
I want no other options.

611
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I want capitalism to solve my weakness for me by knowing better than what I know for myself.

612
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Capitalism is not going to solve your weakness.

613
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
It's going to exploit your weakness.

614
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:54,640
You want the invisible hand of the free market to drive a forced consensus that becomes truth.

615
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Yeah.

616
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Exactly.

617
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
That's exactly how it works.

618
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Well, it's how I want it to work.

619
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
If you buy, you know, all new...

620
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
It's how capitalists would work ideally.

621
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
All new nutrition slop now with trough.

622
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Free trough.

623
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Like turning enough slop box tops or slop tops as we call them.

624
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I get a free trough from the mail.

625
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
I can see Nate setting up his shop now.

626
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Brand spanking new food.

627
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Yeah.

628
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Okay.

629
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Let's just, you know, let's take it to the logical stream.

630
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
You just, you sit down at like a bar.

631
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,640
What you do is you just stick an IV into an injection port.

632
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Nate, you got to start a new health brand called the best food ever.

633
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
That's a good idea.

634
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
That's a good idea.

635
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
But, okay.

636
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Like in the matrix, they have those port, like in the back of their brain or whatever.

637
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Just everyone on their arm or their shoulder or whatever just has a little like hole.

638
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
No.

639
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
You sit down at like a fucking charging station.

640
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
You just plug in the thing.

641
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
It just gives you the nutrition you need.

642
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
You don't even have to use your worthless gob of a mouth.

643
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
No.

644
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
Which is only for passing the word of God and nothing else.

645
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,640
What I want, what I want, is I want the Metal Gear Rising Future where you have a cyborg

646
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
body in order to replenish your life essence.

647
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,640
You just slice somebody in half, rip their spine out and absorb your electrolytes.

648
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Yes.

649
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
And then you're immediately back at 100% HP.

650
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Do you drink that?

651
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Or does he just kind of absorb it?

652
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
He just kind of crushes it.

653
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
He just kind of crushes their spine.

654
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Is it actually their electrolytes?

655
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Yeah.

656
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:22,640
The guy, Doctor, the character who's of German doctor, spelled D-O-K-T-O-R, says you absorb

657
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
electrolytes to regain your energy.

658
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,640
So he could just as easily just down a Gatorade, but he chooses.

659
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
The spine is just filled with Gatorade.

660
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Who has time to get Gatorade when you're slicing geckos in half?

661
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,640
You've got to do what's out on the field, bro.

662
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
You've got to play that fucking game.

663
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
It's so good.

664
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Yeah, one day.

665
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
One day I'll get to it.

666
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Dude, that's where Maka came from, Nate.

667
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
You know that, right?

668
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Is that true?

669
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,640
I mean, in the end of the game, he says straight up he's going to make America great again.

670
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

671
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
It's the best fucking shit ever.

672
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Well, now I've got it.

673
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
This is like two years before Trump.

674
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
No, no, no, no.

675
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
The Matthew Matosis video.

676
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Like, I'm not a Metal Gear Solid guy.

677
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
I've only played the first one.

678
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,640
So, you know, I didn't play Rising, but like the Matthew Matosis video.

679
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Yeah, when he's talking about Armstrong, I was like, this is the coolest fucking thing

680
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
I've ever seen.

681
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Like, by the end of the game, I'm just like, I just want to die.

682
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
I want Armstrong to win.

683
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
He's so, so justified.

684
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Armstrong is based.

685
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Yeah, he kind of is.

686
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,640
In the way that, yeah, he's so fucking cartoonishly terrible that you're like, I love him so much.

687
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:28,640
So, Armstrong, okay, so he's willing to sacrifice innocent lives for the sake of helping America be the best.

688
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Pretty standard American politics, I guess.

689
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I suppose it makes sense.

690
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Like, this is what we do.

691
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,640
How did Koji get America that much?

692
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
That's what's being a West Abuse all about.

693
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
That was just so fucking computer.

694
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
It's just like we get Japan so much.

695
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
It's the same thing.

696
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
I love Japan, period.

697
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Yeah.

698
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Nate, serious idea.

699
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
You're a fitness guy.

700
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Yeah.

701
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,640
If you wrote, like, okay, like Tom, your friend, Jack's Blade, he wrote like the book.

702
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
He wrote a book, right, about diet and stuff.

703
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
He made a million dollars.

704
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
He made a hundred thousand dollars in two weeks.

705
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,640
If you wrote, like, a diet book and you just called it, like, the best diet ever or whatever, or best workout ever, you made, like, a health guide or something.

706
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
I bet you would make, I bet you would make.

707
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:22,640
If Scooby, if Scooby ever found out, okay, you know what I'd do though, what Scooby does, my fitness hero, is he'll make a video called, like, the bread diet, or like, he made the W diet was his thing.

708
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
And then we actually, and it's like, you'll get instant results in, like, one week.

709
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
That is a joke.

710
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,640
What it actually is, is, like, a technique to, like, get you to be accountable to, like, the calories you consume, because whatever.

711
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,640
The W diet is, you literally eat anything, change nothing, you just count the calories, which will just awaken you to how much you're fucking up with your diet.

712
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
That's the whole point.

713
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:54,640
And if I could also write a book that appears to be tricking people into thinking that it's just an easy solution, and then actually redpills them on how hard and how they need to take responsibility for this shit, that I could live with.

714
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
That I could live with.

715
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
So maybe that's the way to go.

716
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
That's a pretty neat maneuver.

717
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,640
I really like the idea that since you're a YouTuber and you have like, you know.

718
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
No, Nate, just fucking lie to them.

719
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
Just fucking tell them what they want to hear.

720
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
That's what the money's at.

721
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
That's fair.

722
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,640
It'll be like, at the end of the book, you'll be like, alright guys, thanks for reading my book.

723
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Be sure to subscribe.

724
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Hey guys, sorry I haven't written a book in a while.

725
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
That's something that's the first page of the book.

726
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I'm going to ring that notification bell so you can see when my next book is published.

727
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Hell yeah.

728
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Start your book out.

729
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Hey guys, sorry I haven't written a book in a while.

730
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
I've been pretty sick and I got a new microphone.

731
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,640
I got a keyboard, so sorry if the font is weird.

732
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I got a new typewriter.

733
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
Damn, that's good.

734
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,640
The thing is though, I need to actually get in actually impressive shape before I write

735
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
anything along those lines.

736
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Maybe this year.

737
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Yeah, you need to be at least 20 feet tall.

738
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,640
You need to be fucking ripped for the photo on the front of the book.

739
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
That's unironically true.

740
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
It's unironically true.

741
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
That's true.

742
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
I think so.

743
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Who's going to want to listen to some fat fuck who just like, maybe he went to school

744
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
for nutrition.

745
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
There's two ways.

746
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,640
You've got to be really jacked on the cover or you can be like a sort of old guy.

747
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Like a healthy family man kind of thing.

748
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
You can be like a family if you're a doctor.

749
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,640
If you're a doctor you can just look like a pretty good shape family man.

750
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Yeah, I buy that.

751
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I buy that.

752
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
But that's what Scooby always says.

753
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Like the reason that you're shirtless is like, these are the goods folks.

754
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Take a look.

755
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
This is what you get.

756
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
The proof is in the pudding.

757
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,640
He says jiggling his pecs, pudding-like.

758
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Gross.

759
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
Dude, you know who's pudding-like?

760
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
My dog.

761
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
Gross.

762
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
But he sits down.

763
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Okay, I'm just saying.

764
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Sessho, Lord's a showbrew.

765
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Looks like a streamlined alpha male athlete most of the time when he's up and he's squeaking

766
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
on his frog pepe.

767
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
I didn't realize.

768
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,640
But when he sits down and his skin becomes loose.

769
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
He looks like a lasagna.

770
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
And it's dope.

771
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Yeah, he looks like a straight lasagna.

772
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
I didn't realize he's like part corgi, right?

773
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
So he's pretty squat.

774
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Sessho is half corgi and half beagle is what they tell us.

775
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
I don't know if I believe that.

776
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
But that's what they say when we got him.

777
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
He's pretty based.

778
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
He shows up in the new Weagua.

779
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Go check it out, everybody.

780
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Yeah, I saw you cradling him.

781
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Oh, yes.

782
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
My new, my Poochiana.

783
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
He's a funny guy.

784
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,640
Dude, somebody commented, he is a funny guy.

785
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
He's a good lad.

786
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,640
I was like, oh, I caught a new weird Alolan Poochiana or a weird fucking Radita or whatever.

787
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
But someone said, no, no, no, Nate, you're wrong.

788
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,640
What he is is he's a, what, I think it's a rock and rough, like that rock Pokemon from

789
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Alola.

790
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Rock and rough.

791
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Yeah.

792
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Rock, rough and like and rock.

793
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Rock, rough.

794
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
He is most like a rock, rough that guy.

795
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
You're right.

796
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
You win.

797
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Why is there no corgi Pokemon?

798
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Hmm.

799
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
I don't know.

800
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
There's not many dogs.

801
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
What was that crack?

802
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Crack was a, was that big fluffy guy who's a Scotty or something.

803
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Oh God.

804
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
What's, what's the fucking?

805
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Yeah.

806
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I can't remember.

807
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
Skit.

808
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Skit.

809
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Oh, it was, it was a skit.

810
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
I don't remember.

811
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,640
It was, it was like, it was like, it was like Mayan.

812
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,640
It was like, man, I had my Spanish teacher in high school.

813
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Mr. Remember Mr. Cibella?

814
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
Of course.

815
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Yeah.

816
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Mr. Cibella, he taught us how to pronounce like Mayan or Incan language and like, I

817
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,640
remember, I remember one word in whatever fucking language it was like, it was like,

818
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
like that was a word.

819
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Yeah.

820
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
What do you mean?

821
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
I don't, whatever.

822
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Like, I don't know.

823
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
That's important.

824
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,640
It had like, it had like, you know, weird glottal stops and like all these weird things

825
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,640
about it were important to the meaning that like in English is not even.

826
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Damn.

827
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
That's cool.

828
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
That's how I remember it.

829
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I think that's, I said it a lot.

830
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
I remember I said a lot.

831
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,440
So I hope I, I really want to, I want to learn a language like that or something like Chinese

832
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
where like inflection itself like makes a big difference in like what you're actually

833
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
saying.

834
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
It just sounds really cool.

835
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
I want to awaken my brain to that.

836
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
I took China in college.

837
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
It was very weird to speak it.

838
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Do you say you took Chinese?

839
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Yeah.

840
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
In college.

841
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Oh, that's cool.

842
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
So, so, so you know a little bit about that.

843
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Yeah.

844
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,440
It was weird like having to like, because like you have to know the different tones and

845
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,340
like they have like a tongue twister where like it's just the same word like five times

846
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
but the tone changes.

847
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Yeah.

848
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
That's a good exercise.

849
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Do you remember how it goes?

850
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
No, I do not remember.

851
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Fuck.

852
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,840
There's a tongue twister in the thing and it sounds like all the words are very similar.

853
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Dude, hit us with it.

854
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,840
What does it mean?

855
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Okay.

856
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,840
So there's a very, there's a repeat of the word good.

857
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah.

858
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Yeah.

859
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,840
So it's like good men drink good class in a good forest.

860
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
I think that's.

861
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Wait.

862
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Drink, drink good what?

863
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
A class.

864
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
It's a, it's a type of drink.

865
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,340
It's not alcoholic sort of.

866
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,340
It's made out of bread, I think.

867
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,340
Whoa.

868
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Whoa.

869
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
Cool.

870
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,340
That's not keto.

871
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Not at all.

872
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
Wait, wait.

873
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
Out of dark bread.

874
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Say it again.

875
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,340
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

876
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
I love it.

877
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,340
I love it.

878
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
I do.

879
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
It sounds like a one-piece villain laugh.

880
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
Like a special.

881
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
He does.

882
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
He fucking does.

883
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Is Lithuanian, does it have any of that inflection stuff that like Chinese does, or is it just

884
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,080
like that the words are automatapias or not automatapias, but you know, synonyms or whatever

885
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,840
the fucking word where they sound the same, but they are the same.

886
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Some words do, but in this case, it's just, it's just the words are very similar.

887
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Yeah.

888
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Okay.

889
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,840
In English, we got, we got the buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, which is a sentence.

890
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
Is it?

891
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Yeah.

892
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Yeah.

893
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,340
Buffalo the verb, buffalo from buffalo or something.

894
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,840
What the hell does buffalo the verb mean?

895
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
I don't know.

896
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,340
That's the one that fits me up.

897
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,840
It's like, it's like archaic, but it means to like bother or bully someone, I think,

898
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
like fuck with someone.

899
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Okay, that's pretty cool.

900
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Or no, no, irritate.

901
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,340
It means to irritate someone is to buffalo them.

902
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,840
Ladies and gentlemen out there, learn a second language because it's fucking dope and you

903
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
won't regret it.

904
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
It's super fun.

905
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:07,840
First buffalo, adjective, second buffalo, noun, third buffalo, verb, fourth buffalo,

906
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,840
adjective, fifth buffalo, verb.

907
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,340
I think there's a longer sentence like that.

908
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,840
She has six in a row.

909
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
How weird is it?

910
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,840
I mean, when I had, I had a good English teacher in like eighth grade, Mr. Clark, I think,

911
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,840
and he like taught me everything I know about like adjectives, nouns, fucking adverbs,

912
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
gerunds, fucking infinitives or whatever.

913
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,840
I learned literally everything I know about grammar from that man and he was based as

914
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,840
fuck.

915
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,840
But beyond that, I learned even more about English by learning Japanese and like having

916
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,840
to stop and actually examine the language I was using.

917
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
I think I'm learning Japanese every time, every time someone says learning Japanese,

918
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
I do that.

919
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
So I'm just kidding.

920
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Well, let's make this the last time, shall we then?

921
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,340
I just, learning another fucking language is such a useful thing.

922
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,840
It's just so funny to me how I could have gone my whole life if I just hadn't had that

923
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,840
one class with Mr. Clark and I hadn't, you know, whatever, started to learn Japanese,

924
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,840
I would have never even examined the language that I'm using.

925
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,340
Like right now, I am not stopping to examine like the verbs and the nouns and the adjectives

926
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
and the sentences I'm using.

927
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,840
They just roll off my brain.

928
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,840
Yeah, it's just a way of like translating the thoughts.

929
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
It's pretty cool.

930
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,340
How are you so good at that?

931
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,340
Is that weird?

932
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,840
It's pretty fucking weird.

933
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,340
It's pretty fucking unique.

934
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,840
It's pretty unique in the animal kingdom.

935
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
Oh, that reminds me of something.

936
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Like I was thinking a while ago about like drawing and how like, you know, everyone can

937
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,840
draw, but like the longer it takes for you to start drawing, the harder it is.

938
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Because when you're a little baby, you pick things up incredibly quickly.

939
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,840
And language is like a prime example.

940
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,840
Like if you grow up around people speaking a language, you won't even need a class.

941
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,840
You'll just get it.

942
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,340
You'll understand it so inherently that it will be hard to like forget it ever.

943
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,340
And then it seems to be so.

944
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,340
Shit.

945
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
It's cool.

946
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,840
But it's also annoying because like if I wanted to learn a language, I should have been doing

947
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,340
it since I was 10 or any skill.

948
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,340
I heard that like kids raised in like bilingual homes that grow up bilingual, like are just

949
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,340
smarter.

950
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,340
They just like do better on tests.

951
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,340
It's just better, man.

952
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
It's just better.

953
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,340
I think.

954
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,840
I mean, I started learning English since I was four.

955
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,840
So I, and I'm not, I'm not smart.

956
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,840
You've got mage here, the counter example to this whole idea.

957
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,840
Meg Tao, Meg Tao, Meg Tao.

958
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,840
Mage Tao, mage Tao.

959
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
The funny thing about.

960
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
Yeah.

961
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,840
No, no, my weakness.

962
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Tom, what were you saying?

963
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
I was just going to say the, cause you were talking about the tones and stuff and like

964
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,840
the different like, like annunciations on words.

965
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,340
The interesting thing I learned in the Chinese class was that the teacher was saying like,

966
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,340
oh yeah.

967
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,840
The interesting thing about Chinese music is that in order to like stay on pitch, you

968
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,340
have to like say the word with a tone that's actually a different word and you just have

969
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,340
to know through like context clues what they're actually trying to say.

970
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,340
That makes sense.

971
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,340
That makes sense.

972
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,340
That's tougher.

973
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,340
Oh wait, by the way, I just want to say Tom, learn Chinese, communist, confirm.

974
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,340
Yeah.

975
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,340
Yeah.

976
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,340
Make sense.

977
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,340
All right.

978
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,340
Did you guys hear Econ speak any Chinese?

979
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,340
No, I don't think they ever have.

980
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,340
Not much.

981
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:22,840
Maybe he just did use around, but no, sometimes like, oh, we went out to, that's really funny.

982
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,840
We were, when he was first got here, we were walking around in like Chinatown, you know,

983
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,840
cause like, I think me and Munchie were just taking him, just going, oh and Zen.

984
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:36,340
It was me, Munchie, Zen and Econ and we walked around and we went to Chinatown and we went

985
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,840
to that bubble tea place, Tito.

986
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,840
Bubble tea.

987
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
And yeah.

988
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
That's good to hear.

989
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,340
Like, they wouldn't do it with no sugar.

990
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,340
Oh yeah, yeah, no keto.

991
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:54,340
He tried to order in Chinese and he was very disappointed when the people speaking there

992
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,340
didn't speak Chinese.

993
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,340
But then we went to a restaurant.

994
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,340
We went to this restaurant, Nate, we went to this restaurant later.

995
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,840
Remember that place with the round table, the spinny round table?

996
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,340
Yeah, it was Chinese as fuck, I remember.

997
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,340
It was Chinese as fuck.

998
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,840
And we went there with him before and he, the wait staff there speak terrible, terrible

999
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,340
English and it's very irritating cause they don't know phrases that they really should

1000
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,340
know, like, split the check.

1001
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,340
They should know what split the check means.

1002
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,340
You should learn that in fucking English cause they're gonna fucking live in America.

1003
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,340
But so, so he, so he.

1004
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,340
Build the wall, build the wall, build the wall.

1005
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,340
But he did, he talked to them in Chinese and they talked back to him.

1006
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,340
That's cool.

1007
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,340
And man, God, and he ordered that fucking, the stinky tofu.

1008
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,340
The stinky tofu.

1009
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,340
Yeah.

1010
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
It was horrible.

1011
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,840
It was the most horrible smell and taste.

1012
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,840
It tasted exactly like it smelled.

1013
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
Oh, he loved it.

1014
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,840
I bet, I bet though, I bet Econ was just lording that club.

1015
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,840
He was just absolutely dominating the social space.

1016
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
He absolutely was.

1017
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,840
But it's funny cause like his, his voice, like the way that he speaks, like he has a,

1018
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,840
he doesn't have an accent, but he has a way of speaking that is unusual.

1019
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,840
But when he speaks in Chinese, it makes perfect sense.

1020
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
It's like.

1021
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
Yeah.

1022
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,840
I mean, what's his, is his first language Chinese?

1023
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
I mean, I don't know.

1024
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
Yeah, he grew up in China.

1025
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,840
Really?

1026
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,340
For some, I don't know how long.

1027
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,340
For some reason.

1028
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,340
Maybe he was born there.

1029
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
I don't know.

1030
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,340
I wouldn't have made the same choice.

1031
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,340
He is huge.

1032
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,340
I think he, yeah.

1033
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,340
His first language is Chinese, but he moved to America when he was pretty young.

1034
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,340
I mean, yeah.

1035
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,340
His English is like perfect.

1036
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,340
So, you know.

1037
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,340
Yeah.

1038
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,340
Anyway.

1039
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,340
That's a.

1040
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,340
Cultures are cool.

1041
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,340
Languages are cool.

1042
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,140
Seriously, people, you won't even know, learn a fucking other language.

1043
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,340
It's so beneficial.

1044
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,340
I feel so bad I have not kept up on my Japanese.

1045
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,340
I'll get back to it.

1046
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,840
I think he said that like he was talking to the waitress in Chinese and then, you know,

1047
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,840
he's saying all his, he's saying all his weird moon speak and whatever and then he gets done

1048
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,840
and he's like, yeah, she was, she was asking me if it was stinky enough.

1049
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Lol.

1050
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:59,840
And oh, it was, I mean, she didn't need to ask in my opinion.

1051
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:06,140
I really should like, I've always felt like I want to learn Arabic and I've never really

1052
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,140
even thought.

1053
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,640
I've never really even taken the first steps into figuring out where I could learn something

1054
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,640
like that.

1055
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,840
But I, but I feel like, you know, those Arabs over there, if you go to Arabia, if you go

1056
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,040
to the Middle East, they don't really like Western white people.

1057
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,040
But if you speak their language, they'll be like, I guess he's okay.

1058
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,840
I guess, I guess we won't like detain him for no reason.

1059
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,600
I hope you're saying it works that way.

1060
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,840
They love Westerners and like, what's that one that's like the Dubai, like Dubai?

1061
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,540
That's India.

1062
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,540
That's a little different.

1063
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,540
That's not India.

1064
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,540
Dubai is fucking and it's like next to Saudi Arabia.

1065
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,540
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,540
It's like, it's like a little offshoot.

1067
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,540
What am I thinking of?

1068
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,540
Like Princeton or whatever.

1069
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,540
What am I thinking of?

1070
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,540
I don't know.

1071
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,540
I don't know.

1072
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,540
You're thinking of India, I think.

1073
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,540
Well, there's a, at least I, okay.

1074
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,540
I got to double check this.

1075
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,540
Are you thinking of like, Bouddha, the Buddha?

1076
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,540
No.

1077
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
Okay.

1078
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,540
Yeah.

1079
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,540
I'm right.

1080
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,540
Dubai is in fact next to Saudi Arabia.

1081
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,540
Okay.

1082
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,040
Well, I'm thinking of New Delhi or something.

1083
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
Yeah.

1084
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,140
Now, my English isn't even in India.

1085
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,240
The interesting thing about learning another language, at least in my experience and Nate,

1086
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,940
you could like totally fucking shoot me down on this since you've studied Japanese.

1087
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,640
Is that priming my rifle and prepping my bullets?

1088
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,240
I think I've studied Japanese.

1089
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Okay.

1090
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
Okay.

1091
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
Last one.

1092
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Discuss.

1093
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Discuss.

1094
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
You better be.

1095
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
No.

1096
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,140
Like, in high school, I took a little bit of Spanish and I took a lot of German.

1097
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,140
I didn't learn anything.

1098
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,440
It was very difficult for me, for my brain to understand.

1099
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:37,040
Because I was learning Chinese and it was totally like different, like it was just like

1100
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,240
characters and not like, you know, letters and stuff.

1101
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,340
And it was just like so different from the language I was used to.

1102
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,840
Instead of like looking at something like Spanish or German and approaching it thinking

1103
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,240
like, oh, trying, like my brain was trying to like look at those words as I would in

1104
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
English and like pronouncing them in English.

1105
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,640
With Chinese, it was so separate.

1106
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,540
I just like, this is something totally new.

1107
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,840
And I took to it much quicker than those other languages.

1108
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Yes.

1109
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Yes.

1110
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,340
I took it about the same way.

1111
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,740
Having to start from the absolute basic thing of you and learning what the fucking characters

1112
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,740
say.

1113
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,320
And like, just starting from that, forming the simplest possible things of that way, totally

1114
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,240
made me step into it from a new perspective.

1115
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,240
Yeah, it was great.

1116
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,780
I studied, I studied a little bit of Japanese when I was younger and you know, I just learned

1117
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,780
the very basics.

1118
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,780
But it was really interesting just how like their whole sentences are just structured

1119
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,780
like different.

1120
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,760
It's just like the way that like the word no is used, for example.

1121
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,360
You mean like the possessive no?

1122
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Yeah, the possessive no.

1123
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Yeah, yeah.

1124
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
But how like the order is reversed.

1125
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,200
How do you describe the possessive no?

1126
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,320
You don't say, you don't say, you don't say Ben's cock, for example.

1127
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,920
You say cock, you say cock-o-no Ben.

1128
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,080
No, that's actually not true.

1129
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:55,280
You say, I mean, if you want to say like my cock, it'd be like what Tashino cock.

1130
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,280
That's what I said.

1131
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,280
You fuck.

1132
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,280
No, you put Ben second.

1133
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
You said cock-no-ben.

1134
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
No, I didn't.

1135
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
Wait, really?

1136
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
I think so.

1137
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
Okay.

1138
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,260
Well, the point is you put the pronoun or the noun or pronoun first, which, okay, maybe

1139
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,260
Ben meant to do that, whatever.

1140
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, it's reversed.

1141
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,100
No, dog, you say what Tashino like Ken would be like my fist or whatever.

1142
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,820
Wait, no, it wasn't the order.

1143
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:23,060
It was like that like, oh God, well, okay, but the possessive doesn't mean, see, this

1144
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,980
is, see, okay, obviously this was a long time ago and I forgot shit, but it like, it doesn't

1145
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,080
mean, it's not the same as like the possessive.

1146
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,960
It's like, does, can you use the possessive to mean like other things than like ownership

1147
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
or something?

1148
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,080
Like, like, you can just use it to like say other things.

1149
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,080
Maybe probably.

1150
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
It has like a broader application.

1151
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,080
Nothing comes to mind, but it doesn't sound crazy.

1152
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,200
Oh no, I'm thinking of adjectives, right?

1153
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Don't you say like, don't you, you, you put the adjective second, right?

1154
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,000
You do put the ad, oh yeah, I'm just gonna say like big truck.

1155
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You put like truck and yeah, yeah.

1156
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Something like that.

1157
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,020
That's what I'm thinking.

1158
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:00,500
It's a bit similar to German, they always put the verb second.

1159
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,020
I just drew the verb.

1160
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,420
And then if there's another verb, like a second year verb, these sort of put it last, something

1161
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,420
like that, it's been a while.

1162
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,420
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

1163
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,420
It's tough to keep all these things like that.

1164
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,220
Languages are weird.

1165
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,860
We all need to learn Esperanto, so we can all talk to each other.

1166
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,860
I wouldn't mind that.

1167
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,860
I suppose I wouldn't mind that.

1168
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,940
Although, you know, when it comes to, when it comes to language, that's when I start

1169
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,740
to think like, wow, cultures are cool because I like doing like looking at different languages

1170
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,280
and it makes you think differently too, depending on what language you're using.

1171
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,320
Like the fact that Japanese has different tenses for politeness.

1172
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,960
Like that, when I learned that, I was like, what the fuck is that about?

1173
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,080
That's just like, that's so informative of the culture itself.

1174
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
No, for sure.

1175
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,080
It's cool.

1176
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,320
I think, I don't think something like Esperanto should like replace languages as we have now,

1177
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
but I think everyone should just learn it.

1178
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,760
Maybe that's just everyone new Esperanto in addition to like, yeah, yeah.

1179
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,360
So like you had a way of talking to other people and it'd be a great way of like opening

1180
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,420
up the world to more like experiences.

1181
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,820
Like if you can just go somewhere knowing, being confident that someone speaks like the

1182
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,580
same tongue you do and then like you can slowly like learn more shit.

1183
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,820
This is relatively recent, but like at the UN, because like it's people from like everyone

1184
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,820
in the fucking world.

1185
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,060
The reason that all the representatives have those little earpieces is because they've got

1186
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,780
translators like working on their staff who understand whoever happens to be speaking.

1187
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,540
Maybe it's a fucking Arab guy and you've got like a French dude, they, they like on their

1188
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,560
staff.

1189
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,360
They have like a guy who speaks French and Arab translating live into their ear so that

1190
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
everyone can communicate.

1191
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,520
And it's like, I mean, that's really cumbersome, but like that's also cool that that's all

1192
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,520
happening.

1193
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,600
That guy's job is going to get replaced with Google assistant at some point.

1194
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
That's true.

1195
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,600
I give him five years, he better be looking for a new job.

1196
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,760
My favorite thing about different languages and cultures is that, you know, I can Google

1197
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:54,820
some, some cool shit and then I can get information as to like how to make, to come up with my

1198
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,140
own world building.

1199
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,180
Like I can base things off of stuff that happened in other countries that I'm not aware of at

1200
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,020
the moment because like, you know, I'm thinking of a name of a place and I'm thinking what

1201
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:12,700
sort of place it's like and I just researched places that exist and civilizations and cultures

1202
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,440
and it's just like, you get, you get really good ideas because like humans, they're, they're

1203
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,720
very different depending on where they like evolved and grew up all over the world.

1204
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:28,600
I only know what it's like to be me, just like if I want to, if I want to write stories

1205
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,440
about all sorts of weird, wacky, fantastical places, I need to know a lot about what humans

1206
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,760
have done and it's cool.

1207
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,760
Yeah.

1208
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,160
My favorite thing about there being different cultures is that I'm in the best one, baby,

1209
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,740
in the US of A.

1210
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:48,500
Fill that wall, say can you see by the darkness.

1211
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,260
It feels good to be number one.

1212
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,380
I'm launching the nukes right now.

1213
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,380
No.

1214
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,380
No.

1215
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,380
Does England have nukes?

1216
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,500
I don't think they have nukes.

1217
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
We have nukes.

1218
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
They're just like really.

1219
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
I think you're bluffing.

1220
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,060
No, we have a nuclear program.

1221
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,060
That's all I know.

1222
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,260
It was brought up in the recent, like, well, that recent, it's like what do we do with

1223
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,260
the nukes, huh?

1224
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,260
What do we do with that nuclear program?

1225
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,960
Who doesn't have a nuclear program?

1226
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
Yeah.

1227
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,760
I got a nuclear program in my backyard right now.

1228
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Yeah.

1229
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
Yeah.

1230
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,520
I got a fission, I got a fission reaction for you.

1231
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,480
Hey, remember in Watchmen when Richard Nixon is like, let's see, I'm trying to think their

1232
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,720
way out of fission?

1233
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,000
That's a stupid line and I hate it.

1234
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,240
That's all.

1235
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:39,320
Well, isn't that supposed to be like Nixon is dumb and that's why I said it?

1236
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
Okay.

1237
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
Yeah.

1238
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
Shit.

1239
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
It's embarrassing.

1240
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,220
I feel embarrassed for him when he says that.

1241
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,260
Hippo said that like, oh, isn't Nixon supposed to be stupid and then my brain immediately

1242
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,140
got trapped and like, oh God, if Watchmen was made today, it would be some weird Trump

1243
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,740
parody and it would be so awful and I would hate it.

1244
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,740
It fucking would be true.

1245
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,060
Wait, well, hang on.

1246
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,660
Watchmen was set in the past when it was made, right?

1247
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,660
Yes.

1248
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,400
But I'm saying it would probably be like W. It'd be like W being stupid.

1249
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
Yeah.

1250
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
I don't want to relate to these things.

1251
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,800
In a few decades, there will be something where Trump is like, you know, the bad guy

1252
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,880
and he's like, ah, he's dumb.

1253
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,640
I'm looking forward to future where we make jokes about how dumb we were back when we

1254
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,480
elected Trump and what a crazy time in America's history.

1255
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,480
Guys, isn't like the newest purge kind of like poking fun at Trump sort of?

1256
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:45,540
And by the way, Trump, he embarrasses me every day.

1257
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,940
Our country embarrasses.

1258
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,940
You guys know what I'm doing.

1259
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,940
I'm doing the Quentin reviews thing.

1260
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,940
All right.

1261
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,940
Oh yeah.

1262
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,940
Okay.

1263
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,940
I don't give a shit.

1264
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,940
Just Trump really embarrassed America that much.

1265
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,940
I just don't pay attention.

1266
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:59,700
I think he sounds like an idiot sometimes, but I don't know.

1267
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:05,180
One thing I always feel is that I hate, I hate them, the majority.

1268
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,680
Like when the majority hates Trump, I'm like, well, maybe he's not so bad.

1269
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,440
Maybe he's actually okay.

1270
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,600
And then everybody in the normal media that I've known all my life to be annoying and

1271
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,600
stupid is this time also being annoying and stupid.

1272
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,800
And Trump is just kind of an idiot sometimes.

1273
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,360
I mean, it seems super clear to me that it's just, so they're trying to apply the standard

1274
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,360
rule set of like, like if Obama said the things that Trump said, like, yes, people would

1275
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,880
freak out and they'd be upset, but Trump, like he's literally just doesn't give a fuck.

1276
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,620
He just is like, I'm just going to fucking meme on these people literally.

1277
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,580
And so it's just, it's just kind of weird to apply like the same standard because he's

1278
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,100
not trying to do it.

1279
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,220
And no matter, I just feel like people get that like, no matter how much they try to

1280
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,780
say like, if Obama did this, you know, we'd all be pissed.

1281
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:52,780
Trump just is a different guy and he just doesn't give a fuck.

1282
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,780
And I kind of just respect that because I also don't give a fuck.

1283
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,300
I mean, I respect not giving a fuck.

1284
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,300
Yeah.

1285
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,300
That's it.

1286
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,300
That's all I'm saying.

1287
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,300
Yeah.

1288
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,200
We should have somebody who does give a fuck.

1289
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,200
I guess that's the thing.

1290
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Yeah.

1291
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
Actually, I take that.

1292
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,860
The thing is, well, the thing like, you know, the current thing that's happening where the

1293
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:16,800
government is shut down because Trump is not getting his way, um, well, it's not all

1294
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,800
on him though.

1295
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,800
It's not all on him.

1296
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,920
The other guy is, you know, no, no, no, I like it because, um, it's the first time

1297
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,640
I've seen a politician like push so hard for their own policy that they were elected

1298
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,640
for.

1299
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
Yeah.

1300
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,640
And I mean, the horrible though.

1301
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,640
But that's a fucking horrible thing to do.

1302
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:37,500
Well, yeah, but like, I just, I just think that I would prefer politicians to be crazy

1303
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:43,540
and very like, like, like, I would prefer them to be like more true to their word than

1304
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,500
Ben, you know, they have been for the last billion years where everything they say is

1305
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,340
false because they don't actually do anything that they're going to do.

1306
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,300
People say that Trump is the most honest president we've ever had, which I don't have.

1307
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,380
I don't have insight into that, but like, I just like the honesty.

1308
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,380
It's really nice.

1309
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,120
His name's Honest Abe.

1310
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:07,240
Well, Ben, you say that it's horrible, but like, like from another perspective, like

1311
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:12,120
what Trump's doing, you could argue, is fighting really, really hard for the, the one issue

1312
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,360
that he mostly got elected on.

1313
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,800
And isn't it fair for him to really fight for the thing that the people elected him

1314
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,800
for?

1315
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,800
Whether or not you agree with it?

1316
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,760
No, it's not, it's not fighting.

1317
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,560
He's shutting down the government is like refusing to have the fight because he knows

1318
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,540
that if the fight happens now, he'll lose.

1319
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,340
Well, that's not true though, because like the point, what the government shut down

1320
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,540
over is that like the proposed budget that the, whatever, the Senate has given him or

1321
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,540
whatever does not include allocation for him making the wall.

1322
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,500
And like because he has said, well, that's unacceptable, go make one that does have,

1323
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
you know, funding for the wall.

1324
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,220
They have said, no, we're not going to do that.

1325
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,940
So it's that stalemate that has, you know, like now the government is not funded because

1326
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,620
that money has not come through.

1327
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,560
So because we're in that position, it's like, okay, Trump could give in and say like, okay,

1328
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,200
I guess we'll just fund the government.

1329
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,960
Now those people who currently aren't at work or whatever.

1330
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,880
Boy, and what a shame that would, what a concession that would be.

1331
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,600
Well, I mean, that would be a massive concession because that was his main thing.

1332
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,200
That was his number one issue.

1333
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,960
You can't, you can't just not have the government because your fucking bill isn't going through.

1334
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,360
I don't know, the libertarians are pretty happy about it.

1335
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,580
But libertarians can go, can take a long walk off a short pier.

1336
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:33,140
I mean, I feel, I legitimately feel bad for everybody who's like, who is, you know, isn't

1337
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,700
at work because of all this shit that totally sucks.

1338
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,460
And I, you know, like I'm very far removed, I'm very far removed from what's happening

1339
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,460
at the moment.

1340
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,180
I just like, I just like that he's honest and like, like pushes for his stupid ideas

1341
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,900
that he has because I just don't see that anywhere else ever.

1342
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,280
There's something to like about it.

1343
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,280
Yeah.

1344
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,760
I mean, you know, and then people can absolutely come in and be like, no, it's irresponsible.

1345
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
It's not good.

1346
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
XYZ.

1347
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,040
But you just feel like the visceral, you know, Jesse-esque response of like, you know what?

1348
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,040
Fuck it.

1349
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,040
And there's something satisfying.

1350
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,480
We should, we should resist that.

1351
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,640
We should resist that.

1352
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,160
It's bad and it's bad.

1353
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,160
I hear what you're saying.

1354
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,160
And it's fucking bad.

1355
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,160
I hear what you're saying.

1356
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:16,200
Just, you can't, this is like, you know, I'm no expert.

1357
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,200
I'm no expert.

1358
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,360
Maybe I shouldn't even fucking open my big mouth, but like, I've heard, I've heard

1359
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:25,140
that like, this is sort of, this is like a Republican thing these days of just don't

1360
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:31,540
have, just don't govern, just filibuster until just, you won't, you won't, you won't get

1361
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,540
your way.

1362
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,180
So just like stun, stunlock everything so nothing happens until you can get your way.

1363
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,420
Why don't the Democrats do the same thing though?

1364
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,900
Is it because they're like better people?

1365
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,540
Is it as simple as that?

1366
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,540
Well, yeah.

1367
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,540
I mean, all right.

1368
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,700
There's an innuendo studios video about this and he, he says,

1369
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
Lib cuck the Lurt everybody.

1370
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,440
He's got some blue pills dropping.

1371
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,400
His argument basically is that just Dems are better people and more principle.

1372
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,520
Like Dems are acting out of principle while like Republicans are acting out of, you know,

1373
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,400
like this is what gets the job done, which I don't know, maybe whatever, who knows.

1374
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,920
But the point, I mean, it's still fucking shitty.

1375
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
I hate it.

1376
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,920
It's a gay.

1377
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,920
Let's talk about something else.

1378
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
All right.

1379
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,920
That's fair.

1380
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,300
Something else.

1381
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:24,980
Last few days, I've been going back to season one of Steven Universe and I wanted to re-watch

1382
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:25,980
it.

1383
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,980
Oh, no.

1384
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,100
What's, what's, what's bad about Steven?

1385
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,980
No, the first season.

1386
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,980
It's turning you gay.

1387
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,980
It's turning.

1388
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,980
Here's the thing.

1389
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,540
Didn't you hear he voted for Trump?

1390
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,540
Oh, yeah.

1391
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,540
Dude.

1392
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,540
Yeah.

1393
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,540
Steven Universe is old enough to vote now.

1394
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,540
Think about that.

1395
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,540
Feel old yet?

1396
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,540
All right.

1397
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:50,320
Like, um, I, I had heard all the time, like, uh, after I got into Steven Universe, other

1398
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:55,160
people had difficulty getting into it for things like, uh, ugh, Steven screams all the

1399
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,160
time.

1400
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,160
He's really annoying.

1401
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,080
And I was like, hmm, I haven't watched the season one in a while.

1402
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,080
Is that true?

1403
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,040
Does he, is he really annoying the whole time?

1404
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,720
And I have composed a list of, of the Steven episodes.

1405
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,880
I've watched the first season or the first half of the first season up until, uh, Lapis

1406
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,100
was introduced and then she flies off into space.

1407
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:22,740
Um, and I, I have, I have the numbers and I will post them in the chat.

1408
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,740
Oh shit.

1409
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,740
Okay.

1410
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:25,740
Wait, what numbers?

1411
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,740
What, what stats did you crunch?

1412
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:30,060
Is this going to be a new, give or take, uh, compilation video?

1413
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,740
Is that what you're, you're grooming right now?

1414
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,220
This is, uh, the, the, the, well, you'll see.

1415
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:42,860
Uh, okay, so this is, every episode is described as either good or shut up.

1416
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,840
Steven.

1417
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:49,560
And the link, the show notes, so like surprisingly, surprisingly, the first seven are not shut

1418
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,560
up Steven.

1419
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,560
They are actually good.

1420
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,520
And I liked the whole thing, but episode eight, 10 and 12, he does scream like basically

1421
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,520
all of his lines.

1422
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,880
He doesn't have a single soft spoken line in the whole episode.

1423
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,760
Uh, you can look them up or you can, whatever.

1424
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,200
Um, I think, I think, I think 12 is giant woman.

1425
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,600
He's like, please be a giant woman.

1426
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:15,500
It's a really good episode, but shut up, Steven, like he really wants to see a giant

1427
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:21,780
woman and I forgot how much, you know, don't we all know, I remember that like, I don't

1428
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:27,060
understand that, that he has that particular obsession in that one episode, but the raw

1429
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:32,540
emotions at the end where he's scared that, that, uh, you know, whatever, the opal won't

1430
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,540
like him or something.

1431
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:36,380
Oh, it's like, do you know who I am?

1432
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,380
And then she starts singing.

1433
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:38,380
Oh, yeah.

1434
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
That's the best.

1435
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,400
A C tune and two.

1436
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,400
A giant woman.

1437
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Oh, yes.

1438
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,520
That is Kino television right there, folks.

1439
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,720
Wait, he has a soft spoken line because he whispers a giant woman, theory busted.

1440
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,720
Debusted.

1441
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,720
No.

1442
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,720
It's hard destroyed by facts and logic.

1443
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:58,080
Yeah, facts don't care about your feelings, hippo, this list of moots.

1444
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,200
No, no, the shut up, Steven.

1445
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,280
I mean, 12 was like on the fence.

1446
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,280
I will admit.

1447
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,360
So eight and 10 are like, God damn, I get it now.

1448
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,660
I get why people are actually like, they quit at episode eight.

1449
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:14,420
But some people, I'm sure quit at episode one because he does scream a bit like about

1450
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,420
the cookie cat and stuff.

1451
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,420
Right.

1452
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,940
But like, overall, it's just a really good introduction to the whole like lore and the

1453
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:23,580
gems and the three of them and the, you know, all that stuff.

1454
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,580
Yeah.

1455
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:28,340
And the action and the animation in the first like 26 episodes is really good as well.

1456
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,340
It's just like, dang.

1457
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:36,060
Hey, time for me to show time for me to be a pedant and gripe about how I still wish

1458
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,080
they animated it traditionally instead of fucking flash.

1459
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Well, that ship is sailing now, hasn't it?

1460
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
What did you say, mage?

1461
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
I said you're an old fart.

1462
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,080
Like every episode.

1463
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,080
Oh, these old bones of mine.

1464
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Every episode.

1465
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,080
No, they all had.

1466
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,080
Every episode.

1467
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,080
You complain about the youth in some form.

1468
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,080
This isn't about the youth.

1469
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,080
This is the new youthful way of making cartoons.

1470
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,080
That pilot episode is old enough to be president now.

1471
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,100
Are you old yet?

1472
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,100
Okay.

1473
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,100
Look, you know, it looked really cool.

1474
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,100
It had that Rebecca Sugar style, which is way more unique than what we eventually got.

1475
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:19,100
They all had the scary Rebecca Sugar Voldemort noses and also maybe unpopular opinion.

1476
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,100
I know.

1477
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:25,100
I know I'm not allowed to say this as a cis white male, but I preferred Garnet's long

1478
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,100
straight hair to her big square afro.

1479
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,100
There I said it.

1480
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,100
That's a race war right there, ladies and gentlemen.

1481
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,100
It has begun.

1482
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,100
Yeah.

1483
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,100
Okay.

1484
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,120
So according to that's a race war.

1485
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
I looked to my left.

1486
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,120
That's a race war.

1487
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,120
I looked to my right.

1488
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,120
That's a race war.

1489
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,120
I do.

1490
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,120
I do.

1491
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
I do prefer the newer Pearl design in a way.

1492
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,120
In a sense.

1493
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,120
I don't know what I just think.

1494
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,120
Oh, New Pearl is way better.

1495
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,120
Way better.

1496
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,120
I just didn't like her.

1497
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,120
No.

1498
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,120
No.

1499
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,120
No.

1500
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,120
Listen.

1501
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,120
I just didn't like her old outfit.

1502
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,120
It looked weird.

1503
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,120
You mean in the pilot?

1504
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,120
Yeah.

1505
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,120
I don't remember what outfit she had in the pilot.

1506
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
I just.

1507
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
It's a gay ass shit boy.

1508
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
It was way cool.

1509
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,120
It was way cool.

1510
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,120
And the real show is lame.

1511
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,140
But what do you even mean anyway?

1512
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,140
Like with flash.

1513
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:09,140
Like all the animation is drawn with a pen of some kind.

1514
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,140
It's on a tablet, but it's with a pen.

1515
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,140
Okay.

1516
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,140
What do you mean?

1517
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,140
Well, I mean, have you seen the pilot?

1518
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,140
I haven't watched it in this rewatch.

1519
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,140
Because I didn't like it the first time.

1520
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:25,140
It looks way cooler in this man's.

1521
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,140
But I remember Stephen being like a lard blob.

1522
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,140
Yeah, it's a lard blob.

1523
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,140
Look at these freaks.

1524
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,140
Yeah, look at them.

1525
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,160
It's great.

1526
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,160
I don't like the pros.

1527
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,160
Just for the record.

1528
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:46,160
Episode 8, 10, and 12 are given shut up Stephen episodes.

1529
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,160
And according to this list, Episode 8 is Sirius Stephen.

1530
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,160
Episode 10 is Stephen's lion.

1531
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,160
And Episode 12 is Giant Woman.

1532
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,160
So there you go.

1533
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,160
Those are the ones that suck.

1534
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,160
Well, they don't suck.

1535
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,180
I enjoyed every episode.

1536
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:06,180
It was just like I could see what people were saying when he was shouting constantly.

1537
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,180
The other ones, he does shout in basically all of them.

1538
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,180
But it's not annoying to me until those ones.

1539
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:19,180
I've said it before, but I have come back myself multiple times to just watch Stephen Universe.

1540
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:22,180
Because Stephen Universe has a very unique, extremely...

1541
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:26,180
I don't use this word often, but it's an extremely comfy atmosphere.

1542
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,200
And I just like immersing myself in it.

1543
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
Just watching the episodes of Stephen Universe.

1544
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,200
Kind of in a way that I haven't with any other show.

1545
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,200
But I imagine it's why people like Hitamari's sketch.

1546
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,200
Probably for the same kind of reason.

1547
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,200
It's just comfortable, I guess.

1548
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
Since we're just talking about Stephen Universe,

1549
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
do you know what's up with the new Stephen Bomb quote unquote?

1550
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,200
Because it's not really a bomb.

1551
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,200
It's not like weekly episodes, aren't they?

1552
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,200
Yeah, but it's off the air now, right?

1553
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,200
I mean, they're just...

1554
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,200
No, there's one more tomorrow.

1555
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:57,220
As of the recording on the 20th, the 21st is one more coming out.

1556
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,220
Shit!

1557
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,220
And it's like 44 minutes, isn't it?

1558
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,220
Shit!

1559
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,220
It's our big one.

1560
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,220
They actually made a real episode for once.

1561
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,220
Not a piece of shit, maybe episode.

1562
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:14,220
Well, I mean, I'm gonna watch that shit.

1563
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,220
The last bomb I watched was so disappointing.

1564
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,220
I wasn't hyped for more Stephen.

1565
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,220
Look, White Diamond is cool.

1566
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:22,220
The shit about Pink Diamond is pretty cool.

1567
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,240
Connie was an idiot these episodes.

1568
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,240
I mean, I don't know.

1569
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:33,240
Honestly, no character is at all interesting or important right now, except for White Diamond.

1570
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
The other two diamonds are kind of okay.

1571
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,240
And Stephen.

1572
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,240
Also Pearl a little bit, because we're gonna find out a little bit more about Pearl's backstory, probably.

1573
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,240
So that's cool.

1574
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,240
I feel like Pearl was...

1575
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,240
I mean, it's pretty obvious that she was White Diamond's Pearl.

1576
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,240
Me and Michelle have had an ongoing debate for years, I think, at this point.

1577
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,240
I still don't accept that our Pearl was originally White Diamond's Pearl.

1578
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,240
Michelle will go to her grave thinking this.

1579
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,240
Why? Why not?

1580
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,240
I just feel that way, I guess.

1581
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,240
I don't know.

1582
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
What would be so crazy about that?

1583
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
My feelings don't care about your facts, Stephen Universe.

1584
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,240
Okay, okay, guys.

1585
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:20,240
I just want to say the only thing I could put my foot down, at least one foot on, that our Pearl was not originally Pink Diamond.

1586
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,240
Pink Diamond's Pearl.

1587
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,240
We know that for sure, yes.

1588
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,240
Whether she was White Diamond's Pearl is...

1589
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,240
She probably was.

1590
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:32,240
I definitely feel like based on the way White Diamond acts towards Pink,

1591
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,240
like, you're just a little, you know, whatever, little girl, just run along.

1592
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:43,240
I could imagine that she gave Pearl to her to look, you know, to monitor her, to make sure she doesn't get into trouble.

1593
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,240
But then Pearl was like, oh, but I love her.

1594
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,240
And then they eloped, basically.

1595
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,240
Why hasn't Pearl talked about White Diamond yet if she was White Diamond's Pearl?

1596
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,240
She's got to have insider information.

1597
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,240
She was fucking White Diamond's Pearl.

1598
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,240
That's not even secret information. Just tell us about it, Pearl.

1599
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,240
She could be the new replacement Pearl after the other Pearl was...

1600
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,240
Maybe she had another secrecy curse put upon her.

1601
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,240
Man, Pearl, fuck off. Just get over it already.

1602
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,240
Just be real.

1603
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,240
Just be cool, Pearl. Why can't you just be cool?

1604
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,240
Like us and the procrastinators.

1605
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,240
She needs to buy the I'm Just Being Cool t-shirt.

1606
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,240
She does need to buy that.

1607
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:29,240
Did you see Zen Huxtable's video, Responding to Sarah Z's video, Responding to Lily Pete's video about why set Rebecca Sugar as a fascist?

1608
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,240
I don't... Oh, did you say a fascist?

1609
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,240
Jesus Christ. What did you just say?

1610
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:39,240
Wait, wait, you guys know about Lily Pete's video that says that the show is fascist, right?

1611
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,240
No.

1612
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,240
I'm up today on every video the little ones make.

1613
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,240
I'm deep in there.

1614
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,240
How can you be that little billy? Say that Steven Universe is fascist.

1615
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,240
The video was a big deal. It made the rounds.

1616
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,240
Okay, I guess I... Well, maybe I saw it, but I don't know.

1617
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,240
I'm surprised. It was a little while ago.

1618
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:58,240
Okay, so Lily Pete is an idiot and makes stupid things come out of her mouth whole.

1619
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:07,240
And this other lady, Sarah Z, responded to it, and I'm going off of what Zen Huxtable says,

1620
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:14,240
but responded to it wrong and criticized her on a bunch of things that she didn't actually say.

1621
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:19,240
And Zen made a video responding to that being like, hey, there's all this legitimate stuff to criticize

1622
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:24,240
and you fucked it up and just did it bad and made, you know, you fucked up, you dummy.

1623
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,240
Sure, good.

1624
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,240
Oh, fuck. No. No, I had a point, but I lost it.

1625
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,240
No!

1626
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,240
I don't know.

1627
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,240
So how come you get mired in drama?

1628
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,240
What were we talking about?

1629
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,240
We're talking about her and how she's being cool and wearing a t-shirt.

1630
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,240
I have had enough of, like, critique YouTube.

1631
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,240
Like, the whole, like, commentator YouTube.

1632
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,240
I agree.

1633
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,240
Like, scene is dumb.

1634
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,240
It's a meme that needs to die.

1635
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,240
It's basically YouTube comments, but in video form, a.k.a. worse.

1636
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,240
That's true.

1637
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,240
I have to wait, like, a certain amount of time before I can run away.

1638
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,240
I got it. I got it.

1639
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,240
The point is that Lily Pete said something about, like, you know, people, like,

1640
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,240
Cartoon Network released a video.

1641
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:09,240
It's like, uh, well, here's all the hints that we dropped all along the way that pink, that rose was pink diamond.

1642
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:14,240
And then there's a bunch of clips that do not prove it, that are totally, like, taken out of context

1643
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,240
and in context don't really suggest anything.

1644
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,240
And this is what Cartoon Network put out.

1645
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,240
Yes.

1646
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,240
But then, but Zen, I think Zen put in his video, like, there are actual hints.

1647
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,240
Like, there are actual moments when you can tell early.

1648
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:33,240
Like, there's moments where, like, it looks like Pearl, like, wants to say something but can't and it isn't remarked upon.

1649
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
Then, you know, later you find out there's a reason for that.

1650
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:42,240
So, like, there are actual, there are some actual, like, early hints towards it, but, like, Cartoon Network's trailer was, like, not them.

1651
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:50,240
It, like, just showed a bunch of fake shit that, like, clearly was trying to make it look more, uh, like, more telegraph than it actually was.

1652
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,240
Yeah, sure.

1653
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,240
Which annoys me a lot.

1654
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,240
Because I think it's dumb.

1655
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,240
I think I, it's a lame twist.

1656
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,240
It's a lame twist that sucks.

1657
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:00,240
And, yeah, I was like, well, that doesn't do anything to you.

1658
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,240
The Cartoon Network?

1659
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Yeah, yeah, I think I vaguely remember that.

1660
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,240
Yeah.

1661
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,240
It's poor.

1662
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,240
It's poor form.

1663
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,240
It was so unimpressed that I barely remembered it.

1664
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,240
You guys think that's a lame twist?

1665
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,240
I think that was a lame twist.

1666
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,240
It's bad.

1667
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:18,240
No, I mean, years and years ago, I suspected that, I mean, we all did, that fucking Rose was picked out.

1668
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,240
I did, I did, too.

1669
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,240
And that's why it was like...

1670
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,240
We've talked about this before.

1671
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,240
It's the combination of one.

1672
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:31,240
They really obfuscated and tried to cloud the air so that we wouldn't be able to guess, even though everyone already suspected.

1673
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:35,240
And then the payoff was just that, no, no, no, we were just trying to misdirect you.

1674
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:39,240
What you already believe and have theorized about at length was just true.

1675
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,240
That's just a boring twist, ultimately.

1676
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:46,240
I think Gravity Falls did it better when they were just like, oh, everyone's already figured out the big twist.

1677
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,240
We're going to reveal it early and go from there.

1678
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,240
Yeah, fair enough.

1679
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:55,240
We did talk about the same thing on the Steven Universe episode, which was what, like 100 years ago?

1680
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:00,240
That episode is old enough to be your granddad.

1681
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,240
Feel old yet.

1682
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:10,240
That episode was out when I was listening to Procrastinator's podcast, episode two, when you were still in short pants.

1683
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,240
Well, we did do a second Steven Universe episode, right?

1684
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,240
Yeah, we did Steven Two Universe.

1685
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,240
We got to do Steven Three Universe and something like that.

1686
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,240
Yeah, that's true.

1687
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,240
That's right.

1688
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,240
Yeah, we did two.

1689
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,240
We did two.

1690
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,240
Okay.

1691
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,240
That one's old enough to be your normal dad.

1692
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,240
Feel young yet?

1693
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,240
All right.

1694
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,240
It's a lineage.

1695
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,240
How about we get to the voicemails?

1696
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,240
What do you say?

1697
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,240
Let's do it.

1698
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,240
I think it's time.

1699
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,240
Okay, good.

1700
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,240
Good, good, good, good talk, everybody.

1701
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,240
Okay, so here we go.

1702
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,240
Voicemails, people.

1703
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,240
Speak pipe.

1704
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,240
You know the drill.

1705
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,240
Links below.

1706
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,240
Send us your shit.

1707
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,240
Okay, here we go.

1708
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,240
First voicemail.

1709
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,240
This is from Jaylin.

1710
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,240
Jaylin sending in a voicemail.

1711
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,240
Jaylin.

1712
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,240
It's time.

1713
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
Oh, am I in the right chat?

1714
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
Yes, I am.

1715
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,240
Go.

1716
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,240
We all know.

1717
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,240
Hey, PCP.

1718
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,240
It's me, Jaylin.

1719
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:58,240
And I just thought because I gave you a whole bunch of shackles this week that you could tell me that I'm a good guy.

1720
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,240
And worth having around even though I just found the voicemail.

1721
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,240
I know you've been waiting to hear from me for a long time.

1722
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,240
Oh, yeah.

1723
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Oh, yeah.

1724
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,240
Please play me on the show and tell me how great I am.

1725
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
Thanks.

1726
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,240
Play me off.

1727
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,240
Play me off, boys.

1728
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,240
Thanks for the money.

1729
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,240
I got none of those shackles.

1730
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,240
I am not bound by any contracts.

1731
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,240
That's true.

1732
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:26,240
Unless you accept your Jaylin name because he's on my server.

1733
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,240
He got a nickname.

1734
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,240
He's not happy about it.

1735
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,240
He's Jaylin.

1736
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,240
Is he Jaylin?

1737
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,240
He's Jaylin.

1738
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,240
He's totally Jaylin.

1739
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,240
He's Jaylin.

1740
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,240
Is he Jaylin like a felon?

1741
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,240
It's just jelly.

1742
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,240
And then at the end of the end, and Jaylin.

1743
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,240
Well, great.

1744
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,240
Glad we had this powwow.

1745
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,240
Like a felon.

1746
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,240
Like a felon with a lion.

1747
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,240
All right.

1748
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,240
Moving on.

1749
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Next one.

1750
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:49,240
We've got another fantastic call from Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1751
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,240
Let's see what he asks.

1752
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,240
Oh, excellent.

1753
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,240
Open a pack of Kraft Mac.

1754
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,240
Free cheese flavor.

1755
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Cook on the stove.

1756
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,240
Cook with love.

1757
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:07,240
Take a handful of honey barbecue Fritos.

1758
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,240
Mix it in.

1759
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,240
That's your din.

1760
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,240
Take a bite.

1761
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,240
Change your life.

1762
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:20,240
You just learned how to make Mac and Fritos on today's episode

1763
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,240
of Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1764
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,240
Yeah.

1765
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:28,240
Now you're cooking with calm.

1766
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,240
Thank you.

1767
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,240
Thank you, Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1768
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,240
Thank you so much.

1769
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,240
We're dropping another Knowledge Bomb.

1770
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,240
Mac and Fritos.

1771
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,240
I know what I'm having.

1772
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,240
Another alternative Knowledge Bomb.

1773
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,240
Something else you should make a book and get rich.

1774
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,240
That's true.

1775
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,240
That's true.

1776
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,240
Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1777
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,240
I know what I'm getting daddy to make me for dinden tonight.

1778
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,240
Okay.

1779
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,240
Next up.

1780
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,240
Mix it in.

1781
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,240
That's your din.

1782
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,240
Take a bite.

1783
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,240
Change your life.

1784
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,240
All right.

1785
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,240
Next up we've got a male from Female Spaghetti.

1786
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,240
Let's get ready.

1787
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,240
Go.

1788
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,240
Hey, hey, everypony.

1789
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:08,240
I just wanted to ask you, former MLP faggots at the PCP podcast.

1790
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,240
Be honest.

1791
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:15,240
How often did you used to masturbate to clop on hentai back in the old pony days?

1792
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:21,240
And if you're not too much of a pussy to admit the fact that you used to jerk it off to clop,

1793
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,240
please describe your favorite piece of pony porn you remember the most.

1794
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:30,240
Thank you, faggots, for being my background noise while I draw autistic weeaboo hentai.

1795
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,240
I love you all.

1796
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,240
Thank you very much.

1797
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:40,240
See, what I'm offended by is the presumption that we stopped jerking into popcorn.

1798
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,240
Damn.

1799
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:48,240
Dude, I regularly go back to Derpy Burrow to stock up.

1800
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
Hell yeah, dude.

1801
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,240
It's your one stop shop.

1802
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,240
I'm going to be straight with you, Female Spaghetti.

1803
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,240
Yep, did it in the past.

1804
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,240
Would do it again.

1805
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,240
They're anthropomorphized.

1806
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,240
I don't give a fuck.

1807
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:04,240
And the number one thing, my favorite clop porn of all, was it was called Apple Poker.

1808
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,240
It's an Applejack story about playing poker and then she fucks Braeburn.

1809
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,240
It's doggy style.

1810
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,240
I guess it's horse style.

1811
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,240
It's by Mitzis.

1812
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,240
It's a game.

1813
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,240
You can play it on the internet, Google it.

1814
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
It's good.

1815
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,240
It's high quality.

1816
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,240
There you go.

1817
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,240
Never.

1818
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,240
No?

1819
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,240
I don't believe you.

1820
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,240
Okay.

1821
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,240
You say so, kid.

1822
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:32,240
I mean, I don't remember any, I think I probably did, but the thing is that I don't care that

1823
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,240
they're horses.

1824
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,240
Okay, okay.

1825
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:41,240
I've seen clop porn that is bad and what's bad about it, when they do it with the boobs

1826
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,240
are in there.

1827
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,240
The horse boobs.

1828
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,240
That's disgusting.

1829
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,240
That's horrible.

1830
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:51,240
When they're anthropomorphized enough that the titties are where titties should be on

1831
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,240
a human, it's fine and it doesn't even matter.

1832
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,240
The ones that emphasize their hoarseness are horrible.

1833
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,240
Agreed.

1834
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,240
You don't want to lean into that.

1835
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,240
No.

1836
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,240
I don't know.

1837
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,240
Some people do and I can't.

1838
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,240
No, no, no.

1839
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,240
It's not for me.

1840
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,240
It's not for me.

1841
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:13,240
I've fapped a furry porn, I've fapped a horse porn, I've fapped every kind of porn

1842
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,240
out there except Goro.

1843
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,240
I can't, Goro doesn't work for me.

1844
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,880
Anyway, so, you know, fuck it, man.

1845
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,240
It's about that there are human elements that I can sexualize in my brain and so I do.

1846
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,240
That's it.

1847
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,240
Hell yeah.

1848
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,240
My hoof.

1849
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,240
My hoof, bro.

1850
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,240
Got it.

1851
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,240
Okay.

1852
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,240
So, from Sy's number one fan is calling in.

1853
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,240
I'm excited for this one.

1854
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,240
Sy's calling, everybody.

1855
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,240
No, it's not Sy.

1856
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,240
It's Sy's number one fan.

1857
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,240
That's my point.

1858
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,240
That's my point.

1859
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,240
Sy is number one.

1860
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,240
Okay.

1861
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,240
Let's find out.

1862
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,240
Go.

1863
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,240
Greetings, PCP.

1864
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,240
My name is Sy.

1865
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,240
This isn't actually Sy.

1866
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,240
Oh, he was right.

1867
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,240
But I am.

1868
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,240
Sy is number one advocate.

1869
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,240
Advocate for what?

1870
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,240
You might ask.

1871
01:22:53,240 --> 01:23:01,240
Advocate for Sy to finally get his guest role on an episode of the pro-crastinators podcast.

1872
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,240
Think about this logically.

1873
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:10,240
Sy has been a huge fan of this podcast for as long as anyone can remember.

1874
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:15,240
Sy is a fan of all the creators from this wonderful podcast.

1875
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,240
Now, I understand the fear that you guys may have.

1876
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:24,240
If I recall correctly, the original reason why Sy went beyond that you guys were free

1877
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,240
is that the video would be disliked bombed.

1878
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:30,240
A similar to the video's on Mumki's channel.

1879
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:34,240
When Sy would appear in podcasts, and the joke was, you'd dislike the video.

1880
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,240
The shit.

1881
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:38,240
I don't think Mumki's fans watch this podcast anymore,

1882
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,240
so I think you're in the clear in that regard.

1883
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,240
I feel you all have to do your due diligence to Sy.

1884
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,240
I recognize that he is the perfect guest.

1885
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:53,240
Me in the past has talked about how he feels that the guests don't really feel part of the podcast.

1886
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,240
They don't fit in well.

1887
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:59,240
I think Sy fit in perfectly.

1888
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:11,240
So that's why I think Sy should be a guest on the next episode of the pro-crastinators podcast.

1889
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
Oh, beautifully delivered.

1890
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,240
I'm standing at attention.

1891
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,240
I'm saluting.

1892
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,240
I'm fully erect.

1893
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:22,240
I'm sending the nukes right now.

1894
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,240
Send them down to Texas.

1895
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Take Sy out.

1896
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,240
Alright, next call.

1897
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,240
Next call, that's it.

1898
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,240
Moving on.

1899
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,240
Next one's from Moonju.

1900
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,240
This is directed towards Ben.

1901
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,240
Oh God, not here.

1902
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,240
Ben, you know what?

1903
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,240
You're no saint.

1904
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,240
You're no real saint.

1905
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,240
You're a bad boy.

1906
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,240
You're a scallowag.

1907
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,240
You're a scoundrel.

1908
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,240
You're a bitch.

1909
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,240
You're a slob.

1910
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,240
You want to know why?

1911
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,240
You're a fucking idiot.

1912
01:24:54,240 --> 01:25:00,240
Because you think that giving to the poor from the rich would do anything.

1913
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:04,240
One, it's evil because it's stealing, just like taxation.

1914
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,240
Oh fuck.

1915
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,240
Yeah.

1916
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,240
It's really hard for that money.

1917
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,240
I don't think he wants all that money to be taken from him.

1918
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,240
I don't think that'd be very kind.

1919
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,240
And guess what?

1920
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,240
All those people who would take the money from him,

1921
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
they'd just go ahead and waste it.

1922
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,240
Sure, some of them would use it wisely,

1923
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:28,240
but poor people are generally poor because they don't handle their money well.

1924
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,240
And guess what?

1925
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,240
If you give them a million dollars, they're going to fucking waste it.

1926
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,240
It's been shown time and time again.

1927
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,240
It was all this time.

1928
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:42,240
So taking from Jeff Bezos and all the rich fat cats would do literally nothing

1929
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:46,240
because it would all funnel back to the 1% who would want to take it back

1930
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,240
using their smarts and their effort.

1931
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,240
Is that it?

1932
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,240
Yeah, okay, I guess that's it.

1933
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,240
Okay, Moonjoo, you're right.

1934
01:25:54,240 --> 01:26:02,240
Jeff Bezos is, Jeff Bezos earned every single dollar with the sweat of his brow

1935
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:09,240
of the half of his wealth that he now has, and so did his wife.

1936
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,240
So did his soon-to-be ex-wife also earn every single dollar of that $70 billion.

1937
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,240
Jeff Bezos did one push-up for every dollar in his bank account.

1938
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,240
I'm sure.

1939
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,240
That's why he's so fucking ripped now.

1940
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,240
Jeff Bezos is just that smart.

1941
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,240
Hold on, he's worth $70 billion.

1942
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,240
How much does the average person have?

1943
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,240
Maybe, I don't know, $50,000?

1944
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,240
I don't know.

1945
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:39,240
Okay, so if the average person has $50,000, Jeff Bezos is worth, how many?

1946
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,240
Like 10,000 regular humans?

1947
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:45,240
He is worth 10,000 regular humans.

1948
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,240
I mean, he invented Amazon.

1949
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,240
What was everybody else doing?

1950
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,240
Just fucking around, you know what I mean?

1951
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,240
Invented Amazon.

1952
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,240
Invented selling shit on the internet.

1953
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,240
Nobody else fucking did it.

1954
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,240
It was him.

1955
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,240
Alright, whatever.

1956
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,240
We get it.

1957
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,240
Okay.

1958
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:02,240
A tabby nickel is calling in with something to say.

1959
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,240
Let's hear it.

1960
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,240
Subtabs.

1961
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:10,240
I'm sick and tired of everybody who's calling out all these other discords like the PODCast

1962
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,240
or the RFCK server.

1963
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,240
I'm here to start a war with all y'all.

1964
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,240
I will fight you anywhere, anytime.

1965
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,240
I will beat your dick off on the street.

1966
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,240
Do you understand what the fuck I'm doing here?

1967
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,240
I will kick your ass and then I'll invite you to dinner.

1968
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,240
Mark my words.

1969
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:33,240
You can find me anywhere and I will fight you.

1970
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:39,240
I think tabby nickel is single-handedly challenging every discord server at once to single combat.

1971
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:43,240
Not even as a discord, just as an individual.

1972
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
He's a vigilante.

1973
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,240
He wants to fight the whole war himself.

1974
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,240
Alright, you know what?

1975
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:51,240
Every discord server needs to stop.

1976
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:56,240
We need to stop fighting each other and turn ourselves to the real enemy here, which is tabby nickel.

1977
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:03,240
Like the Christ, like the anointed one himself.

1978
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,240
He is taken on.

1979
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,240
He will take on the burden of all the violence.

1980
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,240
He will end the shit meme war.

1981
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,240
He will save us by taking it all onto himself.

1982
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,240
Absorbing all the evil.

1983
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,240
What's her name?

1984
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,240
Demon souls.

1985
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,240
Maiden Australia.

1986
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,240
That's the one.

1987
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,240
Exactly.

1988
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,240
What a saint.

1989
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,240
He's the real saint here.

1990
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,240
Alright, next call is from Girl Pants.

1991
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,240
Go.

1992
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,240
Hey guys.

1993
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:39,240
So I've been trying to get my friend Jonathan into the PCP for a while and I've been showing him a couple episodes.

1994
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:44,240
And he's known about a couple of you before, specifically Nate.

1995
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I can't get him to like the show.

1996
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:54,240
What he says is that pretty much that Nate is just the tard wrangler of the PCP and where's Lada?

1997
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,240
Where's the lie though, you guys?

1998
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,240
Where's the lie?

1999
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:01,240
Where is the tard wrangler?

2000
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
There's no debate to be had.

2001
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,240
That's simply accurate.

2002
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,240
I mean if you don't like that appeal, then you're not going to like the show.

2003
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,240
Yeah.

2004
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,240
No.

2005
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,240
Nate's not the tard wrangler.

2006
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,240
We're all his tard handlers.

2007
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
Depends on how you look at it.

2008
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
Sound off in the comments.

2009
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,240
Do you subscribe to the tard wrangler theory or the tard handler theory?

2010
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,240
Hashtag it.

2011
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,240
Go.

2012
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,240
Let's begin the debate.

2013
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,240
This is the real debate.

2014
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,240
All right.

2015
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,240
Let's just move on.

2016
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,240
I guess just ease him in.

2017
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,240
Show him the best of the best.

2018
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,240
I'd say show him the PCP highlights, but I gave up on making those because it took too much time.

2019
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,240
But once bar makes some, I think.

2020
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,240
So check with fucking once bar.

2021
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:41,240
Hey, if we get an editor, we can have him make some of those.

2022
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,240
Oh, damn.

2023
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,240
That's another great reason.

2024
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,240
Another great reason to get that.

2025
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Yeah, boy.

2026
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,240
Make that happen.

2027
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,240
We didn't.

2028
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,240
Having slaves sure is great.

2029
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,240
Having employees.

2030
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,240
Sure is mutually beneficial in capitalist society, Tom.

2031
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,240
All right, moving on.

2032
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,240
Jeff Bezos sure has a bunch and look how he's doing.

2033
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,240
He's doing just fine.

2034
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,240
He knows.

2035
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,240
He knows.

2036
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,240
Next call from Zoomer Bitch.

2037
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,240
Zoomer Bitch.

2038
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,240
Gross.

2039
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,240
Go.

2040
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,240
Hello, PCP Zoomer here.

2041
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,240
Yeah.

2042
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,240
Genuine one really on the low end of the age spectrum.

2043
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:17,240
Speaking of spectrums, I would like to thank you all for turning me just fully gay.

2044
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:24,240
But you always tell people that, you know, go out, make the video, make the art, do what

2045
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,240
you want to do.

2046
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,240
So here's the thing.

2047
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,240
I'm a dumb kid.

2048
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Is there any way for me to make YouTube content because I've been inspired by all you guys?

2049
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:41,240
Is there any way that I could make YouTube content as a dumb little kid and get anyone

2050
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,240
to listen?

2051
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,240
Dude.

2052
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,240
Yes.

2053
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,240
First of all, you got that.

2054
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,240
What's that one kid?

2055
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:50,240
You know that one kid who makes the communist why we need to be communist videos?

2056
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,240
Yeah.

2057
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,240
Yeah.

2058
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,240
The fat kid.

2059
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,240
Your youth is a very powerful tool.

2060
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,240
Look at Munchie.

2061
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,240
Yeah.

2062
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,240
Yeah.

2063
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:02,240
People are inherently drawn to a young person doing something that is more adult.

2064
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:06,240
Just like how I'm drawn to young children sexualizing themselves.

2065
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,240
There's something about that.

2066
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,240
They're just being adults.

2067
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,240
Uh-oh.

2068
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,240
Uh-oh.

2069
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,240
You should have said it like that.

2070
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,240
See, Daisy.

2071
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,240
Where's the line?

2072
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,240
You know what I'm saying.

2073
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:17,240
For Handler, Ben, one point for Handler right there.

2074
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,240
Yeah.

2075
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,240
Yeah.

2076
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,240
Yeah.

2077
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,240
Hashtag, hashtag Tard Handler.

2078
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:26,640
I just want to say, Zoomer bitch, you already, frankly, look, I listened to a lot of voicemails

2079
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,240
because we missed last week just now.

2080
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:33,040
You had by far one of the most cogent, well rehearsed and like, you had a little effect

2081
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,240
at the beginning there with the whatever fucking sound that the Zoom, I assume that was done

2082
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,240
for.

2083
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,240
I don't know if that was intentional, but it worked.

2084
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,240
Yeah.

2085
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,240
Because you're a Zoomer.

2086
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,240
I assume that was the joke.

2087
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,240
Like, you already have your shit together.

2088
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:49,240
If you're smart enough to call in with a decent, with a good voicemail like this, I can already

2089
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,240
tell.

2090
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,240
You'd be surprised how rare it is.

2091
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,240
Yeah.

2092
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,240
No, no, you wouldn't.

2093
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,240
How ahead of the curve you already are.

2094
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:58,240
You are in fact ahead of the curve to be able to just figure out these basic level things.

2095
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,240
Yeah.

2096
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2097
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,240
If you made, if someone, I mean, you know, you sound, you sound all of-

2098
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,240
Sounds quite young.

2099
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,240
Maybe like 15, 14.

2100
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,240
Sounding everyone of his or hers, I literally can't tell.

2101
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,240
It's probably 12 or something.

2102
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,240
Like seven years.

2103
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,240
Sure.

2104
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Whatever.

2105
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,240
Yeah.

2106
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:20,240
If you made content, if you made like the same content that like, you know, one of us would

2107
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:25,240
make, like you would get more attention because it's more remarkable that you made it.

2108
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,240
So, you know, I guess my advice would be do what every other fucking artist does and just

2109
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:34,240
like copy someone whose content you like, copy their style until you can start to make

2110
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,240
it your own.

2111
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,240
Yeah.

2112
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,240
Not a bad idea.

2113
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,240
It's not about being a kid.

2114
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,240
It is an asset.

2115
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,240
Yeah.

2116
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:42,240
Not a problem.

2117
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,240
Yeah.

2118
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,240
People might make fun of you and be like, fuck this kid, but you know.

2119
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:51,240
As long as you, as long as you do the funny, funny jokes, then people will be like, ah,

2120
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,240
he's funny.

2121
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,240
Yeah.

2122
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
Like if anyone's funny, they don't care how old they are.

2123
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,240
You made us laugh just now, so.

2124
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes people can leave to becomes like, oh, you're only 10 years

2125
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,240
old or something like that, whatever year old is.

2126
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,240
And like, how is that even an insult?

2127
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,240
You know what that is.

2128
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,240
It's just like, it's like stating the sky is blue.

2129
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,240
The grass is green.

2130
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,240
Or how is that an insult?

2131
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,240
You know what that is, though.

2132
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,240
That's engagement.

2133
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,240
That's engagement.

2134
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,240
True.

2135
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,240
Is what that is.

2136
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,240
It helps.

2137
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,240
It literally helps you and doesn't hurt you at all.

2138
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,240
Nah.

2139
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,240
I like this guy.

2140
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,240
People call you out for shit.

2141
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,240
You're a bitch.

2142
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,240
You sound like you got shit going on.

2143
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,240
I like what you're doing.

2144
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,240
You just, I don't know.

2145
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,240
Yeah.

2146
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,240
Like pick a project, dude.

2147
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,240
Find something that you're interested in.

2148
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,240
You know.

2149
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,240
Don't worry about it too much.

2150
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Just get out there.

2151
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,240
Start making stuff.

2152
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
And you'll see if you like it.

2153
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,240
If you like it, great.

2154
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,240
Keep doing it.

2155
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,240
If you don't, then you know, try something else.

2156
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,240
Just get engaged.

2157
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,240
Start making stuff.

2158
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,240
Yeah.

2159
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
Post it around.

2160
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,240
Yeah.

2161
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,240
Just do it.

2162
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,240
You take it in a good step, calling into this show.

2163
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:42,240
I'm already impressed.

2164
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,240
I'm already impressed.

2165
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,240
Same thing I would tell anyone.

2166
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,240
Make stuff and then post it around, you know.

2167
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,240
Yep.

2168
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,240
You know.

2169
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,360
You've got such an advantage over guys who have got both feet in the grave, like Tom

2170
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,360
and Ben over here.

2171
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,360
You are way.

2172
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,360
Yeah, bro.

2173
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,240
So, you know, keep it up.

2174
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:57,240
Keep it up.

2175
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,240
All right.

2176
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,240
Let's get to the next one.

2177
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,240
Death comes swiftly.

2178
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,240
It sure does.

2179
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,240
Okay.

2180
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,240
Steve.

2181
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:07,240
Jess is best is letting us know how he feels.

2182
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,240
Go.

2183
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,440
Not only did we get some deep Winnie the Pooh lore last episode, but we also got the seat

2184
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:16,240
and get angry talking about the PCP theme gets a little perturbed.

2185
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:20,080
Hello, fresh getting angrier than wealth and capitalism.

2186
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,920
All these chockers are flared and his Christ consciousness hits a million.

2187
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,320
If you had put a plate of carbs in front of him at that moment, they would have erupted

2188
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:31,720
in a blaze of hellfire hearing sustenance every week.

2189
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,080
So I need to know what's the angriest moment you can remember.

2190
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,680
It can include Ben or not.

2191
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:43,760
And yeah, also the art for the last episode, the picture for the thumbnail, pretty fire.

2192
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,760
Pretty good.

2193
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,760
That's that Jesse quality.

2194
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,760
Yeah.

2195
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,920
And to Jesse brings that rage, the anger that he loves.

2196
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,920
So I get it.

2197
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,640
Is he talking about, is this guy talking about the angriest on the show or just, no, he means

2198
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:56,640
in general.

2199
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,160
He thinks he just likes people and people are angry.

2200
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,400
It sustains him in general, I guess.

2201
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:05,280
The angriest I've ever, you know, this is like a shit answer and I'm embarrassed to

2202
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,680
say it, but it's the truth.

2203
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,680
So I guess I'll say the angriest I've ever been was arguing with our dad at various

2204
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,680
times.

2205
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,280
There were a couple of times when I was incensed, like past the point.

2206
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:23,520
I was like, just sputtering with rage because I just didn't know how to express my fucking

2207
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,520
distaste and whatever shit he was telling me.

2208
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,520
There's a thing.

2209
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,520
I feel like this is similar.

2210
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,640
I think he's the only person who's made me like straight up like incoherent.

2211
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,840
You've punched through walls.

2212
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,800
You've been so mad after, I think, you know, I was, you know, well, you know, he had me

2213
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,600
on fucking, he had me on fucking medication that he fucking sent me to a, sent me to a

2214
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,800
shrink briefly to get me on some fucking medication to keep me in line.

2215
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:49,440
And it like fucked with my brain at the time and I, and I, I didn't punch.

2216
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,600
I kicked, I kicked a hole in the wall.

2217
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,600
That's true.

2218
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,600
That's true.

2219
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Yeah.

2220
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,600
Which I blame.

2221
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,600
I blame, I blame the drugs.

2222
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,600
So by extension, I blame dad.

2223
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,680
So there we go.

2224
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,180
I'm, I'm innocent.

2225
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:01,180
Where's the lie?

2226
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:05,160
I don't feel, okay, I don't get super mad at work, but there's, there's a thing that's

2227
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,160
sort of similar to that.

2228
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:12,480
It's that like when I'm talking to someone and they, they won't engage my actual point

2229
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,840
that I'm trying to say when there's a disagreement, they continue to either straw man or like

2230
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,600
just, just ignore it.

2231
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,520
When something like that happens and I really feel that if they just understood my point,

2232
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,920
which happens a lot, frankly, I get so fucking angry on the inside and you know what this

2233
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:35,280
happens at work, at work is where most, most often these days it happens and I don't let

2234
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,280
myself get that mad.

2235
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:41,160
I maintain rigid control because I can't get mad at work and freak out or I'll get fucking

2236
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,040
fired or whatever.

2237
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:47,920
But like when I'm, when, when I'm talking to my boss and I am certain that something

2238
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,160
should be done a certain way, but they're just like, no, no, no, do it this way.

2239
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:56,960
And I'm like, and I try to explain why it would just save time and money and energy for

2240
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:02,360
all of us to just do it this way, but they won't listen.

2241
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:08,280
That because like, I know that you are just going to get mad at me later for not delivering

2242
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:13,160
this as fast as I could have because I'm wasting time doing this other thing.

2243
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,160
And you know what?

2244
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:17,200
Sometimes I get really mad like that and it turns out I was wrong and they were right.

2245
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,800
That happens fairly decent amount of time.

2246
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,840
But when it doesn't happen, ooh boy, do I get pissed.

2247
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,040
I guess I just try to stay humble and think that maybe I'm wrong.

2248
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,040
They're more experienced.

2249
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,440
They know what's going on.

2250
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,440
That happens.

2251
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,440
That happens.

2252
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,720
Yeah, man.

2253
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,320
That's when, you know, like our dad, when he just like thinks that he's right.

2254
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,320
I remember arguing.

2255
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,080
Yeah, I was gonna, I don't want to harp on the dad thing, but like, yeah, like the times

2256
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,320
I've been real, it's, it's stuff like that when like I'm, when like my point is just

2257
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,320
not coming across.

2258
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,200
In the moment, it feels like I'm being willfully ignored or whatever.

2259
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,600
Like dad, dad, why do I need to take a bath?

2260
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,400
I'm just going to get dirty again.

2261
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,840
This is flawless logic.

2262
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,840
It's debate me dad.

2263
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,320
Facts don't care about your feelings, dad.

2264
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:08,280
But like, yeah, like maybe if I went back and like heard the conversation again, I would

2265
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:12,480
realize now like, no, I was just not explaining myself like, yeah, like I was not making sense.

2266
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,480
I was being stupid.

2267
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,880
But by the time it feels like, why don't you just understand me?

2268
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,160
It's just why won't you just agree with me?

2269
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:21,760
If you knew, if you could, if you could think like I, if you saw things the way I think

2270
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,520
you would agree with me, fuck you.

2271
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,020
Yeah, you know.

2272
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,020
Anybody else?

2273
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,020
I can't.

2274
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:29,640
Yeah, I'm, I'm think, cause like I'm, I'm pretty chill a lot of the time.

2275
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,720
Every time you play Dark Souls, you want the world to end.

2276
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,800
Let me just say, this is all way in the past, by the way, like I haven't been like really

2277
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,400
mad at dad in like years and years.

2278
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,400
Yeah.

2279
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:43,760
Well, well, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty chill, but aside from video games, but I don't like

2280
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,480
get like, like, um, like actually terribly mad.

2281
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,120
I mean, if you had a button next to you, if there was a button next to you, when you

2282
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:57,920
die at a poor moment in Dark Souls that just would destroy the world, I suspect you would

2283
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,920
push that button.

2284
01:38:58,920 --> 01:38:59,920
I suspect.

2285
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,920
Oh, of course.

2286
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:01,920
Yeah.

2287
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,920
But I mean, we all would at that moment.

2288
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,360
It's, it's, it's like, I like being angry.

2289
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:11,840
I think it's really fun to, to, to let loose and be like, fuck, like, like really get into

2290
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:18,920
like an angry rant about why a game is badly designed and I'm right about it.

2291
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,960
And I thought, I also think it's funny because I'm usually very chill and I have like a kind

2292
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:29,100
of high pitched voice for a guy that like when I get mad, it's funny.

2293
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,360
It just is funny.

2294
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,600
People would probably laugh at it.

2295
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,320
I have laughed at it many times.

2296
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:39,160
It's just, it's just like, I don't, I don't take it too personally because, you know,

2297
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:44,400
I look back on things I've gotten mad at and I'm like, you stupid idiot.

2298
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:48,680
But it's, yeah, I can't think of like times I've wanted to kill.

2299
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:55,360
Well, I, I can't, um, here's, here's, here's this one time.

2300
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:01,120
I think I may have said this on the, on the podcast a long time ago, but, um, a young

2301
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:07,320
boy, teenager, like 13, 14, um, walking home from school, didn't have many friends in school,

2302
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:12,840
uh, had like, had kind of long weird hair at the time, not long, not as long as it is

2303
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,840
now.

2304
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,880
It's just sort of, it's just sort of went up, gravity hadn't really done anything with

2305
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,880
it yet.

2306
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,400
So it's sort of like a weird Afro.

2307
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,080
Um, and I was picked on for that a lot.

2308
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:27,160
Hippo, I got to interrupt you to say that I saw your ID card.

2309
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:31,680
I saw the picture of you on that card with short hair, blew my face.

2310
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,680
It was insane.

2311
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:37,840
I can't even imagine it.

2312
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:38,840
It's right.

2313
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:39,840
Yeah.

2314
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,240
Post every, post your social security number.

2315
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,240
I want it.

2316
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,240
No.

2317
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,880
Post those three magic numbers on the back of your dad's credit card.

2318
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,080
I mean, I, I'm thinking of cutting my hair.

2319
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,560
The reason I haven't cut my hair for so long is because I built an internet presence and

2320
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,960
everyone knows me as the guy with long hair and I'm like, I can't change now.

2321
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,960
Now you can.

2322
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,960
I can't change now, but I can totally change.

2323
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,800
You can totally change now.

2324
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,080
I cut my hair a little bit yesterday.

2325
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:09,920
Uh, I just trimmed short sort of one side of my head, uh, like, like just kind of above

2326
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,920
the ear.

2327
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,920
Yeah.

2328
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,360
Because I didn't like how that part was sort of like belling out on the side.

2329
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,120
So I just cut that part short.

2330
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,320
You almost can't, you almost can't tell the difference.

2331
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:23,400
Like, like, uh, I saw a friend yesterday who didn't, he, he, he didn't even notice that

2332
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,400
it happened.

2333
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,400
He was like, Oh, your hair looks good.

2334
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:29,200
And then I said, Oh yeah, I cut it and he was like, what, uh, I don't, I might trim

2335
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,960
off the other side similarly, but I'm not sure.

2336
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,480
I'm not sure if the asymmetry is good or bad.

2337
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,400
Uh, I'm probably just going to carve it.

2338
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:41,840
I'm just going to slowly carve it over the course of weeks into a, into a masterpiece.

2339
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:50,320
Anyway, so I was walking home, um, and I walked by some other kids who are walking in a different

2340
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,320
direction.

2341
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,240
Um, they seem about the same age or younger than me.

2342
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:58,160
So like, which is always the worst thing when bullies are younger than you.

2343
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,160
Cause like,

2344
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,040
you can't fucking beat the shit out of them.

2345
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,480
Well, it's not even that.

2346
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,640
They were, they were younger and they were taller because I was, you know, I'm a short

2347
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,640
person.

2348
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:10,920
So like, it's, it's like in every way, it's like the worst thing of all time.

2349
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:16,000
One of them was one of these tall young bullies by any chance purple.

2350
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,240
No, they were, they were male.

2351
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,560
I checked when I killed them.

2352
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:30,480
Um, they walk past me and like, they do the thing where they walk past you and they insult

2353
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:36,240
you just as it's too late for you to turn around, like it's too late for you to do anything

2354
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,240
about it.

2355
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,320
Like they're already, you know, behind you and you're already walking still.

2356
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,760
You have to make a decision to turn around, say, Hey, stop.

2357
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,840
And then they're not going to stop.

2358
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:48,240
So like they've insulted me and I can't do anything about it.

2359
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,520
And I forget what they said.

2360
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,800
It was just some bullshit.

2361
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:57,600
There's like, you know, I, I usually have a bad day at school and this was like, God,

2362
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,200
the worst thing to happen.

2363
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:07,360
And I had that, that moment where it's like, I imagined if I could turn back time and knowing

2364
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:12,120
that they were going to say that and also have a dagger on me, what I would do to them

2365
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,120
as I passed them.

2366
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:16,080
Cause they passed, like they were almost going to sort of shoulder barge me.

2367
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,080
Yeah.

2368
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:22,040
I was like, Oh, what if I just, you know, kicked him and kicked that one guy down and

2369
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,240
stabbed him in the fucking throat and stabbed him in the skull and the other guy was like

2370
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,560
horrified and I threw the dagger in his head.

2371
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,040
Oh, that would be so cool.

2372
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:34,040
And I was just walking home from that point thinking like, like imagining all like the

2373
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,800
grizzly blood and the killing that I was doing in my head.

2374
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,280
I was like, Oh yeah, that's good.

2375
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,640
And then I got home and I was like, well, I didn't do that.

2376
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,640
Yeah.

2377
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,640
Good, good thing.

2378
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:51,360
There's no chance that they would have said that if like it was just one guy.

2379
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:55,640
It's only when there's a bunch of people, you know, they, you know, it's always about

2380
01:43:55,640 --> 01:44:01,200
pro, um, it's always about like, you know, doing it to bolster their friendship status.

2381
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,720
Like I can make fun of people.

2382
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:03,720
I'm confident.

2383
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,560
We're the in group and we've excluded someone.

2384
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,560
High five.

2385
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,560
Well done lads.

2386
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:08,560
Let's keep it up.

2387
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,560
Yeah.

2388
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,560
Keep up the good work.

2389
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,480
Uh, all right.

2390
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,520
Well, I guess we'll go on to the next call.

2391
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,520
Yeah.

2392
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,520
Okay.

2393
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,520
All right.

2394
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,080
Um, next one is from, oh wait, this is for Munchie.

2395
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,080
All right.

2396
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,080
We're skipping this.

2397
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,480
Was that, was that the angry question about the angriest you've been?

2398
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,480
Yeah.

2399
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,480
Okay.

2400
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,480
Yeah.

2401
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,480
Just checking if I missed one.

2402
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,480
Okay.

2403
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,480
Okay.

2404
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,480
Skipping this one because that was for Munchie who is not here.

2405
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,000
So Cam, I'm not reading your voicemail because Munchie isn't here.

2406
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
So there you go.

2407
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Thank him.

2408
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,760
Was that by Camry Blankenship, creator of AKA Laserbot, creator of Tales Get Stroll?

2409
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:42,280
That, I hope so.

2410
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,280
But no.

2411
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,280
Yeah.

2412
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:45,280
All right.

2413
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,280
This is from Real Shonen Jump.

2414
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,560
The Real Shonen Jump is calling in.

2415
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:48,560
Wow.

2416
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,560
Finally.

2417
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,560
Hi.

2418
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,560
This is Shonen Jump, the publisher of, you know, Manga and we wanted Ben to become

2419
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:01,760
a comic book writer for us, except he actually would have to, you know, make chapters regularly

2420
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,800
on a weekly or even maybe monthly schedule instead of yearly, you know, we don't do yearly

2421
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,960
comics here at Shonen Jump.

2422
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:13,160
We'd like to hear his reply.

2423
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:16,840
You know, you know, I thought bullying was illegal, guys.

2424
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:17,840
What the hell?

2425
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,600
Hey, Nate, fuck you, you chose to include this out of my hands.

2426
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:23,880
This is in God's hands only.

2427
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,280
I have no authority here.

2428
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,280
Yeah.

2429
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:32,920
I should probably, well, okay, you know, I think about this sometimes, like, like, when

2430
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:38,200
Vapors 2 was done, I was working, I was starting champion.

2431
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,760
And I applied to Hiveworks.

2432
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:48,240
I applied to become like a partner of the Hiveworks Comics Collective and I was not selected.

2433
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:52,860
And I wonder if maybe if that had happened, right, like maybe what I would have done is

2434
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:58,760
like focus on comics over everything else and just do that instead of like doing YouTube

2435
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:03,040
stuff and endless war and whatever.

2436
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,880
And I wonder what my output would have been.

2437
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,680
I mean, I would hope it would have been better than it has.

2438
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:12,720
I mean, I, yeah, I wonder too, I mean, because I did you this, I mean, I think about this

2439
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:17,720
sometimes, like, what if I had just quit my job several years ago, like well before my

2440
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:22,800
finances were stable at all and just done YouTube, would I be at, you know, million subs and

2441
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,840
doing really great and then like it wouldn't have mattered, maybe probably not.

2442
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,880
But you know, it's just, it's fun to think about, not even fun, it's just kind of wistful,

2443
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,880
I guess.

2444
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,880
Yeah.

2445
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:40,320
You know, I realized, I realized, I had, I didn't really, I haven't posted a new page

2446
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:44,880
in maybe, I think a little over a week now, but there, you know, a couple of weeks ago

2447
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:49,400
I started posting Vapors three pages again and I realized that like without even realizing

2448
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:55,520
it, three months had gone by and I hadn't made a new one and that was, I hadn't realized

2449
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:56,520
it.

2450
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,520
Yeah.

2451
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,520
I was like, what?

2452
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:01,720
I had thought maybe a month tops, but no, it had been three whole months since I made

2453
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,720
a new page.

2454
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,720
I don't know how that happened.

2455
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,720
I was shocked and disgusted.

2456
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:10,640
I've been busy, I've been busy, I've been trying to, trying to, I've been making pages lately.

2457
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,640
I've been busy with stuff.

2458
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,640
That's good.

2459
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:14,920
I've been, I've been really productive lately.

2460
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:18,240
For a while there I was pretty bad, but I've been a lot better lately.

2461
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,160
I mean, I'm not trying to, not specifically on that.

2462
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:23,120
I'm not trying to pressure you or anything, but I'm just curious, like what's like the

2463
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:26,240
general ETA, like based on how things have been going of, you know.

2464
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,240
On Vapors three.

2465
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,240
Yeah.

2466
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:34,320
If I were working exclusively on it, well, I could probably, I think, I think two pages

2467
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:39,760
a week is pretty fair to, and how many, how many pages you got left?

2468
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,760
If you know.

2469
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:50,040
How many do I have left, maybe, maybe 10, max 20, maximum 20.

2470
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,040
Okay.

2471
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,040
All right.

2472
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,040
But probably more like 10 to 15.

2473
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,040
Well, cool.

2474
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,040
I'll be looking out for it.

2475
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,040
Yeah.

2476
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:01,520
I'll be like seven weeks if I, if I focus.

2477
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,520
Do it up.

2478
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,520
There.

2479
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,520
That's what I have to say about that.

2480
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,160
Ben, do you ever wonder like how, how do Magica do like 20 pages a week?

2481
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,160
Yes.

2482
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,160
Um, I know they have assistants.

2483
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:18,160
Well, I guess here's, I mean, the combination is one discipline and like, and they have

2484
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,160
it all set up.

2485
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,160
And two Japanese.

2486
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,280
Yeah.

2487
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,280
Like they have it set up.

2488
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:26,600
Like they like go, they like go into the office in the morning and they sit down for

2489
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:31,040
like an eight hour work day and they work and sometimes they like, I, like I just work

2490
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,600
in my room and I wonder if maybe that's like bad for my mindset.

2491
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:39,000
Like maybe if I had like, yeah, like a separate office where like I, um, you know, would go

2492
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
to.

2493
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,280
It's so, it's so easy to like completely go into I'm home, relax mode when you're sitting

2494
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,720
at your normal desk that you only have one.

2495
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:51,040
That's why I want to drive in studio one day that I go to every day.

2496
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:55,400
When I, like even, even just changing rooms, when I need to write something, I write on

2497
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:01,360
my laptop in the dining room and it's so much easier to focus even though I have the internet

2498
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,680
and all that stuff.

2499
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:06,400
It's just, it's a different computer and I'm downstairs and downstairs is the work time

2500
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,120
place and upstairs is like at the end.

2501
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:13,120
If I, you know, I mean they all, the other, there's that and then they also have assistants

2502
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:18,160
and like having assistants, I think it would have, you know, obviously it would reduce

2503
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:23,120
the workload, but I think it would have a big psychological effect too.

2504
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:28,040
Like, you know, Oda, they say that Oda draws, he like he draws anything that's moving in

2505
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:32,040
the panel he draws, um, and he'll leave like backgrounds and like obviously he'll sketch

2506
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,800
the backgrounds or whatever, but like he'll leave, like the backgrounds will be inked

2507
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,000
by like his assistants.

2508
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Yeah.

2509
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:44,120
So, I think basically like you, the mangaka, can you draw what's important to you, like

2510
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:48,120
you can draw the stuff that's like the most important and the most interesting to you

2511
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:51,520
and then like all the, the incidental stuff you can pass them and that would, the effect

2512
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,000
that that would have is like you could pass off basically what's to you, the busy work,

2513
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,400
you can pass it off to someone else to do that, so like you would have psychologically,

2514
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:06,080
it would be less of a drag, you know, like the drawing process would be less, you know,

2515
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,160
rough.

2516
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,160
I also think.

2517
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:12,240
Not all mangaka have assistants, like I'm pretty sure that the guy who did Poon Poon,

2518
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:18,360
you know, that dude, I don't think he has any assistants, which is fucking insane.

2519
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:21,520
Yeah, because he had some detailed shit he makes.

2520
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:27,720
I've talked about that show Man Ben on here, you know, the one where it's like they, like

2521
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:32,640
this one mangadude, he like puts a camera in a mangaka's studio for a week and then

2522
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,720
like him and the guy review the footage and like talk about like what they do.

2523
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,000
I love that fucking show.

2524
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,640
I wish every episode was translated, but a bunch of them aren't as far as I know it

2525
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:44,640
fucking is mad, makes me mad and I want to, I want to consume all of it.

2526
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:45,640
Learn Japanese.

2527
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:48,880
But yeah, they did, they did, they did one with that guy and the guy just fucking, the

2528
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,760
level of detail in his panels is insane and his process is fucking bizarre and insane

2529
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,200
and he has no assistants.

2530
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,280
He does it all himself.

2531
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,320
It's fucking nuts, but like most of them have assistants.

2532
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:01,560
You know, I think there was this one, there was this one woman who puts out like, she puts

2533
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:06,120
out like fucking like 40 pages a week, but she's, she's got a team of like, she's got

2534
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:10,000
a team of like eight assistants that are all like yelling about her office constantly.

2535
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,960
I mean, I think another benefit of having assistants like this and just like, like being

2536
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:20,080
in show and jump is like just having a deadline, a hard deadline, I think is a real benefit,

2537
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:25,760
a serious and, and people depending on you, like your assistants and whatnot, pressure

2538
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,640
is good for productivity.

2539
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,120
I swear it's true.

2540
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:30,360
It's real.

2541
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:34,120
Like when you and I were doing T-Bap, I think just by virtue of us kind of depending on

2542
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,880
each other pushed both of us to be real productive.

2543
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,840
Yes, it was, we couldn't, yeah, we couldn't let each other down.

2544
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,720
We both had to do it.

2545
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:44,960
And also we had like, you know, we have to have it out today.

2546
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,240
Our goal was like when it came out, there's no alternative to that.

2547
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:52,080
And we fucking got it out before there were times when we were the first review out or

2548
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,160
whatever and, and it was still an episode of T-Bap, aka not total shit.

2549
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,280
So pretty fucking good.

2550
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,280
I'd say.

2551
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:02,080
What if we made like our own show and jump for that reason?

2552
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,080
Hmm.

2553
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:08,520
I guess, you know, like a weekly period, like a weekly periodical or a newsletter or something.

2554
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:13,760
Yeah, a weekly, a weekly, a weekly something or other publication digitally and if, if

2555
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:19,920
you have like pages for your comic, you can put them in there and it just be like a reason

2556
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:20,920
to have a deadline.

2557
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:24,080
We're in different mediums, but let's just say theoretically, here's a concept for a

2558
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,080
show.

2559
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:29,280
It's like a PCP people sent, it doesn't have to be called that, but it's like a basically

2560
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:34,360
a variety show where we like, let Ben, like whatever, he produces like a chapter a week,

2561
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,760
just, you know, to be crazy, like shown and jump standards or whatever.

2562
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:39,600
And like, I don't know, I produce a wee ag before it.

2563
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:44,040
I'm just, this is totally not real, but just theoretically, I don't know, Tom, I don't

2564
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:49,120
know, like a blog update for his game or something, Davoo, maybe the same thing, Digi, some fucking

2565
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,120
videos or something.

2566
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,760
And like, I don't know, what if it was theoretically all edited into one video, wouldn't that be

2567
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,440
a hoot and a half?

2568
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,280
I don't know, just saying.

2569
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,280
Like a roundup?

2570
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,280
Yeah.

2571
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,280
Like a weekly roundup.

2572
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:03,920
But it's like, it's like a copy of shown and jump in that, like all the stuff's in there,

2573
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:06,840
you know, like you go there for like all the things you want.

2574
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,800
Yeah, I don't know, I'm just saying, it's a cool, same sort of idea.

2575
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,880
I like the idea.

2576
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:18,680
I like the idea of something that we are like committed to and like we are, we are always

2577
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,680
together.

2578
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:20,680
That's the thing.

2579
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:21,680
I've always wanted to have a partnership of some sort.

2580
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,640
I've always wanted to work with somebody.

2581
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:29,920
I've always wanted the Bakumon style of like someone working with me, because I feel like

2582
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,840
that would definitely increase my productivity.

2583
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:37,560
I mean, it's to a small degree, but like look how efficient and productive, like specifically

2584
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:44,040
the PCP podcast has been, we have not missed a single week, except I think after Radcon

2585
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,920
3 we missed, I believe one week when we were just taking a break or whatever.

2586
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,200
And yeah, like super productive, it's relatively lucrative for everybody.

2587
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:57,040
Yeah, I mean, it's just a fucking podcast, we talk about bullshit.

2588
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,480
So yeah, I don't know, the virtues, this is good, it's good stuff.

2589
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:04,080
This is a good idea, I think we should, we should think about this more.

2590
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,080
I think this is something we should do with the procrastinator's website, since it has

2591
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,080
nothing going on, right?

2592
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,080
Yeah, I mean-

2593
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,080
Yes, that's basically-

2594
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,080
Like a blog post every week.

2595
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:15,760
And then the name would become ironic, because it's called the procrastinators, but we're

2596
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:18,480
not busting our asses to meet a deadline every week.

2597
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:21,040
Yeah, I still like it, I still like it.

2598
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:24,880
Oh well, that's a cool idea, but anyway, let's talk about that more later.

2599
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:25,880
Let's put a pin in that.

2600
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,880
Let's put a pin in that.

2601
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:33,120
Move on to a call from Hipster Cthulhu, let's see what he has for us.

2602
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,120
This guy sounds sick.

2603
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:40,080
Okay, Nate, so on the last PCP you said the taxation is theft, and I thought I'd just

2604
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:45,600
blackpill you on how it really works, or you see, you don't actually like own anything.

2605
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:51,880
See, you can only own things if you have the ability to like physically defend them and

2606
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:52,880
say they're yours.

2607
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,800
That's how like borders work between countries.

2608
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:59,600
So really, everything you own, the government already owns, because they're the ones with

2609
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,600
the power.

2610
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,600
Like the police can come and just fucking grab you out of your house and kill you if

2611
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,480
they want, and you can't do shit about it.

2612
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,760
And so like really, your money and everything you own is not yours, you're just the government's

2613
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,360
child basically, you're getting pocket money, and then they're taking some back from you.

2614
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:20,480
Taxes isn't theft, because you don't own things that can be stolen, because we're all little

2615
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:26,120
bitches dancing to their fucking puppet strings as they woke.

2616
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:31,120
Man, this guy's definitely watched Chymatica.

2617
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,120
Yeah.

2618
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:34,640
That's a pretty black pill.

2619
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:40,720
I don't think I disagree, but I don't know what the takeaway is.

2620
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:48,360
Okay, he's wrong, because his whole mindset there, I get it that it's true, like physical

2621
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:53,400
force is what actually makes the difference, but we don't live in a world where physical

2622
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:57,120
force is the only thing that we care about or value.

2623
01:55:57,120 --> 01:56:00,120
Like might does not make right.

2624
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:06,000
So just because the government has, we set up the entire nation of America because we

2625
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,000
wanted to have certain inalienable values like the fucking respect of property.

2626
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,880
If the government came in and just took people's property for whatever, you could argue like

2627
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:22,840
blah, blah, blah, incarceration of slavery, I'm sympathetic to these arguments, and whatever,

2628
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:27,680
like taxation is theft, like sure, yeah, we can make those, but ultimately, we're trying

2629
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:31,200
to protect virtues and values that we all respect.

2630
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:35,760
So it's not that if the government just came in and started taking shit completely because

2631
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:41,080
it fucking felt like it, like I like to think we would literally rise up gamers and like

2632
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:42,080
stop it.

2633
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,080
I think it would take a while.

2634
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:48,840
I mean, I think on like a small scale, the government can do, like the government could

2635
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:53,040
fucking, you know, bust into any one person's house and take their shit.

2636
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,200
Yeah, and they could probably get away with it too, by just finding some excuses.

2637
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:57,200
Probably true.

2638
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,200
Yeah.

2639
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
I bet they have in the past.

2640
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,200
So, I mean, if they can do that.

2641
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:06,360
They bust into your bank account and take your money every fucking year.

2642
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,360
But it's not...

2643
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,480
Look, I'm the one defending the country.

2644
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,160
I'm defending taxation right now.

2645
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:12,160
I'm not sure.

2646
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:13,160
I agree with this guy's argument.

2647
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:19,720
I feel like the conclusion of this argument is not that taxation is not theft.

2648
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:23,120
It's just that it is, but it has already been stolen.

2649
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,120
Basically, yes.

2650
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,120
It is pre-stolen.

2651
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,880
It's not theft because it's already not your property.

2652
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:31,320
So he's kind of just circumventing the whole issue, I guess, by saying there's an even

2653
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,320
larger injustice.

2654
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,920
Yeah, you're going one step further than taxation is theft.

2655
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:35,920
Yeah, he is.

2656
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:36,920
Nothing goes even yours.

2657
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:37,920
I mean, perhaps...

2658
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,000
I think there's an argument to be made there, because like, you're talking, because Nate,

2659
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,520
you're talking about like the government and shit and like social structure and all

2660
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,520
that kind of stuff.

2661
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,400
And like, as long as you're playing within that paradigm, then yes, everything you're

2662
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,400
saying is true.

2663
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:53,880
But I think even you wouldn't disagree that there are people with enough like influence

2664
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,960
to play outside of that paradigm.

2665
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:00,600
And at that point, like, there's no rules anymore.

2666
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:03,560
They basically are like ruling everything at the point of a gun.

2667
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:07,960
I mean, I just don't feel like we actually live in that world in modern day America.

2668
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:10,520
I think that's naive to think that.

2669
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,040
I mean, maybe that's true.

2670
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:13,040
But I don't know.

2671
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:17,400
I don't agree with this guy's premise that, you know, like it's, we don't control.

2672
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:21,280
People, I think it's a little conspiratorial the way people think about like, look, Jeff

2673
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:24,720
Bezos does not actually control the world.

2674
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,040
He really doesn't.

2675
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,640
He runs a really big business.

2676
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:29,640
That's what he does.

2677
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:31,360
And yes, that business has influenced.

2678
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:34,400
I don't think it's about controlling the world.

2679
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:40,480
I think it's like someone like, if you get to a Jeff Bezos level of like influence and

2680
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:45,920
authority and wealth, like Jeff Bezos can do whatever he wants.

2681
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,080
He cannot murder a man and get away with it.

2682
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,080
Yes, he could.

2683
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,080
Yes, he fucking could.

2684
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,080
Yes, he could.

2685
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:57,200
I would actually, it would shock me if he hasn't murdered people to get to where he

2686
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:58,200
is.

2687
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,200
That's no, that's too much.

2688
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:03,080
Look, he just rode a tech bubble and he was in the right place at the right time and it

2689
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:07,240
happened to be something that like the entire world population really values.

2690
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:11,080
That's why he just made so much money because everyone wants a piece of it.

2691
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:12,080
Question, question.

2692
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:13,080
Okay.

2693
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:18,640
Do you think that there are not people out there who would kill for what, for Jeff Bezos'

2694
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,640
money?

2695
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:23,560
I think there, like there are probably people out there who would murder him.

2696
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:29,080
So like, I don't know, man, I think I could, you know, but it's like, but how many maybe

2697
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:33,120
he's had to fucking kill people, you know, it doesn't seem, it doesn't seem crazy.

2698
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:37,200
I mean, let's just say directly, obviously, if someone came up to me and said, Nate, listen,

2699
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:41,800
here's a button, you push this button, I die personally as the magic messenger.

2700
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,600
So I can't spill the beans.

2701
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:47,000
And also Jeff Bezos dies, you get all his money.

2702
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,080
And, you know, and like, and it's guaranteed no one ever finds out.

2703
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,080
I'm not going to lie.

2704
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:57,960
I will have to have a think about that conundrum because, you know, no one, you say no one's

2705
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:04,520
going to find out and I get billions, ooh, that sounds pretty good.

2706
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,920
Maybe I can just find a way to justify my soul murdering a man.

2707
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:08,920
Maybe I can do that.

2708
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,600
I don't know.

2709
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:16,400
But I would, I mean, the point is, I just don't, I don't believe this guy's ultimate

2710
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,120
blackpilled version of the world.

2711
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:23,040
I really think things are more granular and like there is more individualism already.

2712
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,280
I don't think the government really does that much, honestly.

2713
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:31,240
I think it's just like people just have their communities and that's where things like get

2714
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:32,800
resolved and figured out.

2715
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:36,760
I don't think the government really does that much to shape the world.

2716
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:39,840
I don't know, maybe in fucking like North Korea, I guess they do, but I don't live there.

2717
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:40,840
I live in America.

2718
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:46,800
I just feel like in this place I'm at, I do have some significant freedom and I don't

2719
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,920
think a lot of people are going to fuck with it.

2720
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,640
Maybe if I was Bezos, it would be like I'm more vulnerable.

2721
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:59,720
When you're Bezos level, like at your level name, like the level of a human, like a human

2722
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:05,960
citizen, yeah, like the things you do are not affecting like, you know, that many people.

2723
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:11,400
When you're Jeff Bezos, everything you do with your, like you're like, yeah, you don't

2724
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:14,520
control the world, but like your actions like have an effect.

2725
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:15,520
Sure.

2726
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,960
I don't know, like the businesses, like, I don't know, like where he runs his fucking

2727
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:25,240
business out of will like, it will have like a marked effect on like that city's economy,

2728
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:26,240
you know?

2729
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,240
Like the government sets up things.

2730
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:31,000
Like cities will vie for him to run their business in their economy.

2731
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,480
They will offer him like, you know, tax loophole, tax incentives and stuff to like, yeah, run

2732
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:36,480
your business here.

2733
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,240
That like affects the economy.

2734
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:41,480
You know, it could, it could displace people, you know, like not even intentionally.

2735
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:46,120
Like, you know, people might have, people might have to move the house because, you know,

2736
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,640
of where this guy just decided to live.

2737
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:50,800
Yeah, let's say the setup shop, it gentrifies the entire native population can't afford

2738
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,640
to live there because it's too nice now or whatever.

2739
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,160
I mean, yeah, absolutely true.

2740
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,600
This is like, these are like, these are like powerful forces.

2741
02:01:56,600 --> 02:02:00,400
But like the question that we're addressing here is not really related to any of this.

2742
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:05,480
And specifically, it's like, like, is taxation not theft because we just don't own anything.

2743
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:10,760
I don't, I think we do have influence over our lives, even in that situation where Jeff

2744
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:14,080
Bezos can fuck us over by, you know, whatever, fucking up our community or whatever.

2745
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:17,720
It's not even, the question really, Jeff Bezos is an interesting question, but like we're,

2746
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:21,120
this guy was calling and saying the government kind of owns everything and Jeff Bezos isn't

2747
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:22,120
the government really.

2748
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:25,280
Well, I'm happy to say governments or powerful people or whoever.

2749
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,280
Sure.

2750
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:29,840
But I think, I think, I mean, the only thing that makes the government powerful is that

2751
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:36,000
they have capital and resources to an infrastructure, I guess, but like the only way they can maintain

2752
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
that infrastructure is through, you know, their capital.

2753
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Yeah, I suppose.

2754
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:47,560
I feel like the whole thing is, is this idea that of like owning as a concept because like

2755
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:51,000
literally owning is impossible.

2756
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,560
You can't literally do it.

2757
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,560
It's all about the laws.

2758
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,840
Maybe it's protected by the law.

2759
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:55,840
And since, yeah.

2760
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:01,000
So like if a law says you own something, then you own it because that is a concept that

2761
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
we've come up with.

2762
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Yep.

2763
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Yep.

2764
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,600
Again, like you said, unless you physically defend it, then I suppose you do own it.

2765
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:10,800
If like you just have a gun and it won't let anyone touch your shit.

2766
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:11,800
Reasonable.

2767
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:17,240
Well, I mean that like that's like what the law does, like what ownership laws do is,

2768
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:24,760
you know, empower private citizens basically to have, you know, the government will protect

2769
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:26,760
your property.

2770
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:29,560
But like, but like, if we're, but this isn't like bolster the case, though, like if the

2771
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:35,120
government has rules of law that define, you know, ownership and property rights and stuff

2772
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:36,120
like that.

2773
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:41,360
But we also know that the government does like, you know, shit, whatever it wants, even

2774
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:44,880
if like it's questionable legality, like, doesn't it just prove the guy's point like,

2775
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:51,200
yeah, the government could, like it's beneficial to the system to say, stay relatively stable.

2776
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:55,560
So like people like Nate feel like they have control over their lives, but like, yeah,

2777
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,560
absolutely.

2778
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:57,560
Yeah.

2779
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:01,640
But the people, but the people in charge at any point can like, you know, quietly cart

2780
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:05,880
Nate off and like steal his fucking lunch money and do whatever they want.

2781
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:07,760
There would be, you know, objections.

2782
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,160
Those people might go to jail.

2783
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,320
But they're not going to do it obtusely.

2784
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:14,440
It'll be done very silently and quietly and they won't notice.

2785
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:18,480
And that's because that's how when you have that level of a power and affluence, you can

2786
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:22,000
do things in the shadows and nobody notices.

2787
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,240
Think about this.

2788
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:24,400
Think about this.

2789
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:29,600
Say you own some property, you own some land, right?

2790
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:35,120
And you know, someone, maybe a homeless person, someone trespasses on your land and thereby,

2791
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:39,080
because the law says you own this land, you can call the police and the police will be

2792
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:43,360
dispatched and they will, you know, remove this person physically, you know, violently

2793
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:46,400
if, if need be.

2794
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:51,800
Basically what you have by this, the police and the property laws, you basically have

2795
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:56,960
like a military force at your command, like a military force that is ready to defend your

2796
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,960
property.

2797
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:03,920
If you own like a huge amount of land, then basically you have, you have like this military

2798
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:05,920
power to enforce that ownership.

2799
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:10,520
Basically the government enforces your owner, your private ownership with violence.

2800
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:11,520
Yes.

2801
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:12,520
Correct.

2802
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,040
I don't know.

2803
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:18,960
It's a little, it's a little like you kind of, like if you're fucking Jeff Bezos and

2804
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,640
you own a shit ton of land, you've basically sort of got like a little private military

2805
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:23,640
of your own.

2806
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,040
You're basically like a fucking, I don't know.

2807
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:29,000
I mean, if you're, if you're Jeff Bezos, you're not going to rely on the cops.

2808
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,560
You're going to hire a private security force.

2809
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,560
Probably not.

2810
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:32,560
Yeah.

2811
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:33,560
You literally have like.

2812
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:34,560
Yeah.

2813
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,560
You know, this is all fine.

2814
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:42,400
I just don't feel like, I feel like my property is reasonably well defended by the police.

2815
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,840
And like it's, it's, it's a practical very thing.

2816
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:46,280
And then it's also a moral thing.

2817
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:50,160
I believe property is perfectly moral and is, is the right.

2818
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,160
Thoughts.

2819
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:52,160
Okay.

2820
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:56,060
This, this is a, this is not a new observation I'm making here, but there are lots of people

2821
02:05:56,060 --> 02:06:00,920
without homes in America and there are lots of homes owned by people that are not being

2822
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:01,920
occupied.

2823
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:02,920
Sure.

2824
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:09,520
Say, I don't know why, why is it that the, like a wealthy landowner who owns like lots

2825
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,560
and lots of houses that he's trying to flip, right?

2826
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:15,360
He's got all of this fucking property and like homeless people try and squat in them.

2827
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:21,640
Why is the government invested in coming in and using military violence to remove these

2828
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:22,640
people?

2829
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:28,920
You know, why is it, uh, I, I, I, I, it seems weird.

2830
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:29,920
It's, it doesn't seem weird.

2831
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,440
It doesn't just seem weird on the base of it.

2832
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:36,720
It only, I mean, okay, I see why it seems weird on like a base kind of initial emotional

2833
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:37,720
level.

2834
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:38,720
Like these people need houses.

2835
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:39,720
Why can't they like they're not being used.

2836
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:40,720
Just let them have it.

2837
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:46,040
But I mean, the reason is one, because we've decided that property rights, I mean, we started

2838
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:49,080
this at the founding of the country are important to be respected.

2839
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,280
And that's for a number of reasons.

2840
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:55,920
And I think a pure pragmatic one is that like, look, if we don't respect property rights,

2841
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,760
we're just saying anyone can do anything.

2842
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:01,120
You can just take anything from anybody and the government will just let that happen.

2843
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,120
That's just chaos.

2844
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:03,640
Uh, and that's not good.

2845
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:08,200
And at the very least, again, purely pragmatically, that means like, who's going to want to come,

2846
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:11,000
like who's going to want to build a factory in America?

2847
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,080
If America has as a policy, like like Venezuela does or something, the government can just

2848
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:18,800
say like, oh, good factory, we're actually going to take this because we've got homeless

2849
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,240
people who need to live here.

2850
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:21,360
We need a house for them.

2851
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,520
So sorry about like the investment that you've made here.

2852
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,560
We're just going to use your shit, you know, for that equitable.

2853
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:31,840
I thought we were talking about houses that are like, it's the same, it's the same principle.

2854
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,840
It's the same principle.

2855
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:35,840
Like if you invest in a house because it's going to flip it, as Ben said in this example,

2856
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:36,840
you're kind of changing.

2857
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:37,840
You have made an investment.

2858
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:41,760
If you're flipping houses, which is what you said, Ben, that's an investment that you're

2859
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,320
trying to get a return on.

2860
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:47,880
If they can just take your money, why would you, okay, I guess you just won't invest in

2861
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:48,880
anything.

2862
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:54,120
It becomes like, it's, it's like, I can understand the argument from like the perspective Ben's

2863
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:58,800
arguing for at this scale, because it's like, it's a big house and like, you know, but it's

2864
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:03,200
the argument Ben's making is the same thing as like, if I, I can have a laptop that's

2865
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:06,320
going on sale on eBay right now, if someone's just like, oh, you're going to sell it anyway,

2866
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:10,080
or it just comes in, like walks into the house and just starts using my computer, you know,

2867
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:15,880
yeah, that's the same principle because it's, well, I mean, yeah, but it's different.

2868
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:17,120
It's different at scale.

2869
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:23,480
If someone like owning a laptop is not the same as owning like, you know, 100, 100 fucking

2870
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:27,200
houses, look, either you respect property rights or you don't, I guess is really what

2871
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,800
it comes down to.

2872
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:34,160
And I, well, here's the thing, okay, I guess the difference is that I think, you know,

2873
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:39,760
me personally, I think that a person, that it makes sense for a person to own a laptop.

2874
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:44,600
I don't think that anyone deserves to be rich enough to own 100 houses.

2875
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,000
I just don't think so.

2876
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,360
I mean, that what that just says is that, yeah, you only respect property rights so far

2877
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:53,400
and that you don't think people are entitled to the sweat of their brow.

2878
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:56,360
Maybe because you think the system is flawed and like people don't really deserve what

2879
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:57,360
they get.

2880
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,360
It's like not.

2881
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:59,360
That's exact.

2882
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,360
That's precisely what I think.

2883
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:06,320
It is literally an accident that some people own, you know, hundreds of properties and

2884
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:07,320
other people have.

2885
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,320
Yes.

2886
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,320
I mean, it's not all an accident.

2887
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,320
Yes.

2888
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:11,320
Exactly.

2889
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:12,320
Yeah.

2890
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,320
Some people are lucky.

2891
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,320
Okay.

2892
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,320
I see.

2893
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,320
I got.

2894
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,320
Ben, what you want to do, what your idea as proposed, this is a very, this is a socialist

2895
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:21,840
idea that you want to get rid of all unfair advantages because everybody's the same and

2896
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,000
we need to balance for things like luck because whatever doesn't exist.

2897
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And I agree.

2898
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,080
I don't think free will is real.

2899
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:31,280
You know, so we just want to, we want to balance everything.

2900
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:34,920
Everyone should have an equally good experience in life that we can provide them.

2901
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:39,880
But if we do things like redistribute stuff, like you aren't allowed to own 100 houses,

2902
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,440
we're going to take them and give them to the poor.

2903
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:47,360
You are crippling the incentive for people to earn anything, which is what has made the

2904
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:52,720
world so much better across the fucking globe and pulled billions of people out of poverty,

2905
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:54,320
which is what capitalism has done.

2906
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,800
We need that incentive structure there.

2907
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:57,800
Prove that it's done that.

2908
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:03,760
I don't know, like India has been vastly improved by like the technological advances.

2909
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,800
I don't have, look, I don't know, I'm not a scientist, but this is what I've been told.

2910
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:11,240
Yeah, that's a, that's a, that's a bold, that's a, I think that's a bolder claim you're making

2911
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,960
than, than you think it is.

2912
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,600
I, I'm aware it's a bold claim.

2913
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:19,200
It just seems to be true that like across the world, the, the poverty rates have just

2914
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:23,160
been plummeting over the last several years and it's due to capitalism.

2915
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:24,160
I don't.

2916
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,160
I don't know.

2917
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:26,160
I don't know.

2918
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,160
Okay.

2919
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:30,600
If we had some research before all this is going to take your word for that.

2920
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:34,680
We're both ignorant of actual data, which is what you need to have a real debate like

2921
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,680
this.

2922
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:36,680
So I guess.

2923
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:37,680
I'll admit it.

2924
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:38,680
Yeah.

2925
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,680
I could know, I could, I could know more about this.

2926
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:40,680
As could I.

2927
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:42,080
I guess, I guess I'm arguing from emotion here.

2928
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:45,880
I think so, which isn't wrong, but isn't necessarily correct either.

2929
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,560
And I, I feel the same about me.

2930
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:50,880
The problem, the problem with the argument is like what you, cause like you'd have to

2931
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,880
eventually define like what can a person have, right?

2932
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:55,520
Cause there's a limit eventually.

2933
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,960
Like I could make the argument, like, you know, Ben, like we're both artists, but you

2934
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,760
make four times as much money as I do.

2935
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:02,200
Why don't you give me half what you made?

2936
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:03,680
Cause like I work hard.

2937
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:06,680
Why don't I get, why don't I get a hundred?

2938
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:10,480
And then you're in the business of policing things down to that level that as a separate

2939
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:12,120
issue is also unsustainable.

2940
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:16,520
I think we, you know, what I think your argument would be that you worked harder.

2941
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,920
You have a more dedicated audience.

2942
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,920
They feel your content.

2943
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,440
I wouldn't say that I worked hard.

2944
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:21,680
I wouldn't say that I worked hard.

2945
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:22,680
I don't know.

2946
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,680
I do.

2947
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:25,360
But, but I mean, I happy to admit.

2948
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,680
I don't think free will is real.

2949
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:29,760
Uh, I think everyone just is the machine that they were born to be influenced by their

2950
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,360
experiences and DNA.

2951
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:34,600
So like, why does ever anyone deserve anything better than anybody else?

2952
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:36,080
They didn't do anything.

2953
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:44,320
So I, I just, Hey, I, here's the truth is that we don't even own our flesh and bones.

2954
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,820
We don't even own those.

2955
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:50,280
If the government can just come in and take them from you, then maybe we don't, we don't

2956
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:54,520
own shit, but we do own our dreams.

2957
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,880
Don't get me started.

2958
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:57,880
Oh no.

2959
02:11:57,880 --> 02:11:58,880
Oh God.

2960
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,880
Uh, okay.

2961
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:04,080
That wasn't, that wasn't a terrible discussion.

2962
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:05,880
I thought you were dreaming, mage.

2963
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:12,000
Maybe I was, maybe I was dreaming about a topic I could participate in.

2964
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,680
I think, I think we've probably, that's a fanciful dream indeed.

2965
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:18,960
I think we've probably hit, uh, hit the limit of what we can say about this.

2966
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,880
I think this whole, we need more data thing.

2967
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,880
Yeah.

2968
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:22,880
I mean, yeah.

2969
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:23,880
Okay.

2970
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:28,080
Here's, here's, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna suggest this right now, Nathan.

2971
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:32,120
I think you're gonna like this bonus episode on capitalism.

2972
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:35,860
What could be more capitalistic than giving us our money to listen to this episode?

2973
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:37,360
That's not a bad idea.

2974
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,040
We'll come with data.

2975
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,040
We'll hash it all out.

2976
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:43,520
Oh, but that would just require me to do work and find sources and stuff.

2977
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:44,520
Oh no.

2978
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:45,520
Oh, okay.

2979
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:46,520
We'll see.

2980
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,080
That's, that's a good idea though.

2981
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:49,080
Okay.

2982
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:50,080
Next one.

2983
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,080
We got, we got three more here.

2984
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,080
Sherlock, Aznebel.

2985
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:53,080
Go.

2986
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:57,440
Hey, this is a young X Christian boy here.

2987
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:01,160
Just wanted to let you guys know that, uh, I had to tell my parents that I don't believe

2988
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:02,840
in God anymore.

2989
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:05,760
Not because they really needed to know, but I just didn't want to have to go to church.

2990
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:08,440
It was, it was getting kind of to be a drag.

2991
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:13,160
And, uh, so I blamed it on you guys because I figured it was a better fall guy than those

2992
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,000
who are responsible for people dying.

2993
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,760
But when I said that, uh, I didn't believe in Jesus anymore because of the PCP, uh, they

2994
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:24,920
looked at it kind of funny and I think they might have thought, I was talking about the

2995
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:28,280
drug, but, uh, no, I told them it's a podcast.

2996
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:33,400
Uh, now they're telling me that I can't listen to the podcast anymore, lest I be kicked out

2997
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,400
of my house.

2998
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:38,920
So my question for you guys is, is it more valuable for me to listen to this podcast or

2999
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,120
have a roof over my head?

3000
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:44,120
I don't really know because, uh, you got, but podcast, podcast for sure.

3001
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:49,800
You got to stick with the podcast, especially if, especially if you're on the page, I was

3002
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:52,360
going to say as long as you're, as long as you're paying on the Patreon, I don't give

3003
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:54,560
a fuck if you listen to that.

3004
02:13:54,560 --> 02:14:00,160
Um, um, uh, you might, you might, you might have to just, uh, you might have to just

3005
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,800
bite the bullet and go to church for my dreams.

3006
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,760
So I know that's the worst, the worst of all possible worlds.

3007
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:08,880
Christopher Hitchens, I think, uh, not just an atheist, but an anti-theist, which I generally

3008
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:09,880
agree with.

3009
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:12,800
Um, you should, you should listen to the podcast.

3010
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:13,800
That's true.

3011
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:14,800
On speaker.

3012
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:17,920
Uh, Christopher Hitchens, whatever.

3013
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:22,880
Even he said, I think that like you don't want to like cripple your life, uh, first

3014
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,280
of all, if there, if you can just avoid the subject, just avoid the subject.

3015
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:30,880
And uh, that's what I did, uh, for a long time, look, my dad's religious, this is what

3016
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:31,880
you got to do.

3017
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:32,880
All right.

3018
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:35,160
Your parents right now, they want you to go to church.

3019
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:39,640
You don't want to go to church, but they have like this religious duty thing that's

3020
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:41,440
in their brain that they're going to make you do.

3021
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:44,640
Well, you got to, you got to embarrass them at church so they don't want to bring you

3022
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:45,640
anymore.

3023
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:49,280
Like, you know, they finish the gospel and the dude starts like the pre-starts going

3024
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:52,360
on is like little like spiel that he always does after every gospel reading.

3025
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,360
Yep.

3026
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:55,440
You just got to call him out and call his God fake and gay.

3027
02:14:55,440 --> 02:15:00,000
And then the entire church will see that their son is causing an embarrassing scene.

3028
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,160
And then they'll never want you to come back again.

3029
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,160
And then you're free.

3030
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:04,160
Possible.

3031
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:05,160
You just got to shame them.

3032
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:06,720
You got to, you got to be such an embarrassment to them.

3033
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:10,920
You got to be that they have to be, Oh no, they're the ones with the atheist son.

3034
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:11,920
And then they'll feel bad about it.

3035
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:16,800
And then they'll try and erase you from the, the, the parishes like collective memory by

3036
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:17,800
having you not come anymore.

3037
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:19,280
Yeah, they'll try to erase him by kicking him out of the fucking house.

3038
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,880
Just be as blatantly atheist as possible.

3039
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,400
Just make everyone know that you're the God.

3040
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:25,000
You got to lean into it, dude.

3041
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,000
You got to lean in.

3042
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,800
I have a huge moral opposition to lying about most things, especially important things like

3043
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:31,800
this.

3044
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,400
But what I would do is I would just not bring it up.

3045
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:38,360
Look, if it's, I don't, I don't honestly know what it's like to have like super religious

3046
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:40,440
parents, especially like if you're atheist.

3047
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:43,720
I imagine it's really hard.

3048
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:47,600
So I guess I just said tread carefully, survive, dude.

3049
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:48,600
Don't get kicked out.

3050
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:49,600
Do what you got to do.

3051
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:50,600
Yeah.

3052
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:54,360
Just do, you know, you can go to church and just not believe dude, tons of Christians

3053
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:56,360
do it every day.

3054
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:57,360
Fact.

3055
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:02,040
Everyone who's going to church is faking to a certain degree, probably true.

3056
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:06,440
Some more than even, even, you know, everyone's, everyone's, they're taking it on faith and

3057
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:10,320
everyone sometimes is like, maybe God, is this all bullshit?

3058
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:12,200
Ah, fuck.

3059
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:15,000
But they just fake it, you know, they just, they just push those thoughts out of their

3060
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,640
mind until they go away.

3061
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:18,440
And that's, that's, you know, that's, you know,

3062
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:22,880
AKA they reject their logic and, you know, thoughts for their feelings and to placate

3063
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:23,880
the people around them.

3064
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:25,680
You're all, you're all in the same boat.

3065
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,680
You're all in the same boat.

3066
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:29,720
You're all just, I'll just try to make it in this dog eat dog.

3067
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:31,280
Survival comes first and foremost, dude.

3068
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:35,760
So, you know, do what you got to do, but be a good, good, be a good thing.

3069
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:39,600
And remember to thank the Lord for all that, for all that good, good wisdom.

3070
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,600
From the PCP.

3071
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:41,600
Yeah.

3072
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:42,600
Right.

3073
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,600
That's right.

3074
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:44,600
Okay.

3075
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,600
Next up, we got them snakes.

3076
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:46,600
How many, how many more we got?

3077
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:47,600
Two more or two more.

3078
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:48,600
Cool.

3079
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:49,600
And here's them snakes.

3080
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:50,600
Hashtag team Ben.

3081
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:54,560
I don't know, he's hashtag team Ben now.

3082
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:57,480
So I mean, let's, let's see what we've got happening.

3083
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:58,480
Ben's interested.

3084
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:05,000
Ben said, I accept your proposal to join forces to defeat munchies.

3085
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
There you go.

3086
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
All right.

3087
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:14,240
I fucking hate babies and munchie is the biggest baby boy I've ever seen.

3088
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,240
Yes.

3089
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:25,680
I am disappointed by the clear and obvious racism you feel towards snake people kind.

3090
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:28,200
There I go in your territory.

3091
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:31,440
I am confronted with stairs.

3092
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:39,240
Do you have any idea how fucking difficult it is to navigate stairs as a fucking pile

3093
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,240
of snakes?

3094
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:50,960
You are not tolerating this snake phobic bigotry in this alliance, however, if you promise

3095
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:58,320
to install more ramps, I may be inclined to not bite your ankles in the middle of

3096
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,320
the night.

3097
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:02,320
You fucking communist shit.

3098
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:13,600
I don't have you, I don't anymore, next step of kill munchie is fucking gay.

3099
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:14,600
Well, all right.

3100
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:15,600
I like snakes.

3101
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:17,640
Why are you so mean to snakes, Ben?

3102
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:18,640
Yeah, Ben.

3103
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:23,160
You know, it was a crime of ignorance.

3104
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:27,800
I think, all right, we can reach an agreement here.

3105
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:34,480
All right, first thing tomorrow, everyone remind me, don't let me forget, I'm going

3106
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:36,280
to call my guy.

3107
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:39,800
We're going to get some ramps installed in St. Ben's Cathedral.

3108
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:40,800
That's nice.

3109
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:44,960
We're going to let him fucking lurch and slither his way on up.

3110
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:49,440
He's going to shamble his way on up to the narthex and we're going to have a little meeting

3111
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:50,720
of the mines.

3112
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:51,720
That sounds great.

3113
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:52,720
That sounds great.

3114
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:56,320
Look at this image of the snakes from Baaljap.

3115
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:58,120
I think them snakes might be related.

3116
02:18:58,120 --> 02:18:59,720
Damn, I think you're probably right.

3117
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:08,440
Yeah, I think these might be the snakes that became them snakes.

3118
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:16,520
Next up, we've got our final message, a final message, and this is from HardPP.

3119
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:20,360
HardPP, let's bring us home, HardPP.

3120
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:22,360
What do you got?

3121
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:27,120
Why is my PP hard?

3122
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:30,000
Is it because you listened to the bonus episode?

3123
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Did...

3124
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Who's that?

3125
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,800
No, it's because he listened to the boners episode.

3126
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:41,200
All right, that's it.

3127
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,760
It's over, everybody.

3128
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:44,760
Episode completed.

3129
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,880
We've done our obligation to you.

3130
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:54,040
Now continue to give us the currency, patreon.com, slash the procrastinators, $5 for bonus episodes.

3131
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:55,880
There's 21 now, I believe.

3132
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:58,800
Jesus Christ, that's a lot of content.

3133
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:03,840
There'll be another one coming up, a couple of weeks, calm down, relax, it'll be here.

3134
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:10,720
T.P.Crastinators on Twitter, send us more of that cool epic memory that we love so well,

3135
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,760
and I guess that's about...

3136
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:18,480
Oh, and of course, send us more voicemails to the Speakpipe, link down in the description.

3137
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:20,200
That's great stuff, keep doing it, people.

3138
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:21,200
All right, that's it.

3139
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:22,200
Thanks for that.

3140
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:23,200
Thank you.

3141
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,200
Thanks for the outro.

3142
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,200
Thanks for the outro, as always.

3143
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:26,200
Best guy ever.

3144
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:27,200
Yes.

3145
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,200
You're a credit to the race.

3146
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:29,200
Thank you.

3147
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:30,200
Appreciate it.

3148
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,200
Love being white.

3149
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:32,200
Wrapping it up here, everybody.

3150
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:33,200
See you next time.

3151
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:34,200
Bye.

3152
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,200
Goodbye.

3153
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,200
Yeah.

3154
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:37,200
Yeah.

3155
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:38,200
Yeah.

3156
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:39,200
Oh.

3157
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,200
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3158
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,200
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3159
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,200
But I'm not working.

3160
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,200
I'm doing nothing.

3161
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,200
My dick, I'm jerking.

3162
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:45,200
Myself, I'm sucking.

3163
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:46,200
I'm not working.

3164
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,200
I'm not working.

3165
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,200
I'm not working.
