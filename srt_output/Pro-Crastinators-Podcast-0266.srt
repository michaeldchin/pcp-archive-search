00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No unexpected guests arriving. Welcome to episode whatever of the Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint. I just got done recording my Patreon Q&A podcast, which I said last week on the PCP that I was going to record right after that episode got finished recording.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But instead I did it right before this episode because I had a busy week and I didn't feel like it. Patreon.com slash Ben Saint, if you want to hear that. It's a bunch of questions about my game and just some other general stuff. It's just whatever anyone wanted to fucking ask me.

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Uh, it's true. Uh, it's true. Um, this week, I've been doing shit. I've been hanging out with Munchy and Kazzie, who moved and I would, well, generously I could describe what I did as helping them move, but not really.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Um, and then they had a housewarming party and uh, so everyone's always wondering, oh, where did Munchy, everyone's calm, getting bombarded with, with emails and voicemails. Ben, where's Munchy been? Where's Munchy? That's not true. That's not actually true. But once in a while, someone brings it up. I think everyone, anyway, whatever, we hung out. It was cool. Uh, that's, I don't know. I guess that's all I have to say about that. Oh my God.

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What would, hmm, what would the PCP audience like to hear me opine about this week? I know after the last two episodes, maybe some of you might be clamoring for, uh, for updates on, on the Trixie situation. Did, did Ben take an L this week?

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did Ben, did Ben increase his W streak to two? Um, unfortunately, no. Unfortunately, I have nothing else to report on that. Uh, there's no, no developments there, which is good. Everyone makes fun of me. Everyone says, Ben, you're a fucking loser. You're a big asshole jerk, picking on poor, what's her face?

8
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Picking on the poor little golden witch. You can't defend yourself. Oh, you so mean. So, you know, everyone, you're such a bully, Ben. So, you know, I gotta, I gotta, I just gotta do what people tell me to do.

9
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I just have to just accept that that is the truth. And also there's no more developments, which is good. Uh, that's, that's not, it's not important. No, no. It's no big deal. It's no big deal. I wasn't mad. I was never mad. I've never been mad and I never will be.

10
00:03:43,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, yes, apologies. No, no more drama there. Oh my God, I'm only three minutes in. I'm only three minutes into the episode. I'm floundering. I'm floundering. I have, I have no material. I already used all my material for my patrons in it. And that wasn't even good. And now I've gone through all my best material and there's nothing, there's nothing left that's even passable.

11
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a hack. I'm a fraud. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a joker. I'm the joker. I'm joker fine. Baby. Um, she, I'm tempted to go right to voicemails. I'm tempted to go right to voicemails. Um, I can mind fucking do it. I'm sure I'll find some stuff. I'm one, I'm sure I will find some stuff that bears.

12
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That will prompt me into speaking on something else too. I'm, I'm sure I feel like probably Gible show up at some point. I don't know. I don't know if that's true. Whatever. Let's just fucking go to voicemails. And if I, if I think of something else to talk about later, I will.

13
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There are no rules. I made the rules. I can, I can make up new ones. So here we go. First voicemail this week is called Ben taint two, three, two. Wait, wait. No, I do have one more thing. I have one thing that I do want to bring up. This is relevant in that it's about YouTube shit.

14
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I feel like stuff I've been watching on YouTube is relevant PCP discussion. So I will bring it up. I found a YouTube channel. And I feel like I've, I feel like I've discovered a little bit of a rabbit hole here. And I feel like if I feel some people I mentioned this to seem to know who this was and knew a lot more about him than I did. And I felt kind of dumb, like, Oh, am I an idiot that I've never found this person before that I don't know who this is.

15
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I feel like there's a rabbit hole. Um, there's a YouTube channel called action button, which I found due to a, a five hour review popped up in my recommended for a, a.

16
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, I don't, I don't think it is obscure, but I'd never heard of it before dating sim called toky meky memorial. And this was a YouTube channel called action button is a five hour review of this. And I was like fuck yeah, long videos of a guy talking about a video game. That is my I'm the I'm the target audience here.

17
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Um, so I listened to all that. And I was like, well, this was, I had, I had some criticism of it. I thought that his voice, the guy, Tim Rogers, he does a very, he's, he's always putting on a voice. And sometimes it bugs me. Not all the time, but sometimes I don't like his voice. He's like mostly tongue in cheek about it, which is fine.

18
00:06:39,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But in this video in particular, it felt like he was trying to be, he is jokey, but he was more serious. And in the serious times, his like kind of fake putting on a voice stick. I found it a little irritating. But anyway, I watched, I think I've watched like most of his, I think he's only got like four videos up and they're all really long videos where he talks about a video game.

19
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Um, and I, his channel is not huge. He's only got like, he's got like 65k subs, which is like modest, modest, medium, large, large ish. And I look, but he's patron is huge. He's got like making like 50, 50, sorry, $15,000 a month. That's really big. And I, I'm like, so who is this guy? And I, I, I guess he's, I guess he's some kind of.

20
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Journalist, he's a games journalist, but like in some of his, in at least one of his videos, he's explicitly said, I am not a journalist. I do not consider myself a journalist. So that's confusing. I guess most of the time he just describes himself as a game designer, because he's made like a couple of games, but they seem like they're games that no one's ever heard of.

21
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I, and I wonder if maybe that's more important to him. So that's what he talks about, but he's known more for journalism stuff, but he doesn't care as much about that. I don't know.

22
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Um, but this, I mean, the fact that I'd never heard of this guy, and I found him and his channel is modest, and yet he's, he's apparently got like a huge base of support from something. I mean, I don't know where it comes from.

23
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think it's from, because he used to write for Kotaku. I think that's the deal. And it just made me reflect on, it made me reflect on indie stuff and what it means to be indie because like I'm, I'm indie.

24
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have no institutional support of any kind from anywhere. And I have, I have squeezed out a little niche on the internet where some people know me, some people follow my work and support me a bit. And it's pretty great.

25
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But this guy, I mean, I'm sure he's had a longer career than I'm even aware of. I'm sure he's written for various things for a long time. But like the fact that he is known through a like, through a like an institutionally supported outlet like Kotaku, that makes, that dwarfs anything else.

26
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right. If you get, if you get institutional support from like something big, it makes everything else look like nothing. Am I making sense? I just made me like, damn, if you are, if you're some guy making YouTube videos, 75k subscribers, you're nobody.

27
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Right. You might have a couple hundred dollars through Patreon a month, if you're lucky. But if you're, oh, you're that, you're that Kotaku guy. Oh, you've written for all these, these publications. You're $15,000. Right. If you're, if you're successful and popular at that.

28
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If people know you positively through something like that, you're just, you're just in a whole different league. And I, I don't know how it makes me feel mad, despair, discouragement, horror, terror, existential dread.

29
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah. I guess I don't have anything else to say about it other than, boy, what a gulf. What a fucking gulf. I don't know. I guess I would recommend his channel. I'm saying all this, I'm sure this comes off as negative. But I say this with the, I don't know, check his videos out. They seem pretty good.

30
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Also, I'm sure him doing videos seems like a new thing. It seems like he's been writing for a long, I haven't read any of his other, I don't know what he did before action button. Well, I guess, I guess action button is the name of his game studio, but also the name of his YouTube channel.

31
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, I don't know. Feels goofy. It feels goofy for me to be opining about this guy who has a much longer career than I even know about. And I know only like this very slim segment of the stuff he's put out there to be like, oh, wow, I found this guy on YouTube.

32
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And anyone who probably knows anything about ethics and games journalism, like, um, I've been following his work for a million years, and I am a genius and you are a room. And I would agree with that.

33
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't know. I've been, I've been listening to that. His videos are really long. So I've had a lot of that to listen to. I'm like, basically done. I think, I think today I, oh, no, no, I, today I finished the last of his five YouTube videos that I had seen.

34
00:11:46,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And now I went over to an older series that he did for Kotaku called Let's Mosey, wherein he goes basically not line by line or anything, but he goes pretty granularly through the English translation of Final Fantasy seven and explains like, why is this line weird?

35
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What did it say in the original Japanese? Why did it get translated this way? What was the original intention? What was the translator's intention? Etc. That's like, it's like 14 videos, and I think I'm like seven away through there.

36
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's neat. It's pretty neat. Um, I don't know. So maybe I'll find more shit that that guy's made and check it out in the future. I don't know, because I don't read. I just watch YouTube videos and try and do sprites as I draw sprites and whatever for my video game project.

37
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Phantom's revenge in the works. Check it, check out the updates, check out the patrons only exclusive updates and progress reports at patreon.com slash Ben St. And in my patrons only exclusive discord.

38
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Another channel on my disc public public channel. No private channel patrons only channel public server. Actually, I deleted all the I deleted all the the links to the server so that server has kind of been private, although I think I think I'm ready to maybe put public out the links to that server again.

39
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Also, I want to I have been feeling.

40
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because we were getting trolled some some some fuck boys were trolling us spamming us. So I close all the links so that we forget about that.

41
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I might make links public again and update the links and like my old, you know, lecture videos and on Twitch and wherever Twitter and I don't think I have any links up to that on Twitter, but whatever.

42
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I have been feeling.

43
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I've just been thinking lately that I love my discord server.

44
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I really like my discord server. It's really active. And you know, it's mostly it's mostly familiar faces. It's mostly like the same.

45
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Now there's a little community of maybe, I don't know, 20 plus people that talk in there regularly. And then maybe there's some more people that chime in occasionally a broader number.

46
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I just think it's really nice that I have this server that I made and I'm, I guess, the leader of or whatever whatever it even means to be the to be the server owner. I'm the server owner.

47
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's my little space. And there's people in there. And it's pretty active and they're always talking. There's always some kind of usually there's some conversation going on.

48
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And I've been looking at it more lately. In the past, I have sometimes neglected or not looked at it for a while, but lately I'm looking at it pretty often.

49
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm just like, it's, I appreciate, I appreciate that these people are in here in this online space that I created that they choose to spend their time here and interact with one another and me and I think that's nice and it makes me happy.

50
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Cool.

51
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Very embarrassing. All right, the whatever.

52
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Fuck, let's let's start the voice let's let's listen to a voicemail. This one is called bent how far in how far into this.

53
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Wow, I stretched that I stretched out to 15 minutes. Pretty good. If I do say so myself. Okay, let's first voicemail Ben taint two three, two, one, go.

54
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Where is it? Where is it? The scroll only one person could have done this or scroll one person could have taken the scroll. Ben taint.

55
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's right. My nemesis. You must have stolen the scroll from the league of night scrolls. Let's get some scrolls that you take a scroll with all the secrets of how to fuck.

56
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This scroll is 300,000 yen.

57
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We didn't realize you were into that. Let's get it.

58
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Then you have two ways out of this. Either return the Nate fucking scroll.

59
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Unacceptable.

60
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Or join the league of Nate fuckers.

61
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

62
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't have to pay dues, right?

63
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll sign me up. I'll sign me up. I'll sign whatever. Just put a name in front of me. I'll sign it. I'll join.

64
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay. Easy. Easy.

65
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Next voicemail.

66
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
SM part one, three, two, one, go.

67
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And now Yig Studios Riley performing discord.

68
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Is this real?

69
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
One behind you.

70
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh.

71
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, that's that was rough. Is that real?

72
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It did sound like him.

73
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know where that's from, but I hope that's real. Very funny.

74
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Sounds like a little fucking baby.

75
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't know. Maybe it's maybe it's not actually him.

76
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't tell.

77
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You can never, you can never be sure.

78
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay. Next one is called SM part two, three, two, one, go.

79
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
All right, boys. How do you make a lot of money? Let's say you're 18 years old. What do you do?

80
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You go to college, get a CS degree, be an entrepreneur.

81
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let me know.

82
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Computer science.

83
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No joke answers, please.

84
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I mean, I mean, just based on the people I know.

85
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, that's what you do.

86
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You get a computer science degree or you even just no computer.

87
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You don't even necessarily need a degree.

88
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But you, but you understand computer science and data structures and whatever.

89
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And you get a friend who's got a job doing that and they recommend you.

90
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And then you get a job and you just get like pretty good money because that's like something that people need.

91
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah. If you want to make, you don't want to make a bunch of money, go to school, learn computer science, get a job doing computer science.

92
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Seems like the most straightforward way that I've seen.

93
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't know. I don't know any better ways with a higher degree of success off the top of my head.

94
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you answer your own question in a good, good work?

95
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You already knew you had it inside of you all along.

96
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You didn't need me.

97
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay.

98
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Next voicemail.

99
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I am L three, two, one, go.

100
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Greetings.

101
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I am L.

102
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is a message to the one who calls himself Ben Saint.

103
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's me.

104
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Ben.

105
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I know that you killed your brother Nate shortly after the end of the show called content.

106
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I also know that the videos recently posted to his channel are part of a backlog.

107
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And they have been uploaded by you to try and cover up his death.

108
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm a weekend at Bernie's in his channel.

109
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And then I'll know your motivations for killing your own brother.

110
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I am close and I am justice.

111
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
L doesn't sound like that.

112
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

113
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What motivations do you need?

114
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I just did it because it was funny.

115
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I just did it because it was funny and cool.

116
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I was just being cool.

117
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I'm the reason people are dying.

118
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Those two together form all the motive necessary.

119
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The first one is called interrupting death pig three, two, one, go.

120
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay.

121
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I have a serious question about the like the patreon and when you buy like the bonus episodes,

122
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
how do you get them?

123
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Is it like a private YouTube set of videos and then you get the links to them?

124
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Or is it like mp3 shits?

125
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You have to download.

126
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Because like, I just want to know how you, well, what way.

127
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I get it.

128
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
No, I get it.

129
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
At first I was confused, but then I realized the title of the, of the voicemail explains everything.

130
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The, I think, I don't even know.

131
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think I'm just going to pretend the pig didn't interrupt.

132
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I think that when you patron, you get a, there are posts that you can then see, which have links to the bonus episodes,

133
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
which also link to a master list playlist, like a private, or not private, the other one,

134
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
an unlisted playlist that has all the bonus episodes in it.

135
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think that's how it works.

136
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I mean, I'm not a paid, I'm not a patron of this bullshit.

137
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, I think, I think that's, yeah.

138
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

139
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay.

140
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Next voicemail is called if Ben can relate three, two, one, go.

141
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So this is an argument I've been having with my friends for the last few days.

142
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And I felt like Ben, because I was explaining my point and they didn't get it.

143
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I would just get angrier and angrier.

144
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's me.

145
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
My point being, I think it's fucking illogical to believe or to.

146
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

147
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Great, great bit.

148
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Great bit.

149
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Definitely won't get old.

150
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay.

151
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh my God.

152
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Two was too many.

153
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
All right.

154
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That was a little annoying.

155
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If I hear a third one like that, I'm going to get actually annoyed.

156
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay.

157
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Next one is called how could you been three, two, one, go.

158
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You know, I sent a voicemail last week, Ben, and I was super stoked to hear you and give

159
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
talk about it.

160
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What?

161
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Which one?

162
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Behold, you did not misgender me.

163
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Great.

164
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What the fuck?

165
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I specifically send voicemails in to be misgendered.

166
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm so sorry.

167
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And you did not give me that luxury.

168
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I apologize.

169
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Very shameful.

171
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I apologize.

172
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Ben, I hope you feel bad.

173
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You should feel bad about yourself.

174
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You guys got a va.

175
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're horrible.

176
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You just got a va all the time.

177
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And then no one ever gets the opportunity to be, and it's the satisfaction of getting

178
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
to be mad at me.

179
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm too smart.

180
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I head off all criticism at the past, nip it in the bud, chop off its dick.

181
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Next one is called turn off the PCP comments three, two, one, go.

182
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I mean, true, true.

183
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, someone in the comments last week asked when can someone tell me when and the answer

184
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,920
is if you listened to the show, you would know because obviously I've been asked that

185
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,480
question a lot.

186
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,240
So, you know, I don't know, but whatever, no, comments are good.

187
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,560
Most comments are good.

188
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,520
Usually I like reading the comments in an episode, so I will not be turning off PCP comments,

189
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,680
but thank you for your input.

190
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,640
Next one is called turn off the PCP comments, but actually do it three, two, one, go.

191
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,000
I do genuinely think the comments should just fucking be turned off if you have something

192
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,400
to say, but it's not worth the effort of making a fucking voicemail, then maybe you

193
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,760
should have be saying it at all.

194
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,000
No, I can't believe it happened again.

195
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,640
Like the exact same thing happened where the new GeoWizard mission across Scotland straight

196
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,480
line mission video dropped and I'm like, I gotta sit down with a nice cup of tea full

197
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,000
screen there so that I can't see notifications and sit down and watch exactly, it's just

198
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the same time the PCP records.

199
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,480
These things are predictable.

200
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,560
These things are predictable.

201
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
You can know in advance.

202
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
I could have seen it coming.

203
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:59,280
The upload schedule for this would be consistent with the time the PCP happens.

204
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:08,520
All I'm saying is I was happily watching part seven of Tim Rogers' Let's Mosey a slow

205
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:18,360
translation of Final Fantasy 7 and I had to painstakingly wrench myself away from that

206
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:30,480
in order to deliver this pig slop to our brain dead audience who will eat it up from the

207
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
trough.

208
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,840
My excuse is that I have to full screen that shit and because it's full screen I couldn't

209
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,840
see notifications because discord was underneath.

210
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
True.

211
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
True.

212
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm sorry.

213
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,920
It won't happen again or will it?

214
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,280
That's the reason you come back next week is to see whether I do the same mistake.

215
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,720
Does give beat times in a row.

216
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,240
Well I have been listening to some voicemails.

217
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,520
Listen to some voicemails for my entire fucking podcast.

218
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,480
I just kind of talked for like 15 minutes and then had nothing else to say and just kind

219
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,920
of went into voicemails expecting that you would eventually show up.

220
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,720
None of the voicemails have been good so far.

221
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Sorry everyone.

222
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Okay.

223
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
But it's true.

224
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
They've all been bad.

225
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
You haven't missed anything of value.

226
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Wait.

227
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Am I right?

228
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes.

229
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Yes.

230
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Bad.

231
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Well.

232
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Okay.

233
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
What's up?

234
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
What's up?

235
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Good.

236
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:42,520
Well I've gotten into a new life ruining thing.

237
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,720
It's called number go up.

238
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,480
It's an idle game and you know how I am about those.

239
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,200
I play them too much and then I have to wrench myself away from them and it's always painful

240
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,680
and I don't know.

241
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,320
I saw like it in a video and I was like oh number go up.

242
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
That's fun.

243
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,560
Oh look at the numbers go up.

244
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,720
What a quirky self aware title.

245
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,320
It is self aware.

246
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,160
But the numbers do go up though.

247
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
But they do.

248
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,520
They do go up though.

249
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
They do.

250
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Okay.

251
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,560
And so I've been playing that for the past few days and that's stupid.

252
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Sure.

253
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,000
But it's fun.

254
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,240
Other than that, the Lord of Ghosts Kickstarter, I don't know whether I talked about it last

255
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,920
time on the PCP.

256
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,520
Maybe I mentioned something.

257
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,560
I feel like maybe you mentioned that you were thinking about it or considering it.

258
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Yeah.

259
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,960
It was like hoodie gave me the idea when they were on with the cat-o thing.

260
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,280
I was like yeah that's a good idea and I spent the time to make it real, make it happen and

261
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,200
I've got to the point where I've ordered a sample of the pin.

262
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,920
There's a pin involved.

263
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,560
I have made a video to promote it.

264
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
I'm just waiting for the cat-o.

265
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
I saw the video.

266
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
The video is very funny.

267
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Good.

268
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
I like it a lot.

269
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,440
I like it a lot.

270
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,440
I was stressing out over the video for a while because I'm like I don't want to record my

271
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,320
voice speaking the things that I'm going to have to type.

272
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,920
Like I'm going to have to type all of this into the Kickstarter.

273
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,800
That in itself is painful because I'm like how do I make this interesting and fun to

274
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,520
read such that people would actually want to do any of this stuff.

275
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
It's impossible.

276
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,000
And it's just a slog.

277
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,240
It's just a slog putting the necessary information in a line and then also making it in paragraphs

278
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,720
with full stops impossible.

279
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,320
But then the prospect of then taking that and then saying it in a video was like no

280
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
that sucks.

281
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,360
I don't want to do that.

282
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,920
I don't want to put myself on camera either because I don't have my camera mostly.

283
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,360
Is that home?

284
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,000
Where's the parents?

285
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,320
I was saying earlier that I'm considering.

286
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,640
Wait, no, this.

287
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
No, I wasn't saying earlier.

288
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,760
I was said this in my Patreon podcast, which is different, but I'm confused because I recorded

289
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,880
that before and now I forget which one I said which thing in.

290
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,080
But I was saying there that I'm considering dropping a little money on like a better web

291
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,000
camera because like my my let's read video.

292
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,600
I think it looks amateurish.

293
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,240
I think the video quality is bad to the point that it like kind of detracts from it.

294
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,960
And I'm I think I want a good one to make crisp.

295
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,640
Film.

296
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah, it's always good to have a nice quality webcam.

297
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,440
To make, you know, to, you know, to make some high quality people movies as as I as I am

298
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,160
want to do the math.

299
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,720
I didn't have a webcam for the longest time, but then there was a there was an

300
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,200
up is a moment where I needed it for like a Zoom call or like a Skype call with a person

301
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
who wasn't like an internet person.

302
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,440
So I was like, oh, you know, it feels kind of unprofessional for them to be in their suit

303
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,240
with that with that Zoom call and me just audio.

304
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,520
So I got one, but I still look like shit, so I will never turn it on.

305
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,400
Um, so actually I was wasting money.

306
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,800
Absolutely.

307
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,040
Absolutely.

308
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:25,480
Anyway, the Lord of Ghosts, I got the video made and I'm I'm Kickstarter went through

309
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,440
the review process and it's ready to go.

310
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,800
I could launch it at any moment.

311
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,640
I've been going over money things.

312
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,920
There's a plush idea.

313
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,640
Oh, we did talk about it because we talked about the funny Lord of Ghosts.

314
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,440
I saw.

315
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,120
Did I see some some like design shit?

316
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,520
About that.

317
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,800
I drew up a little, a little crude little design of a Lord of Ghosts plush and I sent

318
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,760
that over to to get a sample made, which is like, I'm considering that like my own

319
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,560
personal money, but if the Kickstarter ends up reimbursing me, then that's good.

320
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,760
Just so I can see what it would look like.

321
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,160
It's probably going to be good quality and I've given like specific instructions and

322
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,440
they're going to get the same people that made the pump one.

323
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Yeah, it's the same people.

324
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,400
Yeah, they they have the good quality and they have the power and I just need them.

325
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,120
I'm very good.

326
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,120
They have the know how they have the skills to pay the bills.

327
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,280
Yeah.

328
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,440
So everything's all set up.

329
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm just waiting for the Kato anthology Kickstarter to end or near its end, just so

330
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't like step on their toes or anything.

331
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,680
It's fair enough.

332
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,600
That's fair enough.

333
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,400
And that's like halfway done now.

334
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
So we.

335
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,480
They are they had a they had a live stream as they were approaching their second.

336
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,440
Wait, I think it's their first stretch goal, actually, the thirty five hundred,

337
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,640
which they hit during the stream.

338
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,520
So they have reached they are on to their second kicks stretch goal now, which is

339
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,440
pretty cool, pretty cool, pretty happy for them, I guess.

340
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,320
Pretty congratulations are in order, I suppose.

341
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,840
Oh, yeah.

342
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,600
OK, so I don't know what was I talking about?

343
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,080
Yeah, you would the Kickstarter.

344
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,920
I don't know, I was I was half thinking I could just launch it

345
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,960
because they've already reached their initial goal.

346
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,280
But I feel like it's it's sort of bad form to just I don't know.

347
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,840
I mentioned it to them and they said they appreciated it.

348
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,840
So they can wait a little bit.

349
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Yeah, I mean, I've still got to like to write the the stories for the the ghost

350
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,000
story, vaporette-esque things.

351
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,360
So there's things to do in the game.

352
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,600
And it'll help that I'm able to probably like get the sample of the

353
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,320
the enamel pin of the ghost so I can look at it and be like, oh,

354
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,600
I now can take a picture of it and prove it is real.

355
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,120
It would be it would be pretty nice to have pictures of the pin and the plush

356
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,600
to like show.

357
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,040
I yeah, I did that.

358
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,160
And when I was doing the my previous kick starters, like I've yeah,

359
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,720
I've sent off requests and printed up the at least like sample versions

360
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,440
of the books and stuff so that I can have it in front of me, take pictures of it,

361
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,560
be like, this is the product, this is what you get.

362
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,520
If you this is what you get, this is what you deserve.

363
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,880
Yeah, you just show the actual product in a picture

364
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,320
instead of it being a hypothetical, you know.

365
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,200
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,360
So I don't know if for some reason I looked at the the printing company

367
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,240
for the comic, I don't think I can get like a sample in like a like a,

368
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,360
you know, order a check out style.

369
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,840
I maybe I'll have to email them and ask, are you are you printing with

370
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,560
Kaplan or using someone else?

371
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm printing with what is it called?

372
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:05,120
Mixam, which is also a UK based and it's very good quality

373
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,240
from what I can see for press.

374
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,720
And yeah, they've got a lot of good options for stuff.

375
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,120
And yeah, I think I'm going to go with them, but I need a sample.

376
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,240
I we we have to we have to pick a printing service to print the

377
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,680
road to Radcon book when it's done.

378
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,000
I feel like a comic printer might not be the cheapest option

379
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,360
because it's mostly text, but I don't know.

380
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,920
Well, I feel like it should be the case, but I don't know if it's the case.

381
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,920
You can you can make like leaflets with these sorts of services,

382
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,400
like small little things, brochures.

383
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,560
Because it's it's only like 20 pages, I think maybe 30.

384
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,480
It's yeah, if that be like I feel like that would work.

385
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,960
Maybe the printing cost would be higher than it would otherwise be

386
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
because it's mostly text and it's expecting images if it's a comic thing.

387
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,040
I just feel like I don't know.

388
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,760
I just feel like text printing is cheaper.

389
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,240
And I don't I feel like it should be, right?

390
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,160
Like it should be pictures should cost more to print.

391
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,320
Yeah, you're right.

392
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,080
It will have some images in it, but mostly mostly text.

393
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,560
Whereas like the dojin, I think would I would probably just say,

394
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,680
yeah, let's just use Kablam.

395
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,240
That's the one that's like cheapest for me.

396
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,920
Well, we're going to like physically print the dojin.

397
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,360
I thought that was just like a thing like it needs to exist.

398
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,720
Shit, I thought so.

399
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,160
But I could be wrong.

400
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,280
I could be misremembering.

401
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,000
I remember specifically like the Rotoradcon will make a Kickstarter.

402
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,000
Make a book and then send it to backers.

403
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,320
And the dojin was just like

404
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,640
if I feel like it was different, I feel like that wasn't like a physical reward.

405
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Well, shit, I don't even know.

406
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,560
I don't even remember.

407
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,880
We have to have to go back and dojin dot com or whatever.

408
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,440
We'll have to go back and listen to the stream and listen to our specific wording.

409
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,560
Like what exactly did we say we were going to do?

410
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,440
Because I don't remember.

411
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,720
Well, whatever it was, legally binding.

412
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,440
Well, you look at the Kickstarter itself, what we said in the stream.

413
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,720
I don't know. What would be legally binding?

414
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,760
Well, I mean, nothing. Nothing's legally binding.

415
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
OK, you don't.

416
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,760
You don't you like I don't you don't have to explain.

417
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,640
Yeah.

418
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,640
If you if you just fail to complete your Kickstarter stuff.

419
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,160
I mean, they can't sue you as long

420
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,120
unless they think that you like deliberately lied about it.

421
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,040
Unless it's like fraud.

422
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,480
Well, I don't think I think somebody could attempt to sue you, but like nobody bothers.

423
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,520
Like, there's plenty of starters that have made like fraudulent bullshit claims.

424
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,800
They never deliver on the product.

425
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
And yeah, it just never turns into anything.

426
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,960
And then the creators of it just make a new thing later with a different

427
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,800
eye coat of paint and people get hype all over again for the new thing.

428
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,080
With like under a different company name, like they just move on

429
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,480
and nothing ever comes back because an individual would need to like

430
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,720
know about the Kickstarter and then file a lawsuit.

431
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,720
I think I mean, they would probably have to file like a like a like a class action lawsuit

432
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,520
where all the backers like cosine and are represented by like a single attorney

433
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
that brings charges something like that individuals or LLC.

434
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,760
Let's meet.

435
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,200
I mean, to be clear, it's all a moot point

436
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
because we will be delivering on everything.

437
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
So this is none of this applies to us.

438
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
True.

439
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,080
We're untouchable.

440
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,640
We're untouchably responsible.

441
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,120
Are you looking at that?

442
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,840
Are you looking at the I'm looking up the legal like on Kickstarter?

443
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,480
I feel like I've seen something where they've said, oh, I

444
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,880
they're kind of vague about it.

445
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,840
The actual language that they use is like

446
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,320
we do have like legal expectations for them to follow through on their stuff.

447
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,240
But like there's no I mean, you're right.

448
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,040
There's just no history of like anyone like successfully.

449
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,640
It's like so rare for anyone to get sued over like an undelivered

450
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,200
Kickstarter provides a funding platform for creative projects.

451
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,040
When a creator posts a project on Kickstarter,

452
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,760
they're inviting other people to form a contract with them.

453
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,280
Anyone who backs a project is accepting the creator's offer

454
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
and forming that contract.

455
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,000
Kickstarter is not a part of this contract.

456
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,960
The contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and their backers.

457
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,360
And then there's so what so what they're saying.

458
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,560
So what they're saying is don't don't blame us.

459
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, don't blame us blame the creator.

460
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,360
I mean, it's all just a bunch of it's all just whatever.

461
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,160
That's just that's just them making shit out of being like, oh, yeah,

462
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,800
it's it's a contract between you.

463
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,600
It's like if OK, if you say so.

464
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,440
It's it's kind of solely responsible for filling the promises made in that project.

465
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,280
If they're unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement,

466
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,680
they may be subject to legal action by backers.

467
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,200
So just basically like do it yourself.

468
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,720
We're not involved.

469
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,520
Do it yourself.

470
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,960
It's the backers problem.

471
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
It's the creators problem.

472
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,720
Don't tell us about it.

473
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,120
We don't want to hear it.

474
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,360
We got out of that.

475
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,000
That's the thing.

476
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,880
Like if a backer is not financially able to do anything

477
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,680
individually by themselves, yeah, like by themselves legally,

478
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,200
they probably won't get any money back and they can't they can't appeal

479
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,440
to Kickstarter to help.

480
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,840
Yeah.

481
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,160
So that's it.

482
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,880
No, yeah.

483
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,280
Yeah.

484
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,480
Yeah.

485
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,440
Kickstarter is not responsible for.

486
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,520
Strong arming an irresponsible backer into giving a refund or whatever.

487
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,280
I suppose this person comes to that.

488
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,760
But I don't know what they are and I'm too dumb to think about them.

489
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,520
The pro is that Kickstarter doesn't have to do anything.

490
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,680
True. That's that's that's what they get out of it.

491
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,640
Makes sense.

492
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,560
If I were Kickstarter, I would do the same thing.

493
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm just an intermediary.

494
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,200
I'm just I'm not you're not forming any kind of contract with me.

495
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,840
I mean, that's like I mean, this is like PayPal would never want to be like

496
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,080
if you pay someone with PayPal and then they don't give you the thing they paid

497
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,200
for, they PayPal doesn't want to be like,

498
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,200
oh, you can appeal to PayPal and say that like they were responsible

499
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,360
for that broken contract.

500
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,200
Like, no, no, deal with it yourself, guys.

501
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,920
I mean, yeah, can you not go to a bank and say can say like this?

502
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,520
Like, can you not go to your bank and look at a transaction and say,

503
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,400
actually, I'd like that taken back if it's like fraudulent?

504
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,360
I think it depends on the bank.

505
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,680
I think I think it depends on the bank and like what you how you paid.

506
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,120
Like, did you use a credit card or a debit card?

507
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,560
I think you can in many cases appeal and be like, that's a fraudulent charge.

508
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,040
And the bank will be like, OK, we'll cancel that charge and refund you sometimes.

509
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,320
Something like kind of kind of kind of subject to their whims,

510
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,080
kind of subject to their whims and whether they feel like letting you do it.

511
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Like, like imagine a kid playing some sort of a game that has like money

512
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,440
transactions in it and they have their parents credit card information

513
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,800
on the console or whatever, they they rack up like huge debt.

514
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
You know, that happens.

515
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,120
They what how do they get their money back if at all?

516
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,640
Do they have to hope that the company.

517
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,960
I think they just allow to take that like to refund them.

518
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:10,120
Yeah, I think it's it's generally just like either the bank has to agree to be like, OK,

519
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,160
you're claiming these charges is fraudulent, we can cancel them and refund them.

520
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,160
Or the company can be like, OK, you're claiming that these charges were illegitimate.

521
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,560
We can cancel them and refund you.

522
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,880
But it's all at the whim of the bank or the company.

523
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,000
Like if they if they do that for you, they're basically just doing you a favor

524
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,240
or doing it because they they want to like either like retain you as a customer

525
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,440
through their gracious act of goodwill or they just want to look good

526
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,560
and or not give you like a reason to complain about them publicly.

527
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,560
If you were to do it and probably drop like

528
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,360
ten thousand dollars on something and you went to their bank and be like,

529
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,120
refund my ten thousand dollars, they'd probably just be like, no, fuck you.

530
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,840
We don't feel like it.

531
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,880
That ten thousand dollars is worth more to us than your goodwill.

532
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,480
So get fucked.

533
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,320
I think it's it's it's so it's so like, oh, unfortunate.

534
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,840
Oh, how terrible.

535
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,080
I spent my ten thousand dollars.

536
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,720
I spent my my ten thousand dollars of backup safety legal fees in case of a mishap,

537
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,400
just such for this occasion.

538
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,800
But now that I don't have the money, I can't pay for a lawyer to sue the guy.

539
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,000
Now I can't get the money back.

540
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,320
To a tragedy, a tale as old as time.

541
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,720
Says a lot about society.

542
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,800
Hmm. And yet we live in it.

543
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,760
We do. And yet you.

544
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Hmm. You say something about society and yet you live in it.

545
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Curious.

546
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
Very good.

547
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,440
Duh. Yes.

548
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,680
So that was anything.

549
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,520
OK, Kickstarter Kickstarter happening.

550
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
Cool. It's all by one.

551
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,240
Thanks. I'll buy your stupid book.

552
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,600
And I'm thinking of a price tag of right around zero dollars.

553
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,240
Oh, never mind. That's too much.

554
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Oh, it's never mind.

555
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,920
Oh, no, I can't afford it.

556
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,000
Oh, no, no, no.

557
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,400
Like L.A.S.R. cut that.

558
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
In fact, bleep it out and like replace it with like zero.

559
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,200
Replace it with saying zero and zero dollars.

560
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,800
Like, ah, it's so cheap.

561
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,520
You just can't not buy it.

562
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,160
I can't. I can't afford not.

563
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
I can't afford not to buy it. True.

564
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
Wait for the. Hell, yeah.

565
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,080
Wait for the video to drop.

566
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,680
And then you'll be so hype that you can't help it.

567
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,240
You'll be you'll be hook, line, and synchred by that.

568
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,840
The video is pretty hype.

569
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,880
The video is funny. I think people like it.

570
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,600
Based. It's pretty based, as one might one might say.

571
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,520
You could say that that video is just being cool.

572
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,120
It is.

573
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,640
Buy buy a t-shirt.

574
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,040
Link in the description.

575
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,760
Yeah, buy a t-shirt with the entire

576
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,400
all of the pages of the comic printed on the t-shirt.

577
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,520
Right. Sure.

578
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,040
So you can read it while you're while you're wearing a t-shirt.

579
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,520
While you're admiring yourself in the mirror.

580
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,960
Yeah. Well, you're admiring your new fit.

581
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,360
Like all like one hundred fucking pages of the comic

582
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,960
like mirrored on the t-shirt so that you can stand in the mirror and read the comic

583
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,120
and like adjust the the the fabric folds to be like,

584
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,080
what the fuck does that say? I squint.

585
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,760
Oh, that reminds me.

586
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:36,640
I am going to be applying for a table at shit.

587
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,240
Stop me if I've mentioned this before.

588
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm going to be applying for a table at not.

589
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,280
You know, I did. I talked about mice,

590
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,160
the the Massachusetts Independent Comic Expo

591
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,240
and how I want to get a table at it and how they're doing a mini and out an outdoor.

592
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,840
You don't remember they're doing an outdoor mini mice.

593
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,840
Shit, I should have talked about this on my Patreon podcast, but I forgot.

594
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,080
They're doing an outdoor mini mice where

595
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,040
yeah, it's like an outdoor con basically, but it's like only for local people.

596
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,600
They're not having like out of state people table.

597
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,320
And I think it's going to be smaller than a usual mice.

598
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,480
This was the one mice was where I met.

599
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,800
I met Abby Howard and Casey Green at the last one I went to,

600
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,200
which was God, like almost two years ago, because they didn't have one in 2020.

601
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,560
So the last one would have been in like summer of 2019.

602
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,400
Yeah, they're having this one in August.

603
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,880
I'm going to get I'm going to get a table.

604
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,840
I don't expect to like move a lot of product or anything like I'll have my comics.

605
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,560
I'll have a table.

606
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm mostly just doing it to like, I don't know.

607
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,960
Take a take a seat in like the comic scene,

608
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,440
maybe meet some other creators.

609
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,880
Because like when I went to mice before, I hated it

610
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,640
because I was just walking around seeing comics people sitting behind tables,

611
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,280
making small talk like a nice comic.

612
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,120
And then they're like, thanks, you want to buy one?

613
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,480
And I'm like, no, and that was my con going experience.

614
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,240
So I want to be on the other side of the table.

615
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,760
I think that sounds much more gratifying.

616
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,360
I don't even care. I don't even care if I sell anything like fuck it.

617
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,120
I should have applied.

618
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,360
Actually, I should have applied on the first of the month.

619
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,640
It's the sixth of the month today.

620
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,720
So I hope I didn't miss my chance because when I applied to be at mice 2020,

621
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,480
they have like immediately sold out and there were no tables left.

622
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,640
So I may be fucked.

623
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,680
But then, of course, mice 2020 didn't happen.

624
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,400
Lamal. So I guess it didn't matter.

625
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,400
Whoops. I don't know.

626
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,280
I should probably do that like immediately after I've been putting it off.

627
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,760
I've put it off for almost a week.

628
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,680
So you're not in yet?

629
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,800
You still have to apply?

630
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,760
I haven't. I haven't sent the application yet.

631
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,480
Today, I was putting I was putting together a portfolio

632
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,000
because they asked you to show a PDF or JPEG portfolio of your work.

633
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,280
So I was going through all my old vapor stuff

634
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,120
because I because like the books I'll be showing will be vapors books.

635
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,320
Because that's the only books I have.

636
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,960
I was going through them and converting them to JPEGs

637
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,400
before putting them in a zip file.

638
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,200
And I didn't actually get around to finishing

639
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,760
doing that. I have to do chapter one still, I think, and then send it off.

640
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,640
I don't know why they're so particular.

641
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,680
They could literally just they asked for my website, which, you know,

642
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,440
StComics.com, they could just look at my website to see my portfolio.

643
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:42,400
But they also ask, please attach a PDF or zip file or whatever of your shit.

644
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,480
And we prefer to look at the file.

645
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,400
Why would you prefer to look at the files?

646
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,680
Why wouldn't you prefer to just look at my website and you can see it there?

647
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,640
Like, why do you want to download stuff?

648
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,600
I don't get it.

649
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,640
They said that's what they like.

650
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,360
So I'm just going to do it that way, I guess.

651
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,000
Well, that's going to be pretty cool.

652
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,840
I hope so. I have been this this it must be like two years now

653
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,400
that I've been thinking, damn, I should really table at a con.

654
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,720
I'm a little disappointed that, like, it's not like a normal con this time.

655
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,560
It's kind of like it's the mini version, the outdoor.

656
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,360
I think the idea is that if it's outdoor and the tables are spaced apart,

657
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,640
it's like social distancing friendly.

658
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,720
I feel like social distancing restrictions will be lifted by August

659
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,640
because, like, I mean, in Massachusetts, like, everyone's vaccinated.

660
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,960
Like, almost everyone's had at least one shot already.

661
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,880
So I feel like it's going to be fine by then.

662
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,000
But I think they're just not sure about what their restrictions will be.

663
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,520
So they're playing it safe and being like, we're having an outdoor,

664
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,960
socially distanced mini version of our kind of little.

665
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,360
It's a little bit of a shame that it's not the normal one.

666
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,400
I mean, it's better than if they did have a normal version.

667
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,640
I'm sure I would have missed.

668
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,560
I'm sure I would have missed the the sign update by now.

669
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,480
So whatever, trade off.

670
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,320
Yeah, better than being canceled, sure.

671
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,320
You got to do it, though.

672
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,640
But if it's local, well, Casey Green might still be there.

673
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,160
Abby Howard won't be there because she's from Portland or lives in Portland.

674
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,520
Wait, does Casey Green live in Massachusetts?

675
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,640
I feel like he does. Hold on.

676
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,880
It's an Andrew.

677
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,880
He lives in Boston or around.

678
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
I think so.

679
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,720
I'm pretty sure he does.

680
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,560
I mean, I have I have.

681
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:40,000
You know, the you know, the like ethnic mural in a problem sleuth

682
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,320
in problem sleuth, I've seen that mural.

683
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,200
I've walked by that mural before.

684
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,720
It's it's great. It's even better in person.

685
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,120
Do you think he like he actually took pictures of it for that thing?

686
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,120
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

687
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,040
Well, he could have just Googled it.

688
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,680
Well, I mean, I mean, if it's

689
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,120
like I assumed it was just like a thing he had found online.

690
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,240
But if you've seen it in person and he thought that's really funny,

691
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,720
I'll put that in my comic.

692
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,320
I think he picked it because he lives in the area and he's seen it around

693
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,360
and he thought it was funny.

694
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,440
Yeah. And he put it and he put it in problem sleuth.

695
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,440
That's even better than just like finding something funny.

696
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,960
Um, yeah, from Googling.

697
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,520
I mean, I guess it makes more sense if you have like a you just notice it.

698
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,120
Because like, why would you ever think to Google murals like that?

699
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,360
You wouldn't.

700
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,760
Now, he must have seen it around in real life.

701
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,920
And yeah, Casey Green does live in Massachusetts.

702
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,600
He grew up in Oklahoma City, but I guess he lives in Massachusetts now.

703
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,120
Not sure where exactly.

704
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,200
But I was right.

705
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,960
So he might be there, actually, which would be pretty cool.

706
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,560
I guess I wouldn't say I'm like a huge Casey Green fan or anything.

707
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,680
I mean, I I haven't actually like read any of his.

708
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,680
I guess I read the anime club comics, which were fine.

709
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,760
I haven't read like what's the one he was making for a while.

710
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,360
He is a good boy.

711
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,760
I think it's called.

712
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,800
I haven't read that one.

713
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,080
The only Casey Green I know is the collaborative dog.

714
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,960
Oh, that as well.

715
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,560
But like the collaborative effort with him, Hussey and drill on this super

716
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,160
not super sweet bro and hella Jeff.

717
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,720
A new adventure quest for the missing spoon.

718
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,920
That was fun. Yeah, that makes sense.

719
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,280
That's the one that they that's the one that they kickstarted, right?

720
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,760
Yeah, they kickstarted it.

721
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,640
And it's such a weird book and has a spoon tucked inside that I still have.

722
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,600
I never got that one.

723
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,520
And I feel damn, I wish I wish I had it.

724
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,280
I would love to own a copy of that.

725
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,400
But I don't. It's it's great that the the they made it so

726
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,360
that the it's not like a perfect

727
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,640
like rectangle, it's like slightly angled

728
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,920
like the top half is slightly angled upwards from the spine.

729
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,240
So it's just sort of a weird, annoying shape.

730
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,160
And it's hard to notice at a glance, but then you have it in your hands.

731
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,880
You like, wait, this isn't like a proper book shape.

732
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,600
So many little things like that.

733
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,040
Obviously, it must have taken a lot of work to to like mass produce something

734
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,280
so stupid, because there's like 40, not 40,

735
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,120
like a few hundred pages at the end that are carved out

736
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,840
in the shape of a spoon where the spoon is.

737
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,040
Hmm. Hmm.

738
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,920
And that's called Oh, yeah.

739
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:38,160
That's the into incorporating the physical nature of the medium into the into the work.

740
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah. So dumb.

741
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,840
So dumb. I kind of love it.

742
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,200
Um, yeah, I got I got that book with the with the with the fidget spinner reward

743
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,080
here and I still have that fidget spinner.

744
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,000
It's the only fidget spinner I ever bought based based.

745
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,680
I have I think somewhere here, I have a fidget spinner that Econ gave me

746
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,440
that is really cool.

747
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,800
It's silver and gold and it has yin yangs on it.

748
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,960
It's made of metal and it kind of rules.

749
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,320
It's probably in a box somewhere.

750
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,840
So if if I get into that, if I get a table,

751
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,640
I'm looking at the page right now and I guess many mice will be August

752
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,680
twenty eighth and twenty ninth at Starlight Square

753
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,240
in the Central Square neighborhood of Cambridge.

754
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,280
I know where Central Square is.

755
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,640
I don't know what Starlight Square is.

756
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,320
I don't think I've ever been there before.

757
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,520
And I'm a little surprised because previous

758
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,160
mices have been at Porter Square inside of the

759
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,240
I think it's a Tufts campus building that they've been at before

760
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,720
or maybe not, but it's some building in Porter Square.

761
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,640
But I guess this time it's Starlight Square.

762
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,360
How how magical, how mysterious and a pony full, how pony.

763
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,960
Pony up.

764
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,440
Hey, when's that new pony coming out?

765
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,960
Sometime this summer, I remember something.

766
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,760
Oh, I can't wait.

767
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,440
I can't wait to be Pony Boy again.

768
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,480
I can't wait for the new Minecraft thing to come out and the pony.

769
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,760
And it'll be exactly like it used to be.

770
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,600
It'll be exactly like 2001, a space Odyssey.

771
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,920
I should mention.

772
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,680
I think I think I mentioned this on Shekels for heckles.

773
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,160
No, no, it was after Shekels for heckles.

774
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,200
I talked on Shekels for heckles.

775
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,320
I talked about how I was really into the Thaumcraft mod

776
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,560
that was in that's in there.

777
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,280
It's on their server after the the stream.

778
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,120
I grinded, I grinded Thaumcraft.

779
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,040
I grinded through the like quest line of it.

780
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,560
And I got it and I unlocked all the shit and I made the void metal

781
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,600
and I crafted the cool hood and not just the cool hood.

782
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:01,840
I crafted the cool evil fucking void alchemists hood and robe and pants.

783
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,080
And now I look like a fucking demon and it is gratifying.

784
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,160
I am so pleased with myself that I look like a void wizard now.

785
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,200
I just wanted everyone to know that I I did it.

786
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,520
I beat Thaumcraft.

787
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,960
Nice is very nice, very cool.

788
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,520
So next time we check all I will be looking scary.

789
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,120
And is that the Thaumcraft what thing is it called?

790
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,360
What do you mean?

791
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,160
The the mod is called Thaumcraft.

792
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,160
No, the gear. Oh, the gear set is called.

793
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,080
I think it's called the void Thaum.

794
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,880
Wait, hold on. Void Thaum.

795
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,120
The void Thaumaturge hood.

796
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,560
Yeah, you make you make the you make like the void helm

797
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,560
and the void armor and the void leggings.

798
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,320
And then you you do like rituals on them.

799
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,480
You you enchant them or you know, you infuse them in the infusion altar

800
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,240
to turn them into the void Thaumaturge hood and the void Thaumaturge

801
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,040
robe and the void Thaumaturge leggings.

802
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,680
I've seen I've seen these born by certain players on the server for.

803
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,440
Yeah, I always thought they were really cool.

804
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,800
There's some the shoulder pads on the on the robes are somewhat Samurai-esque.

805
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,720
A little bit. Oh, oh, I didn't know.

806
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,720
Apparently, there are there are boots, too.

807
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,760
There are boots of the void walker that I didn't even know or a thing.

808
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,400
I guess I'll have to figure out how to make those, too.

809
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,440
I didn't I didn't.

810
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:38,680
OK, what eldritch I what the I think this might be part of like a secondary mod.

811
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,400
This looks weird. This looks a little different.

812
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,440
I'm not sure if this is part of vanilla Thaumcraft.

813
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,960
I just wanted to brag about it.

814
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,000
Thaumcraft is really cool.

815
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,080
You like you do all this fucking extract essences from shit.

816
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,960
And if you do it in a certain way, it like boils over and like tainted essence

817
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,480
like infects the world.

818
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,960
And then these creatures start showing up and they spread this stuff called taint.

819
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,720
And then you have to like do all this weird shit to like contain the paint.

820
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,800
And then these rifts start opening up and if they do damage to you

821
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,640
and they spread more taint, they let more creatures out.

822
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,840
And you have to like do all this like involved stuff to make these

823
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,680
like bombs that like collapse the rifts to close them.

824
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,000
It's very cool.

825
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,840
A lot of the stuff in the PCP mod is or in the PCP server is like

826
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,400
it's like kind of a nerfed a little bit, like apparently mage said it

827
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,920
so that taint doesn't spread because if it does, it can like spread really far

828
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,040
and like fuck the whole server up and just like and I think she didn't want it

829
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
to have the possibility of that happening.

830
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,600
So it's a little bit nerfed, but it's still pretty neat.

831
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,480
It's very cool. Love it.

832
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:49,040
I use talking about like like taint spreading reminds me of a mug.

833
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,800
Yeah, what is it?

834
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,800
What is you is talking about taint spreading remind you?

835
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,080
Well, it's reminding me of another Minecraft mod that I can't remember what it's called,

836
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,440
which is very annoying, but I found it.

837
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,440
I saw it on YouTube.

838
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:11,160
It's basically like a certain infestation, like a parasitic

839
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:18,200
like set of mobs and and systems where there's like tainted,

840
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,240
not I guess it's not called taint is like played or ruined land

841
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,840
that spreads from, you know, grass block to grass block.

842
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:33,520
And then creatures that are like parasites spawn in that in that area

843
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,520
and they jump around and they they're not very dangerous on their own.

844
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:42,680
But then they can infect like villagers and zombies and pigs and anything.

845
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,720
Anything Minecraft normal can be turned into a like a parasitic version,

846
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,400
which is like extremely fast and like evolves.

847
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,760
And if you kill them, they they like sort of.

848
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,800
I think there's like a weird thing where like if enough of them like get.

849
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,960
Well, no, no, they turn into parasites and then they start attacking other Minecraft

850
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,720
mobs, so like a sheep will become like a parasite sheep.

851
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,160
And then that sheep will start eating other things around it until it gets

852
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,000
like engorged enough to explode into a into a bloody mess.

853
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,160
And then that mess of like writhing flesh, if it connects with another writhing flesh

854
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:31,680
mob, like evolves into a higher being of Cthulhuid paracet, like weird gross shit.

855
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,760
And it's extremely disgusting.

856
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,120
And it was so cool, but I can't remember what it was called.

857
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,600
There's a lot, just a lot of the whole.

858
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,600
The whole Minecraft modded Minecraft

859
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,960
just seems like a whole separate game experience to like delve into.

860
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,960
Thaumcraft just happened to catch my eye

861
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,200
because I thought it would be cool to have a dark hood.

862
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,680
Oh, it's it's it's called scape and run parasites.

863
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,320
Scape and run the parasites.

864
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,560
OK, pretty, pretty neat.

865
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,760
Pretty. There's like there's like a different

866
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:13,920
levels of like of like being that can be created and the plague area,

867
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,160
the parasite like infestation area can spread.

868
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,320
And if it spreads big enough, it sprouts these like trees that summon things

869
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,200
as it grows bigger and you have to chop them down and purify the area.

870
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,440
Otherwise, it'll summon like flying big, dangerous things

871
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,360
that'll get you and they'll really scare you.

872
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,120
And then you'll poop your pants about it.

873
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,800
Did you did you ever watch the old

874
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,600
the old I've talked about it before.

875
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,440
Fuck, what's it called?

876
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,160
The guys who made Polaris, the the.

877
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,720
The Maker's Studio.

878
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,480
No, no.

879
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,320
The guys who made Polaris was like total biscuit and and color.

880
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,720
I think they use the head of it.

881
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,080
Am I fucking crazy?

882
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,880
I'm sure these guys are like.

883
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,960
Oh, my God, what would the Yogs cast?

884
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,640
Oh, no, you ever see the the old the old Yogs cast of Minecraft videos?

885
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,280
You know, I didn't.

886
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:21,680
But I did watch a video like talking about like like video essaying.

887
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,800
The thing you had talked about before, the the Let's Play Shadow of Israel,

888
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,080
Shadow of Israel.

889
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,760
Yeah, it goes through like all of the twists and turns and like how it

890
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,680
starts out small and the the it really does.

891
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,960
It really doesn't know that it's like set up like that.

892
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,800
And it's yeah, very interesting.

893
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,200
It's genius. It was genius.

894
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,840
It was genius, genius storytelling in a new medium of expression at the time.

895
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,160
I'm not sure if there had ever.

896
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,080
I'm not sure if there was ever anything like it before.

897
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,760
And I mean, it's fun.

898
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,040
It goes on like like there's sequels to it, too.

899
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,160
Like if they didn't stop after the end of Shadow of Israel,

900
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,000
like they spun it off into all these like side series where like

901
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,880
they they started making the Jaffa cake factory while like

902
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:19,720
while they're being, you know, harassed by their enemy Sips over at Sips Dirt Co.

903
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,040
And meanwhile, Sips Dirt Co. has like its own like side story series

904
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,000
that is, you know, that he's kind of just running in parallel at the same time.

905
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,080
It's great since it's inspirational.

906
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,880
I love what they did with it so much.

907
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
I'm so impressed with it to this day.

908
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,520
On I wonder, man.

909
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,720
Shit, I wonder if I went back now and watched it.

910
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,840
What I think like it's not as good as I remember.

911
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,840
Was I just impressed with it because it was good for the time?

912
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,080
It's probably overly long, honestly.

913
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,440
But like, I don't know, even though it's long at the time,

914
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,920
like the fact that it starts out

915
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,880
plotless and then sort of evolves a plot as it goes that while like the players

916
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,560
kind of sort of know that something is being done, but they don't know what it is.

917
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,640
And they're genuinely like experiencing it as it happens.

918
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,560
Oh, I don't know, man.

919
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,280
I don't know.

920
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,880
I guess it makes me want to gush.

921
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,040
I'm just going to gush about it.

922
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,600
Like what what a great what a great what a great conceit.

923
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,080
What a great conceit for a let's play.

924
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,240
I wonder if maybe they weren't the first to do it.

925
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,920
And maybe they were like cribbing their idea from someone else.

926
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,240
But I just don't know about it because they were like more popular.

927
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,640
The Oaks cast were like one of the one of the first one of the first

928
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,680
like big Minecraft channels feel like they weren't that many other people

929
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,200
to crib off in Minecraft.

930
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,360
They were a world of Warcraft show before they were a Minecraft.

931
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,960
Yeah, guys, I think.

932
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,880
Honestly, a few of them X X from X's adventures in Minecraft

933
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,760
was like a World of Warcraft guy.

934
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,360
I remember watching their like tank tutorials, like how to do how to do good

935
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,520
tanking in World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King.

936
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,320
I was the only World of Warcraft that I played was Wrath of the Lich King.

937
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,440
That was a good one.

938
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,200
It was it was pretty all right.

939
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,680
It was pretty OK. It was fine.

940
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,160
It was pre pre Cataclysm, which everyone hated.

941
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,520
Yeah. Yeah.

942
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,640
So I guess I got involved.

943
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,440
The getting was still mostly good.

944
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,520
First for that one just for that one golden summer.

945
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,400
I could talk about World of Warcraft, but I really don't know too much about.

946
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,040
Like I've played Cataclysm.

947
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,480
I played like Missa Pandaria after that.

948
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,000
And then the rest I'm not sure about.

949
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,520
And then I came back for a while and I enjoyed Legion.

950
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,520
I heard that one was a good one.

951
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,480
But then it sucks again.

952
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,560
And then it was good again.

953
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,200
So really, it's stupid that it never even heard of Legion.

954
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
Yeah, there's a bunch of expansions.

955
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,200
You know, the Burning Legion.

956
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,760
It's like a big bad that all the demons and fell stuff.

957
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,880
Well, there's the that was like the expansion

958
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:08,000
about the Legion, specifically the first time

959
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,800
as they've been like a main antagonist.

960
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,240
Wasn't wasn't the Burning Crusade about fighting the Legion?

961
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,520
Well, I guess it was.

962
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,640
So forget it.

963
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,960
But this was like this went there.

964
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,240
This ended up going to a different planet

965
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,720
using like the Draenei's

966
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,800
like they the Draenei likes aliens and they the ship crashed.

967
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,000
And that's the capital city.

968
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,120
Well, they use some of that technology.

969
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,040
I know that because I started a Draenei one time.

970
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,880
Yeah, they they at that point in the story,

971
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,160
the ship is like or not their ship, a ship, technology, whatever.

972
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,680
I didn't actually play all of the quests, so I don't actually know.

973
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,400
But you get on a ship and you fly to the Burning Legion's

974
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,480
military home base, which is the Draenei's previous

975
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,920
previously inhabited Draenei world of Argus,

976
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,240
which is like full of demons.

977
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,040
So green because the the demons

978
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,360
aren't the demons like bad Draenei, like the bad Draenei turned red.

979
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:16,160
But like weren't the Draenei based on the the demons.

980
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,960
But it was like it was retcon to be like, oh,

981
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,720
the demons are like the offshoot of the Draenei that turned evil.

982
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,280
But the Draenei are like they're they're naturally good.

983
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,160
Like the original people that they came from

984
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,240
were these good guys called the Draenei, right?

985
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,440
Yes, the Draenei are just a race, an alien race on a planet.

986
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,600
The Burning Legion itself is a collection of conquered and corrupted races.

987
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,080
So all of the demons that are, you know, all of the different types of enemies,

988
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,280
they used to be just a race of people on a different planet

989
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,600
that was once conquered and enslaved and corrupted and enlisted by the Legion.

990
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,480
And so kind of like some of them.

991
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,440
Yeah, so kind of like the Zerg, but like demons instead of like

992
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,960
gross, like parasitized bug creatures.

993
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,720
Yeah, OK, I see.

994
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,920
So I got you.

995
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,000
And then there's a bunch of stuff I didn't actually get to play on Argus.

996
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,560
I didn't get that far because there's a lot of stuff in Legion.

997
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,960
And it's quite good quest writing, honestly.

998
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,400
But the cool thing.

999
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,920
And I don't know whether people actually think this is cool,

1000
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,600
but it was like, oh, Warpog is the biggest thing I've ever seen.

1001
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,320
So it's so big.

1002
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,320
It's the biggest moment in World of Warcraft.

1003
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,760
Sargeras, the the originator of the Burning Legion, who is like an ancient Titan.

1004
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:45,240
If you know the Titans, they're like really big and they go around planets

1005
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:50,720
creating life by planting like they're like weird robots.

1006
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:56,040
They put like the the iron dwarves and the mechanomes to cultivate the land

1007
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,240
and create like they put stone people down, like carve the land into a thing.

1008
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,720
And this is this is where all the lore of the Titans is.

1009
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,560
The Titans were literal Titans who created life on on Earth, on on Azeroth.

1010
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,320
They go around the universe.

1011
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:16,400
Sargeras is a Titan who is like, actually, fuck that, I would rather destroy life.

1012
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,400
That's better, I think.

1013
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,720
And and he started the Legion and he's going around like undoing the Titans work

1014
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,880
because he doesn't agree with it.

1015
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,400
He arrives and this is this.

1016
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,280
This is like the expansion about the Burning Legion.

1017
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,040
Sargeras should be or could be the final boss, but they don't I don't think they kill him.

1018
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,120
I think they banish him at the end of spoilers.

1019
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,960
But he gets his giant sword.

1020
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,400
He's bigger than the planet.

1021
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,720
He gets his giant sword and he like throws it as just as he's about to be like

1022
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,400
cast away by the other Titans and like locked in a prison or whatever

1023
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,640
to presumably come back in like five other expansions later.

1024
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,440
Because he's the like the main villain of all of the entire universe.

1025
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,040
It's kind of difficult to just kill him.

1026
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,800
He throws his giant sword and it like stabs the earth and it's in the earth now.

1027
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,080
You can go to it like physically.

1028
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,240
It's in Silithus, which is like the southwest.

1029
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,880
So there's nothing there, nothing was there.

1030
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,320
But now there is literally nothing there because there is a sword

1031
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,360
that is the tallest thing that has ever existed in the game.

1032
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,960
And you can actually fly all the way to the top of it.

1033
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,240
It's so fucking big.

1034
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,640
You can see it from like 15 zones away.

1035
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,040
It's like, oh, the horizon is permanently changed with this giant sword

1036
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,640
jutting out of it. And I just thought that was cool.

1037
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,200
That is cool. That reminds me of isn't there like a giant sword

1038
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,920
sticking out of the ground in diaries of a spaceport janitor?

1039
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,680
Like somewhere near like a lake, I think.

1040
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,720
There's like just a big sword sticking out of the ground.

1041
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,400
I thought you're about to say diaries of a wimpy kid.

1042
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,440
In the lore of Diaries of a Wimpy Kid.

1043
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,400
Isn't there a legendary titan sword stuck in the ground?

1044
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,640
No, spaceport janitor.

1045
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,320
Yeah, I heard you cackling and I'm like, what did I say?

1046
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,120
What did I say? That's funny.

1047
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,280
Oh, man. Yeah.

1048
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,200
Good game, diaries of a spaceport janitor.

1049
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,880
Pretty neat, actually kind of a weird game.

1050
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,080
I don't know if I'd call it a good game, but a neat game with a cool world

1051
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,960
that's fun to walk around and look at.

1052
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,400
I have been.

1053
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,880
Oh, you're going to what are you going to say?

1054
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,840
Because I was going to change your game.

1055
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,640
I was going to change the subject completely.

1056
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,760
So go ahead.

1057
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,400
Well, I just want to mention speaking of cool,

1058
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,880
little funny indie games that are interesting.

1059
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,680
The there's a new palestinian bundle.

1060
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,440
I bought that I bought that this morning in the bundle for a palestinian aid.

1061
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,320
I saw it and I was like, oh, great.

1062
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,040
Yeah.

1063
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,600
But last year, I got the friend of the show, Jim Storm Dancer's game.

1064
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,160
Yes, I know.

1065
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,600
It's called glitter, glitter, mitten, grove.

1066
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,160
That's good.

1067
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,640
Fragrance, too, is on there.

1068
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,320
Now I have that.

1069
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,480
And that's going to be fun.

1070
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,360
That's worth that's worth playing.

1071
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,720
That's worth the five dollars easily.

1072
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,320
Yeah, all by itself.

1073
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,480
Yeah.

1074
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:12,320
But yeah, like last year, itch.io had a similar bundle

1075
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,600
for like Black Lives Matter, like support.

1076
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,480
Yeah, I bought that and I was like, it was a great deal.

1077
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,320
That was a great deal.

1078
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,960
I played a bunch of those games and some of them were pretty interesting.

1079
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,680
I played so many of those.

1080
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:30,320
I enjoy the process of coming through those and like looking at one

1081
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,960
and seeing that looks kind of interesting, clicking on it.

1082
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,560
Obviously, I've already bought all of these by them being in the bundle.

1083
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,920
So I don't have to worry about cost.

1084
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,200
I just sort of treasure trove diving, like finding gems, finding things

1085
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,280
that are like not traditionally marketable or good.

1086
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,200
Or you wouldn't see this on the front page of Steam.

1087
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,480
You wouldn't get recommended this by anyone.

1088
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,080
Nobody would ever talk about it.

1089
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,000
And yet, and yet there are some really fun little games in here

1090
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,000
that otherwise would never be seen by anyone, at least not by me.

1091
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,360
I have the page open right now after I bought it, because I just did.

1092
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:11,240
And I saw a couple on here, just on the first page randomly that seemed neat.

1093
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:17,280
Let me just pick one that I saw that was called.

1094
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,200
There's one called, I don't know.

1095
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
This one just caught my eye.

1096
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,280
It's called to dual lists.

1097
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,480
Just a common, beautiful day, completing a list.

1098
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,640
And there's like a fucking, you know,

1099
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:34,960
nude, alarmed adventure time looking boy, girl, I don't know, looking at a list.

1100
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,800
And I guess maybe you play as this person going around and dueling people.

1101
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,960
Like Yu-Gi-Oh, I don't know.

1102
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,280
I might I might play it and see what it is.

1103
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,960
Yeah, I really enjoy it.

1104
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,280
Yeah, it's it's the having access to and being encouraged to try out

1105
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,400
all of these secret games.

1106
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:08,720
And and this palestinian aid bundle is, you know, good excuse to do that all over again.

1107
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:14,080
I did skim through to see if it was like mostly the same, but it's mostly different.

1108
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,200
I actually didn't recognize nearly any of the ones.

1109
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,840
And I have scrolled through all of the pages of the BLM one.

1110
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,400
So definitely worth your money.

1111
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,960
Give it a give it a five dollars.

1112
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,320
Give it even more than that.

1113
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,480
I gave it twenty five.

1114
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,680
Yeah, link link in the description to that, because I would say it's worth.

1115
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,640
Even if you don't want to play these fucking games by any by it anyway.

1116
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,200
Yeah, I mean, I was going to say value for money is like it's one thing.

1117
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,280
But I really like the experience of it's both having all of this.

1118
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:53,400
This like it feels like secret knowledge, even though it's like you put put it a game in.

1119
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,960
I played one of the games the day I bought it.

1120
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:01,640
Which was like this time traveling puzzle game where you have to like walk around

1121
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,440
a very small like level made of like cubes and stuff.

1122
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,080
And you've got to like stand on platforms and press buttons.

1123
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:17,040
And then like another version of yourself from the future plays like you play

1124
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,400
in the same zone as the one you just played.

1125
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,480
And you can't like lock eyes or like your past version of yourself

1126
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,760
that was like pre-recorded through your actions cannot see your future self

1127
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,280
or your present self from your perspective.

1128
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,200
So you've got to like stealth hide from yourself.

1129
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,720
And then if it you fuck up, you can rewind and you have to like plan

1130
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:46,960
where you expect the blind spots need to be so that you can run through them easier.

1131
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,640
It was good.

1132
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,880
And I was just like and I played the whole thing.

1133
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,640
It was a short little game.

1134
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,680
It was a really cool concept adequately made and done and good music.

1135
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,760
And I really liked it.

1136
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,720
And that was like just the first one.

1137
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,360
Hmm. Hmm.

1138
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,240
Hmm. Makes you think says a lot about society.

1139
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,680
It says a lot about the video games.

1140
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,040
It really does.

1141
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,560
Short games are based.

1142
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,160
I'm just scrolling.

1143
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,640
I was thinking, you know, I was watching.

1144
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,800
I was talking earlier about I was watching all these videos

1145
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,880
by this guy fucking Tim Rogers.

1146
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,320
And I don't think I agree with his taste in games

1147
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:33,520
because he talks a lot about big ass games, long games, triple A games,

1148
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,400
last of us, Final Fantasy 7 remake.

1149
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:42,440
And I honestly, I don't care at all about how I don't care how good they are.

1150
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,960
I don't want to play them.

1151
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,160
I don't want to play those games.

1152
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,400
They're not interesting.

1153
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,440
They're big, bloated, cinematic pieces of shit.

1154
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,200
I couldn't give less of a fuck about even if they're perfect, irrelevant.

1155
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,880
Give me a game that I can like last through in like five minutes

1156
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,720
and have a nice experience.

1157
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,760
Give me give me a give me a hundred of those.

1158
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,960
Give me a goofy, weird, little like indie thing that is like.

1159
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,400
Like, I don't I don't want to see the last of us

1160
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,720
because I've seen it before.

1161
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,240
I have it's it's its own story, but like all the stuff in it I've seen before.

1162
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,960
Um, I don't know.

1163
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,440
What is I'm look, I'm strong.

1164
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,760
Cats are liquid, a light in the shadows, a minimalistic 2D platformer

1165
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,560
about a cat with the ability to transform into liquid.

1166
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,840
What could that be?

1167
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,680
Maybe I've never seen anything like that.

1168
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,480
Maybe it doesn't matter.

1169
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,440
Maybe it sucks.

1170
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,960
But I don't know.

1171
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,400
It seems more peaks my interest more.

1172
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,080
There's always going to be a few that suck.

1173
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,040
And there's always a lot of like

1174
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:50,840
tabletop rule sets and things that aren't even games like tilesets.

1175
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,080
But like, there's over a thousand, I think things.

1176
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,920
And there's so many of them that like the vast majority, I think are like games.

1177
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,880
And of those games, there's going to be at least like 20 to 30 to 50,

1178
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,720
like actually good ones that you enjoy.

1179
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,960
Probably it's like there's there's there's no way you can go wrong.

1180
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,360
True.

1181
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,280
I was I was going to say, if you remember when we talked a couple

1182
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:28,200
episodes ago about distress at the thought of having one's head destroyed.

1183
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,640
Ha, I mean, that doesn't sound distressing, but I don't remember.

1184
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,360
I I remember I talked about it.

1185
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,600
I talked about how it.

1186
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,560
The point is, I've been thinking a lot.

1187
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,360
I have I've been having

1188
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,480
at the time, I said, like, boy, I think about like,

1189
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,680
what if I died by having my head crushed?

1190
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,640
That would be so bad.

1191
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,160
And I freak out thinking about it.

1192
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,520
I've been freaking out more and thinking about it more.

1193
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,560
I've been having like a lot of intrusive thoughts about it

1194
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:01,680
that make me like sort of spaz out a little bit and like recoil and like kind of like

1195
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,880
have to like stand up and like hit my head and be like, ah,

1196
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,840
like I'm so I'm like so bothered.

1197
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,880
The experience I imagine is like this.

1198
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,720
The experience I imagine like this.

1199
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:17,120
It's my it's my head on a train track against the metal of the train track

1200
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:23,960
as the train comes towards me and crushes me under its iron wheels.

1201
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,800
I mean, a train track, a train track would be so quick

1202
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,560
that it wouldn't even you wouldn't even feel the pain.

1203
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,640
You I don't know about that.

1204
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,840
I wouldn't you feel it for just a moment?

1205
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,480
Maybe wouldn't you feel it for just a moment?

1206
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,120
You would.

1207
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,920
And I can only imagine that it would be the worst feeling that a human could

1208
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,600
experience. It would.

1209
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:51,120
But like I think I think the way I think the way to solve this is just

1210
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,400
think I'm thinking is hyper focusing about that moment.

1211
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,880
Like how would that moment feel?

1212
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,040
And I just got to face your way out over it.

1213
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,080
You've got to face your face.

1214
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,440
You've got to try it out.

1215
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,800
Oh, yeah, I'll let you know.

1216
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,480
I'll let you know how it goes.

1217
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,160
Oh, you just got to where I tell you.

1218
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,200
And then it like a little thing we like fly off into the sunset.

1219
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,160
Oh, you know what? You know what's in?

1220
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,760
Oh, wow, you know what's in this bundle is Mouse Corp by the catamites.

1221
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,120
That's the guy who made that's the guy who made Space Funeral.

1222
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,320
One of his slightly later games.

1223
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,040
It's a it's a weird game that I never quite figured out.

1224
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,240
Mouse Corp.

1225
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,960
OK, about the head crushing thing, I don't know.

1226
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,080
I've started to wonder.

1227
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,240
I've started to I've been thinking about it so much

1228
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,920
that I'm thinking like, what if I'm seeing the future?

1229
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,720
What if I what if what if that's the future that's becoming it's coming?

1230
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,000
Like it's getting sooner and sooner.

1231
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,120
And that event is reverberating strongly into the past.

1232
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:56,040
And I was receiving a message from my future me that that is how I will die.

1233
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,280
And it was getting closer.

1234
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,000
It's giving you it's giving you subliminal messages

1235
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,560
so that you're afraid of putting your head on a train track,

1236
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,680
whereas otherwise you would usually do that normally and that would be fine.

1237
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,280
But now you're afraid of it.

1238
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,600
I am afraid of it, but it's but it's my future.

1239
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,840
So I'm going to do it anyway.

1240
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,560
So it's not accomplishing anything by sending the message back.

1241
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,000
It's just making me feel bad and it's working great at that.

1242
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,640
It's accomplishing that goal of flying colors.

1243
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:30,280
Something that is similar, kind of, is when I move my jaw in a specific way

1244
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:35,760
or I yawn like too strongly, there's like a weird sharp,

1245
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,120
very short lived pain.

1246
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:43,760
But it's very scary in my skull where it's like, oh, you shouldn't have done that.

1247
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,280
You shouldn't have moved your jaw in that exact way.

1248
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,440
And I'm like, OK, I won't.

1249
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,920
And I don't know what it is.

1250
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,680
I don't think it's like a fracture or anything.

1251
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,160
I don't think it's anything serious.

1252
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,360
But it's like it's happened like on like occasionally for the past few years.

1253
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:03,960
And I'm like, God, if I if I push that, if I decided to continue moving in that way,

1254
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,480
it would maybe it would cause irreparable damage.

1255
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:12,360
And I'm so scared that like there's something wrong there in my skeleton

1256
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,880
in my it's probably just like a weird nerve ending.

1257
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,560
That's like, I don't know, brushing up against something and going,

1258
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,880
telling me that I'm going to die.

1259
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,640
But I'm not sure. I mean, there's a feeling that I get.

1260
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,400
Haven't done it in a while and I don't want to do it.

1261
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,120
But if you like try to open your mouth as wide as it'll go,

1262
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,240
like really try to open your jaw really wide.

1263
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,920
And then when it says wise, it goes like try to push it even further.

1264
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,520
It it's not a pain, but it starts to feel weird.

1265
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:50,360
And if you do it, if no, like you you you it when I've done it,

1266
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,640
when I've done it before, it makes me think like.

1267
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,120
It makes me like kind of want to keep doing it and let's like see what happens.

1268
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,720
And I feel like you could.

1269
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,760
Yeah, like unhinge your jaw and like injure yourself

1270
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,040
if you did that hard enough.

1271
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,280
And it's it's the curious like, oh, I just kind of want to flirt with that.

1272
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,680
Like, I've never felt this before.

1273
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,760
What if what if what if we go even further beyond?

1274
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,760
This is super super broken jaw three.

1275
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,200
Hell, yeah.

1276
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,280
I don't know. I just hate.

1277
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,360
Being a corporeal being having a brain,

1278
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:34,440
having a body, having organs, having parts of me that feel things.

1279
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,040
I hate I hate I hate my corporeal existence.

1280
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:42,400
Yeah, I mean, you should try being incorporeal, such as the Lord of Ghosts.

1281
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:47,000
I would love I would love to I would love to wait.

1282
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,440
Is he even in corporeal?

1283
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,320
He's just like a blob.

1284
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,720
Yeah, he's not. Can he go through?

1285
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,040
So he can't he can't like walk through walls or anything?

1286
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,960
No, I mean, I think in the comic and I make it sort of imply

1287
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,320
that he's not really a ghost when he goes underneath the other thing.

1288
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,440
And the guy says, I'm going to revive now because I'm dead

1289
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,640
and I'm going to go up the pipe and I'm going to become a real person again.

1290
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,920
And then Lord of Ghosts goes there and does it and nothing happens.

1291
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,400
It's like, oh, he's not really dead.

1292
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,720
Oh, oh, oh, Pog, oh, so it.

1293
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,320
No, you're right. I remember that.

1294
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,000
I just I do that makes.

1295
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,840
Yeah, he doesn't seem like a ghost or I don't know what the fuck his deal is.

1296
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,200
I do, but I'm not telling.

1297
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,520
But I sure do love that.

1298
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,680
But I sure do like that little scamp.

1299
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:42,240
Whatever, whatever his freaky is, freaky being might might be.

1300
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,880
Hell, yeah, hell, if the plush, if the plush like stretch goal

1301
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,160
gets reached, reached and like people, people have him,

1302
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,760
then they'll be able to tell for sure what he feels like in real life

1303
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,160
because he'll be finally corporeal, even though he already is.

1304
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,640
It'll be. Will will he retroactively be like, oh, yeah,

1305
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,440
he's actually like a plush all along.

1306
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,000
He was always been made of fabric.

1307
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,520
This was from the very beginning.

1308
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,480
Probably. Yeah, they do zoom in on the on the pages like, oh, wait a minute.

1309
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:22,520
Is that is that a a steam, a seam, a little tag on him?

1310
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,320
Oh, it was there all along.

1311
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,920
Go you got to do it'll be like in Homestuck when Hussie went back

1312
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,000
and added John's arm and all the frame.

1313
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,800
Yeah, go back and add a little tag, add a little a little tag

1314
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,080
and a little like stitch off of a little like fucking.

1315
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,480
How are they called?

1316
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,160
Beanie baby tag.

1317
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,080
Yeah, the tie tag.

1318
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,480
Exactly. Exactly.

1319
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,720
You've got to do it. It's canon.

1320
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,920
You've got to respect canon.

1321
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,760
Oh, no, I'm a slave to the canon.

1322
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,080
And I just assume I just agree with whatever people say it is.

1323
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:05,440
That's the true communism way to make art is to is to have no autonomy at all.

1324
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,040
That's the thing about canon.

1325
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,400
It just is whatever people believe it is.

1326
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,760
And if enough people, if you can delude enough people into thinking

1327
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,760
it's something else, then it just becomes that.

1328
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,080
Yeah, there's nothing anyone can do about it.

1329
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,360
You know, I know the death of the author is an applicable term here,

1330
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,080
but I've heard it so many times in so many contexts.

1331
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,760
I forget what it actually means.

1332
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,360
Do you and I just assume I'll be killed and I'll be dead at some point.

1333
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,760
Yeah, that's what there is.

1334
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:40,160
It can mean that if you want it to like if I'm if you become an author,

1335
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:44,680
you're destined to be killed by the audience, they'll get you.

1336
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,760
It's like it's it's when you when you go to like a book signing

1337
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,080
and you you shoot them, but you say you say death of the author first,

1338
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,960
you get a freebie.

1339
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,280
The cops can't arrest you if you say death of the author.

1340
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,320
Like death caused by the author.

1341
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,840
Well, if you become an author, you're allowed to death death.

1342
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,080
One people. No, I was saying you're allowed to kill them,

1343
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:18,120
the fans or anyone or maybe they maybe it's just a free for all.

1344
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,080
I don't know. It's just anyone fucking kill anyone when book when books are involved.

1345
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,120
When art is involved, it's it's it's this.

1346
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:33,280
I mean, maybe that's maybe maybe that's the canon of death of the author.

1347
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:38,520
Maybe I believe that to be true and that makes it true because I say so.

1348
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,560
If enough people are convinced.

1349
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,400
What about the breath of the author, though?

1350
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,520
Breath of the author is like when they're speaking.

1351
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,520
Yeah, that one's pretty simple, actually.

1352
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,360
It's not a lot to say about that.

1353
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,960
It's exactly what it's like if you stop the breath of the author,

1354
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,120
you cause the death of the death of the author. That's right.

1355
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,240
That's right. And that's why the and that's why when aspect inversion

1356
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,640
occurs on a breath character, they become a doom character.

1357
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,280
No, wait, it's blood.

1358
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,280
They become addicted to meth.

1359
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,880
They become a meth character.

1360
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,880
Yeah, yeah.

1361
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,160
Boy.

1362
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,920
Have we said all we need to say about that?

1363
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,640
Well, about that, yeah, I guess.

1364
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,080
Less little thing is that I'm thinking I might I might.

1365
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,400
I've got a few little things to do,

1366
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,240
but I do want to get back to like drawing the Clarissa comic.

1367
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,000
And I feel like, yeah, even though it's like strange,

1368
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,160
like conflicting marketing, I feel like it would be a good idea to do that stream

1369
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,280
and then talk about Lord of Ghosts while I'm drawing the Clarissa comic

1370
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,480
while that Kickstarter is going on. I don't see. I don't see why not.

1371
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,680
There's there'll be no detriment to to either thing.

1372
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:58,040
So I'm probably going to be doing that once I get a few things.

1373
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,800
In order I want to finish that smaller comic and I'm going to go into Clarissa.

1374
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,880
I'm going to hopefully be live streaming at some point.

1375
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,880
And I'll I'll show the Kickstarter and it will be like,

1376
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,600
oh, everything's suddenly happening.

1377
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,560
It gives doing stuff suddenly.

1378
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,960
Mm, that'll be weird.

1379
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,760
That'll be that'll be the day.

1380
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,560
Yeah, that's how I mean, yeah.

1381
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,520
That's how I'm going to feel when I put the game out.

1382
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,840
It's going to be like, oh, my God, Ben finished something.

1383
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,760
Oh, my God, Ben actually made something.

1384
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,640
And then the lecture comes out right.

1385
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,160
It will. It will be like it rains at poor is kind of like, oh,

1386
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,480
all of a sudden a cascade of content.

1387
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,080
What the fuck? I don't even know.

1388
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,160
I don't even know what's going on, man.

1389
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:44,360
I don't even know which thing to which which media to consume first.

1390
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,720
I'm a consumer. I love content.

1391
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,280
Soy, soy, soy.

1392
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,120
Soy, soy, soy, soy, soy.

1393
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,800
Yes, yes. Perfect.

1394
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,680
Perfect. Soy, soy, soy.

1395
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,760
Oh, there was a there was a voicemail

1396
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,640
that purported to be

1397
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:16,360
Miss Mr. Vizier of the Voidgazers singing the discord song discord.

1398
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,160
I'm howling at the moon and screaming.

1399
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,760
And I don't know if it was real, but boy, it was.

1400
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,880
You know, did it sound like him?

1401
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,400
It did. It did sound like him.

1402
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,840
It could have been real, but I don't know.

1403
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,640
I just don't know. It could be a forgery.

1404
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,440
I don't know. I don't trust my senses.

1405
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:38,640
Well, let's just assume there was an forgery and then suddenly like Riley.

1406
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:40,880
Yeah. You know what?

1407
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,160
This guy's pretty based, actually.

1408
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,240
You know what?

1409
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,200
Anyone who likes the discord song.

1410
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,960
Old discord, old discord between parties goes away.

1411
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,480
Once you sing the discord song, I mean, it's got to remember that friendship

1412
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:03,400
at the end of the day is magic and we just we got to we got to do it.

1413
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,720
We got to have friends.

1414
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,280
Friendship is magic, but magic is fucking fake.

1415
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,880
So I don't know.

1416
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,800
Oh, yeah, by the transitive property of fakeness

1417
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,800
and friendship is fake as well. That's a shame.

1418
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,360
Dang, uh, you want to go do some more voicemails?

1419
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,640
Yeah, we're floundering. We're floundering.

1420
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:29,760
OK, we're floundering like that fish from the Little Mermaid.

1421
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,080
Wait, wait, wait, actually, let's OK.

1422
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,320
Let's listen to that one again.

1423
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,800
Just I want to hear if you think it's it's it's true.

1424
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,120
It's the one called S.M. Part One.

1425
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,840
Oh, hang on. Let me get there.

1426
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,560
Yeah, OK.

1427
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,560
Speakpipe.co.

1428
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,360
I just I just don't know what.

1429
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,320
Like, when would he have been singing that it sounds a lot like him,

1430
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,800
but I'm just like, I just doesn't seem like which one seemed like that would have happened.

1431
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,600
It's called S.M. Part One.

1432
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,800
Oh, oh, there. Yes.

1433
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,440
And OK, three, three, two, one, go.

1434
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:09,320
And now Yig Studios Riley performing Discord.

1435
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,280
I'm not a fan of redditors.

1436
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,200
And I've been nagging for someone else is pulling all those strings.

1437
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,000
Something terrible is going down to the entire town.

1438
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,680
Can you do it?

1439
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,480
Can you do it?

1440
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,560
Brings I can't sit on it.

1441
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,800
No, I can't move at all.

1442
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,000
I curse the name.

1443
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,200
The one behind it all.

1444
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,200
What do you think?

1445
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:36,320
I think the because there is like it's it's made to sound as if it's like played at a venue,

1446
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,480
but we can't hear any people at all.

1447
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,840
I think it's fake.

1448
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,040
There's no crowd noise.

1449
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,080
There's no nothing.

1450
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,880
So why would he just be blasting this and then singing it?

1451
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,960
I don't know if I'm convinced by that argument.

1452
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,680
I feel like if the music was loud enough, you just and like it was just recorded at a low quality,

1453
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:57,840
you just wouldn't hear the crowd.

1454
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,120
Yeah, but I know what live music said.

1455
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,200
I mean, the video they made of that thing, I glanced at it.

1456
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,560
I looked at it just to see what was going on.

1457
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,160
Does not sound like you could hear stuff.

1458
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,280
They didn't they didn't sing at that one.

1459
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,520
I know they didn't, but like.

1460
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,960
They recorded it.

1461
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:16,840
They had a camera.

1462
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:22,720
I don't know what if if Riley sang, I don't know why he I don't know why it's

1463
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,240
Redditors.

1464
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,000
I don't know why the it says Redditors instead of puppeteers.

1465
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,600
Like, is that an ad lib?

1466
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,960
Wait, he says, I'm not a fan of Redditors, but I'm a nagging fear.

1467
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,520
Someone else is pulling at the strings.

1468
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,840
I'm going to turn up.

1469
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,240
I don't know.

1470
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,880
This this is inconclusive to me.

1471
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,720
No, no, no, it's it's there's the bit where after he says, and I can't move at all.

1472
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,760
It takes a breath.

1473
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,480
The music isn't there.

1474
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,080
You can hear nothing.

1475
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:51,920
There's nothing there.

1476
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:59,200
He's either performing in an empty studio, a whole whole of place, venue.

1477
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,480
Or it's fake.

1478
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,400
And I think it's probably fake.

1479
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,240
I I don't know.

1480
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,880
Maybe maybe you're right, maybe you're right.

1481
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,200
Just so disappointing, just disappointing if fake.

1482
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,880
I need any big, big, if true, big, if true.

1483
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,200
I would need a story video.

1484
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,760
Then yeah, I was I was doubting it too.

1485
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,000
I would also need visual if I saw that that's what it would take for me to be

1486
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,800
sure without it.

1487
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,840
I can only I can only wonder.

1488
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,600
OK, but the next the next voicemail that I didn't listen to before is called

1489
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,400
Ultra Numerary, do you see it?

1490
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,960
Yep.

1491
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,160
Base OK, three, two, one, go.

1492
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,240
Hello, PCP.

1493
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,400
I come to you today seeking some advice.

1494
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,880
You see, I would like nothing more than to start a simple, modest,

1495
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:52,040
Welsh speaking family.

1496
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:55,840
But I can't reconcile this with the additional fact that I.

1497
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,280
This is a terrible bit.

1498
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:04,280
This this guy, he he's he's sent in a bunch.

1499
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,920
He's sent in a bunch of voicemails where he starts asking a question

1500
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,080
and then he has metal music start playing with pig squeals.

1501
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,640
And I guess he just must think it's really funny.

1502
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:19,400
But it was it was it was it was it had worn out its welcome by

1503
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:24,000
probably the end of the first one to say nothing of having

1504
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,920
being three voicemails in.

1505
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,880
So I'm sick of this guy.

1506
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,320
Next one is called Toma.

1507
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,440
Yeah.

1508
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,960
Boo, bad.

1509
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,080
Next one is called Tomaso Choco Taco three, two, one, go.

1510
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,920
Hey, everybody, I just wanted to correct something Nate said last week.

1511
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:48,080
He was actually still can download stuff from Emu Paradise.

1512
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,640
It's just you have to download an extension called is a monkey.

1513
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,520
We're going to have a pick on a script through it.

1514
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,160
We're going to be easy to set up.

1515
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,360
You just Google it.

1516
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,880
It works fine.

1517
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,360
See you later.

1518
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,160
What does he mean that Nate said last week?

1519
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,400
What does that mean?

1520
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,480
He probably was responding to a very, very old episode.

1521
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,040
And I don't know.

1522
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,080
Didn't realize or it's a joke.

1523
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,240
I don't get what helps.

1524
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,800
Lane, what a fucking moron.

1525
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:21,760
I'm I don't know why I'm so mad.

1526
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,320
I'm irritated.

1527
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,080
He didn't know.

1528
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,240
No, you're a fool.

1529
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,240
You're you're you're.

1530
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,120
Yeah, you move parent.

1531
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:29,640
Yeah, whatever.

1532
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,280
I don't even remember what you said.

1533
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:36,960
Next voicemail is called Your Average Passive Listener.

1534
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,040
Three, two, one, go.

1535
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,040
You guys were talking about having kids last week, and it was basically

1536
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:47,200
talking about symbolic immortality, a psychological term coined by Robert J.

1537
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,720
Lyft and they'll naturally strive for it because we're fear of death.

1538
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,600
There's four categories, biological, children, afterlife,

1539
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:59,880
religion, natural, trees and the good shit, creative immortality.

1540
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:03,480
I think all artists have that little comfort inside them that at least

1541
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,600
something will still be there after they're dead.

1542
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,640
I sure do.

1543
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,680
I think I need a question.

1544
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,960
So is anyone religious in the PCP?

1545
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,360
And no matter the answer, how is.

1546
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,240
Great voicemail.

1547
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,720
Love that.

1548
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:22,400
I mean, I guess they're just not up to date.

1549
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,080
I don't know what the joke would be if they're just putting.

1550
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,280
I don't know if this is a joke.

1551
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,360
No, no one's religious in the PCP.

1552
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,320
Great question.

1553
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,360
Thanks. Creative immortality is pretty cool.

1554
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,000
That's pretty.

1555
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,320
That's that's pretty cool.

1556
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,320
I don't know.

1557
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,400
You're not really at the conversation that he's responding to, huh?

1558
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,720
No, you're not religious, right?

1559
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,720
I don't think any one of us is religious at all or has ever.

1560
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:52,240
No, I am actually Sikh.

1561
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,320
Because I see.

1562
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,960
A lot of inshallah, save, save Palestine.

1563
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,680
There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.

1564
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,840
That's not Sikhism.

1565
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,920
That's something else.

1566
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,760
Actually, I don't know much about Sikhism.

1567
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,680
Wait, no, you're right.

1568
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,640
What am I thinking of Islam?

1569
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,480
Sunni and she Sunni and Shiite.

1570
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,360
Sunni and Shiite are like Islam branches that I'm thinking of.

1571
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,080
OK, whatever.

1572
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,640
Next voicemail is called Requiem for Lamal.

1573
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,720
Three, two, one, go.

1574
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,800
Yo, what's up, PCP?

1575
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,960
Here to ask some relationship advice

1576
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,680
because that's been interesting.

1577
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,120
Not been enough.

1578
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:36,920
Not been enough of that.

1579
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:41,360
Basically, what I'm wondering is I got this chick who's into me

1580
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,920
and she wants to like date and stuff.

1581
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,600
But gay.

1582
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,440
I don't really want to because my life is like super busy with like

1583
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:56,040
just going to college now and like all that kind of stuff.

1584
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,120
So I don't.

1585
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,920
Is it the pig?

1586
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,480
Is the pig coming?

1587
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:02,840
Are we going to hear the pig?

1588
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,640
This is a bit.

1589
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,640
This is like building to something.

1590
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,920
Oh, my God.

1591
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,640
Just fucking hit me with the pig already.

1592
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,800
Just hit me with a fucking pig, you motherfucker.

1593
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,480
It feels quite deliberate what he's fumbling with.

1594
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,280
Like, this is not the sound of fumbling where you're actually just fumbling.

1595
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,320
If it sounds like he's trying to fuck with the audio.

1596
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,600
Are these like are these like old voicemails

1597
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,800
that someone has like re-recorded and added

1598
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,960
like microphone distortion to make them like inaudible?

1599
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:43,800
I mean, potentially, but they would need access to the old voicemails

1600
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,040
and we never provided them.

1601
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,520
Did we?

1602
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:50,040
I just had them on the show and that that would have our voices on them.

1603
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,360
He might have picked some that we like largely didn't interrupt.

1604
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,440
And then he added like the microphone fumbling sound

1605
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,640
that like might cover up any like later interruptions that we made.

1606
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,080
It's possible.

1607
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,200
Uh, I don't know, man.

1608
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,960
I feel like there's a joke that I'm not getting here.

1609
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,240
OK, next one is trolled.

1610
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,560
Emma, I pretty, pretty good.

1611
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,880
You got me.

1612
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,800
OK, next one is called Pony Lore.

1613
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,480
Three, two, one, go.

1614
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,320
Since major is going to be appearing on podcasts about now,

1615
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,360
I want to ask this question.

1616
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,080
Why is major the PCP?

1617
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,120
I don't know what he's majoring.

1618
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,360
Yeah, this is a bit.

1619
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,360
What is this?

1620
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,160
This is all the jokes.

1621
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,960
And they're taking old voicemails

1622
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,560
and then fumbling with a microphone so we can't hear them.

1623
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,920
But why? Why would you?

1624
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,920
Why would you do this?

1625
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,840
Also, how?

1626
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,520
That's the the question I would have.

1627
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,880
How do they get access to these?

1628
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:53,640
Or are they just fabricating voicemails and then doing it?

1629
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,720
Very strange.

1630
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,080
I think they might just be like

1631
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,640
snipping the audible portion out of the old episodes.

1632
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,520
Again, I don't know why you would you would do this.

1633
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,400
OK, next one is called Henlo Corgo for Ben.

1634
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,640
You're a straight edge turbo version.

1635
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,160
Three, two, one, go.

1636
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,120
Vaping. That was me hitting nitrous, by the way.

1637
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,920
So in older episodes of the podcast,

1638
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:34,160
you guys have had a fairly negative attitude towards drugs in general.

1639
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,840
But I was just wondering if it's not true.

1640
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,360
Anyone on the show on the episode

1641
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:44,280
has any experiences that they, you know, with drugs that they haven't talked about?

1642
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,600
I just figured that this would be like an interesting prompt for a story or two.

1643
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:54,560
I don't know. I don't have a negative attitude toward drugs in general.

1644
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,120
I just don't really like them myself.

1645
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:02,080
I think I've explained that, like, I've smoked weed a few times

1646
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,360
and sometimes it's been fine.

1647
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:08,080
And other times it's made me feel uncomfortable,

1648
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:14,640
paranoid, giving me like a weird body high sensation that I don't like.

1649
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,520
A couple of times it's been really bad and very uncomfortable for me.

1650
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,640
And I'm just not that into it.

1651
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:26,600
I don't think I have ever I don't think I've had any like good

1652
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,080
experiences with drugs that I haven't talked about on this show.

1653
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,240
Yeah, I've talked about my experiences with drugs.

1654
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:40,360
But I guess I can just mention I've only tried weed.

1655
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,360
That's about it. A couple of times.

1656
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:49,200
Smoking it and I took a bong, a bong or two.

1657
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:53,840
And, you know, I got high once the first time I tried it, nothing happened.

1658
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,200
And that's it was good.

1659
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,800
I don't know whether I would turn it down if it was like,

1660
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,760
hey, do you want to do some weed? I'll be like, yeah, all right.

1661
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,680
But I would never go out of my way to purchase purchase.

1662
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,000
I would never go out of my way to purchase drugs because it's like, I don't know.

1663
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:17,400
Whatever. People say they need drugs to unwind and I never take them.

1664
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,200
Maybe I need to unwind more often.

1665
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,280
I don't know.

1666
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,880
I don't I don't really get that unwinding.

1667
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,880
I don't I like I like alcohol.

1668
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,920
Alcohol is the only drug that I really like.

1669
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,920
I guess that kind of helps me unwind.

1670
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:36,560
I guess when I when I have a little the drink, I get a little more

1671
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:40,600
loosey goosey, but it's not like, oh, I feel stressed.

1672
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,920
Therefore, I will drink alcohol to feel less stress.

1673
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,680
It's if I drink alcohol, I will enter a more

1674
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:53,000
rambunctious state of mind, which sounds fun.

1675
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,440
So I'll do it.

1676
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:58,080
Yeah, I mean, when I feel stressed, I don't tend to like.

1677
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:03,520
Like desire any specific thing.

1678
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:08,280
I'm just sort of thinking about something and thinking about it is annoying.

1679
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:11,080
And I'm like, oh, shit.

1680
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:16,840
So I suppose like taking my mind off it would be beneficial.

1681
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,800
I don't like drinking, though.

1682
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,560
It's not that great.

1683
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,240
It's all right on occasion.

1684
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,400
But like I need to I need to get like the right amount.

1685
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,720
And I don't know how much that is.

1686
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,920
And I don't like buying things.

1687
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,680
Sucks. I drink tea.

1688
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,280
He's actually really relaxing.

1689
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,440
Just a nice cup of tea.

1690
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,480
That'll do that'll do me a little the time.

1691
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,080
Sure. Make sense.

1692
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,640
Uh, OK.

1693
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,520
Next one is called I'll die.

1694
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,680
Corp. Die another day.

1695
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,320
Three, two, one, go.

1696
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,720
What a great day for me.

1697
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:56,520
CEO of Aldi Corporation spending the bustling Aldi

1698
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,000
Corp business sector.

1699
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,280
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

1700
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,600
Oh, let me answer that.

1701
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,400
Hello, see.

1702
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,840
It's not funny.

1703
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,440
It's not funny.

1704
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,200
It's a waste of my fucking time.

1705
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,600
It's annoying.

1706
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,600
You're not funny.

1707
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,560
Don't do it.

1708
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,960
Stop.

1709
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,040
OK, next.

1710
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:16,840
I just got to pee.

1711
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,680
Look up.

1712
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,440
Boo.

1713
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,880
OK, Eleazar, cut this out.

1714
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,280
Cut this part out.

1715
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,120
I don't feel like entertaining these freaks during the wait.

1716
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,520
Actually, leave in the part where I say I don't feel like

1717
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,600
entertaining these freaks.

1718
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,520
I want them to know what I think of them.

1719
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:35,680
But cut out this part where I tell you to do that.

1720
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:39,760
I'm Beck.

1721
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,160
You're Beck, the musical artists of notes.

1722
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:46,800
Yeah, I appeared on the new album,

1723
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,120
the Gorillaz made song machine.

1724
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,000
I was a feature guest artist.

1725
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,160
That must have been that must have been such an honor for you.

1726
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,680
No, I hate them, actually.

1727
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,680
I fucking suck.

1728
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:07,080
Damn, that's that's a bummer.

1729
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:10,600
You're here first on the PCP.

1730
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,800
Next voicemail is called when the link doesn't work

1731
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,920
and you do a DIY solution.

1732
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,520
Three, two, one, go.

1733
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,120
Hey, kids, who does this remind you of?

1734
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,840
Colin, Angela's face.

1735
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,080
OK, hold on.

1736
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,080
Where does it hurt?

1737
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:36,160
Ah, my stomach.

1738
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,440
Do you know what this is?

1739
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,600
I can't breathe.

1740
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,600
I can't breathe.

1741
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:46,800
I can imagine it's Hentai.

1742
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,880
That would be like the most shocking thing to do.

1743
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,920
Boo, next next voicemail.

1744
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:57,040
No, not listening to it, garbage.

1745
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:01,440
OK, next one is called three, two, one, go.

1746
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,560
Wait, are you ready?

1747
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:06,560
Yeah, this is too five, too five, two.

1748
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,400
Oh, and there's a big, we got a new one.

1749
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:15,800
Yeah, you're right. Okay. Two, five, two, five, two, three, two, one, go.

1750
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,680
Just asking for your personal opinion.

1751
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,120
Do you think Nate will ever come back?

1752
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,520
I don't know.

1753
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,360
I don't I honestly have no idea.

1754
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,800
I'm not sure. I don't understand.

1755
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:36,440
I get the feeling that he's just done with appearing online and speaking.

1756
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,640
If it's not in a heavily edited context, but he does stream occasionally, so I don't know.

1757
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,840
He just doesn't like the podcast.

1758
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:49,200
But I don't know whether that's like a long lasting thing forever.

1759
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:52,720
See, I know he doesn't like he's not in bad terms with us.

1760
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,200
We're still talking occasionally.

1761
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,840
Yeah, mostly about recon stuff.

1762
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:01,640
But, you know, yeah, honestly, it's a fair question.

1763
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:04,520
And I but I don't know.

1764
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,760
I don't know if I have you put a gun to my head.

1765
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:13,360
I would say probably yes, at least in a little capacity.

1766
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:19,280
Like I feel like at some point, maybe he would want to come on to discuss

1767
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,760
the rad concept, just like because it's been going on and being dealt with in the background.

1768
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,920
Maybe I could be wrong.

1769
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,240
I don't know if I were him.

1770
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:36,440
Well, if I were him, I would be on the podcast, which I am.

1771
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,640
So I don't get it.

1772
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,480
I can't explain anything he does.

1773
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,320
OK, next one is called three, two, one, go three, two, one, go.

1774
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,600
Three, two, one, go.

1775
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:52,800
Bay, three times in a row.

1776
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,440
You know, I mean, that's a good one.

1777
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,720
That's a good gag voicemail that I like.

1778
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,760
This is like the first voicemail that I've liked this whole episode.

1779
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,800
I hate all of you.

1780
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:09,760
Next voicemail is called Jonathan slash John J.A.W.N.

1781
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:12,520
Three, two, one, go.

1782
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,600
Pump purple, no shirt, win.

1783
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,720
I can't hear it.

1784
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,760
Next one is called shut up and take the money.

1785
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,360
I heard punk, so I want to listen.

1786
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,080
Pump purple, no shirt, win.

1787
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:28,320
Oh, I did make a punk purple, no shirt on Teespring.

1788
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,480
But it was like, hold on.

1789
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,160
I can't. I can't.

1790
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,080
I want to listen one more time.

1791
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,880
But that is what he says.

1792
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,440
Oh, OK. All right.

1793
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,600
Pump purple, no shirt, win.

1794
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,760
Yeah, I've had one.

1795
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,040
Let me just see.

1796
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,880
T.

1797
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:49,520
Fucking Teespring.

1798
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,920
Gibo, Crit Store or something.

1799
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,800
What the fuck was it?

1800
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,440
I had it for a while and I never advertised it because I'm stupid.

1801
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,840
But I have a few things on there.

1802
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,080
Yeah, the no shirt, it was just sort of like.

1803
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,760
It's just a black words on a purple t-shirt, so it doesn't look.

1804
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:18,200
You can't really see it.

1805
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,120
Yeah.

1806
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:23,000
So I wanted to like make it a little more like stand outy so that when it's

1807
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,600
printed printed on the shirt, you can make out the no.

1808
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,960
And so I put like yellow and orange around it because that's the punk colors.

1809
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,000
But yeah, but that's not the iconic shirt.

1810
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,680
Yeah, so maybe I should just redo this and then you can buy it.

1811
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:44,320
God, but Teespring sucks.

1812
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,160
I hate making things on Teespring.

1813
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,800
I don't. What's wrong with Teespring?

1814
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,600
I think it's the least sucky.

1815
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:54,520
It's the least sucky shirt site that I'm that I'm personally aware of.

1816
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,720
I mean, maybe it could maybe it's improved since I last used it.

1817
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:01,600
But is it Teespring or is it like, what is it called?

1818
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,640
I don't know. I use Teespring.

1819
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:07,920
Oh, no, it is Teespring.

1820
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,640
Yeah, slash dash spring dot com.

1821
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:13,760
You just put up get a PNG of the image.

1822
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,960
It pretty much just automatically puts it on the shirt where it needs to be.

1823
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:21,000
It's just the sort of like setting up like what

1824
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:26,520
things it shows because like a general customer

1825
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:30,400
when presented with every possible permutation,

1826
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:34,560
like every single item of clothing that that thing could be on on one page,

1827
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,080
they sort of get overwhelmed, like, oh, do I go for this

1828
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,760
very similar to this other T-shirt T-shirt or this other T-shirt

1829
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:43,560
that's slightly different with a different V like a V cut?

1830
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:47,560
Or like people don't know what they what is the the right thing

1831
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:50,960
so I like it to be easier and just like there's one T-shirt

1832
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,920
and you can get it on a hoodie as well.

1833
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,120
But like I have to go through the menus and like D list

1834
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:59,360
all of the things that it's not that's like confusing.

1835
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,880
What you should do and what you can do and what I have done is you can make one shirt

1836
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:08,320
and then like choose like, OK, this shirt design is on this T-shirt,

1837
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,800
this T-shirt, this T-shirt, it's positioned like so.

1838
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:15,520
And then you can just duplicate that shirt settings to make a new shirt,

1839
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:21,000
apply a new image, but it's automatically chooses, you know, the same items, right?

1840
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:26,000
You can if you go to like your items menu and you look at all the listings you have,

1841
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,760
there's a button for duplicate and you can just be like, yeah,

1842
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:33,520
make it the same as that other shirt, but, you know, apply a new design to it.

1843
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:36,440
It's pretty convenient. I recommend it.

1844
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:40,640
Yeah, I got to spend like an afternoon or a whole day like doing that.

1845
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:44,120
I probably like update my my lot of ghost design.

1846
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,960
Because I made I made this store when I was like,

1847
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,040
well, less artistically good than I am now.

1848
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:56,440
And I think the lot of ghosts thing is just sort of not cool enough.

1849
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,840
Or like it's just a lot of ghost thing on the on the Teespring.

1850
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:06,320
I'll link it. Show me, show me, show me, show me, put it in general.

1851
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:14,320
The Gibbo crit store creators spring dot com slash listing slash the Lord of Ghost product.

1852
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:22,320
Oh, yeah, it's like, it's like, all right, I have like leggings.

1853
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:26,320
Well, I mean, you can put them on leggings, which is in my opinion.

1854
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:33,320
The obvious thing to do for a Lord of Ghost shirt is just to have a black shirt

1855
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:37,520
that is an all over print with like the eyes and the teeth on it.

1856
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:44,440
Yeah, I don't think I had the option to do it all over print when I made this one though.

1857
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,480
But I did unlock it at some point.

1858
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,720
They do. Yeah, they unlocked it.

1859
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:54,280
Hey, I've never asked this, but is the way the Lord of Ghosts looks at all

1860
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:59,760
based on that on that vapors page?

1861
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,720
Do you know the one I'm talking about?

1862
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,120
Oh, the one with the teeth.

1863
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:06,760
Now, I think the one that question for.

1864
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:09,120
Yeah, I'll post the image.

1865
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:14,600
It's it's not like it's not OK.

1866
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,760
It's it's from other things that have those that same sort of tooth design.

1867
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,440
Yeah, yeah. OK, fair enough, fair enough.

1868
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,400
I'm thinking of like I'm just looking at the shirt.

1869
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:26,840
I'm looking or I was looking at the socks.

1870
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:28,800
I was looking at the socks with the eyes and the teeth.

1871
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,040
And I'm like, that reminds me of something.

1872
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,840
Hmm. Hmm.

1873
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,800
I don't know about the.

1874
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,640
I bought a pair of those socks, but because.

1875
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,480
I don't know, they stretch.

1876
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,840
They they're not black.

1877
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,480
Yeah, they're not actually black when you print on them,

1878
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,720
even though it looks like that in the preview image, the the the socks you get.

1879
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,480
They stretch a bit and then they're suddenly gray all over.

1880
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:55,280
And it's like.

1881
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:59,920
That's not. Yeah, I think I think an all over print.

1882
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:03,960
No, no border, no like jagged border with like the white gradient.

1883
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,840
I would just want all black articles of clothing with the eyes

1884
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:13,520
and the teeth kind of just around, you know, because Lord of Ghosts is amorphous.

1885
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:15,080
I don't know. That's what I would do.

1886
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,080
Oh, you can get it on a baby onesie.

1887
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:21,960
I can have my fucking baby and put these fucking teeth on him.

1888
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,360
I just thought it would be funny to add that one.

1889
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:29,280
Hell, yeah, the base.

1890
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,600
You know what? I should get my own like brap leggings.

1891
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,640
You look at the brap one at the bottom.

1892
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:40,640
That's like the the Gibb and take like sweet bro and hella Jeff esque.

1893
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:45,520
Yeah, yeah. JPEG fuckery. Of course. Of course.

1894
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,400
I've sold a few of those shirts, but the leggings are fucking.

1895
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,520
I know about brap.

1896
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:54,080
I should buy these now that I wear leggings and that's the thing I do.

1897
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,560
So before I was like, oh, I can't wear leggings.

1898
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,320
Well, yeah, girl article of clothing.

1899
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,640
But now I can.

1900
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:03,240
Small, small mind, small mind, small imagination.

1901
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,360
You had to expand.

1902
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:07,560
You had to expand your reality to make it a possibility.

1903
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,680
So cool. We've arrived. Yeah. Yeah.

1904
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
Honestly, that's.

1905
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:19,040
Honestly, yeah, it looked pretty cool.

1906
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,000
The brap. I mean, the brap is iconic.

1907
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,160
Everybody knows everybody loves the brap.

1908
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,760
Let's do the next voicemail.

1909
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,120
It's called shut up and take my mom take the money.

1910
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,800
Three, two, one, go.

1911
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,240
Man, I just really don't understand

1912
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:39,000
why the gig editor was so hell bent on not getting paid.

1913
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,640
Like, why?

1914
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,240
Why don't you want to get paid?

1915
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:47,320
Davoo got his Ben was advocating for it and they didn't like their right.

1916
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:49,280
I don't know.

1917
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,040
I mean, I just think it's kind of scummy

1918
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,920
that the guys are kind of letting them work for free.

1919
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,960
You're right.

1920
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:58,560
They really should have put their foot down and be like, no,

1921
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,080
like, let me fucking make it up to you.

1922
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,760
I wish this I wish this wasn't going to go on for another 40

1923
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,840
milliseconds because I have an answer right now.

1924
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,040
Do this just because it's a kind of way to avoid

1925
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:17,680
having to deal with headaches down the line or like bands getting too attached.

1926
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:21,760
Yeah, to it, you know,

1927
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,200
they keep going on about parasocial relationships,

1928
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:30,000
but I guess it's parasocial convenient for bad bad when criticism good when money.

1929
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,160
Fucking you were absolutely right to bully this person

1930
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:37,120
into taking money to do their fucking job.

1931
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,920
The reason why?

1932
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,120
Anyway, PCP forever, Tom will never die.

1933
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,720
Call me back. Thank you.

1934
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,360
Thank you. The reason why, in my opinion,

1935
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:48,880
the reason why they were hell bent on it was because

1936
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:55,200
Yig had probably told them maybe in a kind of like sort of suggested

1937
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:59,280
that like, oh, we'd love to have some videos edited,

1938
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,800
but we can't really afford to pay anything.

1939
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:08,360
And this person, you know, parasocial dick sucking lampry scum.

1940
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,400
I don't think they would have done that.

1941
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:15,240
I feel like this person like just assumed that it would be

1942
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:18,400
it would be really cool if I if I did that for them.

1943
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,880
And they just wanted to do it for free.

1944
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:25,600
Like, it seems like it's possible like money never came up.

1945
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:27,560
And then they was like, OK, we'll pay you.

1946
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:30,680
No, no, no, no, well, they well, they claimed they claimed

1947
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:34,600
that they had been offered money and refused, which sounds like a lie.

1948
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,600
Honestly, I don't know if I believe that.

1949
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,680
It's possible.

1950
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:43,680
I mean, the I mean, the answer to the question is

1951
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:48,200
creepy parasocial dedication to a weird

1952
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:55,000
to a weird cult of personality run by a bunch of freak grifters.

1953
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,200
That's the answer to all your questions.

1954
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:04,080
When you get like stuff of stuff offered for you for free from people

1955
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:11,440
who, you know, are parasocially like invested in your brand or yourself.

1956
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,840
You got to you got to not just accept it.

1957
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:21,840
Like the the times where it's acceptable to accept it is like when you're like

1958
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:25,880
like with an actual friend and they're like, hey, let me pay for your drink.

1959
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,680
Let me pay for for like this.

1960
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:28,920
And it's like, oh, thanks.

1961
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:32,080
You know, that's when you accept free shit is when they're actually friends.

1962
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:35,760
This is this is this is this practice in general is just like mixing

1963
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:41,040
mixing friendship and business, which is just not good.

1964
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,480
Right. Yeah.

1965
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:48,200
Like when you even with friends, it would be weird to like

1966
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,120
to ask someone, you know, well, to do something,

1967
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:57,120
hoping that they won't want to ask for compensation for it.

1968
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:00,720
Because adults, they got to pay bills.

1969
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:04,920
They have I would say valuable, you know, if you are like a noob, right?

1970
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:08,520
If you're like a if you're like just starting like I want to start a YouTube channel,

1971
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,480
I want to start making video essayist content.

1972
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:16,280
And maybe your friend is a YouTuber, does that stuff?

1973
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:18,640
Maybe is a bit of a professional about it.

1974
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:23,640
If they maybe like said, hey, I'll edit a video for you,

1975
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,800
like to help you get started or something.

1976
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,520
I would think that was fine.

1977
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,840
But in that case, it's like the person who's higher up on the totem pole,

1978
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,840
doing something for free for someone who's lower down as a favor.

1979
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:38,200
It's not, you know, someone

1980
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:43,440
it's not some nobody being like, oh, let me edit videos for you for free.

1981
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,560
Let me I'll do it for free. I don't care.

1982
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,040
I don't even need to get paid.

1983
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,560
I just oh, I'd love that.

1984
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,000
Oh, I'd be I'd be on the channel.

1985
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,200
Like that's gross.

1986
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,960
That's gross to even even if they offer it, it's gross to accept it.

1987
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:00,320
Because like it's just a fucked up dynamic there.

1988
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:04,400
It's like we got like offers of people who wanted to edit.

1989
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,600
The the PCP for free.

1990
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:09,800
It was like, no, we're going to set up a payment and we didn't let them do it.

1991
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,720
We didn't let them do it.

1992
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:12,320
It would there were.

1993
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:16,520
Yeah, there were people that said they wanted to like design the website for free.

1994
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,160
And no, we yeah, you're you're right.

1995
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:21,120
We've never people have made the offer like I'll do this for free.

1996
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:24,560
And we've always been like, no, that's messed up.

1997
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:27,120
And it will cause problems down the line.

1998
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:28,960
And it will lead to dissatisfaction.

1999
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,200
It will lead to strife.

2000
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:36,320
It will lead to claims of, oh, you took advantage of me, which would be true.

2001
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:41,040
And also, it just wouldn't be ethical, so we don't do it.

2002
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,880
I don't know. It's bad.

2003
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,680
I don't want to dwell on it any longer.

2004
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,760
It's upsetting.

2005
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:52,080
Next voicemail is called, I'm sure you care a whole lot.

2006
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:55,160
Three, two, one, go.

2007
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:59,840
I'm the caller who said the thing about the graves and the other real people.

2008
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,000
I'm not offended. I'm sorry.

2009
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,280
I said your podcast sucks.

2010
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:06,680
It's still good.

2011
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,960
No, it's OK. It sucks.

2012
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,880
It's fine. No, podcasts suck.

2013
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:16,160
I wasn't sure if you were being sincere or or whatever.

2014
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:19,400
If you were like.

2015
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:24,880
If you were like, shit, that's literally like my grandpa's grave

2016
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:31,120
that you put your face on to flash when you talk on your podcast about Pokemon

2017
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:35,760
and whatever, honestly, I would be offended.

2018
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:40,360
And if you were like that, I might get it.

2019
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,680
But I assume that like the odds of that were really low.

2020
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:48,440
But like the outside chance existed, maybe.

2021
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,680
Yeah. Yeah.

2022
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:54,000
Yeah. OK.

2023
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,240
Next one is called the productive team, 17, three, two, one, go.

2024
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:01,720
Hey, what's up, PCP?

2025
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:04,160
Hey, it's your boy, 17.

2026
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:06,440
And I knew it. I knew it.

2027
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,280
I was just about to say pig.

2028
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,720
Yep. Not funny.

2029
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:12,640
I like still not funny.

2030
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,360
I'm a culinary student.

2031
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:16,360
Not a good bit.

2032
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:21,160
You really you really went you really went all in on this bit.

2033
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:26,360
Like this person was like he they be in the change I want to see in the world.

2034
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:31,400
They listened to the episode on Friday and they were like,

2035
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:37,200
you know, I have an idea for a bit, but it's going to take preparation

2036
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:41,120
because I'm going to do this bit over the span of the whole week.

2037
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,800
So they will be sprinkled throughout, right?

2038
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,680
I'm going to plan this out and I'm going to commit to it

2039
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:50,160
because I have a great idea for a funny bit that will really get the people talking,

2040
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:53,240
that will really like get people's imagination going

2041
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:57,240
and like be compelling to the audience in one way or another.

2042
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,920
And they planned it out and they they they scheduled it in their mind and they were,

2043
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,840
OK, I'll make a call this day, I'll make a call this day, I'll make a call this day

2044
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,600
and it will all lead up to the big finale in the end.

2045
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:11,400
And then it will all be a whole it'll be it won't just be one voicemail.

2046
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,680
I will transcend someone who just makes a single voicemail.

2047
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:16,720
I will be an arc.

2048
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,360
I will have a character.

2049
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,720
I will be known as the interrupting pig guy.

2050
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:26,520
Everyone will appreciate it and they planned it out,

2051
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,080
thought about it, decided that this was a thing that was worth doing.

2052
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,040
They planned it out.

2053
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,040
How are they going to do it?

2054
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,160
Here's the plan.

2055
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:38,960
And then they followed through and they executed on it with confidence.

2056
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:43,480
And this is what we got.

2057
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:50,840
And I hope that that paints a picture in your mind.

2058
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:55,200
OK, enough.

2059
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,440
I know it's going to come.

2060
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:57,560
There's going to be more.

2061
02:04:57,560 --> 02:04:58,800
There's going to be more.

2062
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,680
Got him. There's there's going to be more, though.

2063
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:02,440
We're not even.

2064
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,600
Honestly, I just I.

2065
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:06,200
Part of me just wants to give up

2066
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:08,960
because I know there's going to be another fucking interrupting pig.

2067
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:09,720
What do we have?

2068
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:14,320
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

2069
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,400
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

2070
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,520
We have like 15 more.

2071
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:21,400
There's like at least four more pigs.

2072
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,560
And I just feel exhausted.

2073
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,840
I just feel tired and and sad.

2074
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,640
Thinking about having to respond, having to react and have some opinion

2075
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:37,800
the next time I hear the next time next time you just move on immediately.

2076
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:41,880
The more you react, the more funny it might be.

2077
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,160
I guess you're right.

2078
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:47,160
I guess that's that's a more a more mature response.

2079
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,960
I'm you're right.

2080
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:52,200
I just I need to rise above it.

2081
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:54,280
I need to rise above the pig.

2082
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:00,480
OK, next voicemail is called a sincere apology.

2083
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,920
Three, two, one, go.

2084
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:05,680
It was then Ben St realized he should

2085
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,560
have been auditing the voicemails all along.

2086
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,440
Oh, I get it, OK.

2087
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:22,920
After watching Prime Minister David Cameron fuck his mother's corpse for the

2088
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:27,280
final time, young interrupting death pig realized his only question life was to

2089
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:31,480
get revenge on the man who started it all notorious pig fucker.

2090
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,320
Ben St killer of cops and dropper of balls.

2091
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:40,440
If only his brother had been around and clean up the mess before it started.

2092
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:49,360
That's a very long and convoluted way of saying, please don't play every voicemail.

2093
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:51,520
OK, I get it.

2094
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:54,720
I get I get the point that's being made.

2095
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:59,440
So I can at least appreciate that the voicemails were bad on purpose.

2096
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:04,720
But I mean, what am I what am I supposed to do now?

2097
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,760
Now it's like you've got a choice.

2098
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:12,400
You can continue the war by by by not doing what this person says and

2099
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:15,280
continuing to not vet the voicemails and listen to all of them.

2100
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:21,040
Thus, encouraging a retaliation of him to try and come back.

2101
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,760
But it'll be like a war of attrition.

2102
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,480
It'll be like how how how long will it be before he just runs out of energy to

2103
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:32,480
make pig voicemails and and and how long will you be able to stand listening to them?

2104
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:36,200
It'll be a cold war that interruptions.

2105
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,880
Was that oblivion fall?

2106
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,640
Is this is this an oblivion fall scheme?

2107
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:44,640
I don't think so.

2108
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:47,400
I don't think the voice was the same.

2109
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,880
Also, I think he's British.

2110
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:52,280
And I think it will be oblivion full is not British.

2111
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,880
I have some reason to believe that.

2112
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,280
Well, I don't know.

2113
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:03,200
On the on the one hand, I appreciate that this person had a message to send.

2114
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:06,560
And they and I and I comprehend what their point is.

2115
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:09,240
They want the voicemails to be more vetted.

2116
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:14,200
But I mean, if the point is.

2117
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,880
Look how bad voicemails are.

2118
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,800
This is what you get for playing them all.

2119
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,960
I don't know.

2120
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,160
I just feel like this this kind of thing is the problem.

2121
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:29,880
The problem is that people make bad voicemails, which then clog the show

2122
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,320
and waste our time and are annoying.

2123
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,520
And they've sort of just.

2124
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:38,440
I kind of feel like this almost illustrates that.

2125
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:42,120
The voicemailers are the problem.

2126
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,760
I mean.

2127
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:46,480
I don't I don't want to vet them.

2128
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:48,200
I don't want to vet them.

2129
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:49,280
I just don't.

2130
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:53,280
It would add it would add so much annoyance to my life.

2131
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:58,600
And like, I would only remove a handful like I'm not.

2132
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:00,560
Here's why you're wrong.

2133
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,760
Here's what this voicemail is wrong.

2134
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,720
I'm not removing this voicemail.

2135
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:04,960
I'm not removing any of them.

2136
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:07,080
And I wasn't going to, even though they're bad.

2137
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:11,200
The only ones that I remove are ones that are like really offensive.

2138
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:12,720
And I just don't want anything.

2139
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,520
I don't remove voicemails just because they're bad.

2140
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:20,160
So if I vetted the voicemails, I wouldn't even remove the ones that you don't like.

2141
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,680
I just I just wouldn't.

2142
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,120
To me, like part of the point is that anyone can say anything.

2143
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:29,440
Yeah.

2144
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,560
And also if you vetted them, if you if you yeah.

2145
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:37,760
You ever vetted them would like the excitement, like a surprise.

2146
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:41,920
If there was something like surprising, they wouldn't have that recorded for the actual show.

2147
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:45,360
Like someone else would need to vet them if anything.

2148
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:49,160
And then if you need to trust that they have the right idea of what would be good.

2149
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:53,280
And nobody really knows because based on the conversation that was had previously,

2150
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,680
it could be relevant or completely pointless.

2151
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:57,400
It's just hard to know.

2152
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:00,560
It's hard to know ahead of time what's going to make for the best show.

2153
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:03,880
Obviously, some are just like really bad, but we can just skip through them.

2154
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,280
Like we do.

2155
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:07,600
Like we do.

2156
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:12,360
Just make a make a conversation out of it anyway, which is the point.

2157
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:18,760
Voice Mailer, if if you liked Nate's methodology of only picking a handful of

2158
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:26,240
voicemails out of many and only and only listening to those, I can't begrudge you that.

2159
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:28,840
But that's not how I do things.

2160
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:35,280
And you making a bunch of deliberately bad protest voicemails doesn't change my mind.

2161
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,160
Good effort.

2162
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:38,960
Don't do it again.

2163
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:39,600
OK.

2164
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:44,560
Next one is called Are You Moving In With Me Yet?

2165
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,960
Three, two, one, go.

2166
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:49,000
Hey, Ben.

2167
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:58,480
So I was listening to the bonus episodes on Patreon.com slash the progress

2168
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,040
managers or whatever the fuck it is.

2169
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:00,920
What?

2170
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:04,080
And I was listening to like the last one Nate was on.

2171
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,320
And I won.

2172
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:12,560
I realized why people miss Nate so much other than his juicy boy pussy.

2173
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,480
It's he was a good host.

2174
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,280
He hosted the podcast really well.

2175
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:21,840
You have grown into that ability.

2176
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:27,160
You are you have grown so much in the last year.

2177
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,360
And I just wanted to compliment you.

2178
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,440
Generous.

2179
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:39,920
Is when will your boy pussy ripen to his levels is, I guess, the big coming.

2180
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:44,240
I'm like, I'm like, I like feeling like phobic about the pig.

2181
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:46,480
I'm feeling like anxiety over the pig.

2182
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:49,880
I don't know.

2183
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:50,600
Thanks.

2184
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,320
Boy pussy.

2185
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,040
Yes, it's ripe.

2186
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:55,400
Come and pluck it.

2187
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,600
OK, whatever.

2188
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,120
Thank you for.

2189
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:04,200
This is I think I'm going to become better at hosting the procrastinators.

2190
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:06,200
I'm doing a great job this episode.

2191
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,560
I'm really hitting it out of the park.

2192
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,400
I mean, somebody's going to do it.

2193
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,680
Somebody's going to say hello and welcome to the show.

2194
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:14,680
And that's you.

2195
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:19,280
It's it's a tough job, but it puts food on the table.

2196
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:23,960
OK, next voicemail is called Nate fuckers are cringe.

2197
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,960
Three, two, one, go.

2198
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,240
True.

2199
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,000
Hey, everybody, it's other Riley again.

2200
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:29,840
Now, listen up.

2201
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,360
The fuckers are fucking cringe.

2202
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:37,240
OK, the true chat of the PCP, who everyone should want to fuck

2203
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:39,320
has been under our noses for all this time.

2204
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:42,920
He's a man who has been long lost to us here at the PCP.

2205
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:45,520
Jeff, mother's basement.

2206
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:46,840
I want to fuck.

2207
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:47,800
He's so flaccid.

2208
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:51,040
Bring back Jeff so we can all fuck him in the ass.

2209
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,200
That's it.

2210
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:55,080
OK, all right.

2211
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,560
I mean, Jeff is a large human being.

2212
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,720
There's a lot of ass to go around, probably.

2213
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:01,080
There's a lot of there's a lot of them.

2214
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:02,040
There's more, more.

2215
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:04,040
He's so more for the push in.

2216
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:06,320
He's so big.

2217
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:10,040
He's so big.

2218
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:14,080
Oh, the next one.

2219
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:16,200
There's an Imgur link.

2220
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,520
I think it's Gib fan art.

2221
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,520
Huh?

2222
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:22,360
Oh, oh, Pog.

2223
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:23,840
Is this Pog?

2224
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:25,960
Oh, it is.

2225
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:26,960
Wow.

2226
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:27,960
Right. OK.

2227
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:29,080
What do we show this on screen?

2228
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,080
Eliza, what do we have?

2229
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,080
We have.

2230
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,760
The Ray Club.

2231
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,680
Bucklebell spearfishing chick,

2232
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,800
hazard, casual and maximal.

2233
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:40,800
Wow, he's out.

2234
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:43,920
I don't know what I don't understand.

2235
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,600
Sharktooth scarf.

2236
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:47,520
That is an error.

2237
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,960
Is this Errori's art?

2238
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:51,000
Is this an Errori piece?

2239
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,200
I'm not sure.

2240
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:53,240
I don't think so.

2241
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:56,320
Errori has quite a distinctive style

2242
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,320
from what I've seen.

2243
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,840
That's that's true.

2244
02:13:58,840 --> 02:13:59,840
That's true.

2245
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:02,200
Perfect for grabbing some lunch.

2246
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,880
I don't I don't know who this is by.

2247
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:06,520
This is by apology.

2248
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:11,240
This is professional advice from Apologies at floodpunk.gov.

2249
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,400
What the fuck?

2250
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,280
All right, let's listen to the voicemail.

2251
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:16,680
Three, two, one, go.

2252
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:20,080
I knew it.

2253
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:21,840
Feministly.

2254
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:22,840
I knew it.

2255
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,720
Spicy.

2256
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,720
How does it how does it feel that someone is writing

2257
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:23,240
spoken word poetry about outfits you could wear?

2258
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:25,440
It feels pretty good.

2259
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:27,680
Pretty base.

2260
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:28,320
It is.

2261
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,720
Does it make you soy face?

2262
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:31,880
Yeah, a little bit.

2263
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:36,080
Oh, it's it is kind of true

2264
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:38,000
that confidence is key.

2265
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:42,040
But I feel like these the pants as hat and the sharktooth scarf.

2266
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:46,560
I mean, obviously, they're a little crazy of examples.

2267
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:50,000
I don't think I would take a fishing spear to go shopping.

2268
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:53,560
But, you know, anything's possible.

2269
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:54,240
Perfect for.

2270
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:57,480
Well, you don't you don't go shopping with a spear or do you?

2271
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:01,720
I thought you grab lunch by stabbing a fish.

2272
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:04,040
I go into the I go into the supermarket.

2273
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:05,960
I go to like the raw meat section.

2274
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:10,120
And I you go to the lobster meat and you just skewer one.

2275
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:12,160
Yeah, through smash through the glass,

2276
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:15,080
like stab the roast chicken against the wall.

2277
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,320
I grab it and I eat it raw on the end of the stick.

2278
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:21,720
I don't know why I don't cook it because that'll kill me.

2279
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:26,400
Absolutely. Absolutely.

2280
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:31,240
Where was I? OK.

2281
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,640
Next one, I think this is also from Arari.

2282
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:36,360
It's called profuse apologies to the PCP

2283
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:39,880
and the community for everything about time.

2284
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:42,080
OK, three, two, one, go.

2285
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:47,120
I must have all the guys for every one of these.

2286
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:51,160
They are all mistakes like cheeseburgers with no cheese.

2287
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:55,160
I'll make it up to you with a happy meal and fries.

2288
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:58,120
We're heading to McDonald's now.

2289
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:02,200
If you'd like something to leave a comment down below,

2290
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:06,720
I'll have you ordered you in six weeks or so.

2291
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:11,200
I know happy meal won't erase these crimes.

2292
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:16,160
So feel free to get some milkshakes on my dime.

2293
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:21,320
Give me give me a McDonald's song.

2294
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,680
Give me give me a give me a McDouble.

2295
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:26,920
Give me two McDoubles, throw away the bun.

2296
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,760
Give me a and a and a Coke Zero, please.

2297
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:35,800
Give me a chicken legend with the spicy mayo

2298
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:42,240
and and the large fries and a fucking vimto or whatever.

2299
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,440
What are those nice rhymes? Nice rhyme.

2300
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:47,920
Binto chicken legend.

2301
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,480
What are you fucking talking about?

2302
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:51,440
It's it's the British menu.

2303
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,320
Chicken legend is my favorite chicken.

2304
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,680
Chicken legend. Yeah.

2305
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:59,280
What are you telling me that in the Europe,

2306
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:01,480
they call it a Royale cheese?

2307
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,400
I've never heard of such a thing.

2308
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:08,400
I mean, let me get a very small image

2309
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:12,600
that is is not as good as other images that a chicken legend.

2310
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,440
I'm just curious.

2311
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:16,640
What is the American equivalent of a chicken legend?

2312
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:19,080
I don't know. What?

2313
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,480
I don't even know if they have this.

2314
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:23,520
I don't even know if they have this one in America.

2315
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:25,880
I like it because the chicken is like different

2316
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:28,520
from like a chicken burger, whereas like

2317
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,560
like a just a plain chicken breast that's been grilled.

2318
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,520
This is got like it's a big flat chicken nugget

2319
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:37,000
on a bun on a whole wheat bun.

2320
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,280
This is making me hungry.

2321
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:40,240
This is making me hungry, though.

2322
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,960
And it makes me hungry. Damn it.

2323
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:44,720
Arari, you fucked us.

2324
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:46,800
You did this to us.

2325
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:49,520
You should apologize profusely to the PCP

2326
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:51,680
and the community for everything.

2327
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:54,320
Then you did. So good job.

2328
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,080
OK, next one is called have a point.

2329
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:00,280
Three, two, one, go.

2330
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,760
Guys, if you're going to leave voicemails about Trixie,

2331
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:04,600
have a point.

2332
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:06,520
This isn't directed at A1 in specific,

2333
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:09,640
but I've noticed some voicemails are just like,

2334
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:11,920
Oh, Trixie bad.

2335
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,480
Oh, I'm all right, guys.

2336
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:15,400
And like, yeah, we get it.

2337
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:17,520
Don't waste your breath.

2338
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,640
Have a point, please.

2339
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:21,040
What do you think you're going to make a voicemail in general?

2340
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,320
What do you think you're accomplishing

2341
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,880
if you're just mindlessly raging at Trixie and Yeeg Studios

2342
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:27,680
for no reason?

2343
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,160
Like, who do you think you are?

2344
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:30,760
Ben Sainz or something?

2345
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:34,120
You got to fucking you got to you got to quit the quit that.

2346
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:36,000
You got to be you got to focus.

2347
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,560
You got to have you got to strike with precision, like lightning.

2348
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:43,720
Oh, you know, it's really cool. Yeah, you say that as a joke.

2349
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:46,720
And you do it all the time, though, and you know it's bad.

2350
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,960
Well, the joke is that I'm being self aware.

2351
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:50,240
The joke is that I'm being self aware.

2352
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:51,520
Well, it doesn't make it good, Ben.

2353
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:53,080
You got to you got to slow down.

2354
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,640
You got to. Oh, my God, I'll kill you.

2355
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:55,840
I'm going to fucking kill you.

2356
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,960
I said before you got on the show

2357
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:02,280
that I don't have anything else to say about the situation.

2358
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:04,240
You said the thing about it.

2359
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:08,520
Well, I say it when I get voicemails about it.

2360
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:12,240
Oh, before the editor thing out, whatever.

2361
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:13,720
I don't care who cares.

2362
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:15,280
I'm not I'll quit.

2363
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,800
I'll quit when I feel like it, which is now.

2364
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:20,120
But not because you told me to,

2365
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:22,280
not because anyone told me to stop talking about it,

2366
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:24,880
because I wanted to me.

2367
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,200
That was a really good idea, Ben.

2368
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:27,240
I hope you stick to it.

2369
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:28,600
Yeah, you're right.

2370
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,640
Yeah, you're right.

2371
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:32,280
Here we really show me if you stick to it

2372
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:34,680
and and and like that would really own me.

2373
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,080
Absolutely.

2374
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:39,240
Completely 100 percent totally.

2375
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,680
Yeah, you'd be there would be no coming back from it.

2376
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:48,880
Yeah, I guess I just have nothing else to say other than, yeah, true.

2377
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:54,920
Next one is called guest time three, two, one, go.

2378
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:58,040
Keep the guests coming, guys.

2379
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:02,280
They're great, lower person PCP is usually kind of dry.

2380
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:05,120
Don't get a mumkey, he sucks.

2381
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:07,840
Fair, based, fair and true, based.

2382
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:12,360
I think I think Kazi wants to be a guest again.

2383
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:14,280
I told her she could sometime.

2384
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:15,640
Well, that's nice.

2385
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:16,680
I like other than that.

2386
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:18,720
Wait, Kazi's good.

2387
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,520
There was a.

2388
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:22,320
Was there someone else we were thinking of asking

2389
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:25,040
or was I thinking of I'm I thinking of the Cato guys?

2390
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:28,640
I think that might have been the last one I think somebody

2391
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:31,360
somebody mentioned you should get the guy from Noita

2392
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:34,160
who made Noita on the show.

2393
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:35,480
I don't know.

2394
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:37,040
I don't even know who those guys are.

2395
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:38,440
I don't know if they do podcast.

2396
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:41,760
I think they're probably kind of a big deal.

2397
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:46,280
Well, now that they've had a very successful game

2398
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:48,040
or at least a Disney.

2399
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:49,120
I mean, they were lots of people.

2400
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:52,240
They were already true.

2401
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:55,760
But I mean, I think they were already kind of big deals before

2402
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,920
because they made like the falling sand game.

2403
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:01,400
These these guys were professional developers like before.

2404
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:02,720
No, yeah.

2405
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,680
They then it's so I don't know.

2406
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:08,680
I feel like they're I feel like they're a little bit too big time.

2407
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:10,800
Maybe I don't even know.

2408
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,440
But I mean, again, the fact that I don't know their names means

2409
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:18,120
maybe they're not maybe they're just humble devs who go unappreciated.

2410
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:24,640
Um, next voicemail is called three, two, one, go to the polls.

2411
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:27,080
Three, two, one, go.

2412
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:32,680
You know, Ben, you could save like 20 minutes every episode

2413
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:36,680
if you didn't start every voicemail with three, two, one, go.

2414
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:40,960
Just something to think about, Benjamin.

2415
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:44,680
I mean, it has utility because you say three, two, one, go.

2416
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:46,200
You press the button and that tells

2417
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:49,240
Eleazar exactly when to place the voicemail into the timeline.

2418
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:53,440
I say it so that you know exactly when to start it.

2419
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:55,960
I say it so Eleazar knows exactly when to say.

2420
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:59,240
And I think that it probably has utility to the viewer.

2421
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,360
Well, no, I guess they probably don't need to tell me when the voicemail is starting.

2422
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:05,720
I mean, you're right. It's yeah.

2423
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:11,640
I just feel like it's a useful thing to do and it doesn't take that much time.

2424
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:13,960
So I'm probably going to keep doing it.

2425
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,960
I'm sorry.

2426
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:19,400
Next one is called TonyProGrammo.

2427
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,400
Three, two, one, go.

2428
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:24,520
Hello, boom, Jim and Saint.

2429
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:28,040
Hey, I'm here to talk to you about your creative process.

2430
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:31,160
Spooky. Hey, you know, like you feel bad

2431
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:34,480
because you're doing all the art assets and you should be doing the hard program and work.

2432
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:37,680
You got to really like kind of like think about your project

2433
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:39,800
and like what are the necessary steps?

2434
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:42,800
Where are the time it's going to like be taken to get done?

2435
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:45,600
And you know, you just need to make sure that like, hey,

2436
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:51,360
if you're still like chipping away at the the time that you allocated to like,

2437
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:56,280
you know, get your artwork done, you know, you shouldn't beat yourself up

2438
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:57,880
for not doing the programming.

2439
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:01,560
I think I said this, you know, honestly, doing that kind of stuff.

2440
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:05,680
I think it's really good to like allocate an hour or two

2441
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:10,760
where you just learn the like the framework you're going to do

2442
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:13,000
and like not touch the thing yet.

2443
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:15,960
You touch a thing you don't care about because that's going to be cursed

2444
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:19,680
because you don't understand it right, you know, that's going to be a cursed program.

2445
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:22,680
But, you know, after you get that out of your system,

2446
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:26,280
then you take the logic and stuff you learn from that and you put in your real one

2447
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:28,440
and then you don't have to deal with all that.

2448
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:34,480
First of all, first of all, I said, I think I said last time that I

2449
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:38,400
don't feel that bad, that it feels bad in the moment.

2450
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,520
They're like, oh, I'm drawing when I should be programming.

2451
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:43,480
But I know intellectually that it all must get done.

2452
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:46,360
So I don't really feel that bad when I step back and think about it.

2453
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:52,000
As for the like learning before I try implementing,

2454
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:58,480
I'm not saying this is the right way to do it, but I treat coding

2455
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:04,800
basically like chiseling a sculpture

2456
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:09,720
and that I basically will write a little bit of code

2457
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:13,400
execute the program, see what happens.

2458
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:17,120
And if it is a little bit more like what I wanted it to be,

2459
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:20,160
then it was before, then I keep that code.

2460
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:24,200
And then and if it's different from what I wanted to be, then I deleted

2461
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:28,520
and try it again and I iterate that process over and over until the thing

2462
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:32,320
gradually becomes more and more and more like how I want it to be.

2463
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:35,440
And then when it's close enough, I say, I'm done.

2464
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:38,120
I wrote the code. I did it.

2465
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:44,320
So I am like, I'm my whole process is constantly

2466
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:50,200
just like tinkering with the thing, doing live experiments on the project itself.

2467
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:53,160
I don't know what will happen, but I mean,

2468
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:56,280
I always have the I have the control Z button at the ready

2469
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:59,400
in case I do something completely catastrophic.

2470
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:05,000
I mean, it's kind of like it's a little bit like how I always say

2471
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:11,440
that the best like drawing practice I ever got was drawing Vapors one.

2472
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:17,360
I just kind of did it and just kind of kept doing it over and over until it looked good.

2473
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,280
The the programming, the game is the same way.

2474
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:23,760
I just kind of start writing and if it looks bad,

2475
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:26,440
if it's performing badly, if it's fucking up,

2476
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:29,800
I just kind of rewrite and rewrite and tinker with it until it works.

2477
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,400
And then I guess it's done.

2478
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:35,440
And then I start that again on another piece of it.

2479
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:40,520
Yeah, so I'm very haphazard.

2480
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,720
And I don't plan anything.

2481
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:48,920
And I think it's good because planning too much is real bad trap to fall into.

2482
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:54,000
True anything.

2483
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:59,360
OK, yeah, next voicemail is called Tim Timbuk to three, two, one, go.

2484
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,280
That's crazy.

2485
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:04,200
Me and Ben just kept smoking and drinking and smoking and drink.

2486
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:05,200
It's all we did.

2487
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:07,400
We smoked and drink the whole night away.

2488
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:09,400
It was great.

2489
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:14,400
Welcome, Ben, to the new house.

2490
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:17,200
Is this Trixie back in the day?

2491
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:20,320
Welcome, viewers, to Ben.

2492
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:24,920
Is that Trixie? I think so.

2493
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:27,920
It sounds weird.

2494
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:30,520
Like it doesn't sound like I remember her voice sounding.

2495
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:31,520
I thought it wasn't her.

2496
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:37,080
But it sounds like she's saying this is when I moved into the digi house

2497
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:39,080
back like before Radcon.

2498
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:42,920
Two, I think.

2499
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:45,680
I think I don't know.

2500
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:48,640
Anyway, what's what's the point?

2501
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:51,840
OK, that's a that's a blast from the past.

2502
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:54,840
But what's what's your point?

2503
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:58,680
OK, next one, Johnny's nothing.

2504
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:01,640
Johnny Tsunami, three, two, one, go.

2505
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,480
Hello, PCP.

2506
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,240
My name is Johnny Tsunami.

2507
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:07,920
I'm from Tokyo in Japan.

2508
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,960
I don't like what's happened to the podcast.

2509
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:11,880
You need to bring back the best guy ever.

2510
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:14,080
He's a smart guy, a tremendous guy.

2511
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,560
He's the only one of you with a triple vision like you.

2512
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,480
Many people are saying this, Johnny.

2513
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:19,480
He's a real loser.

2514
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:21,640
I'm never listening to the podcast again.

2515
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:25,000
And you need to go to church or something, no watch.

2516
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:30,600
Johnny, no, come back.

2517
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:32,440
How can we how can we pander to you?

2518
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:36,440
I mean, Johnny Tsunami clearly represents a large segment of our audience

2519
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:39,280
because he's saying what they're all thinking.

2520
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,560
I wish he would just tell us what he wants to see

2521
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:46,400
instead of just so cruelly, callously excommunicating us like this.

2522
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:48,320
It's not like such a man's man.

2523
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:50,600
So such an alpha Chad voice.

2524
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:56,040
Sounds sounds sounds like someone who we should listen to.

2525
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:00,760
It's this guy sounds like he knows a thing or two about public speaking

2526
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:03,120
and changing hearts and minds.

2527
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:04,400
And maybe we can learn something.

2528
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:09,000
He knows the secrets of charisma, which we which we so clearly lack.

2529
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:16,600
OK, next next voicemail is called a realization about Radcon.

2530
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:18,880
Three, two, one, go.

2531
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:23,600
So I just realized something that nobody has brought up in regards to Radcon.

2532
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,480
If you guys do have another Radcon,

2533
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:29,720
who are you going to get to fill up the PCP Royal Rumble?

2534
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:32,360
Because like Nate is barely there.

2535
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:34,000
Trixie is gone.

2536
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,240
Mage is gone.

2537
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:36,480
Davoo is gone.

2538
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:37,680
And Jesse isn't coming back.

2539
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:41,160
And that like cuts out a large swath of just characters that you guys can use.

2540
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:43,240
And like, can you guys even use now?

2541
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:46,640
I mean, there's like Ben, Tom and give, obviously.

2542
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:48,840
Yeah, this is dumb. Vincent.

2543
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:50,240
Pump. Yeah.

2544
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:51,920
Vincent was in all the past ones.

2545
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,320
Zoomy. OK.

2546
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:55,440
If this were to happen, only seven.

2547
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:57,680
And like, I really can't do so many other.

2548
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:02,680
I have only I can only think I can only think of seven characters.

2549
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:05,560
Like, did you really want to bring up this old joke?

2550
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:08,200
Are you going to use anybody from the egg?

2551
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:09,320
Like, would you be OK?

2552
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:10,120
That's it. All right.

2553
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:11,280
Hmm. Geez.

2554
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:13,800
I can only think of seven characters that.

2555
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:17,920
So if you did it, you'd have to do all these,

2556
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:21,960
make all these really stupid decisions that sound dumb when I say them.

2557
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:23,600
And you're not going to do that.

2558
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:25,440
Are you? Short answer. No.

2559
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:28,800
We would just think of more than seven.

2560
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,720
I don't know. It wouldn't be that hard.

2561
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:32,280
I mean, I have a lot of characters.

2562
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:36,680
I have Red Man and Gun Girl who were in that endless war rumble at one point.

2563
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,600
That was fun. I mean, if we we.

2564
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:42,000
Yeah, we have there's plenty of goofy characters

2565
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,720
we could draw upon from lore.

2566
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:46,520
And if we needed more, I mean, in the past,

2567
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:49,800
we've always just come up with some bullshit characters on the spot.

2568
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:52,360
And they've just been funny.

2569
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:55,200
They've just sort of become little short term memes of their own.

2570
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:57,960
We just do that.

2571
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:01,440
I mean, really, Bernie Sanders was a competitor last last time.

2572
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:04,360
And you know what? He outperformed expectations.

2573
02:31:04,360 --> 02:31:05,840
He was a champion.

2574
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:09,040
I mean, I feel like a red con with just three people

2575
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:14,040
would be such a different feeling experience that we may as well not

2576
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:16,840
do not even call it that. Not even.

2577
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:19,040
Yeah, we wouldn't call it that.

2578
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,120
We wouldn't have to do everything

2579
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:24,280
that has ever been done at a red con before.

2580
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:25,680
Yeah. Yeah.

2581
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,680
Like the rumble, maybe we don't even do one.

2582
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:30,080
Maybe we just play other games.

2583
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:35,880
Maybe because a rumble does feel like a like a group like screaming at the TV.

2584
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,520
That's one of those things.

2585
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:40,400
A rumble would be different with fewer people.

2586
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:43,680
Yeah, it would be it would it would be lower energy,

2587
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:45,760
which I think would probably harm it.

2588
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:49,280
Harm of viewing experience is unfortunate.

2589
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:52,440
Yeah.

2590
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:56,600
Yeah, the point is we wouldn't have to do that.

2591
02:31:57,640 --> 02:31:59,800
But if we did, I'm sure we could think of some

2592
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:02,760
whatever to fill it out if we needed to.

2593
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:06,920
There's no reason we can't have like characters of other.

2594
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:10,880
All we would do if we had Action Giraffe or something,

2595
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,520
would that really like break immersion?

2596
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:13,600
Because Nate wasn't there.

2597
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:15,720
I think it would be OK to have Action Giraffe.

2598
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:17,720
I mean, at the end of the day,

2599
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:21,480
if we did something like that, you know, a new PCP,

2600
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:23,520
you know, three band rad con or whatever,

2601
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:26,440
we would just do whatever seemed fun.

2602
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:30,760
And if it seemed fun to do a rumble, we would do that.

2603
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:34,080
Or if we felt like doing something else, we just do something else.

2604
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,880
We just do whatever seemed fun.

2605
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,880
Yeah. Yeah.

2606
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:43,800
Next voicemail is called Regarding Archives three to one go.

2607
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:47,760
Hey, Ben, I just wanted to say that I agree with you on the archive thing.

2608
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:50,720
I've seen this mentality go around where people who want to venture

2609
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,520
into new things think that their old works have to suffer

2610
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:57,400
and they should just delete them, which I highly disagree with.

2611
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:59,400
One example is Sue Slut.

2612
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:02,280
She used to make mostly death grips mashed

2613
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:04,200
up with a hotline having stuff.

2614
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:08,400
And then once she once she transitioned into making like original music,

2615
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:13,080
she did delete all her other mashups, all her previous work.

2616
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:17,000
And I just think I just don't I just don't like that mentality.

2617
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,640
I don't think I don't like it either.

2618
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:20,520
I don't think in order for your

2619
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:23,520
in order for your new work to shine, that your old work has to suffer.

2620
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:26,320
That's why the archive exists.

2621
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:29,800
If the people who discovered Sue Slut

2622
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:34,440
for her death grips mashups can now find a new appreciation

2623
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:36,280
for her original works.

2624
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:38,880
But I mean, they may not get the chance

2625
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:42,000
because I mean, they may not get the chance to look into her.

2626
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:45,120
Your previous works, because they're all gone.

2627
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:47,120
And all we have are reuploads.

2628
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:49,320
It's a bit stupid, but I hate it.

2629
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:53,240
Just because to anyone out there, just because you want to venture out

2630
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:56,840
into new stuff does not mean your old work has to suffer.

2631
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:58,640
That's all I want to say.

2632
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:05,400
I mean, if you want to change direction

2633
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:09,160
and maybe you don't want to be associated with your old work,

2634
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:14,680
I mean, you could always start a new venture under a new name, right?

2635
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:16,680
And you wouldn't have to destroy it.

2636
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:19,040
You could just start making new stuff under a new name.

2637
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:24,680
I I think that that I mean, there's somewhat of a precedent

2638
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:31,000
that like if you are like you have like stuff that doesn't fly in other

2639
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:35,560
like circles, if you become like a like what was his name?

2640
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:40,320
Joji, like Pink Guy, filthy Frank, filthy Frank.

2641
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:43,800
He was Pink Guy and his Pink Guy stuff is gone, I think.

2642
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:48,120
Or it's like it's it's like unofficially reuploaded.

2643
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:50,360
The original stuff is like gone.

2644
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:56,480
And now he's a more traditional musical guy doing music

2645
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:59,800
and he's getting all big like stuff.

2646
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:03,960
And it's like Pink Guy would have, I don't know, hurt his career.

2647
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:05,560
I guess is what he thought.

2648
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:07,760
I don't. But I mean, I don't think it would have

2649
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:10,000
because everybody knows he's the filthy Frank guy,

2650
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:11,560
even if he deletes all his stuff.

2651
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:14,840
He's still everybody knows filthy Frank and everyone knows who it is.

2652
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:16,480
And it's him.

2653
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:18,920
I don't understand what deleting it accomplishes.

2654
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:21,560
It's the I think it's just the public stuff.

2655
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,080
If you make it so that it's like unlisted,

2656
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:27,560
but there is a way to access it if you want to find it.

2657
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:29,920
Even if it's behind a paywall,

2658
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:32,960
I would I would much rather that than just it being gone

2659
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:36,040
and and like people having to like reupload

2660
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:37,640
scraps here and there.

2661
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:41,840
I think I really think that an official channel to these things

2662
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:44,960
is always appreciated, even if you're if you cringe at it

2663
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:47,360
and you really don't want people to see it.

2664
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:51,120
Even if you prefer it to be like just in an unlisted playlist

2665
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:54,760
for people who who want to do the digging and find it, I guess.

2666
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:59,960
I would say like the only time that I think it makes sense.

2667
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:05,160
And I would be like, I, yeah, I agree to like delete something

2668
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:08,320
would be if if you think it's like immoral,

2669
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:10,400
like you made something that is like harmful.

2670
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:14,360
Yeah. And in that case, I mean, I think even that like

2671
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:20,520
99 percent of the time it would you wouldn't even if you just paywall

2672
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:22,680
that hit it, made it only accessible to people.

2673
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:26,520
I mean, I think that that would probably be fine

2674
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:29,680
in terms of like mitigating harm that a thing could do.

2675
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:35,120
I really believe in archiving and like preserving history

2676
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:36,960
warts and all.

2677
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:40,600
And like, yeah, maybe you cringe at a thing you made in the past,

2678
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:43,400
but it's such like a stupid trap

2679
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:46,440
that so many people fall into so many artists fall into it,

2680
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:49,320
where they're like, oh, I'm embarrassed by that thing I made before.

2681
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:50,560
I delete it.

2682
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,800
And like everyone knows that that's wrong, right?

2683
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,480
Like everybody knows that, oh, artists don't appreciate their own works

2684
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:00,040
the way that the fans do.

2685
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:02,800
Like the fans like a thing.

2686
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:05,840
And it's never the thing that the artist likes the best, right?

2687
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,120
It's never like that.

2688
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:10,280
So everyone should know that you shouldn't delete your old stuff

2689
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:12,360
even if it's embarrassing.

2690
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:14,240
But people do it anyway and I fucking hate it.

2691
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:15,240
Like it's dumb.

2692
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:17,480
It's conventional wisdom that you shouldn't do that.

2693
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:19,840
But everybody fucking does.

2694
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,400
It's terrible.

2695
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,840
It should be illegal, is what I'm saying.

2696
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:28,240
Yeah, I'm more sympathetic than you, I think, to the artists.

2697
02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:32,320
But I also I really appreciate when I can go to like a YouTuber

2698
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:34,560
and go back to the very first video.

2699
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:36,600
And it is actually the very first video.

2700
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:39,720
I could see how like they've changed over time

2701
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:44,360
because I know, like, you know, maybe the past things were said

2702
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:48,960
could be said on something that would be like, oh, we can't say that today.

2703
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:51,200
But like, I know that that's in the past

2704
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:54,760
and that shouldn't necessarily reflect on the present day.

2705
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:59,200
If I know that people do react like that sometimes,

2706
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:02,760
like things get brought up and it's like, ah, you said this 10 years ago.

2707
02:38:02,760 --> 02:38:03,760
Fuck you.

2708
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:08,280
And it does become a bit of an issue, but it's so minor in the grand scheme of things.

2709
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:12,560
I mean, but like if people want to do that, if people want to do that,

2710
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:16,240
they can find your stuff and they can.

2711
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:19,160
Yeah, we're talking about like cancer culture, witch hunting,

2712
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:21,840
if they can find your stuff and try and witch hunt you for it,

2713
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:26,000
even if you delete it, like unless there's literally no record for it,

2714
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,880
which like is very unlikely.

2715
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:31,400
I mean, I think part of it is just like getting rid of the ease

2716
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:35,000
by which people can search through your history

2717
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:38,880
if they have to go digging even a little bit more than just scrolling down

2718
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:41,360
and in a Twitter thread or or a YouTube.

2719
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:42,920
Well, that's why I would.

2720
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:44,960
That's why I would say like just just

2721
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:49,880
privating or paywalling or unlisting is probably what you should do.

2722
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:51,880
Yeah, most of the time.

2723
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:53,400
Yeah.

2724
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:58,680
I think she had like her old her old like a pony content

2725
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:02,520
like in a in a Patreon

2726
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:05,120
and like an unlisted playlist, I think.

2727
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:07,800
Yeah, I wonder if that's existing still.

2728
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:11,160
I wonder if that like went with the rest of her content.

2729
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:16,000
I just I just don't know.

2730
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,960
I just don't know. Throw it on the trash.

2731
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:19,840
I throw it on the trash. Who cares?

2732
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:22,360
Who cares if people liked it? Fuck it.

2733
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:24,080
I don't like it anymore.

2734
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:25,920
It's not even about whether people liked it.

2735
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:31,160
I just like things to be like, I don't know, the records to be available.

2736
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:34,440
Not for any specific reason.

2737
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:36,720
It just makes me feel good to know that it's still there.

2738
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,800
Yeah, no, totally.

2739
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:39,760
I totally agree.

2740
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:44,320
Just even even if I don't care about the content, I just don't.

2741
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:47,960
If you if a thing can be archived, it's just good.

2742
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,400
It's just good to have a record of stuff.

2743
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:52,840
I just like that for its own sake.

2744
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:57,840
I hate to think about stuff being like forgotten or like deleted.

2745
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:00,760
And like it's like it's like no one will ever see it again.

2746
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:02,480
It's like it never existed.

2747
02:40:02,480 --> 02:40:04,840
But it's so sad. It's a sad thought.

2748
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:10,080
There's like you could either make it so that people

2749
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:13,920
dredging up the past does not become as much of a problem

2750
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:19,080
such that people feel compelled to hide things or you could just hide things.

2751
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:23,400
I feel like, I don't know, advocating for people to not.

2752
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:28,800
Give so much of a shit that their past is like still there.

2753
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:36,280
Like it's people, yeah, I guess it's a bit of an appeal to like, you know,

2754
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:39,240
I don't know what it's an appeal to.

2755
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:41,960
But like saying that people reupload stuff.

2756
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:44,560
So therefore it's OK is not necessarily a good argument.

2757
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:51,520
But I I think it would be a better

2758
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:57,880
like world if stuff being archived was not a problem.

2759
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:01,640
Hmm, like if it ever causes a problem,

2760
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:04,320
I think it would be better for the problem to be solved

2761
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,400
rather than for more things to be hidden.

2762
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:10,000
Right. Yeah, I mean, I agree.

2763
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,480
I think if in a perfect world, I think

2764
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:17,360
if in the past you said some shit, I don't know,

2765
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:20,800
you said some racially insensitive shit and someone is like,

2766
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:25,680
hey, this guy in his old video said some racially insensitive shit.

2767
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:29,720
I think the best resolution there is you go, yeah,

2768
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:31,800
I did say some racially sensitive shit.

2769
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:33,320
I don't agree with that anymore.

2770
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:35,160
I apologize for saying it.

2771
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:39,480
Let's let's let's all let's all agree that what I said before was wrong.

2772
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,720
And I don't stand by it anymore.

2773
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:43,000
Like that's good.

2774
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,240
Yeah, that's that's better than like deleted pretend you never said it.

2775
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:50,200
In my opinion, generally.

2776
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:53,240
And then sometimes people would say, well, if you really take it back,

2777
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:56,280
you should get rid of it, you should take it down.

2778
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:59,840
And then you and then you go, well, you know, I pay all that, you know,

2779
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:02,440
I unlisted it, but, you know, I don't want to erase history.

2780
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:04,480
I don't I don't believe in erasing history.

2781
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:07,960
I do. I really I feel like some people might

2782
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:11,640
maybe some people might say that and like sort of a bad faith attempt

2783
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:17,640
to be like, oh, I don't have to actually, you know, be critical of media.

2784
02:42:17,720 --> 02:42:21,200
I believe I don't believe in erasing tearing down that Confederate statue.

2785
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:23,080
Why are you erasing history?

2786
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:26,240
But I promise when I say it, I mean it in a good way.

2787
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:30,000
True, you know, right.

2788
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:33,240
Yeah, I I feel strongly about this, mostly because

2789
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:38,120
a lot of the time I would watch YouTube poops in like 2008.

2790
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:43,000
And I love those things that make lots of like favorites list.

2791
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:46,760
There was only a favorites list and I put so many of them in there.

2792
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:51,640
And because of content ID becoming a thing later,

2793
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,720
a lot of those like had clips from stuff in them.

2794
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:56,800
They got taken down, channels got deleted.

2795
02:42:56,880 --> 02:43:00,640
People didn't bother archiving because nobody expected that to be a problem.

2796
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:03,400
And there's just so many cool things that are gone.

2797
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:07,280
Yeah. Only occasionally does it doesn't as a YouTube pooper

2798
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:09,600
reupload their stuff.

2799
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:12,320
Imagine being a professional YouTube pooper.

2800
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:15,080
Yeah, professional pooper.

2801
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:20,960
And yeah, I like genuinely respect that as an art form.

2802
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:22,600
It's my favorite.

2803
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:25,400
So fucking funny and sad.

2804
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:29,360
The sad that's so like volatile and so easily like erased.

2805
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:33,240
Oh, no, my headphones died a few moments later.

2806
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:34,640
Hey, you there?

2807
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:37,520
I'm OK. OK, I can hear you. Sorry, I'm back.

2808
02:43:39,440 --> 02:43:40,680
Well, you didn't miss anything.

2809
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:42,080
I finished my sentence.

2810
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:44,560
OK, sweet.

2811
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:46,440
Next voicemail.

2812
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:47,600
Yeah, sure.

2813
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:53,240
Next one is called follow up on the archive three, two, one, go.

2814
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:57,200
Also, would you would you delete history

2815
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:59,800
because it's quote unquote outdated?

2816
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:01,400
Yeah, I don't think so.

2817
02:44:01,400 --> 02:44:04,120
Right. Oh, this information is outdated.

2818
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:05,480
Oh, it's not relevant.

2819
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:07,640
It's not true anymore. We got to delete.

2820
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:09,960
Obviously, it was written in the past.

2821
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:11,400
It's an archive.

2822
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:15,600
It's an archive of information describing the past.

2823
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:19,880
I mean, you can update it if you want, but there's no.

2824
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:23,480
Yeah, I hate I don't understand the the mindset of like

2825
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:26,600
the information is out of date.

2826
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:31,200
Therefore, it should be deleted as opposed to updated

2827
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:32,920
or just archived and preserved.

2828
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:34,960
You know, you know, it would be like a like a smart

2829
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:38,760
like marketing strategy is just to have your own channel

2830
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:42,400
called your channel name archive and then put things on there.

2831
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:45,400
And so like if you take them off your main channel,

2832
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:48,040
which is like your publicly facing forward like,

2833
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:50,200
ah, this is my brand and this is what I am about.

2834
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:52,560
And all of the things you don't like anymore are gone.

2835
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:54,560
But you have the archive channel

2836
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:57,600
and you can still get the ad revenue from it.

2837
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:03,920
But you don't tell anyone that I mean, that would be a that would.

2838
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:07,240
I mean, you'd still you'd still lose the views.

2839
02:45:07,320 --> 02:45:10,480
You'd lose all the all the old like metrics and stuff.

2840
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:12,440
It would you would hurt viewership for sure.

2841
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:14,480
It would be better than just getting rid of it.

2842
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:16,760
Yeah, true. Yeah, true.

2843
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:21,520
And I mean, it's archiving is good generally.

2844
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:25,480
So yeah, I would say if you if you must, if you must,

2845
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:29,040
if you feel that you must remove something from your main

2846
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:33,920
content delivery vehicle, you must distance yourself from this content.

2847
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:36,920
Sure. Putting it somewhere else is better than

2848
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:40,440
getting rid of it pretend it doesn't exist.

2849
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:42,800
OK, next one is Janess.

2850
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:46,560
Three, two, one, go, Ben,

2851
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:50,720
you mentioned weeks ago that you weren't interested in watching our taxi.

2852
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:54,920
So I have to ask, what is your reference library like

2853
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,280
for the champion and the vapors?

2854
02:45:57,280 --> 02:46:00,560
I think you would have playing real life examples for future

2855
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:04,360
volumes of the papers, but are you just going to draw influence

2856
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:07,600
for no time for the rest of the champion storyline?

2857
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:09,560
What the fuck?

2858
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:12,160
Yes, I'm just going to draw.

2859
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:14,360
From Noida.

2860
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:19,480
Um, is the is the implication here that if I don't feel like watching Odd Taxi

2861
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:25,240
that I have a narrow have a shallow pool of influences and my work will stagnate?

2862
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,480
Is that is that the implication?

2863
02:46:28,480 --> 02:46:31,480
Yes. OK.

2864
02:46:31,480 --> 02:46:34,000
Um, I don't know.

2865
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,840
I will accept this and just do exactly what you said.

2866
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:40,560
Draw from one pool of one influence only.

2867
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:46,240
I I mean, I don't think the fact that I am not interested in Odd Taxi.

2868
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:52,400
I mean, I think the general criticism that I am not broadly read or broadly

2869
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:56,040
I don't consume broad enough media might be true.

2870
02:46:56,680 --> 02:47:00,320
I I reject the idea that

2871
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:03,680
it matters whether I watch Odd Taxi or not.

2872
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,600
So I'll just respond to the broader criticism.

2873
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:07,600
Um.

2874
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:14,200
Uh, I just I I do I do I mean, I do agree with it.

2875
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:18,680
I feel like I am not broadly consumed.

2876
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:21,840
It's probably a problem.

2877
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:24,360
It's probably something I should work on.

2878
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:31,320
I don't know what else to say.

2879
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:33,760
I should watch more stuff, read more stuff.

2880
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:37,000
Um, but it's so boring.

2881
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,800
Yeah, media sucks.

2882
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:44,440
I feel similar, like I'm like, oh, I got to draw from a large pool of influences.

2883
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:48,600
But I feel like that's like a task rather than I don't know,

2884
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:50,480
want something I want to do.

2885
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:54,480
I feel like, yeah, if I actually want to draw from influences,

2886
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:58,400
it would have to be something that I am influenced by naturally

2887
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:01,320
rather than just like, I guess I could take something from this.

2888
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:04,400
I hate it and I don't like it, but, you know, it's different.

2889
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:09,760
Like I should I should be I should consume some media because I want to,

2890
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:14,680
right, like because I want to read it or watch it because it appeals to me

2891
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:18,560
or because I feel like I want to know what it says.

2892
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:22,360
And I and just.

2893
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:27,400
There's very little, there's very little that makes me want that.

2894
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:33,440
Uh, it's like, you know, the the the media that you choose to consume

2895
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:39,000
or you're influenced by, like you get into is not always going to be.

2896
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:45,080
I don't know, the same medium than the one you create in.

2897
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:51,160
Yeah, you watch movies and TV shows and play video games and read comics.

2898
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:57,760
These all all these all will influence your art in different ways.

2899
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:04,240
And I just think I think it's fine just to be into a few things at a time.

2900
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,680
Like, oh, I'm watching Buffy.

2901
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:09,240
That's obviously going to have some influence in what I do next

2902
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:11,960
just because it's so good.

2903
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:14,160
And I really like the storytelling and everything about it.

2904
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,160
True.

2905
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:24,560
Uh, I mean, this is like a people when you when you read like biographies of like artists,

2906
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:28,800
they all it's pretty common that they're like, oh, yeah, this this mangaka

2907
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:32,640
was like heavily influenced by like, you know, the Hollywood blockbusters

2908
02:49:32,640 --> 02:49:37,760
that they grew up watching or, you know, this this this game dev

2909
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:43,240
was like really inspired by like a certain genre of literature that they were really into, right?

2910
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:49,080
It's it's not always that like, oh, you know, you you got to read a lot of comics.

2911
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:51,080
I think that's probably not bad.

2912
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:57,400
It's like a misunderstanding of that is is to hear, oh, my favorite artists,

2913
02:49:57,400 --> 02:49:59,400
they were influenced by various things.

2914
02:49:59,400 --> 02:50:03,360
Therefore, I should go out of my way to try and find stuff to be influenced by

2915
02:50:04,480 --> 02:50:06,240
so that I can be as good as them.

2916
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:08,960
And I have to have a certain number of things that I'm interested in.

2917
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:14,200
And even though it's true that the best way to find like stuff

2918
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:18,080
that will really appeal to you is to just look around a lot is to experience

2919
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:19,760
a lots of different things.

2920
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:24,480
The misunderstanding is that you need to constantly be looking

2921
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:28,040
and drawing from a wider range as possible,

2922
02:50:28,920 --> 02:50:31,680
even though you might not give a shit about most things.

2923
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:34,760
Like, I feel like it's it's a means to an end.

2924
02:50:34,760 --> 02:50:36,600
And the end is just to find something you like.

2925
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:39,400
Once you find something you like, you can draw influence from that

2926
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,640
and maybe a couple other things.

2927
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:44,800
You know, it doesn't have to be like if it's just from one thing,

2928
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:47,840
then you're obviously going to be limited in what you can create

2929
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:51,520
because you're not drawing from a wide, you know, thing.

2930
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:53,800
I think it's it's a balance.

2931
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:55,800
You shouldn't be focused too much on just

2932
02:50:56,920 --> 02:50:58,720
doing things because you're supposed to.

2933
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:02,600
You should also just listen to your heart and get interested in things

2934
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:04,800
that literally just interest you on a whim.

2935
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:08,640
You should do maybe hell, yeah, a bit of both.

2936
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:14,480
Based, based.

2937
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:20,120
Yeah, it's like.

2938
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:23,960
You can't you can't force it like if you if you don't

2939
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,760
if you're not if you're not engaged, if you're not interested,

2940
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:30,240
you can't like force yourself to like read a book, watch a show

2941
02:51:30,240 --> 02:51:32,080
and then get something out of it.

2942
02:51:32,120 --> 02:51:35,920
Like it's got to engage you, which is almost like something that it

2943
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:39,080
you can't choose. It's just it just happens to you.

2944
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:42,640
It's like falling in love.

2945
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:45,440
Yeah, I personally you don't choose it.

2946
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:50,320
I personally find it very engaging to look through all of those indie games.

2947
02:51:51,640 --> 02:51:54,880
Yeah, in the Palestinian aid bundle.

2948
02:51:54,880 --> 02:51:57,360
Me too. That's what I almost said before.

2949
02:51:57,360 --> 02:51:59,880
Like, yeah, I'm not that I just look at odd taxi and I'm like,

2950
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:01,320
yeah, it looks nice, not interested.

2951
02:52:01,320 --> 02:52:04,440
But I look at some of these, you know, a couple of thumbnails

2952
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:08,840
and descriptions of this this Palestinian aid game list.

2953
02:52:09,080 --> 02:52:11,120
Catch my eye and I go, that could be interesting.

2954
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:14,040
I just kind of want to see what's what's going on in there.

2955
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:18,000
That that like bundle is like really useful

2956
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:22,200
in that in that specific way of like opening your minds to new possibilities.

2957
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:27,440
So you play one game, of course, of course, you will only know that one game.

2958
02:52:27,640 --> 02:52:29,840
You might know it very well.

2959
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:34,760
But like it's like a shotgun, you know, you're shooting a lot of pellets.

2960
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:38,760
And you some of the pellets hit the target.

2961
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:40,880
I don't know where that metaphor is going.

2962
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:44,200
Yeah, but me, I have a sniper rifle

2963
02:52:44,480 --> 02:52:48,560
and my sniper rifle is trained on one target and it always hits

2964
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,440
going with a bullet going a million miles an hour.

2965
02:52:51,440 --> 02:52:56,160
And the target is Noida and I'm just pumping precision rounds every day

2966
02:52:56,480 --> 02:53:01,880
directly into nowhere else like like like like you shoot the target.

2967
02:53:01,880 --> 02:53:04,320
And then the target like blood splatter is your art.

2968
02:53:04,800 --> 02:53:07,920
And if you shoot one thing, you get like exactly the same thing out.

2969
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:09,520
But it's sort of splattered.

2970
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:10,880
So it's slightly different.

2971
02:53:10,880 --> 02:53:12,880
Ben St. version. Oh, yeah.

2972
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:18,280
That's yeah, it's just that's the natural progression

2973
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:20,400
is I just have to make my own version of Noida.

2974
02:53:20,480 --> 02:53:23,800
That's the only it's the only thing I'll know how to do eventually.

2975
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:26,800
Hell, yeah.

2976
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:30,200
Phantom's revenge is basically just Noida too.

2977
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:36,280
She that's the last voice that's it.

2978
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:40,400
That's it. We're we're done and some.

2979
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:44,160
With the start of this one, I was like, shit, it's a Ben cast.

2980
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:46,680
This is going to be short. I'm going right into the voicemails.

2981
02:53:46,680 --> 02:53:48,080
We're going we're be lining.

2982
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:50,200
This is going to be a one hour episode.

2983
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:53,280
Here we are at the three hour mark again.

2984
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:55,600
Here we are in the future.

2985
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:57,720
Here we are in the future and it's bright.

2986
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:01,520
It's bright because the episode's over.

2987
02:54:02,120 --> 02:54:03,720
Finally. All right.

2988
02:54:03,720 --> 02:54:06,200
We'll go home. Any last words?

2989
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:11,400
Look out for a future Lord of Ghost Kickstarter at some point.

2990
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:14,640
True. Get hyped for that.

2991
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:16,440
Save up some some coins.

2992
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:17,880
Keep them in your purse.

2993
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:20,120
In the meantime, get ready to throw my way.

2994
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:22,600
And in the meantime, you'll be laughing about it.

2995
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:27,240
In the meantime, check out the Kato anthology Kickstarter is still going on now.

2996
02:54:27,240 --> 02:54:31,960
If you got some some of those spare coins in your pocket, throw them at them.

2997
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,840
Throw them at them hard directly in their eyes.

2998
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:43,920
Blind them and patreon.com slash the procrastinators for bonus episodes

2999
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:50,080
and stuff and and also access to the Minecraft server for shekels for heckles,

3000
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:51,640
which we do sometimes.

3001
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:54,080
You also can become a void.

3002
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:59,920
Thaumaturge like myself and master the the energies of the rift.

3003
02:55:00,640 --> 02:55:03,760
And I guess I guess that's it.

3004
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:05,280
I guess that's it.

3005
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:07,280
I guess we're going to send a voicemail.

3006
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:09,360
Send a voicemail, but only if it's good.

3007
02:55:09,360 --> 02:55:13,720
No sending bad voicemails just to prove a point, because I don't care.

3008
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:19,600
I'm not available to be persuaded, so don't try and get clever with it.

3009
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:22,280
OK, that's the end of the episode.

3010
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:23,280
Goodbye.

3011
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:24,280
Goodbye.
