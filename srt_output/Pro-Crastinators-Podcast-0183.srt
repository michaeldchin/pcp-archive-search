1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
1, 2, 3, sync!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And one more time. 1, 2, 3, sync!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I never got my apple juice.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Dab.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sorry. Are you getting apple juice?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's okay. It's okay. It's too late.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the first time hearing about apple juice.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Anyway, welcome to the Pro Crastinators Podcast.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, hello everybody. We're here. That's the episode.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What do you know? It already started. Who could have predicted this thing?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome to the Apple Juice Cast.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Remember Apple Jacks? The cereal.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here's my hot take. As a child, didn't much care for apple juice. I don't know why.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
As an adult, I find it almost too delicious, almost too sweet.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I find the flavor of apple juice to be intense, and it's strange.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When I was a kid, I didn't like apple juice at all.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As an adult, I drink it and I'm like, whoa!

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That sounds stupid, but I'm being completely genuine.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm almost on the same boat, though.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When I was a kid, I used to like the mixed fruit or whatever.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was a 2D fruity something.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wild berry punch.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No, no, no. It's mixed fruit. All of the fruits are together.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Right now, when I taste it, it's too sweet and kind of watered down.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I really dislike it.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But apple juice, though. Apple juice is the god of the juices.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I love it so much. It's so good.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's pressed apple juice. It's the most delicious juice of all.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I know. We're raised orange juice boys, and orange juice remains king of juices.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No. Orange juice has rained for too long.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I prefer orange juice.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I prefer orange juice growing up.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think I probably still prefer it, but grapefruit juice is my thing.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Grapefruit juice is my favorite.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I also like cranberry juice. I guess I like bitter stuff.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Bitter is best.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
To a restaurant for breakfast, I would say, excuse me waiter, please give me a,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
please mix me a tall glass of two-thirds cranberry, one-third grapefruit juice.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you very much. And that is my favorite.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Did you say bitter? Do you mean bitter or do you mean like sour?

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Bitter. I guess it's sour.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Cranberries, I mean they're a little sour, but cranberries and grapefruits are both bitter.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's a terrible taste, but okay.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, it's good shit.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, it's good shit, dog.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've at the grocery store, and I buy orange juice now,

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that I do not also buy a carton of grapefruit juice to make this exact concoction,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
because it is transcendent.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bitter is only worse than sour.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, wait, yeah, sour is only better than the bitter.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sour and bitter are two worse.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's just a brainlet take to be like, ooh, some of these quadrants of food are bad,

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
just across the board.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Certain categories of flavor are just out of the question.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Exactly, they're banned.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you not like coffee?

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Unless I put a lot of sugar and cream into it.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, I don't.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, okay.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I mean same, I also cream and sugar.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, I splenda, but same difference.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I also cream and sweeten my shit out of my coffee.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I do like lattes, like caramel.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've been drinking black milk straight for the last while.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The fuck is black milk?

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Did I say I meant black coffee?

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Only the blackest of milk for me.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That would definitely scare me to see my milk turn black.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hey, speaking, we started this discussion with apple juice.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you guys ever confuse apple juice with piss,

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
as is discussed famously in Homestuck?

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Unless someone in your house pisses in cartons or bottles.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, of course, I've told you that in college,

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I discovered that my roommate was storing piss bottles

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
in the bottom of the trash can.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There was a period of my life where,

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
due to stressful living conditions,

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I did pee in bottles so as to not leave my room

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to go to the bathroom because I would have to see

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the people I lived with.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And after the cabin fever started to set in,

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it was looking pretty delicious.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What, mage?

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You guys and your milk proved being able to pee in bottles.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't, that's true.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You would just need a funnel, you know?

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Just you need additional tools all.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No, I was joking.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, I don't condone what I did,

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but I don't condone it, but I...

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I won't apologize for what I've done.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I feel like I was really...

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I was really, it was a rock and a hard place.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I only did it because of the high pressure situation I was in.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's okay. You were a Hickamore.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You couldn't go outside.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not that.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It was that I was under threat of being

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
evicted from my apartment every single day.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And also, one of the guys I was living with

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
was this intolerable unmedicated bipolar

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
who was just...

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Every time you saw him, he would...

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
50% of the time...

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There was a 50% chance that he would demand

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that you do some things with him,

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
some completely pointless, time-consuming tasks,

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
like moving all the furniture from one side of the room

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to the other side.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He was like, we gotta do this right now.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Come on.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And he would expect you to help him with it.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I would just crouch in my room like,

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
God, I can't...

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't risk it.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't do it.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Not again.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, okay.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Does that have...

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is that related to the whole evicting thing?

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Because it doesn't seem like it's your landlord

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
like cruising around.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, no, no.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That was not specifically related.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, because of the eviction,

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the possible eviction,

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
most people had left the house,

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
so it was just me, that guy, and one other guy.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But no.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Fair enough.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
All right.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, guys, I'm sure you've heard,

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Homestuck 2 was announced.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If it was.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If it was announced.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Homestuck 2.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It says on the website, it's official,

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and I believe it.

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, Nate, thank you.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think I do see that.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Here's my question.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you give a shit?

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Absolutely not.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Absolutely not.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All right, cool.

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's all there is to say.

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I never really got into Homestuck,

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
so no, don't care.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm simply curious.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm simply curious.

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'd be curious to see if anyone disagrees

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
with me in the comments.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I read all Homestuck, you know,

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
was on the arm retrieval.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good times, good times.

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The epilogue came out.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Tried to read it.

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Really tried.

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It just felt to me like they were trying to...

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It was like they deliberately didn't write

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the full ending to Homestuck in Homestuck,

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and now they're adding it back.

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like there are pieces just left out,

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
presumably to be filled in later,

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
as like this continuation or whatever.

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I never mustered the energy to read the epilogue.

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you just remember, just quickly,

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
there was that whole thing about like,

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the Homestuck, the Fort Quadrant,

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
like the secret weapon that was used

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
against Cal at the very end.

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We didn't really understand what it was

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
or how exactly it was found

179
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or what the purpose of it was.

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
These things are somewhat explained in the epilogue.

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I got to the point where at least that

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
made some sense, but then it just kept going

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and I got completely bored, didn't finish it.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There was so much fucking text.

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't have time for this shit.

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I presume that it ended,

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and I'm just flummoxed that there's Homestuck too.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm drinking a fucking blue Raz Rockstar X-Durance.

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know it's not even by Homestuck too.

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't understand.

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm just absolutely boggled that it's...

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Wait, what?

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I saw page one, it's got Dirk.

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's like a space pirate now.

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hussie is like the creative director of it.

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Or this is what I heard.

197
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's like he doesn't...

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He's like the Lauren Faust of it?

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You know, Lauren Faust had to approve every script.

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She had to approve everything,

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
even if she didn't write every episode herself.

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You know, I was happy to hear

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
what was that last episode,

205
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that Hussie is engaging himself creatively

206
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
with his interesting fashion line

207
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and is being a male Instagram model and whatnot.

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's not a fashion line.

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He just dresses very cool and takes selfies.

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's totally sick,

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and I totally support it.

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's kind of sick, yeah.

213
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But frankly, compared to Homestuck too...

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't give a shit about Homestuck too.

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That is the most interesting creative thing

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hussie's done in a long time for me.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, I'm genuinely more interested

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
in Hussie being funny on Instagram

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
than I am in Homestuck too.

220
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Although, didn't he help work on

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Drill or Wint on Twitter?

222
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He helped work on the book

223
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that he made, that Gib bought.

224
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I meant to buy as well.

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Did Hussie help work on the sweet bro and hella Jeff book?

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, he did.

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, I forgot it was a sweet bro and hella Jeff.

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Whatever, you don't know what I'm saying.

229
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, that's fine.

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I haven't read it,

231
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but if I ever got the chance,

232
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I would thumb through it.

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I've told you guys before

234
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that my first ever exposure

235
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
before you told me about Homestuck was

236
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
just reading the sweet bro and hella Jeff comics

237
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that we found online.

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I should have stopped right there.

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I had heard of sweet bro and hella Jeff

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
way before I ever heard of Homestuck.

241
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Amazing.

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Or at least I remember

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
reading Homestuck

244
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
they make reference

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
to sweet bro and hella Jeff and I'm like

246
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
wait, sweet bro and hella Jeff,

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I've heard of that and then I go and find it

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and I'm like, oh, sweet bro and hella Jeff

249
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that's a Homestuck thing?

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Like what?

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I only knew about them as some sort of meme.

252
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I still don't know their context.

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I just know they exist and they're funny.

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You should go to sweetbroandhellajeff.com

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
right fucking now.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But maybe I shouldn't.

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They're fucking good.

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They're legendary.

259
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They taper off as they go.

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, they kinda taper off.

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But the first half of it is fucking great.

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I mean, they're legendary, they're great memes.

263
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's all there is to it.

264
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Heavily inspirational to Gib.

265
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, okay, he's not in this episode, but he's not.

266
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, yeah.

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Heavily inspirational to our country.

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're not wrong.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're not wrong.

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I had to quote Hussie, build that wall.

271
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He really took his shit advice.

272
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All right, there you go. Homestuck 2 done.

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's in the dirt.

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Nothing else need to be said about that.

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I opened up homestuck2.com or whatever

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and I saw like, oh, Dirk on a spaceship

277
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and I said, okay, and I hit that X

278
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and I never looked back.

279
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's the way to do it.

280
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If anyone has read it and it's good, just let me know.

281
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'd be shocked.

282
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm very curious.

283
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I wanna talk about an anime.

284
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
A single anime.

285
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You have to listen.

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Strap self into torture chamber.

287
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I guess there's no law against it,

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
so I can't stop you.

289
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's called Ascendus of a Bookworm

290
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and it's honestly one of the most pleasing

291
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
enemies of the season.

292
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Or just like this year for me.

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
For me personally, it scratches

294
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
a certain itch.

295
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's like, I'm guessing you guys

296
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
at least watch Doctor Stone or Heard of It, right?

297
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Of course.

298
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I've read the first chapter of it.

299
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He uses power of knowledge

300
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to bring

301
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
science stuff

302
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to the stone age,

303
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
so to speak, of the future.

304
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, Ascendus of a Bookworm is sort of

305
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
a bit of an eseper. The stone age of the future.

306
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm slightly confused, but okay.

307
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That would be like a post...

308
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's the word? Post-apocalyptic.

309
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What's the word that Preston Jacobs

310
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
uses to describe a period

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
of history wherein a society has regressed

312
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
from an advanced civilization to like a pre-space

313
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
or a per...

314
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, darn it!

315
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Post-apocalyptic.

316
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
15 minutes from now, I'm going to shout out the word.

317
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay, alright.

318
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But yeah, Ascendus of a Bookworm is

319
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
a bit of an isekai, so like a girl

320
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
she...

321
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Interregnum!

322
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Interregnum.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That wasn't 15 minutes, but...

324
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A period of time

325
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
after a society has achieved

326
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
spaceflight wherein they

327
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
lose it and enter a sort of like

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
intermediate dark age before we're

329
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
gaining it again. Does that happen specifically

330
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
spaceflight?

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, I think maybe

332
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
in the context, George R.R. Martin used it,

333
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
whatever.

334
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Ascendus of a Bookworm. Yes, like on Topic People.

335
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm interrupting.

336
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, a girl dies and she gets

337
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
sort of reincarnated into a body

338
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
of like a five-year-old child

339
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
that actually just passed away

340
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and she gets to inhabit her body

341
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
instead. It's really sad

342
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and messed up when you think about it,

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but they don't think about it and maybe

344
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
they don't address it.

345
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But yeah, so she gets reincarnated

346
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and she's like

347
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
all she wants to do is read a

348
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
book. She wants to read books,

349
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but she lives

350
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
in a peasant household.

351
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
None of them can read or write

352
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
except for the father just barely.

353
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He's a town guardsman, so he kind of has to.

354
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But like no one knows what a book is.

355
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So, her whole struggle

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
is her trying to find

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
or make a book

358
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to read. Her comps, if you will.

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Her struggle.

360
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fine.

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is to find and read a book or to

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
make a book herself if

363
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
their family cannot afford a book. Yeah, and she'll call it

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and she'll call it my struggle

365
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and she'll title it in her native German.

366
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's what I'm saying. No.

367
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Continue. Can't fix that by the way, Ben.

368
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Not struggle.

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Wait, what?

370
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure

371
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Kampf is battle, not struggle.

372
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've heard people say

373
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
that it means my struggle.

374
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I could be wrong. It's been

375
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
like two decades since I had

376
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
German class.

377
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Two decades, I'd say. A decade.

378
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not that old.

379
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Anyway, what's really

380
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
satisfying for me is you get to see

381
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
how much she

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
works towards such a simple

383
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
goal and like all the little

384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
victories she has are just so satisfying

385
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and she has so many

386
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
troubles doing it and she fails

387
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
along the way, but also she brings a little

388
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
bit of knowledge from her own world

389
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
into this

390
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
medieval sort of stylish word like

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
medieval styled world

392
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
like she sort of

393
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
like invents shampoo in

394
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that world because she needs to be able to

395
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
shampoo. Yeah, she creates shampoo

396
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
like a very basic sort of shampoo.

397
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
She had seen fight clubs and she knows how to make soap

398
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I assume. No, not so.

399
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Does she like make a lie out of ashes?

400
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Uh,

401
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No? Or explain.

402
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Can you tell me how does she make shampoo?

403
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm genuinely curious. Now, if I remember

404
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
correctly, like she used some

405
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
oils from a fruit

406
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and then she added some

407
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What was it? What's it called?

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Not vegetables, not mint.

409
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What's that called?

410
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Uh, it's like some grass things.

411
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Some bullshit in there.

412
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Shut up.

413
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I forgot the name. I forgot the word.

414
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Herbs, there we go. Some herbs into that oil.

415
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay. Herbs and oils

416
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
are not what shampoo is made of.

417
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, she's unacceptable.

418
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No, it's some sort of like basic type

419
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
of shampoo she used to make with her mother

420
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
back in her own world.

421
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And it worked

422
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
fine enough in a world where there's absolutely

423
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
no shampoo.

424
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is this as detailed as like Dr. Stone

425
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
which is seemingly pretty scientifically accurate?

426
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think so.

427
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You should play Dwarf Fortress

428
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
where you have to have your dwarves

429
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
make their own shampoo.

430
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You have to like burn wood

431
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to make charcoal and then soak the charcoal

432
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to make lye and then process the lye

433
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
into bars of soap and then mix

434
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and then put it in a waterfall

435
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and wash your dwarves. That sounds so boring, Ben.

436
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How could that possibly be fun?

437
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah. You say it's boring

438
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but then you build your communal

439
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
showers and then like

440
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
50 dwarves a year end up like

441
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
getting sucked down the drains and dying in the

442
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
cisterns beneath. Choked with

443
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
dwarf bodies of women and children

444
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
like legendary swords and axes

445
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and pieces of armor down there just waiting

446
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
for some enterprising individual. You call

447
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
that boring, huh? It's just hard for me to understand

448
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
how this could not be boring.

449
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The fucking death bath house.

450
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay, but back to the anime.

451
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It is similar to Dr. Stone

452
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
in the fact that like, you know,

453
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
she explains all these things

454
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and how she's making it and stuff.

455
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But Dr. Stone has a lot of energy

456
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and lots of

457
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
extreme facial expressions and stuff like that

458
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and with this one it's

459
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
a lot more like slow

460
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and tone down but it's also

461
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
like cute and it's still interested.

462
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm surprised how interested I am.

463
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm just loving the crap out of this anime

464
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and I just want to see more. It's just

465
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
as much as that I didn't know I had

466
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and it's great. I love it.

467
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Fair enough. So I recommend people

468
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to watch it. Okay.

469
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think I can understand the appeal.

470
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's like with most isekais

471
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it's usually a power fantasy.

472
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You sort of like you solve all your

473
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
problems with magic.

474
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're a super powered guy. You're the

475
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
only one. You're the chosen one.

476
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're the god of this universe. But with this

477
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
she's a five almost six

478
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
year old girl and she's so weak

479
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
physically that she can't even walk to

480
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the edge of the

481
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
town. To the shitter. So she's constantly

482
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
shitting herself. No.

483
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Acceptable.

484
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It takes three months

485
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
of her to build up

486
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
her stamina just so she can

487
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
reach the edge of town.

488
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's how weak she is.

489
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
With that frail body

490
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and her getting constantly

491
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
like fevers and stuff.

492
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
She's working towards

493
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
accomplishing her goal of just making a

494
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
book. So what is her goal?

495
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
To make a book.

496
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes.

497
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why doesn't she just make a book?

498
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's hard. What's

499
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
standing in her way?

500
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
She has no access to

501
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
paper.

502
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
She starts off not knowing

503
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the language of the land. She has to

504
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
learn to read and write and stuff.

505
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Wait.

506
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
She has to

507
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
learn to read and write the language.

508
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then she has to get

509
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
trees and process them into paper on her

510
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
own. Probably

511
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
skin a cow and tan the

512
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
leather to make the binding or something.

513
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I just may be at some point

514
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
but no. She tried to make papyrus

515
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
which didn't work. Then she tried to do

516
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
clay tablets which is

517
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the last art we just did.

518
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I appreciate

519
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
how ridiculously specific this premise is.

520
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You said she was a...

521
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
If she liked books at all, she must

522
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
have been able to read in her original world.

523
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
She already

524
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
can speak that language and obviously

525
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
she didn't have to learn how to speak.

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Is there some isekai thing

527
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
where she speaks the same language

528
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
she used to speak? Maybe

529
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
this world is different.

530
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
If I remember correctly, I think

531
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
when she first got isekai, she didn't understand.

532
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm not too certain because I watch

533
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
so many enemies. I'm like how it's a verb

534
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
to get isekai'd.

535
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a thing.

536
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a thing now sadly.

537
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
My favorite thing about isekai's

538
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
my absolute number one favorite thing

539
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
is all these stories about

540
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
how you put

541
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
an average neat loser

542
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
with no skills, no abilities

543
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
into a world and they don't get anything.

544
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I particularly like the power fantasy

545
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
of these gamer

546
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
skills I had as a worthless piece

547
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
or should gamer who achieved nothing in my life

548
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I can now pretend, I like the fantasy

549
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
of pretending that those skills might have

550
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
some use in some other world

551
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
even though we all know they never would

552
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and they never will. It's embarrassing

553
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
when they try. With her, she used to read a lot

554
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
of books so she's applying the knowledge from

555
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the books. Well, that's fine. That's not

556
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
what I'm talking about. That's a-okay.

557
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The only good isekai

558
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
that has ever been written

559
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and ever will be written

560
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
is slime and punishment.

561
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The story of phantom horn being

562
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
sent from his cozy, boring

563
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
existence in the real world

564
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
of Ponyville into the

565
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
fantastical wonderland that is

566
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
New Los Angeles City.

567
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm not surprised. The greatest

568
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
isekai ever made

569
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
currently in its fifth season.

570
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Six seasons in a movie, baby.

571
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They just had a curiosity.

572
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It seems like you're plugging

573
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
along towards the end. Is that close to ending now?

574
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Are you getting close to the end? Well,

575
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the main

576
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
story that I set out to write

577
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
is over. I did successfully

578
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
tell the story of their- But it's time

579
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
for slime and punishment, too, baby!

580
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's time to cash in! It's basically

581
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
time to go from the

582
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
story I set out to tell, and now I have

583
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
now- I mean, because Chris made

584
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
some- Oh! You know what I have

585
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
here? And this ties into what I'm talking

586
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
about. Uh, fuck. Where are they?

587
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Where are they? Where are they? Where do I put them?

588
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Uh...

589
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Damn! Wait. No, no, no.

590
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No, no, no.

591
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay, well, I can't find them. Whatever.

592
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The point is, Chris sent me

593
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
her, um,

594
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
custom-made cards

595
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
for Twilight Sparkle's secret

596
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
shipfic folder.

597
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Uh, when they have- She sent me

598
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the Arizona Slime

599
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
expansion pack. Did you

600
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
have to give Chris your address in order to achieve

601
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
this? Yes. Oh, okay.

602
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Whatever. Chris is not protective of

603
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
personal information. Who gives a shit?

604
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Fair enough. Fair enough. What's she gonna do?

605
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, I just mean she might leak it

606
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
because she's a bit of a dunce at these things.

607
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, because you're s- Why- Why?

608
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Why would she do that? Well, I'm not saying

609
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
intentionally, but she's so flipping with

610
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
her own personal information. That's true.

611
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay, whatever. Doesn't matter. Not important.

612
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's totally unimportant.

613
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Frankly, I'm a fender that you even brought it up.

614
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Indeed you are. Um, anyway,

615
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
uh, yeah, I fucking-

616
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm holding them- I was holding them in my

617
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
hands. Um, I don't know why-

618
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
where- I- they- I-

619
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay, I'm just gonna stop freaking out.

620
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, I used them as toilet paper because I was

621
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
running out. Oh, darn. Aw, shit.

622
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Aw, not again.

623
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Second time this week.

624
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Uh, where the fuck would

625
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
they be? Where the fuck would they be?

626
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Look, I'm with you, but do you need them

627
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
to make your current point, uh, at this jun-

628
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was gonna read off some of the text on them because they're really funny.

629
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh, yeah. Okay. There's one- Okay.

630
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She posted, like, screencaps of

631
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
all of them, uh, on Twitter,

632
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but there's one in there

633
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
that is not that she never posted,

634
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and I think it was, like, meant to be a secret.

635
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Or maybe, I don't know. But it seems

636
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
like it's, like, directly addressed

637
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
to me. And it's basically Chris

638
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Chance on it, too, wagging her fucking finger

639
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
out of the card, directly at the viewer,

640
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
being, like, be nice

641
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to your OCs. Don't fuck

642
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
with your OCs. It's cruel

643
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to be- to write bad things happening

644
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
to your OCs. Um, what- Chris wrote murder of his

645
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
OCs. They were horribly- Chris literally murdered

646
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
70,000 people in

647
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
New Los Angeles City. Oh, shit.

648
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But those were the OCs, so it's okay.

649
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Literal genocide.

650
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Uh, hey, we can pause for a moment.

651
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You can go look if you want. We can just cut that out.

652
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Do you want to?

653
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well, oh, I see him.

654
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, alright, there you go. See?

655
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Although, I mean, to be honest, I feel like I've already

656
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
explained everything I needed

657
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to about him. Um, well,

658
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
yeah, do you want to just get the exact text

659
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
of that? I'm curious to hear it.

660
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I want to hear it in Chris' own words. Sure.

661
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Uh, where is it? Where is it? There's Chris Hold- Chris

662
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Chance Ones, you're holding the Slime Podron,

663
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
uh, the- the

664
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
bicarbonate rain. Here we go. You got to give us

665
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
some pictures of this for the show notes, please.

666
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Sure. The- the card is called,

667
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and this is blasphemy,

668
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
uh, an endless war-free state.

669
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So just like all the politicians of our

670
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
day, they're all calling for an end to endless war.

671
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Bastards. Have they no shame?

672
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Uh, so this is a goal card.

673
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Do you- do you guys have any idea

674
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
how Twilight Sparkle's secret chip folder works,

675
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
by the way, because I don't? No. No, none.

676
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is- it's- well, I'll- I'll talk about it in a second.

677
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I saw that there was a Magic the Gathering

678
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
crossover with MLP the other day. Now that,

679
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I understand. Wait, like an official one?

680
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah, like actual magic cards

681
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
with like rarity the rare.

682
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
She's like a 2-2 monster unicorn

683
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
legendary. No, come on.

684
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Celestia or something. Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
No. That's just real.

686
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're lying. I'll find a picture.

687
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Stop lying to me. I'll find it.

688
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
All right. Well, um,

689
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
oh my god, IGN Magic the Gathering

690
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
reveals my little pony crossover set.

691
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This is vile. This is truly vile.

692
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There you go. All right, goal card.

693
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
An endless war-free state.

694
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Win this goal when

695
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
at least three pony cards

696
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
who have been given the villain keyword

697
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
by card effects are either cleared

698
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
of the villain keyword or discarded

699
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
in the same turn.

700
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Uh, and then there's a

701
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
parentheses 13,

702
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and I don't know where the 13 comes in.

703
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Quote,

704
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and so the slime co-dilemma

705
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and the endless war came to a close

706
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
in Dimension C197

707
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
on October 3rd,

708
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
2019.

709
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
When the moral being even the heavi-

710
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No, sorry. The moral being

711
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
even the heaviest of hatred can be quelled

712
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
when we come together towards a common goal.

713
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Also,

714
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
your OCs should be treated with kindness and respect.

715
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Do not abuse them

716
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
or each other.

717
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's on a chew.

718
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So, I got these in the mail

719
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and I thought, damn,

720
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
this makes me want to get the game

721
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and like play the game with these

722
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
cards in it.

723
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Sure.

724
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know. I think Twilight Sparkle's secret ship

725
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
of photos seems like a kind of funny game,

726
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I guess. I wasn't that interested.

727
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But with these, maybe I'm a little interested.

728
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But I went to go buy it

729
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and it turns out you can't.

730
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Literally,

731
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the company is just out of business.

732
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But you can kind of do it

733
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and like the way that

734
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
okay, you can still get the game

735
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but

736
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you have to do it in the same way that Chris

737
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
made these cards which is if you go

738
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
to the Twilight Sparkle

739
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
official site

740
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
they'll be like, hey guys, we're out of business

741
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but you can still

742
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
make the game the same way we did and they just redirect

743
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you to like a custom card printing

744
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
site and they're like, here's the files

745
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
just give them the files

746
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and like you can like have them make your own

747
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
set.

748
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's pretty cool, I guess. It's kind of cool.

749
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's kind of weird.

750
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Don't you think that's fucking weird? I think it's bizarre.

751
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It seems like they're like, even though our game

752
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
is technically dead, like we still

753
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and we can't sustain it anymore. We just want people

754
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
to be able to keep playing if they really want to.

755
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So here you go, folks. Here's the fucking

756
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess so.

757
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Personally, I don't understand why they would

758
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
like do that.

759
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Like, why declare yourself

760
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
generous.

761
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, but why declare yourself out of business

762
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
when you could just be like, every time

763
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
you tell someone go make it yourself

764
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
you could just take

765
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
an order for it and do it for them

766
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and like probably make a profit off of it.

767
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Maybe they are planning

768
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
a resurgence one day. They had, like everyone

769
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
was busy. They had to go make their bread

770
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
elsewhere but they're hoping to come back

771
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
one day and they want to just seed the

772
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
world with as many of these as possible in

773
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
the meantime to spark

774
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
interest. I don't know.

775
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I guess. Yeah, I mean,

776
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
maybe. I don't know. It's

777
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
weird. But

778
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
alright, I just want to say

779
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that, okay, these

780
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
cards explain

781
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
these cards explain that

782
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the bicarbonate

783
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
rainstorm did de-slime New

784
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Los Angeles City

785
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and put an end to the Endless War

786
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and that is true, however

787
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
only in the alpha

788
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
timeline and there are

789
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
beta timelines. They are doomed beta timelines

790
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
like in Homestuck but they do

791
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
exist and they shouldn't be

792
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
written off as irrelevant.

793
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, geez, you're really seeding

794
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
a lot of ground here. What makes this timeline

795
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the alpha timeline? What's to say that one isn't

796
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
doomed? Why is that one so

797
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
legit? What are you talking

798
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
about? The alpha timeline is

799
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
the alpha timeline and the others are offshoot beta timelines

800
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and beta timelines die.

801
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But how can you determine

802
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
between a beta and an alpha timeline

803
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
at any given time?

804
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't know.

805
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Noby's got all kinds of freaky

806
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
dimension eyes and he can see weird shit

807
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and he knows these things. I don't know.

808
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Look, I don't know. I can see

809
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
into C197. I'm just reporting

810
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
what's going on there, okay? I'm not

811
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
the scientist, right?

812
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm not the expert. I only report.

813
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Well, you know,

814
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
on this subject, there was one other thing

815
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
that we wanted to discuss last week or that

816
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I was going to bring up. We just forgot

817
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
or whatever. And it was that like, or rather

818
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I was going to bring up more. I think we talked

819
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
about it a little bit. It was that when you

820
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
finished your Kickstarter, you got your

821
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yang 12K

822
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
yearly earnings. Yeah, 12K got my UBI.

823
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
My own personal UBI.

824
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Upon seeing that, Chris just wanted

825
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that money despite it being

826
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
specifically for a business venture

827
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and it's just this

828
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
perception of Ben now has

829
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
that money. He could give that money

830
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
to me now. To be fair,

831
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
he could do that. He could. To be fair,

832
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
neither Chris nor MagiChan

833
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
has

834
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
mentioned that to me in a while now.

835
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So they might have dropped it. I'm not

836
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
sure. Although

837
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
who knows? Like, they could come back

838
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
at me at any time.

839
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It was mostly MagiChan.

840
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
They were

841
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
absolutely good cop, bad cop in me.

842
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
MagiChan was like the hard

843
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
ass, like, you better

844
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
pay what you owe criminal

845
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
scum. And Chris

846
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
acted as though that wasn't happening.

847
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I can't hold him back that long, Ben.

848
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, like, hey, listen,

849
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm not responsible for anything my partner

850
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
does, okay?

851
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And if you

852
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
really make him mad, he'll get Mewtwo on

853
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
your ass and you definitely don't want that.

854
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's gonna be way worse for you.

855
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You think MagiChan's mean?

856
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
He learned everything he knows about

857
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
being mean from Mewtwo, okay?

858
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
True.

859
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, um, hopefully we don't have to

860
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
take it to that level.

861
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I think there's something to be learned

862
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
about the nature of man in this little

863
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
exchange here. When money is there,

864
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
it just, everybody just wants it.

865
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If you want to want it.

866
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, well, um, too bad.

867
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Suckers.

868
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah, go make your own Kickstarter, folks.

869
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I guess that's all there is to it.

870
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh, um, actually, MagiChan

871
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
asked me, it's funny,

872
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
he asked me like, he said

873
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
like, hey, you know,

874
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
you don't have to pay me that 300 bucks

875
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
if you will make a Kickstarter

876
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
for my,

877
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
did I already talk about this?

878
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think you mentioned it, I believe it.

879
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If you make a Kickstarter with a goal of

880
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
$5,000, I'll waive that

881
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
$300 you quote-unquote owe me

882
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
if you run my campaign for me.

883
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's very silly.

884
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I did not listen last week's episode.

885
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Why are you quote-unquote

886
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
owing money to them?

887
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I mean,

888
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
good question.

889
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That's a great question.

890
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay, it's a little unclear

891
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
of whether the reason is

892
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
because I

893
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
used Chris's

894
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
characters in the story

895
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
because I

896
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
used the comic

897
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
to attract attention

898
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
while running a Kickstarter

899
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
which made money,

900
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
maybe?

901
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Or...

902
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But the comic has nothing to do

903
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
with the Kickstarter, right?

904
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
True, well observed.

905
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Or the other possible reason might be

906
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
because Chris used my characters

907
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
on her cards

908
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and therefore I ought to pay

909
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
to have them made.

910
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
These are like three different reasons

911
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
that are sort of kind of interchangeably given.

912
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The last one sounds like Chris should

913
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
be paying you

914
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
to use that.

915
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So the Kickstarter had nothing

916
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to do with the comic in which

917
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you used Chris's...

918
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Technically, the slime-oid stuff at the end

919
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
was related, I suppose.

920
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, I mean...

921
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm still angry

922
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
with you about that.

923
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
With me?

924
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, it's okay because Tom and Hippo

925
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
both saved it.

926
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay, good.

927
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I haven't been on Twitter in a while, so...

928
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

929
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
No, it was great.

930
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm so glad.

931
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't regret anything because it worked out so good.

932
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah, Hippo drew Red Man

933
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
saving it at the last minute.

934
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And then Tom made a full 3D animation

935
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
of Izumi saving it at the last minute.

936
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh, that's nice.

937
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, we gotta go look at it.

938
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
We talked about extensive the last time.

939
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah, we won't dwell on it because we talked about it last time,

940
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but you should check it out. They're both really good.

941
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't know if these are two separate timelines.

942
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I kind of wonder if maybe...

943
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because the Izumi thing happened,

944
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I kind of wonder if maybe

945
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
they didn't just happen in order.

946
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Like, maybe Izumi

947
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
saved it from the pit.

948
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And then, because Hippo then drew

949
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
a page of N7

950
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
showing up to fight Izumi.

951
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So I wonder if maybe just in the battle,

952
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
like,

953
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Uwupadi just accidentally fell back

954
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
into the vet anyway.

955
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Like, the two of them were too busy fighting,

956
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
so it took Red Man to come in.

957
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Where did I go wrong?

958
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I've hit walk bottom.

959
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And maybe then just Red Man came in

960
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and scooped it out. I don't know.

961
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
My hypothesis is that these are both the same timeline.

962
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You keep seem to be implying

963
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
that that was Red Man who saved him.

964
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That wasn't Red Man. That was Suzy,

965
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the slime girl O.C. of Gib.

966
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Was it?

967
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, go look at it again.

968
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's clearly like a girl. It's not Red Man.

969
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
At least, I think.

970
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know, we talked about this too much last time.

971
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Hold on, hold on. Now, this is interesting.

972
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Because

973
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
it was a little pinkish, wasn't it?

974
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes, of course.

975
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Wait a minute. Okay.

976
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay.

977
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I gots to make sure.

978
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay, cut all this out.

979
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Cut all this out. Just all of it.

980
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's all bullshit. It's all bullshit.

981
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
All of the podcasts, like making 0 minutes,

982
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
0 seconds.

983
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Alright.

984
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
See what I'm saying? Look at those hands.

985
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Those pink hands.

986
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay. You know?

987
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You got a point?

988
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't know.

989
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Look at the top of its head.

990
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It looks like a smooth circle to me.

991
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I mean, that could just be a curve

992
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
at the top of Suzy's

993
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
like, I think her name is Suzy.

994
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That could be fucking wrong.

995
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Her hair, head thing.

996
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
No, okay.

997
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Right, though. Well, Red Man was wearing a suit.

998
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But still, still, I believe.

999
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah, I assumed it was Red Noir

1000
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
suit

1001
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
version, Red Man.

1002
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I see what you mean.

1003
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Like, the one thing that I think is

1004
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
supports the Suzy hypothesis

1005
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
is the color.

1006
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Because it does seem a little pinker

1007
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
than I'm used to seeing Red Man.

1008
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But the top of the head

1009
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
to me looks like Red Man's head.

1010
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Please edit it.

1011
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Look at the top of his head.

1012
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I mean, in this moment.

1013
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What is that?

1014
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, you wouldn't know, Ben.

1015
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I don't, so I guess you're right.

1016
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay, well, viewers,

1017
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
let us know in the comments

1018
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
what do you think. Do you support

1019
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
the Suzy hypothesis or the Red Man hypothesis?

1020
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I need, like, a list

1021
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
of Hippo's characters

1022
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and just, like, put them

1023
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
next to that. Either way,

1024
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Hippo has made, like, big, like,

1025
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
collection images, like, all his male characters

1026
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and all his female characters.

1027
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Either way, I still support the unrelated

1028
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
hypothesis that both Rescue,

1029
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
both Tom's Rescue and Hippo's Rescue

1030
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
took place in the same timeline,

1031
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
just one immediately after the other.

1032
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Um, but...

1033
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There are now two slimes instead of one.

1034
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I can't prove it.

1035
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But I can't prove it.

1036
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, because Chris said that if

1037
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Uwupati survived, it would be bad

1038
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
for everyone. So I'm thinking that the one

1039
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
in which Uwupati survived is the Beta timeline,

1040
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
which the comic is now taking place in,

1041
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
which has a frame and Nobi

1042
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
are discussing the timelines, and they have

1043
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
to come up with a plan to get back to the Alpha timeline

1044
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
before the universe dissolves, right?

1045
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because in the Alpha timeline,

1046
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
all the slime was destroyed.

1047
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So they got to get back to the Alpha timeline,

1048
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
but they got to do something about the slimes

1049
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
because they don't want to go back and live in the Alpha timeline

1050
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
if there's no slime. They got to find a way to bring

1051
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
the slime with them. That's the plan.

1052
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What was this pink OC?

1053
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Huh?

1054
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What? What? What?

1055
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Look at the gross disgusting. Another show notes.

1056
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, yeah, that's some...

1057
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Let's not go down this rabbit hole. Look at this image.

1058
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Now look at this image. Very cool image.

1059
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm not going down any rabbit hole.

1060
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1061
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I've never gone down a rabbit hole in my entire life.

1062
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Hey, Zenhuxible says he wants to join.

1063
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You want to just hop over to the other chat

1064
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and let him in?

1065
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay. I'm scared.

1066
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The answer is yes. Okay, hang on.

1067
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I've never been on the same podcast as a guest

1068
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
as well, so I don't know. I'm scared.

1069
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Whatever?

1070
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I always purposely miss those episodes

1071
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
so that the guest can have room to...

1072
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Purposely?

1073
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, we're low on people anyway, so...

1074
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm sick of you losers.

1075
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let's get some fresh blood in here.

1076
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Done. How's it going, dog?

1077
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What's up? Hello.

1078
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I've been in a particularly

1079
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
weird situation lately because

1080
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I work on weekends, right?

1081
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm in college right now. I'm in my senior year

1082
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
working on my animation thesis.

1083
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's been a lot of fun,

1084
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
but the other problem is

1085
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I just haven't been having a lot of time

1086
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
working on it because I've

1087
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
been working on the weekends.

1088
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So I have two days free to work on it

1089
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and then I have class the other three days.

1090
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So what I'm thinking, because I've saved

1091
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
a lot of money up because I also do commissions

1092
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and whatnot, so I'm thinking I'm just going to quit the job

1093
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
because I want to...

1094
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
This is what I'm going to be presenting to

1095
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
my employers when I leave college.

1096
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So I want it to be the best thing

1097
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that showcases what I can do as an animator.

1098
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So I want to make the best product that I can.

1099
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I've got to leave the job.

1100
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I've got to come right back.

1101
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Fair enough.

1102
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
This isn't really a dilemma that's in my mind.

1103
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's just like, I'm explaining

1104
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
where I am mentally right now.

1105
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I was actually supposed to go into work today

1106
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and I was like, you know what? No.

1107
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm not going to do that.

1108
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So did you just quit or something just now?

1109
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yeah, I just quit.

1110
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
All right, man. Deb.

1111
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Deb.

1112
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Truly we live in a post job society.

1113
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I have other money making

1114
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
sources of commissions.

1115
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Exactly.

1116
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's not like no liquid is coming in,

1117
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
but you know,

1118
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that floor is coming under me.

1119
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Speaking of liquid,

1120
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
are we hanging out on Halloween?

1121
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, absolutely.

1122
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Nice.

1123
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It sounds like fun.

1124
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I saw Munchie and I was like, hey.

1125
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Maybe move to the real world for once in your life, Mage.

1126
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
They tell me.

1127
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Munchie and Kazzy tell me

1128
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
they've seen you once or twice around

1129
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and I'm like, damn.

1130
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I can't believe all these,

1131
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
all my separate cinematic universes

1132
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
are converging into one.

1133
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's a really weird thing because the thing is,

1134
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm a real homebody.

1135
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So when I'm not at school,

1136
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm just animating.

1137
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Or watching Bojack Horseman,

1138
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
which is what I was doing before I came in here.

1139
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah,

1140
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the newest season came out yesterday.

1141
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Just in case you wanted to be extra set.

1142
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Right, exactly.

1143
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No, the new season came out yesterday.

1144
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't think

1145
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I ever was up to...

1146
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I think I watched the first season.

1147
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It was good though.

1148
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think I watched four seasons.

1149
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay, so I missed one season

1150
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and I'm missing this one.

1151
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No, I just

1152
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I binge all my shows.

1153
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
If you do the same.

1154
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Release the whole episode.

1155
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I did something a little shameful.

1156
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We were talking about

1157
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Twin Perfect last week.

1158
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Indeed.

1159
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
They put out that four hour video about Twin Peace.

1160
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Oh my god, I forgot about that.

1161
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You gotta mention that.

1162
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't know if I'm even apologizing.

1163
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I feel like this is bad,

1164
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
but I don't think I want to apologize for it.

1165
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I haven't seen the new Twin Peaks.

1166
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I watched the video.

1167
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't care that it spoiled everything.

1168
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh my god, this is a four hour video?

1169
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's four and a half hours.

1170
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This is incredibly fortuitous.

1171
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Last episode I was bitching and fetching about

1172
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Where's Twin Perfect?

1173
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I brought up Twin Perfect.

1174
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Did you?

1175
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I think I brought up the song

1176
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
for some reason.

1177
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't know, whatever.

1178
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It doesn't matter who brought it up.

1179
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I believe you, Ben.

1180
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I expressed some sentiment.

1181
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Where's Twin Perfect?

1182
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's been so long.

1183
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It had been over a year since their last video.

1184
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
They just released it.

1185
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I was like, what are they doing?

1186
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
They're probably fucking around.

1187
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The biggest fucking video I've ever seen since that one.

1188
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Were we talking about cancel culture?

1189
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Or I think I wanted to talk about that thing

1190
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
with Tom.

1191
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Tom Hewlett and the whole blaming him.

1192
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm sorry.

1193
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm still hung up on how you said Kovetching.

1194
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Is that like Northern European slang or something?

1195
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's like Jewish.

1196
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I think that's Yiddish or something.

1197
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I probably got that from Seinfeld in my youth.

1198
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This is my estimation.

1199
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I've been watching some hot YouTube one piece.

1200
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't know why I said one piece.

1201
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Seinfeld's Kovetching.

1202
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's basically the Seinfeld of Japan.

1203
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I don't know why I said one piece.

1204
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't know why I said one piece.

1205
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's basically the Seinfeld of Japan.

1206
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Two and one piece.

1207
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
True.

1208
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Lucy, stop eating all the meat.

1209
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Sanji, fuck you.

1210
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I just want to sleep in lift weights.

1211
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1212
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Stop just getting upset.

1213
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Okay, so Twin Perfect.

1214
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The biggest video I've ever seen in my fucking life.

1215
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's so huge.

1216
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Ben watched it. Cool.

1217
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I recently watched Twin Peaks Season 1 and 2.

1218
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I was like, okay.

1219
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I did a big glowing tweet of this.

1220
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I can't believe these guys proved me so fucking stupid and wrong.

1221
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I got to go watch the new season

1222
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
before I watch their video,

1223
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
which I'm dying to do.

1224
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I got to Episode 6,

1225
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and it took too much brain power.

1226
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So I had to slow down and relax.

1227
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Here's the thing.

1228
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I didn't watch the new season.

1229
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
A couple of years ago,

1230
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I did watch Twin Peaks, the original.

1231
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I liked it.

1232
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It was cool.

1233
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm a big fan.

1234
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You know, I know the new season's out.

1235
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I hadn't seen it.

1236
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I don't know when or if I was going to make time to see it.

1237
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But I did see the Twin Perfect

1238
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
review or analysis was out.

1239
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And I was like, I really want to see that.

1240
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I want to see that more than I care.

1241
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
More than I want to see the new season.

1242
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So I'm just going to watch it.

1243
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And you know what?

1244
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I really don't.

1245
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I guess I'm just one of these people that spoilers don't matter.

1246
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I don't feel like I'll get less out of it

1247
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
if I ever do decide to watch the new Twin Peaks.

1248
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That weighed on me.

1249
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That particular question

1250
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
weighed on me heavily.

1251
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The funny thing is,

1252
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I got into Twin Perfect from the start.

1253
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
They're some of my favorite YouTubers with their shit.

1254
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The real Silent Hill experience, whatever.

1255
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I got into Silent Hill.

1256
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You showed them to me a long time ago.

1257
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah, exactly.

1258
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Their videos were the exhaustive,

1259
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
incredibly in-depth reviews

1260
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
of every detail of every Silent Hill game.

1261
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah, it spoiled everything.

1262
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
But you know what I did then?

1263
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I went and I played the games and I fucking love them.

1264
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't give a shit about Silent Hill.

1265
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I have no desire to ever play a Silent Hill game.

1266
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But I love those Silent Hill reviews.

1267
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
They are good.

1268
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So was this a good video?

1269
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Did you enjoy it?

1270
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes, I did.

1271
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It is very much...

1272
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Twin Perfect have this mindset.

1273
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Twin Perfect really believe

1274
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
that they can solve media.

1275
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
They can find the hidden,

1276
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
the meaning of it.

1277
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Which is very annoying and objectively wrong.

1278
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But it's still a funny exercise

1279
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
to watch some of the...

1280
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
That is their approach, though.

1281
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It is a fun exercise to watch them go through.

1282
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And they make pretty good...

1283
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Not fungo,

1284
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
he lays out a pretty compelling case

1285
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
for his interpretation

1286
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
of what it all means.

1287
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's good stuff, man.

1288
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That is a funny approach.

1289
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't think I would ever...

1290
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I suppose if someone

1291
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
proposes to me an interpretation of a show

1292
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I really like for some reason,

1293
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and I find their view of it to be

1294
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
dumb,

1295
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
then I could say that that's dumb

1296
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
because I really...

1297
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It depends.

1298
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What if they are picking up a small detail

1299
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
that is there,

1300
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
as opposed to

1301
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
getting something wrong

1302
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
that's clearly wrong.

1303
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Those are two very different ways

1304
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
to view any piece of media.

1305
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
One, you can counteract.

1306
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The other is...

1307
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I feel like

1308
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
it's dumb to say

1309
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
that this...

1310
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
No matter how compelling

1311
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
your reading of a story is,

1312
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I think that the one that Rossiter lays out

1313
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
in the Twin Peaks

1314
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
video is pretty compelling,

1315
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
but no matter how good it is,

1316
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I think it's really stupid to be like,

1317
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
okay, this is the right one.

1318
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I feel sort of implicit in the way

1319
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
he lays it out is this idea that

1320
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
we found the right one,

1321
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
there is no other one.

1322
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That does seem to be the difference.

1323
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Come on.

1324
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's funny.

1325
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He's got a bit of an ego which I like

1326
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and appreciate.

1327
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's not about ego, I just think his critical approach

1328
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
is very frustrating.

1329
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
All his videos, they're all like

1330
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
you're wrong about Man of Steel,

1331
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
you're wrong about

1332
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Justice League or whatever the fuck it is.

1333
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't mind the ego or the attitude,

1334
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
but

1335
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I just like to be right and I respect

1336
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
people who are correct.

1337
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You know what I mean?

1338
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Indeed, I do. By the way,

1339
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I got into a little bit on the point

1340
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
of watching it first or whatever.

1341
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
When I put out my glowing tweet about

1342
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I was just shit talking to these boys.

1343
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I was proved so, so foolish.

1344
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I am ashamed as a content creator.

1345
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Wait, who are you talking shit about?

1346
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
These people produce actual works of quality.

1347
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Who are you talking about?

1348
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
On the last PCP episode,

1349
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I was saying, where is Twin Perfect?

1350
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What have they been doing, man?

1351
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And then they immediately

1352
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
afterward come out with this.

1353
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I hadn't watched the video,

1354
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
but I know the effort that Twin Perfect,

1355
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that Rossiter puts into these videos.

1356
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I felt assured this would not be

1357
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
any... It's not as produced as

1358
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
the Silent Hill ones,

1359
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
but like... Really? Okay.

1360
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I mean, it doesn't have any songs

1361
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
in it or anything like that.

1362
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Those were highlights.

1363
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, okay, fair enough.

1364
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But just the little editing they do.

1365
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
For everyone who thinks that me and Major

1366
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
are contributing a little too much in this podcast,

1367
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm sorry.

1368
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Apologize.

1369
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I gotta know my place here.

1370
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah.

1371
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I would contribute, but I don't know

1372
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
what you're talking about.

1373
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I haven't seen Twin Peaks or anything,

1374
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
so I have nothing to say on this topic.

1375
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Fair enough.

1376
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Some of the shit from the footage

1377
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
of the new season seems pretty fucking weird.

1378
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Let me see.

1379
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's hard to describe in any kind of detail

1380
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
the shit you see,

1381
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
but it's just...

1382
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It really is me sitting there

1383
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
on screen and I'm like,

1384
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
what did he mean by this?

1385
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
What did he mean by this?

1386
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, I guess.

1387
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It does feel, at this particular moment,

1388
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
six episodes into this 18 episode

1389
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Season 3.

1390
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It feels too deep for me,

1391
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
but I'm gonna work my way back.

1392
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Wait, was there a reboot of Twin Peaks?

1393
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Not a reboot, they just made a new season

1394
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that takes place like 25 years in the future.

1395
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You kidding?

1396
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah, it's just straight up the same story.

1397
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I've heard nothing about this.

1398
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Like last year, or I think?

1399
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I don't know.

1400
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I gotta say, it was 2017, I think,

1401
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
but the biggest thing that makes me sad

1402
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
is they were not able to get,

1403
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
because he retired from acting,

1404
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
the original sheriff from the old two.

1405
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Him and Coop were buddies,

1406
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
they were a team,

1407
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and what they have now is

1408
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
they've got an actor who's playing his brother

1409
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
also aged up,

1410
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
and that character is in rehab

1411
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
or he's off doing something else.

1412
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't know, it's unfortunate.

1413
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I miss that guy, but he's a retired actor.

1414
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
But they got the log lady,

1415
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
they got Coop, obviously,

1416
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
they got the giant who I

1417
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
suspected would be dead by this point,

1418
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
but thank god he's not.

1419
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
He looks like the kind of guy

1420
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
who's got some kind of congenital thing

1421
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
that'll kill him before 40.

1422
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Just like Tom, just like Tom.

1423
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Just like Tom.

1424
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Rip.

1425
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I think Tom was saying

1426
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
he might have some weird, minor form

1427
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
of gigantism of some degree

1428
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
that's why he's got his finest shoe.

1429
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
He says that because he's tall,

1430
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
but he's not like freaky tall.

1431
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
What if his parents were like four feet tall

1432
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and Tom is like six, five, whatever.

1433
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Although it is true that I think

1434
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
that height does inversely correlate

1435
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
with life expectancy,

1436
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
like to a small degree.

1437
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh no.

1438
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
That's why little dogs

1439
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
live really long and big dogs live not at all.

1440
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, it's something I don't know

1441
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
what it is, but like,

1442
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
yeah, you're fucked.

1443
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Manlet master race

1444
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
rise up.

1445
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah, you fucking

1446
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
manlets are going to have a real hard time

1447
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
rise enough if you know what I mean.

1448
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I've been seeing like this weird

1449
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't know like how big of a phenomenon

1450
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
it is. It might not even be a phenomenon,

1451
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
just like business practices, but like

1452
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
people who make quote unquote like high media

1453
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
doing like low media stuff like

1454
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Francis Ford Coppola

1455
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
he was like, you know,

1456
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
shitting on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whatever.

1457
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I could not give less of a shit about that.

1458
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But like people were like, dude, you directed

1459
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Jack, like that movie with

1460
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Robin Williams. That was like a fucking

1461
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
joke. And I was like, huh.

1462
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh yeah. I wonder who else is like that.

1463
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And David Lynch, he was actually a voice

1464
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
actor in the Cleveland show by South

1465
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
McFarland.

1466
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That doesn't surprise me

1467
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
too much. I feel like he does that kind

1468
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
of thing. He'll just like show up on

1469
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
somebody's fucking show or whatever.

1470
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Right. It's like a funny little guest

1471
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
appearance. Twin Peaks can be

1472
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
very non pretentious at times.

1473
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It's very like silly. Okay, but like this is the

1474
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
guy who made Eraserhead, you know.

1475
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I've actually never seen Eraserhead, but

1476
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
yeah, it's pretty good.

1477
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Eraserhead, I know, is from

1478
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
in academia.

1479
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
My favorite piece of

1480
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
my favorite David Lynch piece of

1481
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
media is

1482
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
David Lynch cooks quinoa.

1483
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Oh yeah. Is that a thing?

1484
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, it's a

1485
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
oh god, I think it's like 20

1486
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
minutes or something, but it's like

1487
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
some guy just goes to David Lynch's

1488
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
house and films him in his kitchen

1489
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and David Lynch cooks

1490
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
himself dinner and he cooks

1491
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
some quinoa and broccoli and he tells

1492
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
him his recipe. Okay. And then he goes

1493
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
out on the porch and smokes a cigarette

1494
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and while he's smoking, he like

1495
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
tells a little story about

1496
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
like riding the train through Eastern

1497
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Europe and like buying some

1498
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
weird soda.

1499
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Eastern Europe.

1500
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And then he like

1501
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
you go slobby or something and then he

1502
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
like goes back to finish his quinoa

1503
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and like that's it.

1504
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But it's really funny because like

1505
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
the video, it's like it's edited

1506
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
to be in black, like it's in black and

1507
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
white. I've got it right here.

1508
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Very dramatic lighting and like

1509
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
he'll make like a little hand gesture

1510
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and whoever edited it will add in like

1511
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
a super dramatic sound effect like boom

1512
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
like to go along with the story.

1513
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's wicked fucking good.

1514
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's a really good video. Is this

1515
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
available on YouTube or something?

1516
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, it's in the chat there.

1517
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Beautiful. Yeah, I was right.

1518
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I think I tried to find this before but I couldn't

1519
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
but I'm gonna go watch it because

1520
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I've always wanted to. Talked about it before.

1521
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That's the weirdest. I like that.

1522
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And which chat did you link?

1523
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It's in general. It's gross disgusting and also

1524
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
in the general chat in our cinematic universe one.

1525
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Okay. That's cute.

1526
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah, I like when like these

1527
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
creatives make like appear

1528
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
into their lives, you know.

1529
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Of course.

1530
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
There was that like

1531
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Miyazaki like workflow documentary.

1532
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You remember that one?

1533
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Is that the one workflow documentary?

1534
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Is that the one where he says that anime was a mistake?

1535
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
No, it might have been.

1536
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I never watched the whole thing. He actually had a new

1537
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
documentary come out like last year.

1538
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I didn't get to watching it. I don't know why.

1539
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I just kept on putting it off.

1540
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
He said something like that.

1541
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
That got translated in that way.

1542
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm not even gonna touch it because like I know

1543
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm gonna get it wrong and then people are gonna give me shit for it.

1544
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But like, yeah, you know,

1545
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
it's the one where it's like he's just like showing

1546
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
how he makes ramen and it's not even like spectacular

1547
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
or anything, but it's like, oh,

1548
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
that's something I know now.

1549
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Hey, by the way, on your

1550
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
subject of Coppola

1551
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and whatnot, talking a little bit of smack

1552
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
on the Marvel films and whatnot,

1553
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I just want to put forward the possibility that

1554
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
they would probably separate

1555
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
their works that they've done

1556
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
of ones that they would consider

1557
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
cinematic quality or like true

1558
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
cinema versus like Jack, which maybe

1559
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
they themselves would say, oh yeah, that was just

1560
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
some trash I made for money.

1561
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So they would inflate the two.

1562
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Definitely, yeah, that's definitely the distinction

1563
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
they'd probably make.

1564
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Unless they're fucking loony.

1565
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Which they might be.

1566
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I don't know, maybe Jack is great though.

1567
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I haven't seen it.

1568
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Didn't Spielberg direct the North Pole

1569
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
or the Polar Express or whatever?

1570
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
That was probably

1571
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
the Norm of the North.

1572
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yes, with Tom Hanks.

1573
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Was that like the animated one

1574
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
with the varying James 3D X?

1575
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah, the weird CG Tom Hanks one.

1576
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Wait, that was Polar Express?

1577
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I think so. Oh god.

1578
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
No, I remember that coming

1579
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
on like ABC, like every

1580
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Christmas season.

1581
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I don't even remember watching the whole thing.

1582
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
The Polar Express is a beloved, whatever man,

1583
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm sure everyone says, but the Polar Express,

1584
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
beloved children's story, I liked in school,

1585
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
whatever, it's fine, it's cool, who cares.

1586
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
But then they add like, when they make the movie,

1587
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
they have to add like action scenes

1588
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
of the new, like,

1589
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
worthless Tom Hanks character.

1590
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
They gotta add like a subplot

1591
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
where he wins his father's respect or something.

1592
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You gotta movie-ify it.

1593
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It can't just be boy goes to the North Pole,

1594
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
which should be like a 15-minute film or whatever,

1595
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
which is, but they had to make it

1596
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
like an hour long, so I guess that's why they pat it out.

1597
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It's frankly amazing.

1598
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Have you guys seen Dumbo, the movie, the remake?

1599
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The new one? No.

1600
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I have heard all about it.

1601
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I have heard all about it. Why?

1602
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It just reminded me of how you said,

1603
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
you can't just be the story, they have to add shit in.

1604
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And that's basically it.

1605
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That's my point, but they have to add shit in.

1606
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I heard that they don't even have the crows.

1607
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, they don't.

1608
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah, they're middle-aged.

1609
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm sure they'd want to whitewash that way.

1610
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Whitewash it, know what I'm saying?

1611
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
What the fuck?

1612
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
They have a small girl that wishes to become a scientist.

1613
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Nice.

1614
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You know, I don't remember Dumbo at all.

1615
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Were the crows actually like an important narrative element to the story?

1616
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah, they sing the fucking elephant,

1617
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I've seen an elephant fly song.

1618
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
They give him the magic feather that makes him think he can fly.

1619
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Now the girl gives him the magic feather.

1620
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Terrible.

1621
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's all about the girl now.

1622
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
These fucking SJWs, man,

1623
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
sticking girls in our stories about

1624
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
proud, big-tow elephant boys.

1625
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I wouldn't even mind it so much,

1626
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
but she gets so much attention

1627
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
for no pay-off.

1628
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
She's been right from the moment the movie started,

1629
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and she goes through no arc or anything.

1630
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
She's always been right, she always knew what to do.

1631
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
She's there.

1632
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Just like Applejack, I didn't learn anything.

1633
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But they also, I don't want to shit on a kid,

1634
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
but the way she delivered the light,

1635
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
she was just so bad.

1636
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I didn't like her actor.

1637
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
If you got a bad child actor, it's the director's fault.

1638
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And she has a little brother,

1639
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and she has a little brother,

1640
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and he has even less purpose.

1641
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
She's at least there to be like the play device, basically,

1642
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
but the little brother just exists.

1643
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Why even have a little brother at that point, honestly?

1644
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I hear you loud and clear, Mage.

1645
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
New thing bad, old thing good.

1646
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
No, no, no.

1647
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I'm just complaining that the little brother doesn't have a brother.

1648
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Dude, we have to go back.

1649
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
We have to make America great again.

1650
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Bring back the original Dumbo.

1651
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I just didn't like the child, the children.

1652
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I feel you.

1653
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It seems like perfectly reasonable.

1654
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Just talking about this stuff from a more holistic standpoint,

1655
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I was actually going to bring up the reason

1656
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
as to why Disney is remaking all these movies.

1657
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And I thought, initially, it was because they...

1658
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's got to be money, right?

1659
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I thought, and this is the viewpoint

1660
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
that a lot of people were bringing up.

1661
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
They thought that they were doing it to renew the copyright,

1662
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
so it wouldn't enter public domain.

1663
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
But apparently, that's not true.

1664
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I'm researching it right now,

1665
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
and apparently, that's not the case.

1666
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Doesn't copyright last like 80 billion fucking years now?

1667
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
No, it's like...

1668
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It lasts until the creator is dead,

1669
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
plus another two centuries or some stupid crap.

1670
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's something like almost 100 years for some.

1671
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Great.

1672
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, love it.

1673
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So I guess it is just straightforward.

1674
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's just about the money.

1675
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Just rehashing these IPs.

1676
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Epic.

1677
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like, I don't know, 5, 10 deep into these movies,

1678
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
they would have stopped if these weren't successful.

1679
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Everybody hates them,

1680
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
but they make so much fucking money.

1681
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Because it's Disney? I don't know.

1682
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's just Disney again.

1683
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Look, here's the thing.

1684
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What I saw of the Lion King,

1685
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I hated it so much that, like...

1686
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I have not heard anyone say anything good

1687
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
about the Lion King Remake.

1688
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm not even going to pirate it,

1689
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
because I don't want to see any of it.

1690
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It looked terrible. Yeah, me neither.

1691
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It's like, I don't even...

1692
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Why translate it to this medium?

1693
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Like, with this weird CG crap

1694
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
where it's talking like the Lion Turtle

1695
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
from a fucking Avatar The Last Airbender, you know?

1696
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Like, that's how all the characters were talking.

1697
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It's like, oh, that just looks so weird in CG.

1698
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I heard they brought James Earl Jones back

1699
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
to play Mufasa again,

1700
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
but he's got to be old as shit.

1701
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
He's not going to sound like...

1702
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I don't know. You know, whatever.

1703
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You never stop sounding like James Earl Jones.

1704
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I suppose. But you can sound...

1705
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Ooh, it's so sad when, like, they bring back

1706
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
guys who are, like, they're playing the same character.

1707
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
They're not supposed to have aged,

1708
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
but we can see they've aged a lot.

1709
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, like Jacques. Like Jacques the bird.

1710
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Like Jacques the bird, Ben.

1711
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yes, and John Trun's hit new video.

1712
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I have not seen the new video, but I saw you

1713
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
in Hippo speculating on whether Jacques

1714
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
is getting old. I haven't seen that one.

1715
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
This was fascinating. We...

1716
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yes, so John Trun made a new video.

1717
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It was whatever, selling his merch.

1718
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
You know, it's funny.

1719
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Just some N.U. John dog shit?

1720
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Basically, but the funny thing is

1721
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
we call it N.U.

1722
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
This is a fascinating concept, actually.

1723
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So, like, for the last many, many years,

1724
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
at this point, probably most

1725
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
of John's, like, YouTube career or whatever,

1726
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
probably the vast majority of it,

1727
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
John has not used Jacques for anything.

1728
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And that's because working with Jacques was, like,

1729
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
hard and he, you know, whatever.

1730
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I get work with animals, especially a bird,

1731
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
probably challenging and hard. I get that.

1732
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Nonetheless, this toy, as, like,

1733
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
a big feature on the toy,

1734
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
has Jacques on his shoulder

1735
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
in the toy that's being sold of John.

1736
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So it's, like, I don't know.

1737
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I feel some kind of way about

1738
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
we're remembering

1739
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
the good old days of, like, the classic stuff

1740
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
that we love John for the most,

1741
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
but he doesn't do this anymore. Like, none of his new content

1742
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
is of this style, despite us, like,

1743
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
we're paying him

1744
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
for the toy of how he used to be,

1745
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
but he doesn't do it anymore. So, like, why would we support?

1746
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Like, I don't even dislike his character.

1747
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Oh, that seems like the whole

1748
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
John experience in microcosm.

1749
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Like, it's just, I feel like

1750
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
John today only exists

1751
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
off of, like, momentum from, like,

1752
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
classic John that everyone was so excited about.

1753
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You know, the weird thing about that, Ben?

1754
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And now when you see John, it's like, oh, that kind of

1755
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
that kind of tickles that part

1756
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
of my brain that used to get excited about

1757
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
John back then. That's kind of true.

1758
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It sort of looks like him. Yes.

1759
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
The weird thing is just the weird thing.

1760
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The weird thing is just how unbelievably

1761
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
successful all of John's content is,

1762
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
despite what I would consider

1763
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
a pretty serious loss of soul.

1764
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They're so popular.

1765
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Like, 10 million views

1766
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
per video, which he does every, like, month or two.

1767
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
No, people love the spectacle, man.

1768
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That's all there is to it, you know?

1769
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Like, for some of his jokes,

1770
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it's literally just like,

1771
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I spent $1,000 on this

1772
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
prop. Bam! I just destroyed it.

1773
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Ha, ha, ha.

1774
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I don't think there even is that much spectacle.

1775
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I don't know. I don't feel like when a new

1776
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
John drops, it's like a fucking extravaganza.

1777
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's just, I've only seen

1778
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
a few of the newer ones, but they just seem

1779
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
like the same old shit. Like, half of them,

1780
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
he's literally just sitting on a couch.

1781
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You know, honestly, I want to give credit to John.

1782
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I don't even really dislike his new videos.

1783
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I've watched some of the new ones, and I have enjoyed them

1784
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
because there's a lot of, like,

1785
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
he does, like, practical effects.

1786
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
To quote Mr. Plinkett,

1787
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I'd rather see them than blood in my

1788
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
stool, but...

1789
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, I, true.

1790
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But, like, look, I, I, yeah, I, I love the guy

1791
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
because, like, he would make video game things

1792
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
that were really funny. I could, like, relate to it as an epic

1793
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
game or whatnot. That's fine. That identity

1794
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
is established for the guy. Now he just

1795
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
makes pretty much more straightforward,

1796
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
absurdist comedy or whatever. But he

1797
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
re, you can really tell.

1798
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
He is passionate about it, and he works

1799
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
hard, and he has vision.

1800
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Even when I didn't like the videos, like, at all,

1801
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and I, we were all like, oh, why is he in this weird

1802
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
set? Feels a little more natural now.

1803
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I, I really do respect

1804
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
his work ethic and his, like,

1805
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
dedication to the craft. Like, nobody

1806
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
is putting as much work or effort

1807
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
into his videos as John.

1808
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So just on that front, I, I am impressed.

1809
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You know, you know, it's, it's the funniest thing.

1810
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
What do you mean he's putting work into them?

1811
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I mean, he's getting practical effects.

1812
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
He's getting actors. He's getting, like,

1813
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
skits that he's scripting out. He's

1814
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
going to live action places in the real

1815
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
world. Wait, did, did, did not think

1816
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
he's putting work into them.

1817
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I don't know. I guess that's not your point, Ben.

1818
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's something else. I've seen a couple, and I,

1819
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I wasn't, like, very impressed.

1820
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I mean, he's putting work into them, regardless.

1821
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Like, maybe the, maybe it's like, maybe

1822
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I haven't seen the right ones.

1823
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Like, the direction might be misplaced, but, like,

1824
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
the work is definitely there.

1825
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
They're, like, he did a video

1826
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
for, I forget what it is. Let me watch this

1827
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
jock exposed. Okay, fine.

1828
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Well, this one isn't particularly, it's

1829
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
two minutes long. I want to watch it too.

1830
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Um, it's horseshit. Yeah.

1831
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
One second and then it's horseshit.

1832
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Whatever, man.

1833
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
No, but there's nothing good, nothing good

1834
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
about this. Okay. In one of the videos, I

1835
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
forget what it is. Oh, it was the goop

1836
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
one. It was the one he did for goop. At the

1837
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
end, he does this whole thing where he goes

1838
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
into, like, is that recent? Yes, that was

1839
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
the last, like, couple of months or something. Yeah.

1840
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Oh, found it. Okay, goop. Okay, there you go.

1841
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Like, skip to the end. He does a thing where

1842
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
he, they've, like, produced an actual,

1843
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
excuse me, fucking

1844
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
a thing. He is literally

1845
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
being a snake oil salesman.

1846
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Funny. That's a funny joke. He's being a snake

1847
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
oil salesman. They set up in real life

1848
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
across the street from an actual

1849
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
practical goop store that he's

1850
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
mocking. Oh, yeah, I saw that. He's hocking on the

1851
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
street, like, he's in full costume,

1852
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
he's got a script he's doing, and he's got

1853
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
the whole snake oil, like, cart

1854
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
set up. He's doing a Nathan Fielder. I am

1855
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
impressed by that effort. That is cool.

1856
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah, okay. I like that. See what I'm saying?

1857
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
No, this is good. This is a good costume and set

1858
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
all that. That's a good one. That's playing the Nathan Fielder.

1859
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Um, I don't care.

1860
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Like, who on YouTube is doing that?

1861
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I don't know many. You know what? You know what?

1862
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
When you have as much money as John Tron does,

1863
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
literally nothing you do is impressive anymore.

1864
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Right, but look, it's all in red. What do you mean?

1865
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
What do you mean? Oh, you just get on the phone

1866
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and say, hey, pay someone to make this happen,

1867
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and then they'll do it for you. You have no

1868
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
idea what's involved in writing. Yes, I do.

1869
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You gotta have the visions, like, make it come

1870
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
together. I guess.

1871
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I guess. How much vision do you really need?

1872
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Just straight of credit, if nothing else.

1873
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's bullshit.

1874
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You guys gotta, like, realize that this is

1875
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
all in relation to, like, his old content,

1876
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
which was, like, you know,

1877
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
as tier, you know? So it's like,

1878
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
in terms of, like, being a reaction YouTuber,

1879
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
he's still, like, one of the best.

1880
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I think he is.

1881
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I respect what he's doing.

1882
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
He's fine. I don't hate him.

1883
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I don't hate listening to him.

1884
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But I don't know.

1885
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
You know what?

1886
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's just, it's just...

1887
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I just... Die, John.

1888
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I don't know why. I don't have any desire

1889
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
to fucking open up a John Tron video

1890
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
anymore. Sure. The magic's

1891
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
gone. Maybe it's me.

1892
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Maybe I'm the problem. I don't know.

1893
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I get what you're saying, because, like, you know,

1894
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I see the videos pop up on my feed and I don't click them.

1895
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Like, I... Me neither. Me neither.

1896
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Most of the time. Glad John's doing well.

1897
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But you know what? I did watch,

1898
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
just recently, I went back and I watched

1899
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
his Banjo and Kanzui

1900
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Mass and Bolts review. You know, this was, like, the video

1901
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
that was, like, the most famous of his.

1902
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That made him hit the big screen.

1903
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You know, the big scene, whatever.

1904
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And it was... It was

1905
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
very good. And I should keep in mind

1906
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I have seen it many times and loved it.

1907
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I'd call it, like, an 8.

1908
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I call it, like, an 8, currently.

1909
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I don't know.

1910
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Maybe I've changed. YouTube has evolved.

1911
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Is it fair to compare, you know,

1912
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
things of that nature to what we got now?

1913
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know. It's still a legendary video

1914
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
where he waves and it deserves respect for that.

1915
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You know, kind of set the field for a lot of

1916
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
epic game reviewers with editing

1917
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and goofy gaffy skits and whatnot.

1918
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So, whatever. I respect him on that.

1919
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It was a fun time. I don't know.

1920
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It was a good era.

1921
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It was a good era. It was a good era.

1922
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
This is when him and John, or him and Aaron,

1923
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
were, like, first forming Game Grumps, I believe.

1924
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It was actually, it was, like, after some videos

1925
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I thought were more recent, this Banjo one.

1926
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Whatever. I don't know. It was impressive.

1927
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We all know that was, like,

1928
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
that was him being a gamer.

1929
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That was him tapping into his identity

1930
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
for its purest, most,

1931
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I don't know, distilled,

1932
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
gamerous cred and he was

1933
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
capitalizing on.

1934
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You know, there's one other thing about

1935
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
John that I must say,

1936
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I find extremely attractive.

1937
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And that is

1938
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
his race, his realism.

1939
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh, boy.

1940
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It's like this

1941
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
total

1942
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
lack of need to work at anybody's

1943
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
pace but his own.

1944
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And, you know, maybe just because he's so rich or whatever, he doesn't care.

1945
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
He's got the leverage.

1946
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Of course he doesn't have to do anything.

1947
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But he was like that all along, you know.

1948
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
He quit Game Grumps for that reason.

1949
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I feel like, yeah,

1950
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'm just not a fucking bootlicker, okay?

1951
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
That's, that's my thing.

1952
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Sorry if that's weird.

1953
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Who's boot am I looking here?

1954
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Oh, wow, look at this, wow, look at this incredible set

1955
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
that he made. Yeah, he's got like an $800 billion.

1956
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
He can make any set he wants.

1957
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It's not a challenge. Oh my,

1958
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
you don't even know what it's financed. You have no idea.

1959
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
How much do you think that card cost

1960
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
to make, Nate?

1961
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Maybe, well, he probably

1962
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
rented it. He probably didn't buy it, right?

1963
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Rent it from somewhere and then you deck it out.

1964
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Maybe a couple thousand tops.

1965
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Okay, but regardless of the price, it's a pretty neat card.

1966
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So what?

1967
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
There's a bunch of things

1968
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
that cost a shit ton

1969
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and look ugly as fuck.

1970
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Here's the difference between me and you.

1971
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I, I watch a Marvel movie

1972
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and I don't, like, or actually

1973
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I don't do that, but if I did do that,

1974
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I would, I would see, I would see some

1975
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
CG and be like, it's not,

1976
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I would never be impressed by it, because like,

1977
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
of course they have all this beautiful CG.

1978
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
They paid like 8,000 people

1979
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
to spend like two years a piece making it.

1980
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I agree, I agree. So my point

1981
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
is that it's not impressive.

1982
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Look, the scale, I think

1983
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
the difference here is the scale of

1984
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
the point is that the Marvel has this

1985
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
disposal versus John and his YouTube channel.

1986
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm not impressed by budget.

1987
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Well, that's not fair to the people who actually did

1988
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
work on the CG and make it look impressive.

1989
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Right, a lot of people.

1990
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Right, you know, it's like, it's all these resources.

1991
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
A lot of people can do the work, but it's like

1992
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
you have to put someone in charge who knows like

1993
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
what they're doing. So it's like, it's,

1994
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
if you don't, if you don't care about the money,

1995
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
sure, fine, you know?

1996
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Disney has a shit ton of money, but Lion King

1997
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
still looks like shit.

1998
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Exactly, you have to put the right people in charge.

1999
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Even if this is like a gorgeous

2000
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
card, even if you're like, oh my god,

2001
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I am living for this card.

2002
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I am here for it right now.

2003
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
We will never know who made this card.

2004
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It wasn't John.

2005
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Dude, I couldn't give a shit about the card.

2006
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's like, what context the card

2007
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
exists in, you know? It's like, was the joke

2008
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
funny? It's like, who could

2009
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
have thought of that joke?

2010
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
To be fair, I didn't watch the whole video

2011
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
so I don't know if the joke's funny.

2012
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't believe it. I can appreciate

2013
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and sympathize with your point.

2014
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I really do. I just think that this joke

2015
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
is funny and it's well

2016
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
done. So I guess that's my main point.

2017
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It might very well be. I feel I can separate

2018
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
the money issue, which I agree

2019
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
is legitimate. I'm not saying

2020
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I'm not even saying fuck John for having money.

2021
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'm just saying I'm not impressed by

2022
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
the presence of like cool sets and

2023
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
costumes because like, yeah, of course

2024
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
he would have those things. Better than the set

2025
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
costume is going across

2026
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
the side from Goop

2027
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and being a snake oil salesman in real life.

2028
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Just that concept. Very funny.

2029
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
What is Goop, by the way?

2030
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Goop is Gwyneth Paltrow's obviously

2031
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
retarded, like, lifestyle

2032
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
brand of stupid Goops and

2033
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Essences. They've got, they literally

2034
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
have magnets that you're supposed to like

2035
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
attach to yourself that are supposed to like

2036
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
balance your chi. Like shit like that.

2037
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Shit like that. Maybe you should watch

2038
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
the video before criticizing it then.

2039
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm not criticizing the video.

2040
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm just saying, I'm just

2041
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I'm literally just saying fuck you.

2042
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That's all I'm saying.

2043
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Well, that's all I want. That's all I want.

2044
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Okay. All right.

2045
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Well, agree to disagree, I guess.

2046
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
God damn it. I had

2047
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
another Rockstar, X-Durance

2048
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
marshmallow flavor and I can't find it.

2049
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Give me 30 seconds. I gotta

2050
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
check downstairs. That's not fair.

2051
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
If he's going to get his marshmallow, I want to get

2052
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
my apple juice. Apple juice?

2053
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Go for it, I guess. I'll just

2054
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
fill time. Hey, I'll tell you what.

2055
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I actually started a website

2056
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
recently. Yeah. It's

2057
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
philip. S-O-S-S-O-U-R-T

2058
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
dot com.

2059
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
That's my art website. Put that in the links.

2060
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
That's for all my

2061
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Well, it's for my animation ventures

2062
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
and for like drawing and all that stuff

2063
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
to have a place for me to

2064
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
post your shit. Exactly.

2065
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Exactly. You know,

2066
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
situate it all. But also,

2067
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I'm a big fan of puppets. I don't know

2068
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Okay, I'm back. I don't know when I got into

2069
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
puppets. It might have been

2070
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
just like, you know, going into Jim

2071
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Henson's shit, but like, I've been really

2072
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
into it and I want to

2073
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
incorporate it into my videos. I like

2074
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You're a man of many talents. I played

2075
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
around with it a little bit for one

2076
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
video and then I never did it again.

2077
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
You know? Okay. I have a bad habit of that.

2078
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I want to see an R-long, not an R-long, an

2079
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
R-low collab immediately.

2080
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Puppet Boys of YouTube.

2081
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It's time. It's the craziest stuff.

2082
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Um, yeah, I have like,

2083
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I just literally have

2084
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
like, fur

2085
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
halfway to the ceiling

2086
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
next to me. You know, all these materials

2087
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I've just been stacking up and I just

2088
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
haven't had the time

2089
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
to do it because I've just been stuffed.

2090
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So like, the weekend freeing up for me

2091
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
it's a blessing. I should have done it a long time ago.

2092
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
So you can make these puppets for

2093
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
producing in videos. For producing in videos.

2094
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yes. Oh my god. I'm so excited. I'm so hyped.

2095
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You're filled with that. Dude, I'm so hyped.

2096
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
You've always actually on YouTube been like a

2097
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Jon Trons spirit. You just do exactly what you want to do

2098
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
exactly as you feel like it. Yeah. Oh my god.

2099
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
At least that's how it seems to me. I've always thought that.

2100
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah, it's so liberating, you know?

2101
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It's like, uh... I mean, now that I've made it my

2102
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
fucking job, oh god, let me tell you.

2103
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's a fucking bummer. Speaking of liberating,

2104
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I've done nothing on social media.

2105
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I've been sort of like, away

2106
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
from social media for as much as I can

2107
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and it's been pretty liberating.

2108
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
That's true. I feel so chill.

2109
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I feel so zen. I've played like

2110
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
91 hours on Fire Emblem and Three Houses.

2111
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
That's been fun.

2112
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Was this really an improvement in your life

2113
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
is the real question? Yes. Yes, it has.

2114
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I've been so happy. I love

2115
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
that game. I love my new Switch.

2116
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It's great. It's fantastic.

2117
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I don't remember the last time I've been so happy

2118
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
with my life. Say you got a new Switch?

2119
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Sounds like a great investment then. Yesterday.

2120
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Wait, not yesterday. A few days ago

2121
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
a miracle happened. So me and my boyfriend

2122
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
we ordered pizzas for one for each

2123
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and they messed up one of the pizzas,

2124
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
my boyfriend's pizza. So they gave us

2125
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that messed up pizza for free.

2126
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
So we got three pizzas.

2127
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
That's the story I want to hear about.

2128
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's epic. One time

2129
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
my people, we ordered

2130
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
hamburgers, right?

2131
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
My one friend Lorenz

2132
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
he made the order for everyone,

2133
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
right? And then we got the order,

2134
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
right? And they messed up

2135
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
like one burger, right?

2136
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Like one guy got the wrong burger.

2137
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I got the right burger. My burger was fine.

2138
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
But he's like

2139
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
oh, they fucked up our order. And he called them

2140
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
up and he's like, he's just like, he's on the phone

2141
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
like, yeah, no, these burgers are all fucked up.

2142
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
No, he just gave us the wrong burgers.

2143
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And I'm like, actually, my burger's fine. He's like,

2144
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
no, no, no, no, yeah, they're all fucked up.

2145
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And we just got a second burger. I just got two burgers.

2146
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It was great. That burger is epic.

2147
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I don't care.

2148
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I use kind of vague language if I was calling.

2149
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'd be like, yeah, there's like some issues with our order.

2150
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I'd really appreciate it if you guys could fix it

2151
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and just like give us, you know, this is

2152
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
what I like to do. I never tell lies.

2153
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This is the thing I do. But you can

2154
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
talk your way around lies to effectively

2155
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
lie. This wasn't me. I didn't do this.

2156
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I didn't do this because my burger was fine.

2157
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
That's fair. That's fair.

2158
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I condemn this friend of yours. I disavow

2159
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
he or she, I don't know.

2160
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
They seem like they're a ruffian, a rapscallian.

2161
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I'll have none of it, sir.

2162
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
That's all true.

2163
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You know, if we're still on the subject

2164
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
of food, I've only been

2165
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
eating one meal a day

2166
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and it's only been Burger King

2167
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
or McDonald's.

2168
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I don't know if that's good or bad because

2169
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
it's like, I guess

2170
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
all the food that's going in me is bad, but it's like

2171
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I'm not eating the large quantity of it, you know?

2172
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
It's counter balanced by the intermittent

2173
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
fasting of eating once a day or whatever it's called.

2174
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
That's my thought process

2175
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
doing this.

2176
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I heal you. I heal again.

2177
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Sometimes we've been ordering pizza

2178
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
every now and then. I only need to eat just the one

2179
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
pizza that day and the next day

2180
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I've lost some calories.

2181
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It's really good.

2182
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I can have a

2183
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
pizza diet.

2184
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's beautiful. Well, no, you just got to do

2185
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
what Oolulia does and degrease your pizza.

2186
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I mean, that sure would make

2187
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
a pretty decent difference.

2188
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Well, you just take your napkins and you soak up the grease

2189
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
off all your pizza. Okay, but what if my pizza

2190
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
isn't all that greasy?

2191
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Then you've already degreased it. I guess you're in good company.

2192
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Well, you see, I don't actually

2193
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
at the end of the press

2194
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
that don't have anything, it's just bread. I don't

2195
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
eat that. As a keto man,

2196
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
what I recommend is

2197
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
ordering a pizza, degreasing it

2198
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and then throwing away the pizza and just

2199
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
eating the greasy napkins because

2200
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
only the fat is good. Everything else

2201
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
is poison and cause inflammation.

2202
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I can't eat the fat. Listen,

2203
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Jack Spratt could eat no fat. His wife

2204
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
could eat no lean. Okay, here's the thing.

2205
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I got

2206
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
was off keto and then

2207
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
over the last couple days we've gotten back on it

2208
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and I literally went from

2209
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
being fat to being skinny.

2210
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's disgusting. The difference is

2211
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
ridiculous. I can't believe

2212
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
how absolutely heinous I was

2213
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
four days ago and how

2214
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
gorgeous I am today.

2215
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I was so distressed.

2216
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I was so distressed four days ago looking at myself

2217
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
in the mirror like, God, how did this happen so fast?

2218
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And now I'm so euphoric

2219
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
today, tips fedora

2220
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
because like it's fixed, solved,

2221
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
problem solved, no biggie.

2222
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Do you track your weight in there or anything?

2223
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I haven't been weighing myself lately, no.

2224
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Okay. For a while I was, but I haven't

2225
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
counted calories. I haven't been counting calories

2226
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
so in the last month I was like 3

2227
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
kilograms or so.

2228
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
3 kilograms? That's like 40 pounds

2229
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
in a month here.

2230
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Wait, is that true?

2231
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That's like 100 pounds, dude.

2232
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
What? That's not 100

2233
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
pounds. No, it's just 3.

2234
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Yeah, it's like a thousand pounds.

2235
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's like infinity pounds.

2236
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh man.

2237
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I don't exist anymore.

2238
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I haven't been great about my diet particularly,

2239
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
but the one thing I have been doing, which is kind of more important,

2240
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I've been doing the W diet, the whatever

2241
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
diet that I've advertised,

2242
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I've been doing it for like four months now

2243
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and I've lost like over

2244
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
10 pounds at this point

2245
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and I mean that's a little slow, you could lose weight faster

2246
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
than that, but all I've been doing

2247
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
is counting my calories and all that does

2248
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
is make me aware of what I'm eating

2249
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
and so I can eat a little less of that.

2250
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah, exactly, same thing. I've been counting calories.

2251
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I've also set a limit of how many calories I can eat per day.

2252
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Wise, yep, yep, that's the way to do it.

2253
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It's funny, when I went on

2254
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
the pizza party

2255
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
podcast

2256
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
and talked about Keto

2257
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
because I had gone

2258
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and listened to some like recent episodes

2259
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and I had heard Izzy

2260
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
talk about how she was like doing Keto

2261
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and so I'm like

2262
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
hey, uh, Izzy

2263
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I hear you're a Keto guy

2264
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
and she's like, yeah

2265
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and I'm like, yeah, me too, awesome

2266
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
and she's like, oh, she was like

2267
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I think she thought I was going to attack her for it

2268
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
or something

2269
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
like fuck you

2270
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
eat some carbs, fucking asshole

2271
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
put up those apprehensive shields

2272
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah, yeah, she's right to be afraid

2273
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
obviously

2274
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
but in this case it was

2275
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
unnecessary

2276
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Directly after gamers

2277
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
it's the people who do Keto

2278
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Keto people

2279
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Indeed, that is how it

2280
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I couldn't find

2281
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I couldn't find my fucking

2282
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
my fucking marshmallow

2283
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Rockstar Exdurance

2284
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Oh no, well deal with it

2285
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
On the way here, I got two

2286
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I got, what, why is it like

2287
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
fucking what?

2288
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
This can is like smashed

2289
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm terrified

2290
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
No, never

2291
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
How does that stuff affect you?

2292
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It barely does

2293
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Energy drinks fuck me up, dude

2294
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I am like totally

2295
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
immune to them now

2296
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
My tolerance is so high

2297
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
What's up?

2298
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Guess what day today is

2299
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Why is it special?

2300
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Is it your birthday?

2301
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
27th

2302
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Daylight savings

2303
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Well, yes, but no

2304
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
No, it's not

2305
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Daylight savings

2306
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
It's National Black Cat Day

2307
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
No kidding

2308
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Black cat day, no way

2309
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Yeah, I love that manga

2310
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
You guys don't even know

2311
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
what that is, I bet

2312
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I do

2313
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You probably know, you probably know

2314
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
That's incredible

2315
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Happy day of black cats to my cat

2316
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
because he's a black boy

2317
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Oh, that's nice

2318
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Happy black cat day to Luna

2319
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
which is a hippos cat

2320
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Well, I hope you enjoy it

2321
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
You know, my

2322
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
My rotund little guy

2323
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
My little baby dog, Sessho

2324
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
He is black, he is a dog

2325
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
He wants to be included

2326
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
He has spent this entire episode

2327
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I've got a blanket around my legs and feet

2328
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
He has been in that blanket

2329
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
on my feet

2330
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
You're like those fucking people

2331
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
in October who draw digitally

2332
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and think you're right

2333
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Whoa, coming from my neck last year

2334
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
You're gonna have a party

2335
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You're gonna have a party

2336
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
and you don't include everyone

2337
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That's like racist

2338
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Everyone wants a participation trophy

2339
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Sessho's a guest of honor

2340
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Sessho's a guest of honor

2341
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
He's allowed, I am allowed

2342
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Okay, well thank you

2343
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Speaking of Sessho

2344
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Tomorrow, he's going to camp

2345
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
He's going to camp for a couple of days

2346
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
because me and Michelle

2347
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
No, it's not fat camp

2348
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It's normal camp

2349
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
We're going to visit

2350
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Digi out in Virginia

2351
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and we're gonna hang out with them

2352
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and Vic and Hope, presumably as well

2353
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yep, gonna visit them for Halloween

2354
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
and just, I don't know, maybe film some stuff

2355
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
We'll see

2356
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
We'll do

2357
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That sounds like a blast

2358
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Let me see, we'll be there

2359
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Today is Sunday

2360
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
By the time everyone hears this

2361
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I will literally be on my way home

2362
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
a little late for that

2363
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
We'll probably do goofy stuff

2364
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Me and Zen and Munchie and Kazzy

2365
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
will be having way more fun

2366
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
than you

2367
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Watching Spooky Movies

2368
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Are we actually gonna do that

2369
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Because I've never watched Spooky Movies

2370
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I hate Spooky Movies

2371
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Watch Focus

2372
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Watch The Exorcist

2373
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The Exorcist is a great movie

2374
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I might consider watching The Exorcist

2375
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
The only problem is The Exorcist is a little

2376
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It's like an actual

2377
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
really good movie so you want to pay attention

2378
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
which isn't great for like a party setting

2379
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
or like hanging out with your bros

2380
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Watch Scary Movie 3

2381
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I don't know, that's more your speed

2382
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
No

2383
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
That's right

2384
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Is that the one with the 3?

2385
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
No, never

2386
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That's for babies

2387
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That's the one where everyone makes fun

2388
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
of the kid for being a virgin

2389
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Is that true?

2390
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Yes

2391
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
That hits too close to home

2392
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It can't be happening

2393
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
All these grown ass women

2394
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
are teasing this 13 year old boy

2395
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
for being a virgin

2396
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You see Bender

2397
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
subverting the trope of

2398
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
having the virgin woman

2399
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
be victimized in horror films

2400
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
by having it be a 13 year old boy

2401
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
It's genius

2402
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah, that might be true

2403
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
That doesn't make it like

2404
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
not super uncomfortable

2405
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't think they were actually teasing him

2406
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I think what they were doing was like

2407
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
they needed a virgin for like a spell or something

2408
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
No, they are definitely

2409
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You were actually

2410
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I do remember like

2411
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
the spell or whatever

2412
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
to summon them back in

2413
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
The candle had to be lit by a virgin

2414
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
or something like that

2415
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Everyone assumed it had to be

2416
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
a female I think

2417
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and then specifically stated

2418
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
ended up being lit by the boy

2419
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
That's fucked up

2420
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Wild shit

2421
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'm just saying, you can push a gamer

2422
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
but one day you push a gamer too far

2423
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
and on that day you'll learn to regret it

2424
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Veronica

2425
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Stacey, you'll learn

2426
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
My people will rise up

2427
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It's tough out here for these gamers

2428
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Guys, I did it

2429
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I found my Marshmallow Rockstar Extern

2430
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You'll never guess where it was

2431
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
You'll never guess where it was

2432
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
In the refrigerator

2433
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
You don't deserve any congratulations

2434
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's always in the last place you look

2435
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Oh, you know what

2436
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I just reminded all of a sudden

2437
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Speaking of the last place you look

2438
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
at the beginning of the episode I completely forgot

2439
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But now I can say it, it's that ladies and gentlemen

2440
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It's time

2441
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
to head on over to patreon.com

2442
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
PCP Minecraft

2443
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and join the PCP Minecraft server

2444
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Because we got it up and running baby

2445
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
We're back in business

2446
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's a thriving community, I know it took us weeks

2447
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
but we fixed it seemingly every problem

2448
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Whatever, you get like a lag spike once or twice

2449
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It's an online game, deal with it pussy

2450
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
This is it, Minecraft is alive forever

2451
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
We'll happily take

2452
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
all the money you've got

2453
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And also there's a slash

2454
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
kit, sorry that you can claim up until

2455
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
the 5th, I think of October

2456
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
so it might be too late

2457
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
So if you join now

2458
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
November

2459
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Even if you weren't there

2460
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
for the first part or whatever of it

2461
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
you will still get this bonus sorry kit

2462
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and that's just a little present for most of you

2463
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Wait a minute, I think by the time this episode

2464
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
comes out

2465
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
this comes out on the first

2466
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
this episode

2467
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So there's still some time

2468
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
No time to waste folks

2469
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
That's good

2470
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You'll get a really cool thing like a minors ring

2471
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
which helps you mine faster

2472
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
and also the sorry stick

2473
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
which is a pickaxe

2474
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
That's fucking sick

2475
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It gives you some light

2476
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
when you're mining

2477
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
in the dark

2478
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
We've done all the work for you

2479
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
We've solved all the problems

2480
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
We have created for you

2481
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
a thriving minecraft community

2482
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Honestly, I can't believe one

2483
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
how many people sign up and two

2484
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
how active the discord is

2485
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's literally a thriving community

2486
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I just want to say thank you to everyone

2487
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's been so fun

2488
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
even while the server was down

2489
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
It's just so nice

2490
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I love meming

2491
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I love when people do memes

2492
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's so good

2493
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I love memes, I swear

2494
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
They're so funny

2495
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I gotta say your enthusiasm

2496
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
for this project is kind of infectious

2497
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It is infectious

2498
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
SlimecorpHQ

2499
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
rises higher every day

2500
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
brick by brick by brick

2501
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
crushing the hopes and dreams of the wage slaves of the world

2502
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Slime they had for mortar

2503
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
brick and stone

2504
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
What's the fucking bible quote?

2505
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah, it's the original slime quote

2506
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I got it for you

2507
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It is

2508
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And they had brick for stone

2509
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and slime they had for mortar

2510
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Done

2511
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It's being constructed out of

2512
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
a black concrete

2513
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
clear green glass

2514
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and a beautiful marble

2515
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Oh, I can't wait

2516
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I'm gonna build 13 floors plus the lobby

2517
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
for the 13th N members

2518
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Ooh, it's gonna be glorious

2519
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm gonna use my god powers to make an underground empire

2520
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Great idea

2521
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Has anyone seen

2522
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I've probably talked about

2523
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
fucking the Yogscast

2524
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and like their

2525
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Minecraft series

2526
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You have told us many times, but they are

2527
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
They continue to be fascinating

2528
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Exclusively Minecraft YouTubers, right?

2529
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Originally

2530
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
They started that way

2531
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
They branched off into other things

2532
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and now they are fucking like scary

2533
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
evil capitalists that own everything

2534
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It's like

2535
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Ain't that just the way

2536
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Absolutely boot-shakingly terrifying

2537
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
to like switch over

2538
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
from doing like one video game

2539
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
for your whole career

2540
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
to just like wanting to branch out, you know

2541
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And like a lot of people can't make that jump

2542
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I mean, I think they started on

2543
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
as World of Warcraft guys

2544
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Oh yeah, okay

2545
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I think they got popular among like wow

2546
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
wow communities and then they switched to Minecraft

2547
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
If you remember

2548
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
the old fuck himself, old Dunkey

2549
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Remember Dunkey? I still enjoy Dunkey

2550
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I mean, Dunkey's still around

2551
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I don't know why you're talking about him in the past tense

2552
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Rest his soul, Dunkey

2553
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Good to run, but you know

2554
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
He's gotten pretty fat though

2555
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So I mean maybe

2556
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
He's on his way out

2557
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You know, not to me mean, because this is kind of like the high water mark

2558
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
But like it's funny to watch

2559
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
more and more like YouTubers are getting married

2560
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Dunkey got married recently as well

2561
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It's fun for me to compare them each

2562
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
to PewDiePie's wedding

2563
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and see like how much

2564
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
silence was off the charts

2565
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I mean, he's a literal millionaire

2566
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Obviously, I'm just saying

2567
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
My wedding, whenever it happens

2568
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
will obviously be nothing compared to this as well

2569
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I didn't watch PewDiePie's wedding video

2570
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
How was it?

2571
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Well, his actual wedding video was like

2572
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
an overdone, saccharine, like not funny

2573
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Like, oh I actually love my wife, lol

2574
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Idiot

2575
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Boo, don't want to hear about it, shut up

2576
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Sounds like a bunch of malarkey

2577
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It was a bunch of malarkey Zen

2578
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I post marriage and I post job

2579
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and I post life and I post food

2580
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I post all of this bullshit

2581
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Post existence

2582
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Exactly, I want to be pure energy

2583
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I'd be a millionaire too

2584
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
God, I'm looking at this timeline

2585
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I just went to the Yogscast fan Wiki

2586
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Can you like it?

2587
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And I'm looking at like a timeline

2588
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
of like all the different Minecraft series

2589
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
they did

2590
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
and like some of them overlapped

2591
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
because some of them were running at the same time

2592
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Some people would have like YouTube

2593
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Minecraft series that were set

2594
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
in like the same servers, right?

2595
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
But sort of telling like separate stories

2596
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Man, there's so many more

2597
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
than I've never seen

2598
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Like I've seen Shadow of Israel

2599
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
is the big one that most people know

2600
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and then on top of like after that

2601
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
like that transition into Duncan's laboratory

2602
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
and then there was the Jaffa Factory

2603
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
and Sipsco

2604
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
The Jaffa Factory and Sipsco

2605
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I remember Jaffa Factory and Sipsco

2606
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
they fucking went on and did it for years and years

2607
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
and years and I will never ever watch

2608
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
all this content but it sort of

2609
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
makes me happy that it exists

2610
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
That's cute, that's nice

2611
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It's good, it's good shit

2612
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Well, it looks like it ended around

2613
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
late 2016 but I don't know

2614
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Maybe it continues

2615
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
and this chart's just out of date

2616
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah, please link that chart man, link the chart

2617
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
so we can all cruise

2618
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I mean you will just, it'll just

2619
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
be a bunch of names that you don't

2620
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
understand because that's what it is for me

2621
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I can only

2622
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
speculate as to the content of

2623
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Flux Buddies

2624
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
or

2625
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Druids Downtown

2626
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Yeah, well, they sound enchanting

2627
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
and I hope it's more than one day

2628
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm fucking charmed

2629
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Well, I mean we could go to voicemails if you want

2630
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I don't know, it's

2631
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
talking about a bunch of bullshit

2632
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah, we can go for an hour and a half

2633
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Yeah, alright, alright

2634
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Let's pull them up here, alright sick

2635
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
You don't have a choice then, you have to

2636
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I am but a pretender

2637
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
in this house

2638
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Okay, where does this go? This goes to the commander

2639
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Alright people, you know the drill, speak pipe

2640
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
leave us voicemails, link below, click

2641
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
play, record, there you go

2642
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Alright, first one, oh boy, okay

2643
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
we're starting strong

2644
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
First voicemails from I Need To Get Laid

2645
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Now!

2646
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Let's see what his excuse is

2647
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Go!

2648
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
What's the quickest way to lose my virginity?

2649
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
How do I execute Operation Pump and Dump?

2650
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Also, am I a bad person?

2651
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yes

2652
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Zan, could you not hear that?

2653
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I didn't hear, I only heard him say hello

2654
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and I was making jokes about that being like his opening line

2655
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
That's weird

2656
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I heard the whole thing

2657
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
No, the sound was down

2658
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
on the rhythm

2659
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Oh, okay, point was

2660
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Okay, Mage immediately

2661
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
says to this guy that he is a

2662
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
bad person because he just wants to pump and dump

2663
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
There's nothing wrong

2664
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
with going to pump and dump

2665
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It was mostly a joke, if both are concerning

2666
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
to the act of pumping

2667
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
No, of course

2668
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Listen to this fucking boomer

2669
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
with consent

2670
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's over man, get out of here

2671
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Post Consent Society

2672
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
We're posting everything

2673
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Ban

2674
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Well, okay, listen

2675
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So the gist was, he has a girlfriend

2676
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Did you notice

2677
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
he said something in there that was like

2678
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I won't be able to have a girlfriend

2679
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
like in a year

2680
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
What does that mean?

2681
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Maybe he's going to the military

2682
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Was I not paying attention?

2683
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
No, you were not

2684
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
He has a girlfriend, why doesn't he just fuck her?

2685
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I think

2686
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
that's what he needs help with

2687
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Look, I've been there, you have a girlfriend

2688
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
and you want to convert that girlfriend into

2689
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
a girlfriend, but you are inexperienced

2690
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
and you don't know how

2691
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
The good news is

2692
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
your hard work is behind you

2693
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
You've got plenty of months, what you want to do

2694
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
is in a non-creepy way, a totally nice way

2695
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You want to escalate physical intimacy

2696
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
like hand touching

2697
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
You just say, hey, I want to have sex

2698
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
and if she says no, then you just leave

2699
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
because you want sex

2700
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Ben's point is actually correct

2701
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Don't fall into the trap, I literally did this

2702
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
You're absolutely right

2703
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
You know what Ben? Rare moment

2704
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Ben's correct

2705
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I did it

2706
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
If you have a girlfriend

2707
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and you want to have sex

2708
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
and she doesn't want to

2709
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and that's it

2710
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
You shouldn't be dating

2711
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Because that's such a large component

2712
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
of the relationship

2713
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
If you can't talk past it

2714
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
If you're 13

2715
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
whatever, if you want to fuck at 13

2716
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
like a 16 year old

2717
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
who's ready to go

2718
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
who's experienced

2719
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
or a 13 year old

2720
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I don't care, whatever

2721
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Don't encourage what?

2722
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Underage

2723
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I'm encouraging it

2724
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
There's nothing illegal about that

2725
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
No, nothing

2726
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Well, there might be a legal in some states

2727
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
a 13 year old to fuck a 16 year old

2728
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
because the divide between them

2729
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I mean 13's kind of young

2730
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I don't think it's illegal

2731
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Well, the premise there was a 13 year old

2732
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
horn dog who wants to fuck

2733
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I mean, what are we going to say?

2734
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
They're not allowed to?

2735
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I don't think it's not allowed

2736
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
They can fight a 13 year old

2737
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
As a general statement

2738
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
not pointed to anybody

2739
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Practice sex

2740
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Condoms and whatnot

2741
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Do that too

2742
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Good advice

2743
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I'll go one step further on that

2744
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I actually am not

2745
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
In my days

2746
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I've become a little bit revised on this point

2747
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't think having rampant sex

2748
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
is really like a great way to live your life

2749
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think pursuing people

2750
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
who have a fellow interest in sex

2751
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
who you could like have some kind of

2752
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
reasonable relationship with

2753
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I just think will make you happier long term

2754
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
having tried both

2755
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But get out there and meet someone who wants to have sex

2756
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
as you do

2757
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and maybe your girlfriend does

2758
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
You can't be pussyfoot around

2759
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
She wants to have sex, just know if you

2760
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
We're kind of scared of the actual question

2761
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
His actual question is how does he lose

2762
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
his virginity as quickly as possible

2763
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And I say that

2764
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I say that one

2765
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I mean, tell your girlfriend

2766
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
you want to do that

2767
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
There's a sunset on this relationship

2768
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And if she says no then pursue plan B

2769
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
which is

2770
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
get rid of her

2771
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I don't know

2772
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Ask around

2773
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Anyone for sex please

2774
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Use the Christian method

2775
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
and bring a sign to school that says

2776
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Hello, my name is

2777
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
whatever my name is, I'm looking for

2778
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
such and such age female

2779
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
so on and so forth

2780
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
My name is I Need to Get Laid Now

2781
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
as featured on the Procrastinator's podcast

2782
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
with a link

2783
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Dude, how to get laid

2784
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Just tell them you were featured on the PCP

2785
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
and their panties will hit the floor

2786
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Trust me

2787
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
He already tried just being cool

2788
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
and that's how he got his girlfriend

2789
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Now that you've been featured on the show

2790
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It doesn't surprise me at all

2791
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
to hear him say that just calling himself cool

2792
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
actually works

2793
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
because that's just how simple human minds are

2794
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
If you hear someone being called cool

2795
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
even if it's themself

2796
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
you will just learn the association

2797
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh, that cool guy

2798
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I've heard of this before

2799
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
It's just that easy

2800
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Alright, there you go

2801
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
There's your one-step program

2802
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Transparency is so important for our relationship

2803
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
You just gotta be straightforward

2804
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I'll just tell the short tale again

2805
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
of like I had a girlfriend in college

2806
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I wanted to fuck

2807
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It's obvious I was a loser and she wasn't into me

2808
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
but like she pitied ATV basically

2809
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Yeah, exactly

2810
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
but like, you know, would like try to push for that

2811
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
and she would recoil because she wasn't into me

2812
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't blame her at all, 100% on me

2813
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
So you know what you do?

2814
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And the relationship, if you're not into each other

2815
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
and you move on, that's all there is to it

2816
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
That's all there is to it

2817
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Alright, next voicemail

2818
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Here we go, we got the Northern Norway report

2819
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Okay, sick, go

2820
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Okay, so I listened to this previous episode

2821
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
of the PCP a couple of weeks ago

2822
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and there was this voicemail with a guy

2823
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
reporting on the autumn

2824
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and I start getting fucking pissed

2825
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
because they look all around me

2826
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and there's snow

2827
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and there's winter

2828
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
and he said he's gonna call back

2829
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
three weeks, three months

2830
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Winter report

2831
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
No, no, it's already winter here

2832
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Get your facts straight, you fucking retard

2833
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Also, related question

2834
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I woke up and there were some moose

2835
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
shitting in my garden

2836
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and I got really scared

2837
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I waited until they got away

2838
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
before I got out of the house

2839
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
to go to school and stuff

2840
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So I have a question

2841
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Have any of you experienced

2842
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
a similar incident?

2843
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Has a moose ever shitting

2844
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
your garden back?

2845
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
They have moose in Norway?

2846
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'm trying to think

2847
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I thought those were North American

2848
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Landbridge?

2849
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I don't know

2850
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
He said he was from Norway, right?

2851
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Yeah, Norway

2852
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I mean, I've seen a moose

2853
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
when we went to Maine

2854
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I remember we saw some moose

2855
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Moose are fucking huge

2856
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
by the way, moose are like

2857
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Do you guys know how big moose are?

2858
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
They're huge

2859
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
They're like fucking tanks

2860
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
He's definitely right saying in the house

2861
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
They could easily crush you

2862
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
A horse

2863
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
You see a horse in person

2864
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and you think, oh my god

2865
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I didn't realize just how big

2866
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
a horse really is

2867
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
and then you see a moose

2868
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
and it makes the horse look like nothing

2869
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Okay

2870
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I thought they were a North American thing

2871
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
but I'm not

2872
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
too shocked to find out that I'm wrong

2873
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Anyway, they went over that damn landbridge

2874
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I used to see deer a lot

2875
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
in college

2876
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
because it was in a forest

2877
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
that had a lot of deer around

2878
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
and it should up its gamer cred

2879
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
by ditching the leaf and making a moose

2880
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
They're like national symbol or something

2881
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
because moose are fucking sick

2882
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and they've got dope antlers

2883
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
and they could easily crush a man

2884
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Do that

2885
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
That's my recommendation

2886
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
You ever read the Blue Moose stories

2887
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
by Daniel Pinkwater?

2888
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Of course I did

2889
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Absolutely

2890
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
For anyone who doesn't know, Daniel Pinkwater

2891
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
was like a young adult fiction

2892
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I guess when we were kids

2893
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I don't know

2894
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
That helped me out

2895
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
That moose would eat and drink

2896
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
one very specific thing

2897
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Was it like cinnamon?

2898
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Was it cider and chowder or something?

2899
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I just remember

2900
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
the lodge that the Blue Moose

2901
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
would visit

2902
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
was known for

2903
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
legendary chowder

2904
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
That was their specialty

2905
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I don't even remember

2906
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
anything that happened

2907
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I just remember there was a Blue Moose

2908
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
who would hang out with his dude

2909
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
at his fucking lodge in Maine

2910
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and they would eat chowder

2911
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
and just fucking shoot the shit

2912
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
by Stephen King

2913
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
No, Daniel Pinkwater

2914
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Legendary

2915
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Let's go on to the next one

2916
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
How many more?

2917
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
18 more

2918
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
We've got one

2919
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
but this is good

2920
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It's Art Boy towards Chile

2921
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
He's not dead yet

2922
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Maybe by the time you hear this

2923
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
For anyone who doesn't know, the reason we're saying that

2924
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I'll make sure of it

2925
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
The reason we're saying that is because he is from Chile

2926
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
which is undergoing some kind of

2927
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
fucking riot storm

2928
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Call it a revolution

2929
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It's all about the optics, Ben

2930
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's a revolution

2931
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
A workers revolt

2932
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I'm honestly not 100% clear

2933
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Oh, it's a litany of stuff

2934
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
It seems like

2935
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I know corruption is a thing

2936
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
They raised the price on public transport

2937
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
but there was a lot more

2938
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
that had happened before that

2939
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
that had led up to this happening

2940
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Anyway, we should...

2941
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But also he had some health issues

2942
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Nexus continually

2943
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
draws

2944
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
This is so embarrassing that

2945
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
there are men like Nexus out there

2946
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
make me feel ashamed of myself

2947
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
He just goes and he draws

2948
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and drops and just goes to the hospital

2949
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I don't know if that's something

2950
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
to be proud of, honestly

2951
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Well, is it better

2952
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
to burn out as a bright star

2953
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
to slowly fade away into the

2954
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Why not

2955
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
follow the middle way?

2956
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Don't burn out, just burn longer

2957
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
The middle way is for pussies

2958
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Let's hear what Nexus has to say

2959
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Here you go

2960
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Oh, fuck

2961
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Hey, PCB

2962
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Nexus here from Chile

2963
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
What a wig, man

2964
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Thing is, I found

2965
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
a very sexy poster

2966
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I drew for the Ratcon Arena 3

2967
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
that features Monty,

2968
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Egyptbro, Best Guy Ever, Tom Oliver

2969
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Give and Take

2970
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
and that guy from the Kickstarter

2971
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
So, I've been wondering

2972
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
which one of you guys

2973
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
would like to have the original art

2974
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
of that poster in particular

2975
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
There's a new post office downstairs

2976
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
even in the middle of the chaos

2977
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
in the city right now, so let me know

2978
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Oh, and by the way

2979
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
this is a present, meaning

2980
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
it's free

2981
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Oh fuck, no

2982
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I didn't say freedom, I said free

2983
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Oh, no way

2984
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
That's even worse

2985
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Oh

2986
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So, okay

2987
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I think it's only fair that me,

2988
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
an original member of the podcast gets that poster

2989
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Yeah, that's fair

2990
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I think as part of his severance package

2991
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
we actually owe it to Mumkey

2992
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Um, so

2993
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I think this was somewhere

2994
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
in the contract

2995
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Hey, remember all those good times we had without you

2996
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Here's a reminder, put it on your wall

2997
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Rest in peace, Mumkey

2998
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Oh my god

2999
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Listen, listen, listen

3000
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I have a PL box, you know the address, Nexus

3001
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Send it to me, I want it

3002
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I want it, I would appreciate it more

3003
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I bet it smells like ink

3004
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It probably does

3005
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You know, maybe we could in some way

3006
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
have some sort of game of

3007
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Yeah, maybe no, cut it into 8 pieces

3008
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
and send it to each of us

3009
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Damn, that's a good idea

3010
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
When we all

3011
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
like, unite, then we can

3012
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
see the full image

3013
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Honestly, yeah, and then like we have

3014
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
like at Radcon 4, we all come together

3015
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
and like put it together like that

3016
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Ooh, that would be sweet

3017
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
But Mage would have to get off her dumb ass

3018
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
and get over to North America

3019
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
No, you go, you come to England

3020
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Mage, how much money would it take

3021
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
to get you to come for Radcon

3022
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Yeah, give us enough

3023
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Okay, Mage, that's 100%

3024
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Not only

3025
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
How about 9,000 Nigerian dollars?

3026
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Mage, listen, listen

3027
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Let's just say theoretically

3028
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
your entire trip was paid for

3029
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
and let's just say for a crazy bonus

3030
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
you also will get paid

3031
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
$1,000, I'm keeping it trying

3032
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
to be reasonable here

3033
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I'm just saying

3034
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Just an exaggeration, would you

3035
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
come with that situation?

3036
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It's not about the price, having

3037
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
the journey

3038
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Is it the bother of having to take the trip

3039
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
and the babbling and all that?

3040
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I'm scared of traveling alone to America

3041
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
America scares me, can you blame me?

3042
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Oh, it's always right to settle down

3043
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
reasonably well at this point

3044
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I have a country with guns

3045
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'm scared

3046
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Where's carrying guns around?

3047
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Here's the thing

3048
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
You wouldn't be coming to the

3049
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
gun part of America, you'd be coming to

3050
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Massachusetts, which is like as European

3051
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
as America gets

3052
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Everyone wearing

3053
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
scary cowboy hats

3054
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
and guns all over the world

3055
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
That's like the Ontario

3056
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
That's like the Ontario

3057
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
of the United States, it's like its own

3058
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Ontario? Yeah, it's like a separate part

3059
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
No one gets these Canada

3060
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
metaphors you're using, no one understands anything about Canada

3061
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
No, not Ontario, Quebec

3062
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Quebec is sort of its own cultural enclave

3063
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
in Canada, I think

3064
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
because they have a French peaking part

3065
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Texas is its own fucking beast

3066
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Massachusetts is the good part

3067
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I don't want to go to Virginia, fuck Virginia

3068
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
We'll keep you posted

3069
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I got an observation to make

3070
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I got an observation to make about America

3071
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Mage, maybe you should be afraid

3072
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Listen, my personal life

3073
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I realized this the other day

3074
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
my personal life has been kind of shit

3075
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
ever since Trump got elected

3076
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
and I can't find

3077
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
a direct causal link

3078
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
but it can't be coincidence

3079
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
It has to be a connection, I know it

3080
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I know it in my heart

3081
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Ooh, when you got that

3082
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Trump derangement syndrome

3083
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
it's tough to relate to your fellow man

3084
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Wait, what is that?

3085
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Well, that is the thing

3086
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You attribute everything

3087
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
to what will happen to you at the Trump

3088
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
When you're just so steam

3089
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
that Orange Man is so bad

3090
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Is that a real thing? Is that like a phrase?

3091
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I mean, it's like a brain phrase

3092
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It's used to own the lives

3093
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Well, I better

3094
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I guess it's me

3095
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
No, it's not me

3096
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
That's victim blaming

3097
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It's not my fault for being mad

3098
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It's his fault for being bad and making me upset

3099
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
That's fair

3100
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
In addition to

3101
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
being scared of Trump

3102
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
In addition to Orange Man, yes

3103
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
It's also like

3104
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I tend to fall ill

3105
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
immediately after I travel

3106
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
so I kind of don't want to be ill

3107
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
in a foreign country

3108
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Have I talked about

3109
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
what happened to me right before I left

3110
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
to go to BronyCon this past year?

3111
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Much like Hillary Clinton

3112
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
you have not yet told us what happened

3113
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Please do so

3114
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Again, okay

3115
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Before I travel

3116
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I'm kind of a homebody as well

3117
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Before I travel

3118
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I get very nervous

3119
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I get very anxious

3120
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
and this was happening to me

3121
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I couldn't sleep, I was pacing around

3122
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
in my house, I was sweating

3123
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I was sweating a lot

3124
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I don't know, that just happens

3125
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Something that I do a lot

3126
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
when I'm stressed out is I'll cut my hair

3127
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
or I'll groom a lot

3128
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
a whole bunch of times or whatever

3129
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I'll take a bunch of showers

3130
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
So this time

3131
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I'm looking at myself and I'm brushing my teeth

3132
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
and I'm looking at my teeth and I'm like

3133
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Ah, damn these teeth

3134
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and I've got like

3135
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Damn these teeth

3136
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Get them out of my mouth now

3137
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
No, I've got this tooth whitening gel

3138
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
It comes in like a thing

3139
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So I might as well whiten my teeth

3140
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So I put this shit on my teeth

3141
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
and I put it in my mouth

3142
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
and I'm looking in

3143
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
and the stick gets on my gums

3144
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
and I have used it before

3145
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
and it has gotten on my gums before

3146
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and it's been fine, like it has not been a problem

3147
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
but this time it gets on my gums

3148
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
and a little piece of my gums

3149
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
just turns like chalk white

3150
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
bone white, like swollen

3151
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
weird looking, looks like cooked chicken

3152
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
whiter than my teeth

3153
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
it's just a little piece of my skin

3154
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
it just turns white, I'm like oh my god

3155
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I start like, I go in to have a little fucking

3156
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
attack, I have a little panic attack

3157
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
about it, I get like

3158
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
just distraught, I get emotionally distraught

3159
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I'm like weeping, right

3160
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I'm like, I'm rinsing my mouth out

3161
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
like a whole bunch of it, after a little while

3162
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
after a little while

3163
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
it starts to go down, it just starts kind of

3164
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
just turns kind of sore, but it goes away

3165
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
and I'm like oh thank god, I thought I was doomed

3166
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I thought I was just doomed to have fucking chicken mouth

3167
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
for the rest of my life

3168
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
but for that moment

3169
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I was like, I can't go, I can't leave the house

3170
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
like this, I'm a freak, I'm a freak

3171
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
well

3172
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
what was the point of that story?

3173
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I can't remember

3174
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
oh traveling, traveling, fear, before traveling

3175
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
or something, I've been using the crest white strips

3176
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
a little bit, I've been a little lazy

3177
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I'm gonna try to use them like every other day or something

3178
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
they seem, they're not bad

3179
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I haven't used my, that's the same kind of

3180
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I haven't used my, that whitening gel

3181
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
since this happened, I'm too scared to try again

3182
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I don't want to have a chicken

3183
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
it was very weird looking

3184
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
and I've never, it was like

3185
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
yeah, it was fucking scary, it was like

3186
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
body hard

3187
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
no, I'm sure, yeah

3188
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
fucking yikes

3189
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
well on this subject

3190
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
perhaps one day

3191
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I wonder how much it would really cost us

3192
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
to do like a rad con

3193
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
in England

3194
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
in London England, jolly old England

3195
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I mean considering you and

3196
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Gib and Mage wouldn't have to fly

3197
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
but then like, you know, five or six

3198
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
or seven or whatever of us would have to fly

3199
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
so that's gonna be a pretty penny

3200
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
but I don't know, I mean realistically

3201
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
it would be me, you,

3202
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Munchy, Digi

3203
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Jesse, if he went

3204
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
if he went, yeah

3205
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
well is Tom just not coming

3206
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
oh and Tom, well Tom definitely could

3207
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
but I can't remember everybody

3208
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
wait, that's like six people?

3209
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
let's say six people, yeah it seems about right

3210
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
assuming Jesse goes

3211
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I mean that right there, I don't know

3212
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I could easily imagine that would be like ten grand

3213
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
ten grand? no

3214
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
yeah, it's gotta be over a thousand dollars

3215
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
for people to fly to England from Merrick

3216
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
yeah, no, maybe you're right, yeah it could be

3217
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
are the tickets really that bad?

3218
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
no

3219
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
you know what, we could research this

3220
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I think it's usually able to fly for less

3221
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
we could get them for better

3222
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
we could probably get around-trip tickets

3223
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
for under a grand for each person

3224
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I'm seeing costs for like

3225
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I'm seeing costs for like six hundred

3226
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
for round-trip?

3227
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
for one person? oh not round-trip, my bad

3228
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
maybe it is, I don't know

3229
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
let me check

3230
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
round-trip, yeah, yeah

3231
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
round-trip, 633

3232
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
okay

3233
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
alright, hey, you know, that's not terrible

3234
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I mean still, for six people that ends up being like

3235
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
that would be a large percentage of the budget

3236
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
what airport would you guys use?

3237
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I don't know, Mage

3238
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I'm no London expert

3239
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
no, no, no, I'm asking the American

3240
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
which one you would use

3241
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
wait, I have a lot of CVG

3242
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
we don't need to go through the numbers right now

3243
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
but you can use CVG

3244
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
which airport I'd fly out of

3245
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
to England

3246
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I would fly out of

3247
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
it's Cincinnati

3248
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
yeah, Logan Airport

3249
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
she's probably going to crunch the

3250
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
numbers right now

3251
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I'm trying to, yeah, just like, how do you spell Cincinnati?

3252
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
we can do this later

3253
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
we've got approximate numbers

3254
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
if we raised, let's just say theoretically

3255
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
if we raised like $10,000 for a ride

3256
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
that's a pretty penny

3257
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
but I think it's theoretically possible

3258
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
for like a PCP in England or whatever

3259
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
the things we'd want would be

3260
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
air flight and then like

3261
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
we'd need some sort of sort of like Airbnb

3262
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
or some place to live while we're there

3263
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
would $10,000 cover it?

3264
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
probably, I think so

3265
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
probably cover it

3266
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
we probably also want Vic to be

3267
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
cameraman too, that's another

3268
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
expense as well

3269
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
but I don't know, whatever

3270
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
we'd have to fly Vic out and all his equipment

3271
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
and his equipment too

3272
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
maybe we just hire somebody else

3273
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
to do it locally, I don't know

3274
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
might make sense

3275
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
you'd also have to make it worth his while

3276
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
yeah, exactly

3277
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
we also paid him last time

3278
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
ideally, we're spending time doing this

3279
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I would like to get paid

3280
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I would like to at least not lose money

3281
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
on the venture, that would be nice

3282
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
which we have each time, but

3283
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I don't know, whatever, we'll see what happens

3284
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I, Radcom 4 man

3285
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Radcom 4

3286
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
the Sonichi Lecture 2

3287
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
is going to be a defining moment

3288
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I am like

3289
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I'm like

3290
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I'm creating history

3291
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
right now

3292
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
so that I can deliver it in

3293
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
that's the way to do it, that's what God did

3294
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
so that I can deliver it in

3295
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Sonichi Lecture 102

3296
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
beautiful

3297
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
this is what it's all about

3298
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
speaking of lectures, this just reminds me

3299
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
of a point I was going to say before

3300
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I avoided talking about this for a long time

3301
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
because it actually bothered me and grossed me out

3302
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
and I didn't like it

3303
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
and it gave me lots of anxiety

3304
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
so the final fantasy lecture

3305
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I did at Radcom 3

3306
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
there's a bunch of issues with it

3307
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
audio-wise, which is very unfortunate

3308
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
it wasn't perfect, it wasn't good as the Kingdom Hearts one

3309
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
that's fine, doesn't matter

3310
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
but the main thing I had about that

3311
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I was very sad that the audio was dorked in the way it was

3312
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
aside from that

3313
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I was very, very

3314
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
worried, I was considering just scrapping the entire

3315
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
video for one reason

3316
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
and it was that

3317
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
my, I had just shaved

3318
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
before doing it, I was very concerned about

3319
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
looking decent

3320
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I had just shaved and I was like

3321
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
bleeding a little bit

3322
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I was like, you guys were downstairs

3323
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
waiting for me and I'm upstairs

3324
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I had just shaved, I'm like, oh god

3325
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I'm bleeding, it's so gross

3326
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I don't want anyone to see it, it's so nasty

3327
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I hate it

3328
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
you should have seen, as I was editing the video

3329
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Michelle was like, Nate, shut the fuck, no one cares

3330
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Nate, just post the video

3331
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
you can't even see it

3332
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
and if you look real close, you may be able to

3333
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
detect some slight traces

3334
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
but basically no one can tell

3335
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I mean, not one person

3336
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
complaining about that, but like

3337
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
me at fucking Radcon 3

3338
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Fat Ben, of course

3339
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Fat Ben, unshaven Ben

3340
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
like, just like

3341
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
not decrepit, but like

3342
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
just like disheveled

3343
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
disheveled, terrible

3344
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
worst Ben

3345
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
man, oh, I look so fucking

3346
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I look so fucking bad at Radcon 3

3347
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I'm on camera basically every week now

3348
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
for Reagolas, but the real milestones

3349
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I want to get fit and get

3350
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
better in shape and whatnot

3351
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
so that for the next lecture, you know, the videos people actually care about

3352
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
it'll be a look

3353
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
a look that much better

3354
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
we were doing voicemails

3355
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
you're right, you're right

3356
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
and let's get back to it and wrap this pony up

3357
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
alright, this is

3358
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
okay, watch out, brace yourself

3359
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
this is an extremely scary voicemail

3360
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
warning, ultra haunted

3361
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
okay, so let's, it is the Halloween season

3362
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
this will be like one day after Halloween

3363
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
but nonetheless, okay, brace yourselves

3364
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
so you're with your honey

3365
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
and you're making out when

3366
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
the phone rings

3367
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
you answer it and the

3368
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
voice is, what are

3369
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
you doing with my daughter

3370
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
you tell your girl and she

3371
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
say, my dad is

3372
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
dead

3373
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
then who

3374
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
was

3375
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
phone

3376
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
phone was daddy

3377
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
daddy isn't her father

3378
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
daddy is

3379
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
the joke is well known

3380
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
the joke isn't done, but

3381
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
the production value was

3382
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
worth the play

3383
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
there's something you're misunderstanding here

3384
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
a phone, a dad

3385
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
is phone

3386
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I'm daddy

3387
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
not father

3388
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
yes, exactly

3389
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
this is some new John Tron level

3390
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
shit, I don't care about production value

3391
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
next, next

3392
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
alright, next voicemail, here we go

3393
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
this is from the leader of the

3394
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
PC partisans

3395
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
okay, alright, good, go

3396
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
greetings, PCP, this mission

3397
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
if you choose to accept it

3398
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
may very well change the entire world

3399
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
around you, it's coming to my

3400
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
attention, you're now all under house

3401
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
arrest by the PC police

3402
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
and may be subjected to gay

3403
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
rape, straight rape

3404
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
and even worse

3405
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
but we, the PC partisans can fix that

3406
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
we're leading a revolution

3407
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
to stop them and need your help

3408
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
the first 9-11 was so successful

3409
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
they're planning a sequel, 7-11

3410
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
we're on July 11th

3411
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
2020, 11, 7-11

3412
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
convenience stores, we're throwing

3413
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
their 7 important towers by Nazi

3414
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
vampires, hate off by the PC

3415
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
police and their martial masters

3416
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
this inside

3417
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
job will be leveraged to give full power

3418
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
to the Dark Lord and spell

3419
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
the end for America

3420
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
we can break you out

3421
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
but if you do, you need to help us

3422
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I'll wait your response

3423
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
but I NEED TO GO

3424
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
what do you think?

3425
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
oh man, man, is that guy in chili with nexus?

3426
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
yeah, a lot of gunshots today

3427
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I mean, okay

3428
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I don't, you know

3429
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I wasn't gonna do anything

3430
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
about the house arrest situation

3431
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
but 7-11

3432
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I'm just so charmed by the theming

3433
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
of this terrorist attack that I can't help

3434
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
but get on board with it

3435
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
you know, there was Homestuck

3436
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
there was Homestuck 2

3437
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
there was 9-11, then there was 7-11

3438
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and the rest was history

3439
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
equally good works of art

3440
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
okay, next one

3441
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
we're in

3442
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
we're in, we're fully on board

3443
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I'm comfortable speaking for the rest of us

3444
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
that we will all die for this cause

3445
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
no

3446
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
no, no, your protests are in vain

3447
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I mean, I'm

3448
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
putting distance between myself and this

3449
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
concept

3450
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
alright, next up, put mage on the front lines

3451
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
strap mage to the front of the plane

3452
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I'm not gonna be there, I won't be there

3453
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
alright, I think what he said

3454
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
what am I gonna do?

3455
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
we're gonna drive 7-7-11s

3456
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
into

3457
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Nazi vampires

3458
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
how are you gonna drive a 7-11?

3459
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I think we're going to

3460
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
bomb 7-7-11s

3461
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
on

3462
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I don't remember how the Nazi vampires

3463
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
come into it

3464
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
that's where I get my big gulps

3465
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I'm not bombing a 7-11

3466
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
you can't make an egg with that

3467
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
break into an obelisk

3468
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
we'll go in

3469
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I'll buy up their entire stock

3470
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
of cheeseburger bites

3471
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
and then you can do what you want with them

3472
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
that makes sense

3473
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
they don't even have the hot deals

3474
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
they don't even have the hot deals on

3475
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
rockstar ex-durance anymore

3476
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
it used to be 2 for 3 dollars

3477
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
an incredible bargain

3478
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
now what do you got like 2 for 5 for quake

3479
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
fuck quake

3480
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
die

3481
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
next voicemail

3482
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
we've got rustles

3483
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
sorry, it's rustle

3484
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
with name something scarier than a ghost

3485
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
with a gun

3486
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I think it's the rustle

3487
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I think so

3488
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
what's up guys

3489
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
it's your gangoy rustle here

3490
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
just calling in to let you know that a few months ago

3491
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I lost the only virginity

3492
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
that's actually worth a damn

3493
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
that's right

3494
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
shooting a gun

3495
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
a staccato p9mm handgun to be exact

3496
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
so I just wanted to ask

3497
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
what kind of guns have you guys shot in the past

3498
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
and if none

3499
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
what kind of guns do you want to shoot

3500
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
no guns

3501
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
no guns

3502
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I have fired a gun

3503
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
on a firing range before

3504
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
like once

3505
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
was it like a pistol

3506
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
one of those

3507
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
wait have I

3508
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I think I have

3509
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
me this episode

3510
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I'm scared to go to America because of guns

3511
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
every single voicemail

3512
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I don't like guns

3513
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I don't like guns either

3514
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I've shot one at a range before

3515
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
but I'm honestly now

3516
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
what about like Boy Scouts

3517
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
with the scouts I must have done it at some point

3518
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
really

3519
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
you did

3520
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
what was that

3521
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
in school

3522
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
we were like I think secondary grade

3523
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
we went to a police station

3524
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
you shot at the school mage

3525
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
we went on a little

3526
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
tour to a police station

3527
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
we were allowed to shoot

3528
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
that's crazy

3529
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
here play with my gun

3530
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
it's only filled with hollow points

3531
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
apparently shooting a gun isn't as

3532
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
uniquely experiential

3533
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
as I thought

3534
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
a lot of you guys are like just an hour counting that you

3535
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
shot a gun

3536
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
you a frequent shooter

3537
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
no I've never shot a gun before in my life

3538
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
but um

3539
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
it's just like

3540
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
it's the kind of thing you would definitely remember

3541
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
right exactly

3542
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
apparently not

3543
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I would have been like a decade or more ago

3544
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
so I'm like

3545
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I'm like 85% sure

3546
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I've also been to archery

3547
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
you're not even sure if you shot it

3548
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
that's how vague it is

3549
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
maybe with these fools

3550
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I remember absolutely explicitly shooting guns

3551
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
I have shot these exact guns

3552
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I shot BB guns stuff

3553
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
like at Boy Scouts for the rifle rearrange

3554
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
whatever

3555
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I did the shotgun shooting merit badge

3556
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
which I achieved as with the BB gun shooting one

3557
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
or the rifle shooting

3558
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
so I had my shotgun shooting merit badge

3559
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
it was fucking sick it was the best time ever

3560
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
we shot clay pigeons I was so fucking good at it

3561
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
it was absolutely dopey shit

3562
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
and actually just the other day

3563
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Michelle on Michelle's

3564
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
interest in the subject

3565
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
she was like maybe we should go shoot guns

3566
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I was like fuck yeah let's do that

3567
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
she would want to shoot guns

3568
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
there we're in Ohio now baby

3569
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
it's a wild west

3570
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
that's right

3571
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
so we haven't shot yet what we did was

3572
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
we went to the intro to firearms course

3573
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
and we were gonna set up for like a class

3574
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
where they teach you more stuff

3575
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
and then you actually go shoot pistols and real guns

3576
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
on a range and stuff so we'll probably do that sometime

3577
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
and I'm

3578
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
super fun it's fucking sick dude guns are dope

3579
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
epic

3580
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I'm way into it although they do

3581
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
terrify me and I don't want them around me

3582
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I don't know if it counts but like I remember

3583
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
like dad had a BB gun and I remember

3584
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
like shooting some cans with a BB gun

3585
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
but I feel like remember that time dad shot

3586
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
the fucking rabbit in the garden

3587
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
that fucking rabbit that psychopath

3588
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
what the fuck dad because it was just

3589
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
you didn't think it

3590
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I similarly remember my dad coming home

3591
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
one day he came home and it's like

3592
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
the first time he shot a gun and he like he had

3593
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
like the gun range like

3594
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
little sheet where you shoot it and he's like

3595
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
he hung it up in his office I was like okay cool

3596
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
in his office he's just like shooting across the room

3597
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
yeah you're real badass dad

3598
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
no no no like he brought it

3599
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
he brought home the sheet that he shot

3600
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
oh okay yeah yeah

3601
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
we did archery

3602
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
okay I've definitely shot BB guns

3603
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I

3604
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
think I don't remember

3605
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
if I shot a real gun at a range I've been to a range

3606
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
it might have been an archery range

3607
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I feel like

3608
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
we understand you exist in a state of quantum

3609
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
having shot a gun

3610
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
like disturbed by the fact that I'm not 100%

3611
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
sure on this question

3612
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
just go pick up a gun and shoot it

3613
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
and then put your questions to rest already

3614
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
alright let's move on here

3615
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
couple more we got um

3616
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
okay crates with pancakes

3617
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
hashtag free secho

3618
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
uh okay

3619
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
no he's literally under my boot

3620
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
deal right now my foot is on top of secho's body

3621
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
push it down

3622
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
push him

3623
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
squeeze him out

3624
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
the rates of dog incarceration are

3625
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
insane

3626
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
alright let's hear what he has to say

3627
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
hey crater here

3628
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
and Nate I'm calling you out

3629
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I was with my wife yesterday

3630
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
yeah I got a wife what of it

3631
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
and I see a dog on the corner of my

3632
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
eye

3633
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I got out of bed after fresh plow

3634
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
to the front porch

3635
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
and here comes secho rolling his fat

3636
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
dog ass over here

3637
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
so I said

3638
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
help me it's Nate

3639
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
he keeps giving me fuel

3640
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
and he just keeps feeding me

3641
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
and feeding me

3642
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and he just won't stop

3643
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Nate

3644
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
I contacted animal control

3645
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
and they're on their way right now

3646
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
oh

3647
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I think that's them

3648
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
by the way can we please get fan art

3649
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
a vorporn of secho eating

3650
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Nate please

3651
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
oh no

3652
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
it has to be in the furriard style

3653
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
it's the only way

3654
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
the only way to stop eating

3655
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
is to consume that

3656
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
which gives the

3657
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
forces you to consume I guess

3658
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I can just imagine Nate

3659
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
a big bag

3660
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
of liquid fuel

3661
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
you just could dump it out into secho's bowl

3662
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
just slather it all over the floor

3663
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
we hook it up to an IV

3664
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
so he can't even not eat

3665
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
you and him subsisting

3666
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
on the same weird mineral

3667
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I pour it into the trough

3668
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
and we both stick our heads through our respective holes

3669
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
and we just lap it up

3670
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
that's how it goes

3671
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
we've been reduced to animals in this society

3672
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
let's go to the next voicemail

3673
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
ghost of

3674
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
voice

3675
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
the ghost of bad voicemails

3676
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
okay

3677
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
let's see what he has

3678
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
there's a lot of those ghosts

3679
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
it's gonna be an all-star one

3680
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
go

3681
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
who knocks at this time of night

3682
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
ooh

3683
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
it is I

3684
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
the ghost of bad voicemails

3685
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I am a specter born

3686
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
from the twisted souls

3687
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
of those who died

3688
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
in voice jade

3689
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
ooh

3690
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
and I have come

3691
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
to kill you

3692
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
what the fuck

3693
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
I am the ghost

3694
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
of bad voicemails

3695
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
fucking

3696
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
spooky

3697
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
look

3698
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I don't know what the point of this is

3699
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I don't know what you're trying to sell me

3700
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I'm definitely not scared

3701
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
there is

3702
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
no point

3703
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
you better start believing

3704
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
bad voicemails

3705
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
because you're in one

3706
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
because you're in one

3707
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I was only pretending

3708
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
to be an idiot

3709
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
the twist ending

3710
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
the ghost of bad voicemails

3711
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
was no ghost at all

3712
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
for he yet lives

3713
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
he lives on in our hearts

3714
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
this is a living breathing bad voicemail

3715
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
before I take this very moment

3716
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
alright well how many more do we got

3717
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000

02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
two more okay here we go

3719
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
we got another call from not even

3720
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
clusterpunk can save me now

3721
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
now the pc police

3722
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000

3723
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
alright let's see what we got go

3724
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
sir I'm sorry

3725
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
don't want your damn excuses

3726
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I want best guy

3727
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
ever's head

3728
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
why didn't you illuminate him

3729
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
there was an

3730
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
unforeseen variable

3731
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
we were attacked by a ferocious

3732
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
frothing at the mouth giraffe

3733
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
oozing with AIDS

3734
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
he held back our main

3735
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
a giraffe

3736
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
a fucking giraffe held back

3737
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
my main squadron

3738
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
well not just a giraffe sir

3739
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
there was also this rotom canine

3740
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
that

3741
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
any other pcp

3742
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
members that you were successful in locating

3743
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
well we're currently

3744
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
researching this wacky place

3745
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
called England for suspect hippo

3746
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
after many failed attempts

3747
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
at locating him in Africa

3748
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
or any local zoos

3749
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
we've also discovered through tireless research

3750
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
that best guy ever has an older

3751
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
brother named Ben St

3752
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
we've never found the dumpsters in Boston

3753
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
that Ben St can be living in

3754
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
so it's only a matter of time before we dig him up

3755
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
no I'm always on the move

3756
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
very good

3757
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
we may have had a misstep with that

3758
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
ferocious giraffe and rotom dog

3759
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
but soon

3760
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
very soon they'll be making t-shirts

3761
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
saying one of the reason why

3762
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
the pcp are dying

3763
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
oh no

3764
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
what you gonna do

3765
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
the pcp

3766
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
the pcp

3767
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
the pcp police closed its grip

3768
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
more and more every day

3769
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
it's just propaganda

3770
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I'm not worried about it

3771
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
they'll never find me

3772
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I'm slippery

3773
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
literally like I'm covered in grease

3774
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
yes absolutely

3775
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
you are slime

3776
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
oh so that's why you degreased the pizzas

3777
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
to put it on yourself

3778
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I eat so much pizza grease

3779
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I sweat it now

3780
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
we call it grease

3781
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
first cousin of slime

3782
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
it's related to ooze

3783
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and slime and sludge

3784
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
you know I was actually curious

3785
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I don't know if you addressed this

3786
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
was he dying that looked like a friolator

3787
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
full of grease

3788
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
no it is a chemical vat

3789
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
this has been canon since the beginning

3790
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
of slime oids

3791
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
the way to kill a slime oid

3792
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
is to throw it into a dissolution vat

3793
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
oh I see

3794
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
fair enough

3795
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
now you can have multiple slime oids

3796
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
in bottles

3797
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
but before if you wanted a new slime oid

3798
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
you had to go to the labs

3799
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
and dissolve your old one

3800
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
oh so this bottle thing that

3801
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
is actually that's like lore

3802
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
that was in there already

3803
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I had no idea

3804
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
bottling slime oids is how you

3805
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I think you can have like three

3806
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
pokeballs

3807
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
in bottles

3808
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
that's it

3809
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
next voicemail here we go

3810
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000

3811
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
fave chip calling in go

3812
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
question for y'all

3813
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
do you guys have a

3814
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
favorite

3815
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
chip

3816
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
that's it

3817
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
that's the whole voicemail

3818
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I gotta tell you this was voicemail god

3819
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
he had so many voicemails once again

3820
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I didn't play this out of pity

3821
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I like chips and I did want to talk about

3822
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
my favorite chip

3823
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
but he has so many voicemails

3824
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
relax dude, relax

3825
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
just make them on average better

3826
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
what's your answer

3827
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
what's your favorite chip

3828
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I think

3829
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I like

3830
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
what are they called like new england style

3831
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
like the really crunchy

3832
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
cape cod chips

3833
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
cape cod potato chips

3834
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I think those are my favorite

3835
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
it's like you're breaking someone's spine

3836
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
in your mouth

3837
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Tom sound familiar

3838
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
it's great

3839
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
yeah no I love those

3840
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
you ever had

3841
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
there's like a certain brand of potato chip

3842
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
they come in a black bag

3843
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
they look gourmet

3844
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
and they have one kind that is like blue potato chips

3845
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
made out of blue potatoes

3846
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
and they have another kind

3847
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
they have another kind that is like

3848
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
it's like a mix of like

3849
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
taro root and sweet potato

3850
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
and like two other like different tubers

3851
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
and they have chips at all

3852
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
those are super good too

3853
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I really like those

3854
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I think I've had them but

3855
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
mage, zen, comments

3856
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
yeah

3857
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
the thing that first comes to my mind is like

3858
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
well I was listening

3859
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
to this song by this rapper named young i may

3860
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
and she's awesome gotta check her out

3861
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
and she has this line in her newest song

3862
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
she says pinky ring out the puddle

3863
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
hot sauce under ruffles

3864
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
and I was thinking

3865
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
god that must be pretty tight

3866
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
you know for you to mention

3867
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
it in a song that must be pretty good

3868
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
cause I like ruffles never had hot sauce on

3869
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
indeed I might try it out

3870
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
she's just shouting out ruffled potatoes

3871
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
yep that's it

3872
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I feel like

3873
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I don't, I think I'm against

3874
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
ruffles in principle

3875
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
I kind of think they're overhyped

3876
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
really what

3877
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
they don't get that much acclaim

3878
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
you see it on the bag

3879
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
and it's like ooh ruffles

3880
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
it's like a

3881
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
point of sale it's like a selling

3882
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
point and I'm like I just don't, I don't get it

3883
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
oh you mean like the actual ridges on them

3884
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
yeah

3885
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I like that texture

3886
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
it's fine I don't know whatever it's a lateral move

3887
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I feel like it's a lateral move that gets overhyped

3888
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I

3889
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I usually like sour cream and onion

3890
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
that's pretty basic I also like

3891
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
um barbecue Pringles

3892
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
yeah

3893
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
but there was this one

3894
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I used in Latina and never again

3895
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
because I could never find them again

3896
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
they just disappeared off of the face of the earth

3897
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I don't remember what flavor they were

3898
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
but like they were absolutely perfect

3899
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
they were like sweet a little bit spicy

3900
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
but not too spicy because I don't like too spicy

3901
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
but a little bit of spice just a little bit

3902
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
to get the little kid but they were sweet

3903
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
and I just like when I ate them I just

3904
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I couldn't stop they were just so delicious

3905
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
they were really next day to get more

3906
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
because I just I wanted to know what flavor

3907
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
it was to just like to just to get more

3908
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
of it and they were gone and and like

3909
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
what for as long as I was in Latina

3910
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
this year they never again

3911
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
stopped those chips wait what brand

3912
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
what brand was it

3913
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I don't remember I don't remember

3914
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I don't know I'm

3915
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
going to be tormented for the rest of my life

3916
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
mystery chip that's how to get you

3917
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
yeah

3918
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
okay I have a question everyone

3919
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
yeah opinion on

3920
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
salt and vinegar

3921
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
oh never been a fan

3922
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
you know what

3923
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I'm surprised how popular

3924
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
they are in England

3925
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
byter loves them they're their favorite

3926
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
when I was a kid I like

3927
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
smelled like like I knew people

3928
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
would eat them and I would smell it and think

3929
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
it smelled disgusting and I was like

3930
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
gross but then as an adult

3931
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I tried them and I'm like you know what I get

3932
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
it so I've I I didn't

3933
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
used to like them but I change my

3934
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
right and I was not a fan

3935
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I used to hate them but now

3936
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
sometimes a little bit is just

3937
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
fine it depends on the brand

3938
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I think it's like the

3939
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
it's the walkers I think

3940
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
the UK version of them I feel like

3941
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I know that like some people are

3942
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
against just like no it's

3943
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
like some people just don't get salt and vinegar

3944
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
but I guess we're all

3945
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
we're all down with the strong yeah

3946
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I think we're all cool when I was young yeah

3947
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I've transitioned from the like childish

3948
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
like it's gross I don't think it's gross

3949
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
I just can't take too many

3950
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
of them and I'm not a big fan

3951
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I like how it stains

3952
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
your mouth

3953
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I like to over do it

3954
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
with stuff like that

3955
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I gotta tell you a story

3956
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
speaking of chips right I was eating

3957
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
chips today but not real chips

3958
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
because

3959
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
somebody left

3960
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
a monster energy drink

3961
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
in my freezer

3962
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
and it exploded

3963
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
and then it froze to the edges

3964
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
of the freezer

3965
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
so I had to de-ice

3966
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
the freezer but I noticed

3967
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
that some of the ice

3968
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
was green

3969
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
and I was like this just seems like a damn waste

3970
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
so I broke off chunks of this ice

3971
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
frozen this and I tried it and I gotta tell you

3972
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
it was it was delicious

3973
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
it tasted like sweet

3974
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
cotton candy

3975
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
it was super good

3976
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
this was the best ice

3977
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
but then I was licking I'm like wait a minute

3978
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
it wasn't a diet monster

3979
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
these aren't keto ice chips

3980
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
but it's okay

3981
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I only had a couple

3982
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
anyway it was very excited

3983
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
and I was like and like my friend

3984
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
that same friend

3985
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
who said that my burger was fucked up

3986
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
even though it wasn't and he got me a second burger

3987
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
he was there I'm saying like guys

3988
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
you know you're not gonna believe me

3989
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
it's frozen monster ice chips

3990
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
it's actually super good

3991
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
and of course everyone's like oh Ben

3992
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
you're so fucking crazy

3993
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
you're such a weird eccentric guy

3994
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
just like when you said that watering down

3995
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
your orange juice just gives you more orange juice

3996
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
you're so crazy

3997
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
but then exactly like that time

3998
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
I got Lorenz to try some of this ice

3999
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
and he's like it's actually really good

4000
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
just like with the orange juice I was 100% right

4001
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
fully exonerated

4002
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Ben are you aware of the product

4003
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
it's a drop 50

4004
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
which is just it's just

4005
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
it's that they just took orange juice

4006
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
they literally it's an ingredient

4007
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
half orange juice half water

4008
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
just half orange juice

4009
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
why would you ever buy that

4010
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
when you could just buy regular orange juice

4011
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
for the same price and water it down

4012
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
and get twice as much

4013
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
because they're trying to pull the wool over your eyes

4014
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
that's all there is to it

4015
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
fucking cut your own orange juice with water dudes

4016
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
with the samurai sword

4017
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
by the way I sorry guys

4018
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
double cheese is so good

4019
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
double cheese delay like extra cheesy

4020
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
flavors for chips are good

4021
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
wait double cheese

4022
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I used to like those but

4023
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
it's like the crazy like

4024
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
flavor bomb chips they're too much

4025
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
for me I can't I can't deal with that

4026
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
sometimes I'll have too much

4027
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
of one thing over like a two week

4028
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
or you know whatever long

4029
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
period and then like

4030
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I just have this aversion

4031
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
do it completely like one time

4032
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
like it was like Dr Pepper

4033
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
and Domino's for me

4034
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
and now I just cannot have it

4035
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
at all anymore it also makes me sick

4036
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
one time I got like a big I was a kid

4037
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
and I got a big bag of salsa Verde

4038
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Doritos and I ate the whole

4039
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
bag of salsa Verde Doritos they're kind of

4040
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
spicy but they're pretty good and then

4041
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
that night for dinner we had tacos

4042
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
and then I woke up in the middle of the night

4043
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
and I had to puke really bad and

4044
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I puked it all up and it was spicy

4045
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
and it tasted Mexican

4046
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
and the puke was like

4047
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I could taste the salsa Verde Doritos

4048
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
and I didn't have Doritos for a long

4049
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
time after that because real fucking nasty

4050
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
makes sense

4051
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
just my buddy Garf

4052
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
my buddy Garf did the same thing with vodka

4053
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I think that's far more common experience

4054
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
dude the thing about puking up vodka

4055
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
is you get drunk on the way up too

4056
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
eww

4057
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I guess

4058
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I guess

4059
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
last voicemail right

4060
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
you know I was going to say

4061
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
that was allegedly last I lied

4062
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
to you guys but there was actually one

4063
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
secret final voicemail

4064
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
brace yourself because this is the

4065
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000

02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
