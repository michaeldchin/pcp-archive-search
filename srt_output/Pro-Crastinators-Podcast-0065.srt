1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hiya.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hiya.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, no, no. It's just that it's called Hiya.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But it's a type of Hiya.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's called Hiya, but I don't think so.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's amazing how great it is.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you put the weight in and turn it,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
even if something bad happens, it's okay to put it in the book.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's my opinion.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've been doing a series of online online classes since I was a child.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've been doing online online classes since I was a child.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most important thing is not to fall.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've been doing online classes since I was a child.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's how you think.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's how I think.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm the best guy ever.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Last week was a mistake. I'll never leave you again.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I swear upon my Lord Jesus Christ.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
With us today is Mumkey Jones.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, he's having a tough time right now.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ben St. is here.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And Hippocrite is also joining us.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fuck your enthusiasm.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Fuck you. Fuck the PCP.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Fuck my ass and suck my dick.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The PCP is what you got left.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's all I have left is the PCP.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You fuckers have more subs than me now, God damn it.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's true. Let's address this right away.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Guys, there's been a terrible event in case you haven't heard.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mumkey's channel was in fact deleted.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was destroyed from YouTube.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His main channel due to infringement of what was it?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Terms of service or something?

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wasn't it violent content?

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No, it was. I made fun of Muslims one time too many

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and they couldn't handle it.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I mean, that certainly seems to be the case.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
His Sharia law video, in fact,

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you were making jokes about how many subs you will lose.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You did in fact lose all of them as it turns out,

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
which is a certain kind of hilarity.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But it's quite sad.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So first of all, Mumkey's migrating his work

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
over to his Mumkey Jones 2 channel,

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
which is now just called Mumkey Jones, as I understand it, right?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Link in the description, of course.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We need to update all our links on the PCP.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, I don't care.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, alright.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Fair enough.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But, I mean, I don't know what's appropriate.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I guess, sub to his new channel.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you like Mumkey shit, even if you don't like it,

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
support the man, because it's not right what's been done to him.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Subscribe to his new channel, or his, you know, his most,

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
his current channel, his real channel, Mumkey Jones,

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and give it to his Patreon, just to say,

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
fuck you, YouTube.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We support people who do things you don't like,

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
just across the board.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Anything you oppose were for.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Send YouTube your emails, and fucking tweet at YouTube,

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and just fucking spam YouTube.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is there a link we can use?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can tell them to send shit to?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's like a bunch of ways to contact YouTube,

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but I don't know which one's the right one.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Incidentally, this will be a week ago,

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
by the time this actually goes up.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, I might actually have my channel back by this time.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's funny.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The depth episode premieres tomorrow,

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and the whole time I brag about how many subs I have,

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so it's gonna be really funny.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's gonna be really funny for people who hate me.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's true. That will be an interesting arc.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I can't wait.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm gonna avoid that comment section like the plague.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, if your channel's not back by the time this goes up,

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and people want to...

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll probably be dead.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Alright, and people want to complain about it.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Where should we send?

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How should we protest to YouTube about it?

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think I can find the link where they can fill out a form,

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and I'll probably put it in the description.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Can we put it in the description?

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And by the way, I'd like just people...

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think it will be most constructive to not just send them,

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you know, like Islamic State videos

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
with like, you know, YouTube logo

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
shoot over the journalist who's getting his head beheaded.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, just like...

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Those sorts of things will not be constructive.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't take the Trump approach.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, now that's evil.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't go crazy and tell them, send them death threats,

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
or what you've done is evil.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You want to just be...

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You want to help...

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is real shit, people. Let's not fuck around.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is real shit.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So be polite.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And say, you have made a mistake.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please correct this, Monkey Jones.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This clearly was not hate speech of any kind.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was simply criticism.

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right.

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You know, in a satirical fashion.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So go take that tack, guys,

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
if you want to really help.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I certainly do.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So there you go.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There you go.

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do what you can, people.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I guess...

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, so moving on.

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Our topic for today is being prolific.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Whoa.

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Being prolific.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So I...

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Me and Nate have been doing...

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And Monkey, really.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Monkey's always been quite prolific.

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I did it once.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I did it once a long time.

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Once in a...

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
T-Bap was prolific.

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Every blue moon.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
T-Bap was prolific.

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, yeah.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I forgot about T-Bap.

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, T-Bap was pretty prolific back in the day.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Before doing me and Mavva,

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I always used to reminisce about how productive I was

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
during the T-Bap days,

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and how much I loved it.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But now I've upgraded my most recent productivity memory.

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
These days, I reminisce about how productive I was

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
when I was drawing Brunswick.

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That was my, like, golden age.

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I haven't been able to recapture it in a while.

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know, I'm sure this will come up a lot.

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And certainly not to criticize,

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because I love the work that you do.

154
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Get the fucking...

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't fucking criticize me.

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You would say the same thing yourself.

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And you did when talking about Brunswick.

158
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because when you started Brunswick,

159
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
it was a tougher art style.

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But like you said,

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you were able to get it out really fucking fast.

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then as you got further,

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you kind of, like, you know,

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you sort of developed more of, like, a connection with it.

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Or you want it to be really great,

166
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
because you put so much time and work into it.

167
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And, like, you start taking longer on pages,

168
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and they get better.

169
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Like, I started out with it,

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
like, I'm just gonna fucking blast it out

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and not care that much about how it looks.

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But, like, the further I got into it,

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and the more important it felt,

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
like, the less I was able to do that.

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, like, yeah, like, early on,

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I was like, I'm gonna draw, like, one,

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
maybe two pages a day.

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I did.

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But then towards the end,

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it was more like,

182
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
maybe I'll get a page done every other day.

183
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I mean, from the beginning,

184
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
like, the pages were smaller,

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
so there was, like, less to do on them.

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, like, it was, I don't know,

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
like, everything about that,

188
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
like, the way I approached Brunswick

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
just, like, led to, like, it getting done really fast.

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And it was really good.

191
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I think I need to fucking,

192
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think I need to fucking, like,

193
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
maybe once champion's done,

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I need to fucking take a minute

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and, like, look at my life

196
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and look at myself and, like,

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
maybe go back and...

198
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Take a look at yourself,

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
then make a change.

200
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And just, like, try and, like,

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
try and, like, see what I can take from that

203
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and, like, put that in my fucking workflow, you know?

204
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Like, try and replicate those circumstances.

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I just had, like, an idea

206
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
while you were talking then,

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
just then, because, like,

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I feel like you just need a project

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
that you feel, like,

210
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you want to make more than you want to hone.

211
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like, you, like, like...

212
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I disagree.

213
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, no, no.

214
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What I mean is, like,

215
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
spending too much time on each, like, drawing

216
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
makes it take so long

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and then you feel bad.

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But if you had, like, a project

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that was sort of, like,

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you didn't care too much,

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but it was sort of fun to do,

222
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that, you know, that could be, like,

223
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
a good way to just get some...

224
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Get yourself on that, like,

225
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
choo-choo train of just making things.

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I had an idea.

227
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, you mean, like...

228
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You mean, like, take a break

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
from, like, the other stuff

230
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and, like, do something

231
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
that's less, like, quote-unquote important?

232
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, well, I was going to say, like,

233
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
doing a HD re-release of Sonichu,

234
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
like, just drawing the whole thing yourself.

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
God.

236
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
People have done that, actually,

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but I see what you're saying.

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That would take so fucking long, dude.

239
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well, I would actually say,

240
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think a strategy...

241
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I mean, here I go,

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
shelling my own shit,

243
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
but, like, doing a, like,

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
maybe I'll actually draw a page a day.

245
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Like, a challenge like that

246
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
that forces you into the play position.

247
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I thought about it.

248
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I thought about it.

249
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't do it with Champion.

250
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If I start...

251
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Not Champion, sure.

252
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not Champion, but something else.

253
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I started a new thing,

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I could maybe stick to a page a day

255
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
for, like, a month.

256
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Like...

257
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'd think about it.

258
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Like, I could have done that

259
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
with Brunswick.

260
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I could maybe have done that

261
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with Brunswick.

262
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So, yeah, it's a possibility.

263
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I might really like it

264
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
if you did a comic version

265
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
of some of your recent

266
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Nuzlocke adventures,

267
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
if there were any, like,

268
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
characters that stick out

269
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
in your mind.

270
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, what about,

271
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
what about Banana's Final Day?

272
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or, you know, like, that one?

273
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Something like that.

274
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know?

275
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Um...

276
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wait, you, sorry.

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You said, like,

278
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
like, comic adaptations

279
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
of, like, pieces of the Nuzlocke's?

280
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, sure.

281
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Um...

282
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

283
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's a really good idea.

284
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's a really good idea.

285
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I really...

286
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Please do Banana's Final Day.

287
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Please, if you had to do it.

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's my favorite thing

289
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that's ever happened.

290
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Banana's Final Day,

291
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
or Banana's Big Day Out

292
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
or whatever I call it,

293
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is my favorite moment

294
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
from both series.

295
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This is amazing.

296
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm here, everybody.

297
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh!

298
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm late.

299
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I...

300
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Did we just start?

301
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We've...

302
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No, we've been going for

303
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
10 minutes or so,

304
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but only because we already

305
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
have been waiting

306
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
for people such as you

307
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to show up in the first place.

308
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you're...

309
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, if I'm too late,

310
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll just go

311
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
if you don't want me here.

312
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No.

313
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I'm here now.

314
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, it's fine.

315
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right?

316
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think, guys,

317
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
let's do a quick vote.

318
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Who votes Jesse can stay.

319
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yay!

320
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Stay!

321
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I vote yay.

322
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I vote yay.

323
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yay.

324
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
All right.

325
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Sorry.

326
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I just got home.

327
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was at the happiest place

328
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
in the world,

329
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the Gibraltar Trade Center.

330
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a big, grimy,

331
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
dirty flea market

332
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
full of cool stuff.

333
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We...

334
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't think they're joined.

335
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They can't.

336
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I want you here.

337
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want Jesse here.

338
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm a weak.

339
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm a weak man.

340
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't hold on my own rules.

341
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Monkey,

342
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
do you have any strong feelings

343
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
about this?

344
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, that's...

345
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's because the...

346
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's give him 10% less pay

347
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so I can get my money's worth.

348
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The rules...

349
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, you're getting dark.

350
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The rules document...

351
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The rules document says

352
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you can join late

353
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and it's fine.

354
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Like, that's...

355
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like, that's what the

356
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
explicitly written rules say.

357
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, I think that, like,

358
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
30 minutes late

359
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
should be the cutoff

360
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
for two weeks.

361
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is 25 minutes.

362
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
25 minutes.

363
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's very damn fucking close.

364
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

365
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're under the wire.

366
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're under the wire

367
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that you put there yourself

368
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
slightly above yourself.

369
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Just now.

370
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, we'll work on this later.

371
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't care if you're here.

372
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We'll figure it out.

373
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
By the way,

374
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
before we get too crazy,

375
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
let me actually read,

376
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
just for fun,

377
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the Urban Dictionary Definition

378
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
of Prolific.

379
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Just because...

380
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, I think you'll find it

381
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
interesting.

382
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

383
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So here's the top definition,

384
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Prolific.

385
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Utterly, unexceptional,

386
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
absolutely average.

387
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Person one,

388
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
did you go to that alternative

389
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
rap show on the weekend?

390
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Person two,

391
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
yeah, it was prolific, eh?

392
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This is the worst...

393
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That doesn't sound right at all.

394
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's just wrong, yeah.

395
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Listen to the next one.

396
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is the second one.

397
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Prolific.

398
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
A dumb man's profound

399
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
actually means

400
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
fertile or producing.

401
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean, I guess that

402
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
second part's true.

403
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, so they're saying

404
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
that people confuse the words.

405
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And people...

406
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I guess so.

407
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And, like, the first one

408
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is just that confusion

409
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
or something.

410
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've never been confused

411
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
on this word.

412
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Does anyone actually think

413
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
this means mediocre or something?

414
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, whatever.

415
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, I gotta say that

416
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm actually pro-choicic.

417
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wow.

418
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Nice.

419
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thanks, Ibo.

420
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Just like my girl Hillary,

421
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
my hero.

422
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It could be a statement that

423
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
people who play out a lot of stuff

424
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
evidently have a lower quality

425
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
since they, like,

426
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
do too much work.

427
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think that's what they're

428
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
trying to get at.

429
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think that's what they're

430
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
trying to get at with this.

431
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like, if you're prolific,

432
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
then you obviously aren't working

433
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
that hard.

434
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Wait, what was the second one?

435
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
A dumb man's profuse?

436
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A dumb man's profound.

437
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Profound.

438
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A dumb man's profound.

439
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Actually means fertile

440
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
or producing.

441
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Does that mean the person

442
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
using prolific in that way

443
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is a dumb man or...?

444
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, yeah.

445
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you use a word wrong,

446
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you're dumb.

447
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I would agree that

448
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
we're all dumb.

449
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

450
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But not dumb enough

451
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that we would ever

452
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
incorrectly, you know,

453
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
misspeak

454
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
or anything.

455
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, never.

456
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Or use one word

457
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
when we meant another.

458
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That should be our slogan,

459
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
not dumb enough.

460
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
All right.

461
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, let's,

462
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know,

463
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
where should we take this?

464
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do we want to just talk about

465
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the trials and tribulations

466
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
of being prolific

467
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
on millions or web?

468
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Now, monkey is,

469
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think, consistently

470
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the most prolific man here

471
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
when he's not doing

472
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
a big, big, gay event.

473
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When his channel's not

474
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
fucking deleted.

475
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, that too.

476
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That too.

477
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, monkey,

478
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
why don't you tell us

479
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
about your approach

480
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to your content?

481
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Where prolificity

482
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
pertains to it?

483
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I guess that's the word.

484
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So, I have a

485
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
dry erase board

486
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
up on my wall

487
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
above my desk

488
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and it has my

489
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
daily schedule.

490
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And, well,

491
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't really follow it.

492
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I love it already.

493
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I love it.

494
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I got cucked.

495
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But it's pretty much

496
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
like this.

497
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Sunday through Wednesday,

498
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I would do

499
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
work on main channel videos.

500
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I treat it like

501
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
an actual job

502
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
eight hours a day

503
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
every day.

504
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So, that's how

505
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I crank out all this shit.

506
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then the PM

507
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
record the

508
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I S M A podcast

509
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
AM

510
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
of Thursday.

511
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Edit the podcast.

512
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You have to

513
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
schedule this shed out

514
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and treat it like a real job.

515
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I love you, monkey.

516
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is perfect.

517
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is perfect.

518
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go.

519
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've got a massive

520
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
erection right now.

521
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Please continue.

522
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Fridays are dedicated

523
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to recording Let's Plays.

524
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then Saturday

525
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in the AM,

526
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you edit those mother fuckers.

527
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then Saturday

528
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in the PM,

529
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
you record the PCP.

530
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And there you go.

531
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's my week.

532
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's what my week

533
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
used to be before I decided

534
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going to kill myself.

535
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And is that to have

536
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Sundays off?

537
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No.

538
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sundays I work on

539
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
main channel videos.

540
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't get a day off.

541
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because my job

542
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is making fucking

543
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
YouTube videos.

544
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Exactly.

545
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Days off are for

546
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
week faggots.

547
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Every day is a day off.

548
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I love it.

549
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Days off are

550
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
literally a fake

551
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
meme.

552
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A fake news

553
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
created by unions

554
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to trick us into

555
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
thinking that we're

556
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
less cool than we

557
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
actually are

558
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
as human beings.

559
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Weekends are for

560
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
if you've got a shit job

561
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that I'm sure you're

562
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
totally into a weekend.

563
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Weekends are for

564
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
people with bad jobs.

565
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's what they are.

566
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It says that like

567
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
entertainment or the arts

568
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is not a real job.

569
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fuck that.

570
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If that person

571
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
has a quote

572
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
real job where they

573
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
get a fucking weekend

574
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and days off

575
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and get to go home at

576
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
5 p.m.

577
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Fuck them.

578
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They're the lazy ones.

579
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
They're scum.

580
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
They're nothing to me.

581
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I work

582
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
fucking 25 hours a day

583
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
366 days a year.

584
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Never had an off day

585
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
since before I was born.

586
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Fuck you.

587
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Die.

588
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And the way that

589
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've been getting those

590
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is actually every

591
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
PCP is recorded.

592
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We actually talk

593
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
10 times speed and then

594
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
we slow down.

595
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Except for today

596
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
when I can 10 minutes late

597
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
for the podcast

598
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
because I was at a flea market.

599
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The happiest place.

600
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The only day off

601
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I've ever had in my life

602
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and I still made it

603
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to work on time.

604
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

605
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
On time.

606
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What was the place called again?

607
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Roughly on time.

608
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Whatever.

609
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

610
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's great.

611
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Jesse, what was that

612
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
place called again?

613
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I just it sounded magical.

614
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Gibraltar World Fair

615
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
or something.

616
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The Gibraltar Trade Center.

617
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Amazing.

618
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I went today.

619
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's like my favorite

620
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
place in the world.

621
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's like an hour away.

622
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Fantastic.

623
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Like an airplane hanger.

624
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Fucking grimy ghetto

625
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
flea market full of like,

626
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
you know, just like

627
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
vendors full of stuff.

628
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah.

629
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And there's this huge

630
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
sign.

631
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll post a picture

632
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
of me by the sign.

633
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's the sign of this

634
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
of this dandy gentleman

635
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in like a bowler derby

636
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and a brown pinstripe suit

637
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with a cane.

638
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And he's like,

639
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
welcome to the Gibraltar

640
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Trade Center.

641
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm Gibraltar

642
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and welcome to my stuff.

643
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You can buy my stuff.

644
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He's my best friend.

645
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He's my hero.

646
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He's my father.

647
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I took a picture

648
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
standing next to him.

649
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I went is because

650
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
after this summer,

651
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
after 37 years,

652
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the Gibraltar Trade Center

653
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
is closing its doors

654
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
once and for all.

655
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And it's the saddest thing ever.

656
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So yeah.

657
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So I called up my secretary.

658
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I said,

659
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
we have to go to Gibraltar

660
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
every day this summer

661
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
before it closes.

662
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Ben,

663
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
remember that trade center

664
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
that we went to

665
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
where I think we a,

666
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
we sold our original

667
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
NES with all our games.

668
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like,

669
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
no, no, no.

670
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's not that's

671
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you're misremembering

672
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
because we sold our original

673
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
NES at a GameStop.

674
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And I know

675
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
because they ripped us off

676
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
for an original copy

677
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
of Kid Icarus,

678
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
which they gave us

679
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
a measly,

680
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
miserly,

681
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
$1.

682
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Parsemonious,

683
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
$8 for.

684
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Fucking cucks.

685
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And the one cent

686
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
for like all our games.

687
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Probably could have got

688
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
like 30 or 50 for it.

689
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why the fuck

690
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
did we sell that?

691
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay, but forget that.

692
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But I do remember,

693
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I do remember a flea market.

694
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I do remember

695
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the Gibraltar

696
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
trade center.

697
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It sounds so funny to me.

698
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And it's because

699
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the World Trade Center,

700
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
that's the first thing.

701
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was thinking it.

702
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I was thinking it.

703
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I never realized

704
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
they got the World Trade Center

705
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and not the Gibraltar one.

706
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, true.

707
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Nate, but I do remember

708
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
a flea market.

709
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The Gibroni trade center.

710
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There was a flea market

711
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
where we bought

712
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Earthworm Gym 2.

713
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Metal Gear Solid 1

714
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and Metal Gear Solid 1.

715
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Remember that?

716
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No, but I remember

717
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Earthworm Gym 2.

718
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I remember we bought

719
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Metal Gear Solid 1

720
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
at a trade center

721
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because you're like,

722
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
my friend,

723
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Stefan really likes this game.

724
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We should buy this game.

725
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That sounds like

726
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
something I'd say.

727
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If I can add to

728
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
what Jess was saying

729
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
about an hour ago

730
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
before Nate and Ben

731
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
interrupted with

732
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
this stupid bullshit.

733
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The point about

734
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the wage cucks,

735
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
like, you know,

736
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
they go to work at 9,

737
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
they go home at 5.

738
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah,

739
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
like you get to

740
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
stop working at that point.

741
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But when you're doing creative

742
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
stuff,

743
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
all day you're tormented

744
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
by thoughts of,

745
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
okay, what should I be working on

746
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
next?

747
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's the next idea?

748
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What's the next video

749
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
going to be?

750
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And I can't turn that part off.

751
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's not like a 9 to 5 job

752
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
where it's like,

753
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
okay, I'm at this place

754
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and now I'm back at this place.

755
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm at home all day

756
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and I can't stop

757
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
thinking about things

758
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I should be working on.

759
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It doesn't turn off.

760
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, it's true.

761
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I can think like,

762
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can't do anything.

763
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I just like,

764
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll lay on the couch

765
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and like try to relax

766
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and play video games.

767
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But like,

768
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
even when I'm relaxing,

769
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm not relaxing

770
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
in my head.

771
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm still working

772
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in my brain.

773
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You know what that is?

774
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's the comfort

775
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
of low personal expectations.

776
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Like,

777
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
oh yeah,

778
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
it's not like

779
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
if I work harder,

780
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm going to like

781
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
make any money today.

782
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like,

783
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
why would I,

784
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
why would I go in

785
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and like put in an extra hour

786
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to like get this project done?

787
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll just do it on

788
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
fucking Monday.

789
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Who gives shit?

790
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And it does,

791
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it does its own destiny

792
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
out here doing our own shit,

793
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
which is why it's so much better.

794
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And especially like,

795
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
our particular branch

796
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
of entertainment.

797
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Like,

798
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sure monkey probably

799
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
has this problem as well.

800
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Where like,

801
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I feel like I can't play

802
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
a video game

803
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
because I should be

804
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
recording it somehow.

805
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

806
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, yes.

807
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Video games now.

808
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, like video games

809
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
are like my,

810
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
they've always been

811
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
like my most beloved hobby,

812
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
but now they're also

813
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
just my work.

814
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is why everybody

815
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
should stream all the time

816
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
because streaming is,

817
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
is basically,

818
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you know,

819
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
when you're being able

820
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to play a video game

821
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and relaxing

822
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and chilling out with people

823
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and you're not,

824
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you don't feel like

825
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you're performing,

826
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you feel like you're

827
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
hanging out.

828
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And also,

829
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you don't have to edit anything.

830
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's,

831
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
it's so much better

832
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
than making Let's Plays.

833
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I made Let's Plays for,

834
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
you know,

835
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
a couple years.

836
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Nobody ever watched them.

837
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Nobody ever watches

838
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the live streams,

839
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
but at least now,

840
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I can see there are a few

841
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey man, 23 viewers

842
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
reliably turn into

843
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Minecrafty every Friday

844
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and over.

845
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah,

846
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and she bovers like the,

847
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the queen of the chant.

848
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

849
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So,

850
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
but it's like,

851
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
even if it's only 20 people

852
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
on a,

853
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
on a YouTube view count,

854
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
20 people is like,

855
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
there's nothing,

856
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but in a stream,

857
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
it's like, yeah,

858
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have 20 whole people here

859
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and they say,

860
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that's a party.

861
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not,

862
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
it's not just video games.

863
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Like I feel that way

864
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
about everything.

865
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like,

866
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
like watching a movie

867
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
or something.

868
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's like,

869
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
yeah,

870
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I could,

871
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm spending this time

872
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
watching a movie like,

873
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
man,

874
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I could be making something.

875
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I could have made this movie.

876
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I could have made this movie,

877
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but I was used to look down

878
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and I still do

879
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
on people who kind of like,

880
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
in a,

881
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
just,

882
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
just like people who aren't

883
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
creators,

884
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but like have a,

885
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
a social media presence.

886
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Like they just have a

887
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Facebook page or whatever.

888
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And then they like feel the

889
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
need to like document

890
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the cool shit they do.

891
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But like,

892
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I do a different version

893
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
of that now where I like

894
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
post to Twitter,

895
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the things that I'm doing

896
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that seem interesting

897
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
or relevant.

898
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
In addition to just my

899
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
thoughts and shit,

900
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
just cause like,

901
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
like when I was in

902
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Anime Expo,

903
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I just felt a desire

904
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
to post all this shit

905
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
cause it's like relevant

906
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
to you.

907
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And,

908
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
you know,

909
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it's a little different

910
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
from like the reason people

911
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
do it,

912
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but I feel like it's part of

913
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
like my branding.

914
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So I,

915
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I can feel like I'm

916
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
accomplishing something

917
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
by doing that,

918
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you know,

919
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
like I'm,

920
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm helping my,

921
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
my business

922
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
by doing that shit.

923
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's cool.

924
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's cool.

925
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
My Twitter doesn't help

926
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
my business,

927
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
but I do enjoy it.

928
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know.

929
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
For a while there,

930
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
for a while there,

931
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I was really on

932
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Twitter a lot.

933
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I kind of,

934
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know.

935
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I was doing something productive

936
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
cause I was like,

937
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
expanding my social media

938
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
outreach or something.

939
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But I think it's,

940
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it's not real.

941
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's like,

942
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't know.

943
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Like it's,

944
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
there's such a thing as too much.

945
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You know,

946
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
there's not a real

947
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
return on investment on Twitter.

948
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There is a bit.

949
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Like I think it's good,

950
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it's good and beneficial

951
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to maintain some kind of like,

952
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you know,

953
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
fan like direct line

954
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
of communication there

955
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and like talk to people

956
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and like get messages

957
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and respond and,

958
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
you know,

959
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
show everyone

960
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you're still here

961
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and you're still doing stuff.

962
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But like,

963
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
yeah,

964
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
not much.

965
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Like a little,

966
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
a little bit goes a long way.

967
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah,

968
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I feel like in the last year or so,

969
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I've become like really good at Twitter

970
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to the point where like,

971
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
like I've got more followers on Twitter

972
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
than people with more

973
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
YouTube subscribers than me.

974
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And like,

975
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
it feels good.

976
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You get that rush.

977
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You get all the,

978
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the favorites

979
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and the retweets and stuff.

980
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But like,

981
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I would almost prefer to not be

982
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
on Twitter,

983
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
so I wouldn't tweet as much

984
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
because like,

985
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
like I have a vision for myself.

986
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like I long to be

987
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
one of those mysterious creators

988
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
who doesn't have

989
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
a social media presence

990
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and like,

991
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
oh, people only know him

992
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
from his work

993
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and that's it.

994
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like I show up out of nowhere

995
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
after like months or years

996
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
with a video

997
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and people are like,

998
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
wow, he's back.

999
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What a legend.

1000
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He's back.

1001
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I want to be that guy

1002
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and I can't because

1003
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm too damn good at Twitter.

1004
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I feel that.

1005
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I feel that.

1006
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Some,

1007
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
sometimes it feels,

1008
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
it feels a little cheap

1009
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
for me to be like,

1010
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
going on Twitter

1011
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and like just talking to people.

1012
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And it's like,

1013
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I should be speaking

1014
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
through my work instead.

1015
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like why do,

1016
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
why, like why do I have to do,

1017
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
why am I doing this?

1018
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But then it's like,

1019
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and like sometimes

1020
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
like I'll fool myself.

1021
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Like I'll lie to myself.

1022
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Like I'll,

1023
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll go on this massive

1024
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
tweet storm

1025
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
or I'll make a big chain

1026
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
of tweets,

1027
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
making some like,

1028
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
grand point

1029
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
or like,

1030
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
fucking philosophical

1031
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
theory.

1032
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And,

1033
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and I'll look at it and like,

1034
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
hmm,

1035
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
maybe I'll just take these tweets

1036
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and format them

1037
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
in the form of a video.

1038
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So I'll have content.

1039
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm never gonna fucking do that.

1040
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know

1041
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
why I lie to myself.

1042
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Once it's on Twitter,

1043
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
it's gone.

1044
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It doesn't matter.

1045
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's lost to the void.

1046
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's kind of given you,

1047
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
like, yeah,

1048
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
since it's sort of published

1049
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in a way,

1050
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
it's like,

1051
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
yeah,

1052
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you get the endorphin rush

1053
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
of having said it,

1054
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
but without having said it well

1055
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
in the format people

1056
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
actually care about.

1057
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And the way that

1058
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
will actually make you money.

1059
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I have seen you

1060
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
take tweets

1061
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and turn them into videos

1062
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
before,

1063
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
or at least put them

1064
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
into videos.

1065
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So,

1066
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
what are your tips

1067
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
to bring back

1068
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
in a video form

1069
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
if I can?

1070
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Well,

1071
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
let's,

1072
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't know.

1073
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think,

1074
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
did we get off

1075
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
our original topic here

1076
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
a little bit?

1077
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I mean,

1078
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
this is all relevant,

1079
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
this is all relevant,

1080
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
but let's focus

1081
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
in a little bit.

1082
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I was asking

1083
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Monkey about how he

1084
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
deals with his

1085
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
productivity.

1086
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And he,

1087
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that's perfect,

1088
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Monkey.

1089
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Your scheduling system

1090
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
is exactly what

1091
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I should be doing.

1092
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I,

1093
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
like,

1094
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't have time.

1095
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So either,

1096
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
like,

1097
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I've decided like,

1098
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll do a thing

1099
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
where I'll be like,

1100
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I've devoted like,

1101
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
like Saturdays and Sundays

1102
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
are like this.

1103
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I just sort of think

1104
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in my head during the week,

1105
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
like, okay,

1106
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Saturday and Sunday

1107
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
are just pure

1108
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
get YouTube stuff done.

1109
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Just work on that stuff.

1110
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But the problem comes in

1111
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that I don't organize

1112
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that time,

1113
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
like specifically enough.

1114
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So I'll do things

1115
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
like wake up in the morning,

1116
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
like today,

1117
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and like,

1118
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
you know,

1119
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
okay,

1120
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll just spend like

1121
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
an hour,

1122
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you know,

1123
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and so what,

1124
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
what am I going to do?

1125
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Waste the whole day?

1126
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't think so.

1127
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Meanwhile,

1128
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
so many Saturdays,

1129
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the days that I have,

1130
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
like,

1131
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
the most amount of time

1132
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
to work on shit,

1133
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
end up just getting consumed

1134
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
by me thinking like,

1135
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
oh, I'll do it in a bit.

1136
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, I'll do it in a bit.

1137
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, I'll do it in a little bit

1138
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
because I have not structured

1139
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
my time perfectly enough.

1140
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's almost like

1141
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you're a pro Krastin.

1142
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Hey,

1143
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that's me, baby.

1144
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's funny,

1145
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Nate,

1146
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that you still go through

1147
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that because I'm,

1148
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
because you did me a math

1149
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
for,

1150
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you had to do it every day.

1151
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I'm doing

1152
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the,

1153
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
my thing,

1154
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the Igmovo tourdage thing.

1155
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And every time I wake up,

1156
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm not even considering

1157
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
not doing anything.

1158
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You know,

1159
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I've been working like

1160
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
from 8 a.m. to

1161
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
however long it takes.

1162
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Usually,

1163
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
usually I finish

1164
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
the video for the day

1165
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
by 6

1166
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and then I try to

1167
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
start the next one

1168
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
immediately.

1169
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But like,

1170
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the idea that

1171
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
after me a math

1172
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
of her,

1173
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
you could wake up

1174
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and then not want to,

1175
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
not continue that.

1176
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's,

1177
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
that's,

1178
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that's,

1179
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I agree hippo,

1180
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I agree hippo,

1181
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Nate is a fucking

1182
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
hack.

1183
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It all makes sense,

1184
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
just in the context

1185
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
of the way that

1186
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
my brain works

1187
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
because like,

1188
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm doing this thing

1189
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
where I like,

1190
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
like during me a

1191
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
math of her I was able

1192
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
to like kind of

1193
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
be intellectually lazy

1194
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and just say,

1195
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Nate,

1196
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
your whole life

1197
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is now making videos

1198
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and you are doing

1199
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
nothing else.

1200
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And because of that,

1201
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I didn't have to actually

1202
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
put in the hard work

1203
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
of something

1204
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that will like,

1205
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
pay off long term

1206
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
of being able to structure

1207
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,400
And like that's because I was able to just kind of relax into I've given up everything except making videos

1208
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,080
Like that's actually kind of the easier way to do things than like managing your life properly

1209
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,800
That's what it was like. That's what it was like drawing Brunswick

1210
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,520
I would like wake up and be like there's no question of me doing anything other than just sitting down and starting to draw

1211
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,720
Right, and it worked. I've never been good either at the scheduling thing

1212
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
The only schedule I have is

1213
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Every every twice a week I stream and around that I just I have

1214
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,920
I've mentioned this before I have like a pad of paper of like goals that I needed to get done at the moment

1215
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,120
I have just like the list of video ideas. I have and once I've done one for the day. I just tick it off

1216
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,720
but

1217
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,520
The idea of saying okay for the for the beginning of this day the AM of this day

1218
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm gonna work on this I

1219
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,640
It just doesn't feel right. I've made calendars like that before where I would say all right for this hour

1220
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,440
I'm gonna do on work on this

1221
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,600
But I never know like I sometimes can start at the right time, but I didn't never end at the right time

1222
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,720
So the entire schedule is is fucked for the rest of it. So I'm like, ah, well, I've gone like over by three hours

1223
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,480
I don't know what to do now. Should I say never next thing?

1224
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
I've never been able to stick to a schedule

1225
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,720
But what what what's worked for me is like just getting the day started on the right foot

1226
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,200
Like if I get the day started and I'm starting to work

1227
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,120
Yeah, then that's gonna be a productive day

1228
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,240
But if I wake up and I'm like I'm gonna do something else for a while and then I'll start working like I might as well

1229
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,320
Just give up, you know. Yeah, man

1230
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,800
That's like my my Achilles heel as a as an as a creator and as a human being

1231
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,520
Hmm is that I have like a hard time focus and like you said Ben

1232
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,320
It's almost like an involuntary procrastination. We're like like when I get up

1233
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:50,480
I cannot think clearly at all until I've like eaten and been outside and walked around a little bit

1234
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,960
So it's like I'll sit down to work. It's like, okay. Well the first time hungry

1235
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,920
So I go to eat and it's like well, I need some fresh air. So then I walk around food was a trap

1236
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,240
They get back a trap. Yeah, then I finally get back and start to sit down like well now

1237
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,480
I have to go pee so then I have to go pee then I go pee go back down sit down

1238
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,600
Well, now I'm hungry again

1239
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,760
So I go and I fucking I eat again and now I have to go outside again

1240
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,960
And now I fucking remembered that like I thought of a tit so now I'm horny

1241
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,080
So now I got to go sail around the world and find like a seaside brothel

1242
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,720
Yeah, and then I fucking come back like a month later and finally sit down and it's like well now

1243
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm hungry again. You know, it's never ending. That's why you know, it's like two in the morning ain't done shit

1244
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Yeah, that's pretty much a similar problem to me

1245
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,480
The only thing I find that helps is breaking my tasks down into tiny little bits. I like you should see me at work

1246
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,440
I've got all these post-it notes that have all like my tasks broken down into like tiny little chunks

1247
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,880
Like it's better at work because like there are people there who will fire me and hold my feet to the fire if I fuck up real bad

1248
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,200
So I have no choice but to schedule my shit and that's great

1249
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,360
Having deadlines makes me a thousand times better at getting the shit done

1250
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,280
Even if I like am a big shitty procrastinator and wait until like the last possible minute to get it done

1251
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Which I've always done and I really want to fix about myself

1252
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,120
But but like like I really I take every task. I have I have all these lists

1253
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,240
I make it work and I really try to break it down into the smallest possible components and then just just itemize like okay

1254
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,480
I'm doing this now then I'm gonna do this then I do that and I'm not great at it

1255
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,640
Obviously, but I find that even if I'm like give and I like fail to

1256
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,720
Like stick to the plan having these to keep me sort of on in sailing in the right direction of what I need to get done

1257
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,760
Eventually like the little steps to do and really knowing like exactly what motions

1258
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,760
I need to specifically do in order to get it accomplished is a big help to me

1259
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,600
It helps me long term get things done. Even if I you know, no stick to the plan perfectly

1260
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Yeah, I'm

1261
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,760
I was gonna say something and I blanked out something about Igma Vo 2 just something about video something about making videos

1262
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,360
It's something about being productive or probably in fact

1263
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,720
I've you you have been able to get like it sounds like at least one video done if not more

1264
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,920
During your time. Yeah, if it's a blog I can get two videos done per day

1265
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,520
It's like one of them's a blog and the other one's like I've edited video

1266
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,240
I never managed that with with me a math but not even once I mean I have a huge advantage because I have all day

1267
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,200
Oh, that's true. That is true. So it's it's not a weekend. I never did it, you know

1268
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,640
Oh, no, I've been working all fucking week. Oh, every single waking moment. It's it's

1269
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,760
You know, this is what I was gonna say the em

1270
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,880
Cuz like all these problems of like you wake up and you're not sure you want to really start doing this

1271
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,480
I oh, you know, I didn't finish that podcast

1272
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,040
I'll just put that on and listen to the last bit of that as I wake up and you know

1273
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,720
I haven't bite to eat and before you know it, you're clicking on the next podcast and you're like, oh, yeah

1274
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,400
Oh, no, I'm gonna kill myself

1275
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,000
but this month like even

1276
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,240
Even just before the month I was trying to make a few videos like as a buffer to get me started

1277
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,660
And they were taking more than one day each to make and I was like, oh, no, this is gonna suck

1278
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:00,160
And as soon as July started, I was like, I have to do it now and the deadline that the pressure

1279
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,360
It wasn't really stressing me out. It's just like well, I have to do it

1280
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm going to do it and I love pressure. I love pressure

1281
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,960
It makes me a real human being it forces me to accomplish things. Yeah, I wish people put things on me and forced me to do things

1282
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,680
It's so hard to self-motivate what I'm gonna do what I'm gonna try and do it's not gonna is not gonna happen

1283
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,640
But what I'm gonna try and do is I'm gonna make one of one of the years

1284
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,360
It doesn't matter when the year starts, but I'm gonna make 365 videos in a row

1285
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,960
I'm gonna see what happens because if casey-nice I can do I mean he does the same sort of

1286
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,360
Yeah, but what does he do? I thought he just like talked about what he did all day like hippo makes actual analysis and shit

1287
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,320
That takes work. That's true. It does

1288
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm I'm a lot of the videos I've been making I'm like does that make any sense

1289
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,480
I don't have time to check I just I just write it on the other hand casey-nice that has one guerrilla in subs

1290
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:00,440
So, you know, it's it's it's like my ad sense has been going up quite a bit just because of the daily amount of videos

1291
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,360
I'm happy about this. I like it's great. I like daily videos daily videos are great. I might I might do it forever

1292
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I hope you do

1293
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:17,600
Being prolific. Yeah, is it is is um is addictive. It's it's cool. Yeah feel like you're really on top of things

1294
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,320
I already miss me and math intensely and

1295
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,720
You know, I want to go back. I have to go back hashtag max revive

1296
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,240
It really is like like giving yourself a deadline makes you more powerful because like absolutely like if I have um

1297
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,880
Like say I want to make oh, I don't know a 4th or July video

1298
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,440
Like I'll tell myself. Okay. It has to be out on the 4th of July

1299
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,120
So I'll work at it really hard and I'll get it almost done almost done

1300
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,800
But if the as soon as the clock strikes 12 on July 5th, it's like well now

1301
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,800
I'll never fucking finish it because I don't care anymore even if it's 99% done. It's like yeah, fuck it. I'm done with this shit

1302
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,960
Yeah, fuck it. You'll you'll get a you'll get a 4th of July video on fucking August 22nd

1303
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,960
This is not this is not quite the same thing

1304
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:09,640
But something something that I really regret and I think has really hurt me was when I decided to release like half of

1305
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,120
Champion because like the previous comics I released only like I released them entirely when they were done

1306
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,240
And it was like a big surprise and it was like oh man. This is what I've been working all the time

1307
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,000
Here's the whole thing

1308
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,600
like releasing half of it really was like really

1309
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,520
really killed my motivation a lot and

1310
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,240
Because it's like it's in a way it feels like okay people have already seen it and it's no longer

1311
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,040
It's no longer a surprise like if I had had if I had kept it to myself and just like sat on it and been like

1312
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,920
It's out when it's done

1313
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:45,960
I would have felt like so pressured all the time to be like well no one's seen it like as of right now

1314
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,000
I've got like no one's seen my work

1315
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,480
I need to finish it so people can see it and it would have been like even like I gotta finish it no matter what now

1316
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,200
It's like well people have seen almost of it or a lot of it

1317
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,120
You know like it can get the rest done and and it doesn't I

1318
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,880
Took the pressure off myself, and I feel like I really paid for it. I hate when the pressure goes off

1319
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Yeah, I'm just repeating myself here, but yeah, that's I hear you I hear you one thing that's really confusing me is that?

1320
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,240
Deadlines and pressure used to completely destroy me when I was younger

1321
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,840
And I don't know when the change happened because like in school when they're doing something that you want to do

1322
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,840
You know that's I guess that might be it but like I used to do I was I did like art at school

1323
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,080
And I liked art and I was like yes making cool big things and stuff

1324
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,760
But it was like every deadline of a thing I had to do was like oh, no, I only have seven days left

1325
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,960
Oh, no, I only have six days left. Why haven't you done anything? Oh, no, I only have five days left

1326
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,480
Oh, no only four days left. Why you just why you just just complaining about the number of days you don't have oh, no

1327
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,560
It's done. Oh, I didn't do anything. Oh, that was depressing the whole time

1328
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,080
I don't know what I am doing with my life, and that was just me the whole time forever through school

1329
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,920
Dude, I and now deadlines are like good like I thought they were bad, but they're good

1330
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,400
And I don't know when that changed and how you know

1331
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,560
I know comparing that to like school work like

1332
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,560
Deadlines were great for me because I never I mean sort of because I I was that kid who never did I always got pretty decent grades

1333
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,520
I guess I mean whatever who gave a fuck but like I would get the project done like the night before I would stay up the night

1334
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,880
Before it was due and finish it then this happened to me like every single fucking time

1335
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,880
Including on my class that I finished like this January like as a 26 year old man

1336
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,040
I was still doing I have not fixed this about myself and may never actually do so

1337
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,800
But like finding myself doing doing this shit like I it's astounding to me

1338
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,620
Like how much I am willing to just like drill myself into the fucking ground and like plan things to have

1339
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:51,520
I plan things out ahead of time and work for months to finish a project that I'm just kind of interested in or very interested in

1340
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,280
You know whatever as opposed to like at work where I just like whatever who gives a fuck school work. Oh, I don't care

1341
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,520
God, I don't want to do this shit. Just like having the motivating factor of doing something for myself

1342
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's like it's like I don't know it's kind of like kind of like that shit Davoo talks about we're like

1343
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,400
Like if I guess like a sort of a political thing

1344
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,200
We're like if if someone's telling you to do something if like just for example if the government is like telling you like okay

1345
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,840
Restructuring people to like be these people to like fit into these boxes. That's what you're gonna be your whole life

1346
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,960
Like as opposed to letting basically the free market like dictate what people are gonna be and let them like find something

1347
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,760
They're good at and like find a way to make it work like not only will those people be happier at least in my own experience

1348
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,080
I'm like at least ten times more productive

1349
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Because I'm doing something that makes me happy and I'm able to get more out of it

1350
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,960
And I like I personally have way more to contribute to the world doing this kind of shit as opposed to you know being a fucking

1351
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,160
You know wage-cuck automaton just just doing the shit that I'm told to do it's it's night and fucking day

1352
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,960
Yeah, so yeah, but like but like the free market has its own

1353
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,000
Downfall because like it because like look at YouTube right like look like YouTube is a free market

1354
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,580
YouTube is a what might loosely be described as a meritocracy where like people get rewarded for unless you don't approve a sharia law then

1355
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:20,320
Well on YouTube you get rewarded for doing what you know what there's demand for you once and that's why and that's why YouTube has become

1356
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,520
So homogenized because everyone is everyone is incentivized to do the same thing and that's what the free market does and I mean

1357
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,160
It's nice to say that like oh, but if it's not rigidly dictated if it's if it's if it's up to the individual to decide then

1358
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,440
Yeah, you can do what you want to do

1359
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,680
But like not everyone not everyone can be a you know an esteemed anime youtuber

1360
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,320
You're absolutely right about you're absolutely right about that

1361
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,000
I guess just in this case I'm more focusing just on this one this one thing that I notice is better about it

1362
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,760
There are absolutely problems with I mean specifically YouTube or any kind of system that is trying to like or just ends up

1363
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,040
We maybe intentional or not like steering people into like certain compartmentalized ways of doing things like that's what me a mafia

1364
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,600
Was all about I would love to just spend all my time making gigantic like cinematic anime reviews the way that I've been doing

1365
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,920
That's what I really want to do

1366
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,080
But I realized that I can't do that if I want to survive I have to adapt to the world

1367
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,480
I'm in which forces me to do me a mafia and you know what it won't always work out this way

1368
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,720
But I found out that people actually pretty pretty pretty pretty positive about hearing me just talk about shit and doing that kind of like light

1369
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,680
Editing stuff and that like it's it's brought out that something I see myself as being better at doing, you know

1370
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,280
And it's helping me kind of find these other ways. So of course, it's not always gonna work out that way

1371
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
There's going to be problems

1372
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,640
But you know if you can be forced to experiment to like see how you fit somewhere that could be helpful

1373
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,880
And if you just don't succeed at it then like yeah, it's gonna suck

1374
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,720
But like you know you should find some other way if like the thing that the market's forcing you to do just isn't working out

1375
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,120
Then yeah, you got to find something else which can be a loss for sure

1376
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,880
But I just think that process is more interesting and productive and like

1377
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,520
Yeah, like really productive like you'll get more out of the people doing it if you let them

1378
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,680
Explore that shit for themselves instead of like box in the mint of shit

1379
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,080
No, yeah something like that something like that I don't particularly like it when

1380
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,520
When there's a person and he makes something really great and he gets a load of fans and then he

1381
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,400
Consistently doesn't make something that's great forever and his fans continue to be there because of that first thing

1382
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,120
I don't particularly like it, but I understand why it has to be that that way because oh no, are you calling me ego raptor?

1383
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,360
No, I'm calling I'm calling everybody the same guy who does yeah

1384
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,640
Because it's unfortunate when you just see somebody who used to be good

1385
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,160
And now they're just doing something that is kind of homogenized and kind of boring and kind of whatever

1386
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
But that's how they got to keep stay afloat and I don't like it

1387
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,280
I like to crit before in Gava would to a ditch you get so mainstream. I look at my thumbnails and I'm like

1388
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,280
I don't even know who I am. What is this Nate?

1389
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,200
Are you saying that you're never going to make another video in the same?

1390
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,280
You know epic vein as the tank and I'm currently working on it

1391
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,360
It's just that I'm restructuring the way that I do things so that I can survive while doing this

1392
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
And overall make more throughout my life

1393
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,920
I'm just probably gonna break up my content between like doing those long-term and then like take a day and make like a smaller video or something

1394
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,560
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to diversify instead of just like abandoning our only exclusively doing one type of video

1395
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,200
Yeah, yeah, just trying to compensate for my own weaknesses

1396
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,680
I trust Nate to be able to continue making big videos while still doing the small stuff, but I'm I

1397
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Don't know I don't know I just

1398
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,280
Maybe I feel like I haven't made a big big video. Yeah

1399
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,320
I kind of feel like the era of the big video is over on your way. Yeah, I

1400
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,080
Mean even even me as a viewer like I you know more than anyone. I appreciate

1401
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,840
the merit of the big gigantic videos, but

1402
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,080
Man, even as a viewer myself. It's like I'd rather watch the five-minute video

1403
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,800
Here's here's a weird dilemma that I that I find myself having like what I like I

1404
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,640
Like it's easy for me like I look at I look at the landscape of YouTube

1405
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:21,360
I look at how you know, it's all like vlogs and it's all like let's plays and it's all like casual like low low produced stuff

1406
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
And I'm like man

1407
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,800
Look at all like look at all the shit content like what I like what I think of as like real content is like worthwhile

1408
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,440
Content is like scripted like narrow like narratively driven like like stories like fit like stories and fiction

1409
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,560
It's like that's what I think is good

1410
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,280
And like that's what I try to make as an artist myself

1411
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,560
But as a viewer as a viewer

1412
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,520
I'm I don't like I'm kind of pushed away from that like I don't eat like I don't eat like I don't want that for myself

1413
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,760
Because it's like but I don't know if that's because of like

1414
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,760
my like my like I don't know if that's because of like the YouTube landscape and like because of like culture

1415
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,320
Like I don't know if that's me as a viewer or me as an artist because like as an artist

1416
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,240
I'm like, I don't care about what stories other people are telling. I'm trying to tell mine over here

1417
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,480
So like I wonder I like I hope that it's just me being like biased by my by my profession

1418
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,000
You know like what I like I hope or I would like to think that like people that like a layperson

1419
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,920
Like the masses like respond to that stuff well

1420
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,920
But I don't know if it's true or not because technically I'm part of the masses and I find myself being like well

1421
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,040
Whatever someone else will watch it if it's good someone else will watch it and enjoy it and like it

1422
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,560
I and it'll get popular but if but leave that I don't but I want no part of it

1423
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,560
literally my favorite show on YouTube right now is

1424
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,840
Monkeys Yu-Gi-Oh, let's play that is without a doubt my favorite thing happening on YouTube right now

1425
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,720
I don't even know how to play Yu-Gi-Oh, but it's my fight

1426
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,800
It's my favorite thing and I can't explain it. It's it comes out like every other day or something like that

1427
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800
I fucking love it. He's just plowing through all the fucking

1428
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,640
Like we're past where I even know who these characters are anymore

1429
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,600
I don't know who any I for some reason something about it is just great

1430
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,020
and it's so easy for me to watch like every morning as I'm coming into work and

1431
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
You know, it's it's really great

1432
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,280
But but yeah, let's let's talk about like the downsides of of being prolific or prolificity or whatever

1433
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:20,080
Well, yeah, well you guys um, I mean you were talking about wanting to do more stuff like short videos like Mia

1434
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,120
Maffavan gives thing and like getting them out more more being more prolific

1435
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:30,960
I almost feel the opposite way where like I I kind of strive to be less prolific like I

1436
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:40,320
Would I like my goal is to this for my patreon to get high enough that I can disappear and make one huge great thing

1437
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:48,360
Project a month. Mm-hmm as opposed to like just just a never-ending stream of trash like I've been doing for all these years

1438
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,760
I'm at a point. Thanks to YouTube fucking me that I'm kind of in that position where I'm like, okay

1439
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,040
Maybe you know since I'm not gonna get 10 million views anymore

1440
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,400
Maybe I'll just do two really big great videos and throw them up on the patreon and see what happens

1441
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,320
That's something to try at least God your your video had just gotten like it was close to like a million

1442
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,960
Yeah, I was right up to a million. They're like, you know, I know this guy. Yeah, yeah had it crossed over 900,000 yet

1443
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I know it's close. Yeah, it had

1444
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Well, uh, the um

1445
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
Dair of a wimpy kid

1446
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,200
That's that's a lot of views. Yeah, we'll see if I get it back and and if YouTube doesn't want to give me my

1447
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,040
$1,000 in ad revenue, I'm gonna fucking burn YouTube headquarters to the ground

1448
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Yeah, they certainly deserve it

1449
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,920
They're just they're just the worst. They're just the worst. Um, so are they gonna just gonna keep my money. What's the idea here?

1450
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,600
Oh, oh, they're gonna keep your money

1451
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,200
They're gonna keep your money just just like how right now we're having a little bit of I mean, I know this is getting inside

1452
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,280
Maybe I should even talk about but like we're talking about those emails. I saw those emails today

1453
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,480
Yeah, yeah, I'm talking like it's not a big deal

1454
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,400
But like we're trying to basically get access to the to the ad revenue that the PCP has already earned and like they're

1455
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,280
They're throwing up some real roadblocks here for us getting that money. They might just decide, you know what?

1456
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,720
I think we're just gonna keep it. You know, yeah, that's uh, that's cool you guys, but and they're gonna they're gonna take that money

1457
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,440
They're gonna build a paper mache cock out of it and fuck us with it. That's right. That's right

1458
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,880
Well, and we're supposed and we're supposed to just thank them. Thank them for giving us this platform. Yeah

1459
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Thanks guys appreciate that

1460
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,440
Well, okay, okay, but before we we go because we're getting pretty close to the hour

1461
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,040
Let's let's talk about specifically more downsides of prolificity because that I did your depression

1462
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
So you're like

1463
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,720
It's easy for me to to be like really excited now that it's done, but like it was hell

1464
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,880
I gave up sleep. I gave up sleep for for much of that time and just worked

1465
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,740
I feel like it's way more depressing when you don't have any videos in mind and you're just sitting there. Yeah

1466
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:07,720
That's yeah, that's true. I'd rather be stressed out and being like, oh man. I really need some sleep

1467
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,160
I'd rather be like that than oh man. I really need to die like

1468
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,680
I was the first one's better

1469
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,800
I was I was just about to say not being prolific is what is what makes me feel more depressed

1470
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,280
And then I realized something I realized something about the way that I am as a human being not not being like I think that not

1471
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,200
Being productive causes depression and then I think that right rather than rather than

1472
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,800
Product productivity making me depressed because it fucks up my schedule

1473
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,520
I think that being depressed causes me to change my schedule to become productive to like to mollify

1474
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,200
To mollify the depression because I'll go if I go a while and I'm not being productive and I start to hate myself

1475
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,560
Then I'll like I'll have to like like with Brunswick like I was like and I was like the world is fucked

1476
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,640
My life is fucked. I'd like there's nothing for me

1477
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,880
There's nothing there's nothing for me in this world

1478
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,440
It's time to just it's time to never leave my room and never do anything again and spend like all day every day

1479
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,640
Just like drawing and that was like and that was like the fucking that like really helped and carried my problem

1480
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,680
For a while. I that's true

1481
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,520
I guess the only danger is falling into that kind of depression spiral where you don't make the change and start to make shit

1482
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,560
It's like, you know, it's a gambit. I mean, I mean, I think the healthy

1483
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,120
I mean, I think the healthy thing that that that nugget of

1484
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,840
Hutsma from inside yourself and actually get shit done as opposed to you know, just killing yourself

1485
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,200
I was gonna say I think I was gonna say I think the healthy about the healthy thing is to make that

1486
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:40,240
Loathing my depression is like the opposite of that where I really love myself and my fear and like I just don't want anyone else to

1487
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,040
Not like me

1488
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:49,080
So my fear is that like if I take too long with a video or like too many days go by without a video for me that people

1489
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:56,680
Assume I'm not working or not doing anything. Yeah, like sure like but my my biggest problem that like hampers my

1490
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,440
Productivity is just like not being able to focus on one thing at a time

1491
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
Like right now I'm looking at

1492
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,960
11 Sony Vegas windows in my browser. Oh my all of different projects and like

1493
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,800
Everything takes forever for me to get out because I can't focus on finishing one project at a time

1494
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,280
I like I'll do like five minutes of work on on this window and then like get bored and zoom over to the other window

1495
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,280
So like I'm just inching towards finishing all these different projects instead of getting one thing done and like my worst

1496
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,920
Fears that people think that I'm just lazy or not working. I am working. I'm working hard all the time

1497
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,160
There's just there's just no there's no results ever

1498
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,240
And I don't know why not to be critical

1499
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:43,440
But it sounds like the issue there is that little thing that get bored that get bored that allows you to you know

1500
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,120
Just or that forces you I don't know. I don't know

1501
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:56,040
It's more like run dry what I can't finish one thing before I start feeling guilty about not having finished the other thing

1502
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,840
So I'm constantly like like a balancing my guilt for different projects and going from one to the other

1503
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,720
That that you know that thing that monkey said oh just a couple minutes ago

1504
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,960
You know about the whiteboard with the schedule, you know, that's inspiring to me

1505
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,920
That's really probably what I need in my life more than anything

1506
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,080
Yeah, I'm literally going to order a whiteboard as soon as we're done with this call

1507
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,240
I want that I want that in my life

1508
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,100
It reminds me it reminds me of those like you ever seen for like mangaka the like

1509
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,360
Like the timetables of like how they spend their day and how like each hour is blocked out

1510
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,360
Yeah, and they'll work for like 16 hours a day with like half an hour for lunch in the middle

1511
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,720
And then like on weekday on weekends

1512
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,800
They'll only work eight hours a day and then spend the other like and then like spend like four with their wife or something

1513
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,760
And then on Sunday, you know, it's right back to it. It's like what what what's a better life?

1514
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,440
What's a what's a better life really?

1515
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,160
I guess is the question that sort of comes to mind when I think about this shit

1516
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,480
Do you want to be somebody who like, you know as a nine-to-five, you know, it's it's fine and all but then on your weekends

1517
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,120
Ah, you can chill out you can you can you fuck sluts at the club or do you want to be a content machine?

1518
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,620
Where you spend 16 hours a day or more?

1519
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,960
Bust in your ass and so the end of your life you say look at what I have accomplished look at

1520
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Terrible

1521
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,400
The day is a bit is a bit much, but I do like the idea of working really hard

1522
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:25,960
I mean I like time to make something that's so cool like I want to be I want to make a home stuck or a one piece

1523
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,480
I want to make that yeah, the problem the problem with I'm dead the problem with the nine-to-five

1524
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:39,520
Slog but then you got weekends free like that sounds fine to me because like but then like what are you doing with your free time on the weekends?

1525
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,640
You should be working. Well, yeah, that's what I mean because it if you're not if you're not a content machine

1526
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,200
Then like well what what what are those free time for what cuz like because if it's just time to just like sit there and like zone out

1527
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,760
And it's like what's the point like what are you getting out of that?

1528
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,560
I feel like people who zone out don't deserve that life off because

1529
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:06,280
Yeah, they're not used to working so hard that they need a whole weekend of time off

1530
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,320
You know what I mean, I mean my whole my whole deal is I want human advancement as quickly as possible

1531
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,840
So I look at the landscape of humanity and I see all these people taking weekends off doing nothing

1532
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,920
And I'm like get your shit together guys

1533
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,120
I want you guys to discover your purpose in life and work until you fucking die to achieve it

1534
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,040
You know be as happy as you want. I mean your shit together me like to me

1535
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,240
Happiness is or like the closest way to time

1536
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,560
No, no, no the closest thing to happiness that I found is just is just having a goal

1537
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:44,640
Having a any goal and feeling like you're working towards and if you're working a nine five and if you're working a nine to five

1538
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,640
Then like what's like and then you have the weekends off like if you're not using those weekends to work towards some goal

1539
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,440
And it's like well, what are you doing? You know like you know you need you need to feel like you're progressing towards something

1540
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,840
I think the normie answer would be like maybe a family like starting a family and

1541
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,360
Yeah, that shit

1542
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,520
Children kissing your wife. No, that's actually that's actually

1543
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,720
That's that's a fine way to like to be a good parent

1544
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,680
I think I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shit on I'm not gonna shit on the idea of being a family man

1545
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,760
Like if that's your goal, of course not. Yeah, okay, but like I'm just I'm imagining someone who's just like you know

1546
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,360
Like time off for the sake of it is not satisfying

1547
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,280
Like if you're not if you're not using it to do like to do something that's like gonna bring you happiness

1548
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,560
even if even if it's something as simple as like

1549
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,160
You know, you don't know what you want to do

1550
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,160
But you find you kind of like the idea of playing guitar, so you have a guitar and you just play it

1551
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,560
You know play it a little you don't know whether that's going to result in a musical career

1552
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:51,640
But it's something to be working towards it doesn't matter that you you don't need like an entire life plan planned out

1553
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
Yeah, just need you just need an ideal

1554
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,720
Like a goal a thing that you want to get towards and whatever people do

1555
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,920
I think they're better off having like goals for it

1556
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,880
You know like I'm going to do this for a while like even if this is a weekend thing

1557
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,400
Yeah, yeah, like playing guitar like you said like to have a goal like you know what I'm gonna pick up guitar

1558
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,200
It's pretty fun. Maybe one day you know my goal be like do a do an open mic and I just you know do that shit

1559
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,400
I think you're way better off having something that you're like working towards then just I don't know not

1560
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
Not doing that, you know

1561
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,760
Yeah, if I ever find myself feeling bored then I will know that I'm doing something wrong

1562
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,560
Because like I will definitely like I will always

1563
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Take off work to hang out with a friend or someone because that's important to me like it's way more important than work like

1564
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Like I almost live my life by the ethos if I can be with another person fuck work. It shouldn't exist. Well

1565
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
disagree there, but alright

1566
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,360
Yeah, but you know, but the opposite of that is that if I'm not working

1567
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,640
I'd better be doing something worthwhile or fun or else. I should put my head in the toilet

1568
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,120
Which is also fun

1569
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:10,320
In a different way because I'm a fucking digital and that's what I do I swim in the fucking toilet. I

1570
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,200
Don't know where I was going with that originally, but it went somewhere totally different somewhere superior

1571
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the story of my old roommate

1572
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,680
Okay, my lifelong best friend who I lived with before I moved down to North Carolina

1573
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,480
Mm-hmm. He worked at a kitchen

1574
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,400
Eight hours a day and no joke every single minute. He was home when he was not work

1575
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
He would just sit on Netflix

1576
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,840
While staring at his phone and that was that's literally his entire life

1577
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,240
He's just binging through shows not actually watching them and looking at his phone

1578
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:48,480
He would he's watched the two Netflix seasons of better console. He couldn't tell you what

1579
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,880
Staring at his phone. That's tragic. Yeah, when I think about his life

1580
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:00,320
Like is ignorance actually bliss because he doesn't seem that sad, but it it looks miserable to me. Yeah, wait

1581
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,200
It's hard to say. Oh, I'm very confused about what he's looking at on his phone

1582
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:10,960
He's just like on Twitter or fucking Facebook or reading ESPN.com to see what his favorite Faggity football player has been up to

1583
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,960
That's just stupid shit. I

1584
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:20,240
Guess yeah, I guess it's not really a bad thing if you you're satisfied with with less stuff in your life

1585
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,360
But I couldn't be you know, you know, I don't like that though

1586
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,840
It's cuz cuz if this guy or whoever you know, I don't mean to show the guy specifically, but like shit on him

1587
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,760
I fucking hate him any anybody who does that I think would be Nate. Hello

1588
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:40,600
Significantly happier or or at least equally happy if they were like working to accomplish something and then like you know what and then they also

1589
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,040
They're achieving something which is good for everybody. So like I think let's just do that

1590
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,600
I think it's just because people like that haven't even considered or tried or been put into a situation where they're forced to

1591
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,560
Work on something

1592
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,360
You know bigger than just getting through the day and they don't even you know

1593
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,800
They can't even conceive of a big old goal like that

1594
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:07,280
So they don't feel like they're missing out when they're not doing anything probably which one of you was it that said that if you

1595
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,240
Don't have a creative outlet. You're not even a human being because I agree with that completely

1596
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,020
I think that was me. I fit so I feel I think I've definitely said that

1597
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,960
I stand by it completely

1598
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,400
Jesse's definitely said if you're not a creative person, you're less than

1599
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,160
That sounds like that sounds like a much younger more foolhardy and arrogant version of me

1600
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,960
So I would I would also define creative in this context as like if you're working to like I don't know crack some new

1601
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,480
Mathematical algorithm just in your spare time like Einstein used to that's creativity

1602
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,400
You know, that's yeah, if you're putting your brain to work in any way. I think it's creativity sitting fucking yeah

1603
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,120
Yeah, the background is wasting your life away in my opinion. I want to be a zombie. I guess if it makes them happy

1604
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,240
I don't know. I mean maybe that maybe maybe that's a simpler and like less stressful existence

1605
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,080
Well, I would I like to believe I I

1606
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:05,960
Like to believe that the highest of my highs are better than a person like that's very true

1607
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,960
Yeah, I would say that they're kicking their their stress down the road until they die

1608
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,960
They're like I've accomplished nothing. Yeah

1609
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,800
That's what I was about to say like people have midlife crisis is when they

1610
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:22,400
Yeah, like a normal life and they have no reason they have no idea that you could even do more and then they get to an age

1611
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Where they're like man, I haven't really done anything and then it all comes and hits them all at once whereas for us

1612
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,720
It's hitting us constantly, but less, you know

1613
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,960
Yeah, we're facing it. We're we're staring staring into that a whole life crisis basically

1614
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,120
Life is like and fast forward and you don't even realize how much time has passed and that you haven't done anything

1615
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,400
It's very true. I

1616
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:53,880
That terrifies me deeply without yeah without that structure without that structure that the bullshit academia system like forces you into and like

1617
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:00,480
Tells you as important to some degree that might be just as you get older time goes faster, but nonetheless

1618
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,520
That's yeah, there's that but also the lack of structure just makes it real easy for like fucking weeks and months to go by and you're like

1619
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,920
Well, I wasn't supposed to be doing anything. No one told me to do absolutely absolutely

1620
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,080
So very specifically gives you like little tasks and things to achieve like okay

1621
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,600
I have to finish this paper by tomorrow

1622
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,640
But like once you're out there are no goals handed to you you have to come up with your own goals and most people don't

1623
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,280
Haveing them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, most people are like just

1624
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,840
Really happy that they don't have to think of good goals anymore

1625
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:36,040
It's like you haven't liked those goals because school sucks when you're anything when you're in school

1626
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,440
Goals were interesting then people would probably continue to do them up when you're in because most people go to school

1627
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,480
And they do the work just because like they have to do it to get the degree

1628
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,960
So then you they graduate and they're like, oh, well, thank God now

1629
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,360
I don't have to do any of those things anymore

1630
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:55,160
But then but then you don't if you don't have anything that you are having to do then you fucking

1631
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,120
You're headed for a midlife crisis town USA

1632
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,560
It really reminds me of at least personally how I play video games because I love

1633
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,720
Accomplishing goals in video games and it feels great. I love like

1634
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,720
Achieving challenges and you know, there's there's some challenges to achieve in real life

1635
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,360
If you want to if you want to take the time to do that shit

1636
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:20,040
So it's like people, you know video games give people like an artificial world that allows them to like feel like they're superior and like

1637
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:24,600
They're they're doing something when instead of doing it in real life because it's way fucking easier in a video game

1638
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,200
You know, I still love video games

1639
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,640
But that that that probably is a lot of the reason why people I know it is for me

1640
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,920
They yeah, they buy the hot new game

1641
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,440
And they play it all the way through and they complete everything and then they're just like well, I did it

1642
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,920
It gives them a sense of empowerment. It gives them like like I'm in their own life. Yeah

1643
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,240
Yeah, it's like it's it's goals for them to achieve and they've been starved for goals because they're not doing anything

1644
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,400
So I hate that I hate I hate thinking about that. I hate thinking about the fact that like

1645
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:57,720
To a certain extent video games or video games are just like a sort of like hamster wheel

1646
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,000
That usually are supposed to like step up on and run and if you and if you press if you press the right buttons like

1647
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,720
It'll tickle your brain and that way that you've been missing and then you're like, oh, I got it

1648
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:14,040
Games are in a sense kind of like emotional crack because you get to just like experience the most interesting part of

1649
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:20,520
Characters lives over and over and like accomplish these gigantic goals that you will never be able to do in your pitiful little real life

1650
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,880
And it just it's all big it's a big like playcane a mechanism to make you think that you're happy as you're like living somebody else's life

1651
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,640
When I when I when I think about that I feel like oh god video games

1652
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,240
Oh, no, get them just get them get them away, but then but then but then some time sometimes I'm like

1653
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,560
Yeah, I was just gonna say but oh man

1654
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,580
Undertale wasn't really like I mean I guess to a certain extent it was it had some tough bosses

1655
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:52,880
But it was mostly about the story which is not really the same thing I guess well

1656
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,120
So I don't know I would tell like make it makes like intellectual points about like the nature of video games

1657
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,960
Which is cool. You know games do that a lot my favorite video game of all time is without a doubt

1658
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,920
You have to burn the rope on new grounds. Oh my god

1659
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,960
It's this 30-second long game where you just you fucking go and you like you walk along this corridor

1660
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,080
You grab fire you burn the rope and you slay the grinning colossus

1661
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,260
And then there's a there's like a 10 minute outro a song about how fucking badass you are for burning that fucking rope

1662
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,960
It's the greatest video game ever conceived and laughs at this whole idea of what video games and yeah

1663
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:31,000
Know what the the the worst and most agonizing game of all time in terms of like feeling like a mindless hamster wheel

1664
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,280
For me the worst in terms of that and also

1665
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:45,040
Possibly the best game ever made which is the problem is the binding of Isaac because yes, man

1666
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,040
I know the guy who made that he's pretty cool

1667
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,480
Yeah

1668
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,560
Yeah, I don't know about that

1669
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,400
We should if you want to he we should you should hear our conversation with him on the bonus episode a patreon.com

1670
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,880
The procrastinators are TP procrastinators. I forget our url. Yeah

1671
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah dogs with him the last he was on the last man. So it was great game

1672
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:18,040
I I hate it because there's no story and there's no reward and there's there's nothing that makes it feel like a worthwhile

1673
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:23,680
Experience whatsoever, but the gameplay itself is so goddamn perfect and flawless and beautiful

1674
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:30,160
Like there are times when I will just fall into an Isaac hole that lasts for an entire day and I'll hate myself

1675
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,760
Yeah, I want to die, but I just can't it's it's the worst drug of all that's kind of like

1676
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,040
The Zelda Breath of the Wilds doing to me sometimes these days like that's what I did when I woke up this morning

1677
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,120
Yeah, I just played Zelda a little bit. No big fucking deal

1678
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:47,600
Of course, it's a gigantic world to explore an infinite goals to accomplish. So it's like fuck my fucking day

1679
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,760
But the thing about Isaac that's interesting to me that makes that that kept me coming back is

1680
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,520
Is like if there's nothing new to discover

1681
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,480
I won't keep playing a game like that even if I really like it because I'll I'll get bored

1682
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,360
But like the fact that there's like new bosses to unlock new levels to unlock new items to find

1683
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:11,920
You know like an extra challenges to give myself to overcome is what I'm all about when you get that like when when

1684
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,160
Two or more power-ups like combine in a unique way that you haven't seen before

1685
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,920
It's like fucking heroin right up my dick

1686
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,400
I just chasing that dragon forever, especially when you get especially when you get the boomerang bullets and the Ipacac

1687
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,560
Exploding bullets so the

1688
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,760
That's my thing I

1689
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,320
Personally have fallen way down the Magikarp jump hole. I'm really loving training all these Magikarps

1690
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,520
I'm really I fully I fully admit

1691
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,120
I don't know

1692
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,120
It's just something to do like when I'm in the car or just like when I'm just like sitting around when I'm when I'm

1693
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,320
Yeah, yeah, what I'm driving when I'm on the toilet. It's just

1694
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:58,400
It's it's like I fully admit that the gameplay is like just a just a completely shallow just excuse

1695
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,680
It's just like a series of rigamarole. It's just it's complete rigamarole

1696
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:08,840
Like the only thing that matters is your trainer level and everything else in the game is just a is just like a bullshit hurdle to

1697
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,200
Jump over just to get your trainer level up

1698
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:17,720
But it's just so fucking cute how all your how all your previous Magikarps the ones that the ones that survive the ones that

1699
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,720
Don't get eaten by Pidgeotos or blown or blown to smithereens by Voltorbs

1700
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,600
They'll just like live in your pond and swim around in the background

1701
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:31,800
You can see them there and sometimes they and sometimes they come and give your and give your current Magikarps some advice on how to become a great jumper

1702
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,880
It's really cute and charming

1703
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,880
That's pretty cool. I guess

1704
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:44,240
Gyaradoses you can't you yeah, yeah, you can you can make your you can like fuck up really bad and make your a

1705
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,320
Magikarp evolve into a Gyarados at which point he becomes worthless and is discarded

1706
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,920
Just like when I normally play Pokemon. Yeah, I don't abide that shit

1707
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah

1708
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,480
Well, all right, that's cool. I guess we we pretty much explored our topic our original topic being productive or prolific

1709
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,440
I got it. I got it my final word on being productive is I got I got to get back there

1710
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,040
I got a I think it's time

1711
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,880
I've been feeling real bad for a while about not getting enough done

1712
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:18,600
I think it's I think it's getting nigh on that time where I need to like I need to get back into that headset of like wake up start

1713
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,040
drawing and

1714
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,920
Then I'll be happier then I gotta drive a fucking comic

1715
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:30,600
Yeah, that's been that's gonna be been every morning all right anybody else final points being prolific

1716
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,280
In the comments say which is better me a mother or Igma vote who it is. Hey, it's not done yet though

1717
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,840
Yeah, but

1718
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,880
Who cares it's

1719
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,520
Plus yours is the current one everyone's gonna like the current one so the old and busted one. Hey, I'm the original baby

1720
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:51,600
I'm I'm I'm Bulbasaur. I'm Pokemon zero zero one. I'll always be the champ. Hell. Yeah, I'm Bulbasaur

1721
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,080
Jesse Jesse's like quiet and then just he hears Bulbasaur. Yeah

1722
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Nate just got my vote

1723
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:06,560
To me I really think Min Maphne I really trumps in Govo a to a ditch and me a math

1724
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:13,160
I really math math. Yeah, man. Maphne is just is just is like it's like it's like one of those

1725
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,480
Like what I it's like one of those brain activity charts. It's like, you know, man

1726
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,760
Maphne is like a little tiny skull in Govo a to a ditch is like a little a little activity

1727
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:28,280
Min Maphne is like, you know, just like fucking like angels shooting out of like a man with a brain light shooting out of his fucking head

1728
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,400
Yeah, yeah, and like and like the eye the eye of Raj is like

1729
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,560
Sure, the sheer brilliance of maybe never making a nuzlocke

1730
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,240
My Christ consciousness is off the chart, right

1731
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:49,280
The thing that really is puts it over the edges the maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like damn this guy's got it all figured out

1732
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,440
Thanks

1733
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,200
All right. Well, let's let's go to our questions if we're all set with this or is there we all good

1734
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:02,160
We all set folks. I got one good, baby. Okay. Um, let me see. I'm just scrolling scrolling scrolling. I

1735
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Fuck I had a good one. Where the fuck did it go?

1736
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,560
Nope. Nope

1737
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:16,200
I gotta find something fast. Okay. Here we go at Moe entrepreneur asks what crimes have you committed?

1738
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,760
What crimes?

1739
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,640
What are you willing to confess? I dared to

1740
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:29,480
To make a point that Shreela probably doesn't treat women very well, oh, that's true. That's a YouTube crime. That's a YouTube

1741
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,480
How dare I?

1742
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,520
That's it

1743
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:39,200
No, I think we're all too good boys. We're the goodest boys on the on the whole planet. Um, I've

1744
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:47,560
Crimes just just stop being crimes when we do them. Yeah, I've stolen shit before I'm not even I'm not embarrassed about that anymore

1745
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,800
I've shoplifted stuff. I haven't I've been real poor. I

1746
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:57,400
Wasn't poor. I would just eat a donut while walking around and was like, yeah, whatever. This is my yeah now

1747
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
It's in my body. Yeah

1748
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,200
It's part of me ever steal anything from digi when you lived with him

1749
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,240
food probably no

1750
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,160
only

1751
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,000
Well, I

1752
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,320
Well, after Victor after Victor moved out after Victor moved out

1753
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,680
I ate a bunch of the food that he left behind but like he left it behind so I'm thinking so I'm thinking that's not stealing anymore

1754
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,120
Yeah, I gray area

1755
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,520
I still I committed once

1756
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
Well, we've all done that. Yeah

1757
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,200
I committed the greatest crime ever once and I'm ashamed of it to this day

1758
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,240
I'll never atone for it shit when I was a little kid

1759
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,080
When my grandma used to watch the news

1760
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:45,880
I would just come in the room and sit down and turn on the Sega and not even ask her

1761
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,480
You monster and I didn't even care

1762
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,960
I had no remorse for my for my poor

1763
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:00,240
Saintly grandmother and now she's dead and I can never apologize for this crime that I committed over and over again as a child

1764
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,160
I ought to be stoned as his code of Sharia law

1765
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,000
She probably thought you were cute, which is my religion now so I can stay on YouTube forever

1766
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:12,800
That's right. She probably was so senile that she thought Sonic the hedgehog was the news

1767
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,360
She did have Alzheimer's it was very sad

1768
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:25,920
Here's another question at exile of itch asks who would win him? Yeah, I know that guy

1769
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,280
He's a dead mining who would win in a fight Rhonda Rousey or Gal Gadot. I

1770
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,960
Know

1771
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,360
I mean Gal Gadot has killed there both women so they would both lose

1772
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,160
Yeah, I don't know if Rosie has two kills under her belt

1773
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,640
That's true. That's true. By the way guys. I just happened to read the other day

1774
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:54,040
This is a little bit of a tangent, but I like apparently it's common

1775
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,280
Like the world champion

1776
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,600
Should they were working but like that the Australian like

1777
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:05,440
National team like their best national team their female national team

1778
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,920
Lost 7-0 to a 15 year old high school boy soccer team like

1779
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,560
What is that what the fuck is happening here? These are like the best in the country. I don't know

1780
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,680
I just was astounded the best in the country

1781
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,280
You got it you got it man

1782
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,480
Really like I want that clarified. Is it true?

1783
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,160
Like I know munchie drilled it all into our heads and now he

1784
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,600
But like I tried looking it up and I couldn't find this information in like there for for real

1785
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,320
So I don't know if it was just like scrubbed the only munchie knows the truth

1786
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,960
Munchie's the only source for fake news that I trust

1787
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,880
Did you guys see that poster somebody made of the Wonder Woman with like the palestinian kid

1788
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,040
Amazing way to go dude. I wish I'd remembered your name, but that was sick

1789
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,160
I retweeted it, but it's like three weeks ago. So good luck. Yeah. Yeah

1790
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,640
Okay, a new question. Here we go at

1791
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:12,360
ZTM zero three two one asks thoughts on YouTube being pro Sharia law. Yeah

1792
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,920
You know I approve I approve

1793
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,880
Let's

1794
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:23,000
Let's talk about this for a second. So Sharia law guys. It's not so good. It's not so good got some issues with it

1795
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,080
Got some got some complaints. No, I've seen a lot

1796
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,880
Ultimate way to live. Oh

1797
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:32,120
Now that you've said that now that you've said that Nate the PCB is done for they're out for us

1798
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,680
They're gonna we're gonna get flag. We're gonna get a band. Yeah, we're done. We're gonna get fucked and sucked

1799
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,720
It's uh, I'm really curious as to whether they actually know it's about Sharia law

1800
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,840
And that's why it got taken down. Can we just talk about this for a second? I mean whether it was just like oh

1801
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,480
Sharia law is a controversial thing. You can't have that in a title

1802
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Destroyed. I mean was it as simple as that or but the thing is I I did a lot of research before I put up the video

1803
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:04,880
And there are like outright hate mongers on the front page of when you search fuck Islam

1804
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:09,120
Just saying the worst things you can imagine millions of views on the front page of search

1805
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:13,880
I make a comedy video that doesn't specifically target any group at all for hate

1806
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:19,000
It just like lists stats and shit and makes jokes about them instantly deleted within a day

1807
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,720
Maybe it's just like somebody manually flagged it or something. Well, yeah, but like

1808
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:31,300
Yeah, that has to be it like people in your audience like who subscribes to monkey Jones and then gets so upset about something like that

1809
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:37,400
What if one really I've been getting pretty doing well on the red? Oh, no way? No, I know why the dive of wimpy kid

1810
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:42,760
Yeah, that's probably it. I mean I'm I'm I'm almost positive that it's just like one

1811
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,840
Muslim guy on reddit must have seen it and flagged it. Yeah, I bet it was literally Isis

1812
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,040
But literally Isis like it was like that guy that I hate the most. Yeah, the worst guy

1813
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:59,720
Yeah, the worst PCP character of all maybe Muslims really like Dyer of a wimpy kid

1814
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
You really pissed them off

1815
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:08,120
The Sharia law broke the camel's back. That's probably true. Let's just just examine this just for one second more

1816
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:13,400
Okay, so so YouTube's thing is that they're SJW cucks, right? Like that's clearly that's clear where they're moving

1817
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:19,120
So like so that being the case they support or are like totally in defense of

1818
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:27,160
This belief system that says that women should like not drive cars or should be clothed when they're outside at all times

1819
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,520
Here's the thing. What is up with that?

1820
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,960
This is the most brown brown feminist video I've ever made and I got me banned

1821
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,760
Like you're literally arguing to for women to not have to be forced to wear clothes like that cover their entire body

1822
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,920
That's your argument beaten and raped by their husbands and all it's it's literally because like brown comes before women

1823
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,680
Yeah, it's a progressive skin color. That's how Obama beat Hillary in 2008. Yeah

1824
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,400
It's not a joke. I don't accept that Hillary won that election too. She's perfect

1825
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,080
How long has she been the president?

1826
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,520
She's gonna have 16 years under her belt

1827
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,360
How do I even let her run for a third term? That's crazy. I don't know. That's one of the many mysteries

1828
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,080
I'm trying to cover. She is in fact the founding mother of America

1829
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:19,760
She wrote the Declaration of Independence. She is the alpha in the Omega. Yeah, you know as much as I hate to to get off

1830
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:26,760
My centrist high horse for a minute. That is definitely some SJW cucky shit on YouTube's part. Yep

1831
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,080
It's unacceptable for her once for once

1832
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,920
Didn't deserve it

1833
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,200
Yeah, I've been saying it couldn't have happened to a more deserving person

1834
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:44,640
Indeed indeed. Well a hashtag justice for monkey. I don't know man. Hopefully that shit works out

1835
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:51,960
We'll say sending in appeals every single day begging the stupid fucking interns who look at this shit to actually watch the video and tell

1836
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,360
Me you wear the hate speeches because they couldn't do it. It's impossible

1837
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,360
You're fucking intro bit

1838
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:02,800
Monkey Jones, that's me. That's like my favorite. I don't know. That's line is fucking hilarious. You know, it was funny

1839
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:09,000
I really like that. Yeah, I just I really get a kick out of the the bad monkey dancing in public scenes

1840
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,680
Those are my favorite parts of all of your videos coming up. I'll survive

1841
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,080
I don't even know how the song goes, but it was great

1842
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,240
Okay, here's here's another question getting off that I guess at ice killer 159

1843
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,280
My old friend the Excalibur Excalibur. Yeah, Excalibur that guy's cool

1844
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,640
Would you say that DLC has overall been a good thing to happen to gaming?

1845
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,920
No, and no, no not at all. Nope the fact

1846
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:43,480
Well, I mean DLC as like the idea of downloading extra things is no, but the idea of purchasing it. Yes

1847
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,800
Remember you can have like like a like. Oh, yeah, we patched we patched something and made it

1848
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,600
I mean, I mean, I disagree with that. It's cool that we're no longer stuck in the days

1849
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:01,520
We're like you have to buy like Sonic the like extra fucking cartridge to like plug your Sonic 3 and 2 so you can play as

1850
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,760
Knuckles or whatever like it's cool that we've been unshackled from that

1851
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,440
But also it sucks and it's not it's abused and I mean

1852
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,160
I guess I guess I like the idea of DLC in principle

1853
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:19,560
But I know that like companies do it in a shitty way that like just fucks their consumers things like Artorius of the

1854
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,960
Abyss are like good examples of DLC that do everything right or like the Bloodborne DLC and shit

1855
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,160
But like like the the idea of like electronic media and you know that you can just download everything and then endlessly

1856
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:36,040
Put out patches everyone should check out a little video by by an old man called Endless Jess

1857
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,200
Who who I forget the name? It was it was in the city, right?

1858
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:47,360
City one. Oh, yeah, that's my second favorite guy next to furnace room. Yeah, he's pretty good

1859
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:53,560
They're both good that video just really lays bare like the the agony that we all have to go through of how like

1860
01:15:53,880 --> 01:16:00,640
Video games will like be updating for a thousand years and like it was so great to just buy a fucking game

1861
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,760
You put it in your thing and then you're playing it now and all the like I'm expanding from DLC

1862
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,680
Just like electronic gaming like downloadable content and all that shit like it's made to developers

1863
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,160
Super fucking lazy and like now they just don't give a fuck about like delivering like a complete package day one

1864
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,360
Now they're like, oh, we'll just patch it man

1865
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:26,360
Who gives a fuck like right now they are continually like tweaking Final Fantasy 15 to make it like the real game

1866
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,520
And oh what we rejoice in like ten years when we've got like oh, we did it

1867
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,440
We've got the real Final Fantasy 15

1868
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:37,800
Meanwhile, I buy that shit day one and I punished for it because I care too much

1869
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,720
About you know playing the game when it comes out the people who invest the most are the people who are punished the harshest

1870
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:50,600
You get the worst experience. I don't like that structure people should be rewarded for supporting your fucking product instead of punished for it

1871
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,600
I hate that shit. I mean I

1872
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,080
Thinking about like the Dark Souls DLC. I bought

1873
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,960
The Dark Souls one the prepared to die edition which had the DLC in it

1874
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,520
So I mean I like the DLC

1875
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,200
But if I didn't like it and I bought it separately

1876
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:11,880
I would feel constantly bad that I had purchased that extra add-on when I didn't need to and with every other Dark Souls game

1877
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,880
It's like now that I purchased this DLC. I better enjoy it

1878
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:22,160
Whereas if it was just part of the game like I could just think of it as part of the game like I don't really like that level

1879
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:26,760
I won't play that one. Mm-hmm, and it's I don't like that it it makes me think that at all

1880
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,040
I don't like thinking about it

1881
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:33,320
I don't want to be naive either because like I know game development costs are just shooting through the roof and like DLC is one

1882
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,160
Way of like them them like you know compensating for that

1883
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,800
But like all the problems I've said still stand and like DLC should never like

1884
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,760
I don't know. Well, that's you shouldn't rely on it

1885
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,680
That's the problem because because development costs are skyrocketing, but it's not like games are getting better

1886
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,560
Right, you know like it's not like there's any real return on that investment

1887
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,280
It's like that's that's the problem that should I have fixed

1888
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,600
I have a not not DLC used as like a weird fucking patch to take to cover

1889
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:06,920
DLC should only stand for dick licking contest with fine juggalette bitches

1890
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I

1891
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:15,160
Agreed agreed. I actually have like a video about this that will not be out as we're recording

1892
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:20,160
But we'll be out by the time people are watching this. Oh hell. Yeah, it's a rant about realism and

1893
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:27,480
Video game. I think a lot of it comes from like the normie influx is gaming has hit the mainstream and people want like people don't

1894
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:31,680
Actually get what's good about video games. They just want the shitty cinematic experience like they want to play

1895
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,920
They're only picking up they're only picking up on the tangible details. Yeah. Oh my god

1896
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,880
I just remembered I just remembered that last night last night

1897
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,280
I had a bunch of shitty dreams and one of them was a terrible nightmare about me playing

1898
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,800
I don't know. I think it was uncharted. I've never played uncharted

1899
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:53,920
But I was playing what my mind imagines uncharted to be and I was just like oh my god the game plays itself

1900
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,920
I'm not

1901
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,760
Really

1902
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,480
Who else had shitty dreams who's that Martin Luther King jr. Oh

1903
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,160
Yeah, but he had one good dream that was good, you know, it's just the one dream was pretty nice

1904
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,440
There was I was just gonna say his dream was Hillary's nightmare

1905
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,440
Exactly there's this one. There's this one chart that gets passed around on V a lot

1906
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:31,080
That's that's very misogynistic and it's very problematic and it's it's like a picture of like Mario

1907
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:36,920
With just like a list of like years and then like what women thought of video games at this time in history

1908
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,440
And it starts at like

1909
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,600
1995 and it's like there for nerds and you're gay if you play them and it let just like go

1910
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,920
That's that repeated like ten times until you hit like 2000

1911
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,080
It's like oh what are those guys doing over there and then like 2001

1912
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:54,000
Oh, maybe I can get it on this and it just shows it like slowly like creeping in and like like changing

1913
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,400
And then the last ones are like we games are for us and if you can accept that you need to get the fuck out of here

1914
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:04,080
Yeah, and um, you know, I don't actually feel that that's like a super accurate for all women or anything

1915
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,760
But it reflects like the normie influx of video games guys. I had a dream

1916
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,520
That I was at a place with my dad

1917
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,320
And there was another dad with his littler kid than me

1918
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:22,520
He was a little kid and that dad sent the littler kid to annoy my dad my dad turned around and he beat the shit out

1919
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,920
Is that for doing that he didn't beat the shit out of the kid the kid did nothing wrong

1920
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:35,440
Yeah, and I felt so proud and I then I woke up and I was like yeah, that young child's name was Trayvon Martin

1921
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,160
He didn't do nothing. He didn't do nothing everybody

1922
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,640
All right, I know

1923
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,640
Doesn't

1924
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,320
What the fuck are we okay the question let's get out of question here here's a simple question at Siamid

1925
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Simply says bug fuck

1926
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:11,360
Depends definitely well, that's that's what we need to you know the bug wars are going on

1927
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:17,280
But like we need we need to look forward to a better future where we can we get we and the bugs can love one another instead

1928
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,160
You know, uh-huh. So yeah, so yes enthusiastic. Yes to bug fuck

1929
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:28,080
There's a very me me Twitter that has been blowing up recently called spike the beetle and it's this

1930
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:34,480
Oh, yeah, I'm speedal with the big the pinchers and they put like a pen in his hand and they let him paint

1931
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:41,000
Oh, I saw that yeah, you know, I look at that beetle and I think this guy fucks this bug

1932
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,960
I

1933
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,920
Just want to give all the girls love and I want to give an unequivocal yes to this question because of Hornet from Hollow Knight

1934
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:59,240
Who is the sexiest bug? I've ever seen and I love her and she's great and she's super cute. I love her dress

1935
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:07,600
She's a fucking fish bitch fuck that slut. Yeah, if if a bug is a woman then of course

1936
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,400
Who beat I still want to be gay with a man bug

1937
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:17,740
Yeah, that would be unacceptable, but I like it like an armoured penis or whatever they would have

1938
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,120
Armoured penis that sounds that sounds like a Mega Man X boss

1939
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,000
Let's okay, let's let's end this thing. Here's one more question

1940
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,880
Yeah, at 5 8 Keegan asks do you think YouTube has been oversaturated with reviews?

1941
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,600
Delete all the channel

1942
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:49,240
The problem is there's too many that are not good and they make I mean I would imagine they would make people think that what I make is

1943
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,800
I think there's too many here. I think there's too many period even the good ones

1944
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,080
Yeah, I agree. I agree. They need to all go away. So you know what everyone everyone look up a video on YouTube

1945
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,440
called

1946
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,440
Bill Hicks Hitler had the right idea

1947
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:13,640
He just he absolutely loses it on a heckler and starts screaming about please God wipe these scum from the earth and like

1948
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,520
It's it's like it's not even funny like he's clearly

1949
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:24,260
Audience feels really awkward about it because he's really screaming at this guy like please God kill everyone

1950
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,520
Hitler had the red idea. He was just an underachiever

1951
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,560
That's why I feel about reviews and analysis videos on YouTube. I feel like Bill Hicks

1952
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,160
screaming kill them all

1953
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,720
Agreed. It's it's really just that

1954
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,360
There's you know, there are good things to review

1955
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:46,120
But I'd rather people make more good things to review than to review the good things

1956
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,680
I mean

1957
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:52,720
I only care does that because reviewing good things is easy and everyone does it and I do it and I feel stupid

1958
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:59,280
I'm basically totally uninterested and people talking about specific peeps pieces of media outside of the fact of them like making a

1959
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,240
larger point about like I don't know something that is

1960
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:09,560
Actionable or you know like is good and smart in some way. I don't know. I don't know

1961
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,600
You know what? They're entertaining if they're entertaining or they're a cool person

1962
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,480
Yeah, then it will be good. It's it's about it's like ideally

1963
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:21,720
It's about the person doing like making the review and like you like you watching it for their for their personality or whatever

1964
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:27,560
And just like you like and the game itself or the movie itself is just like a sort of like prompt to get them on a

1965
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,640
Thing it's like this movie or this game is like smart and good

1966
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:39,080
And they're just like using that to attach themselves to it and make them seem good. Yeah, you know what?

1967
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:45,560
You know, it's not even reviews and analysis. It's the problem. It's it's just please for the love of God be funny

1968
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,640
Everyone. Yeah, isn't funny. Just die

1969
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,520
I couldn't agree more

1970
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,760
