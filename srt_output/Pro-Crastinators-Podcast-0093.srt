1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, Big Booty Bitches, it's Best Guy Ever here with a special announcement from The Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
RADCON 3!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right, the PCB has officially launched our Kickstarter to fund RADCON 3 Arena.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Since our previous venue is no longer available to us, we had no choice but to enter the arena!

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And by that I mean rent a house.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Six of the Pro Crastinators will be there to make content just like you saw at RADCON 1 and RADCON 2.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The only difference is this time we're doing a Kickstarter specifically to fund that RADCON 10 you love.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The PCP Royal Rumble, the PCP U Lectures, and the live hundredth episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All this and so much more content will be created if we can make this Kickstarter happen.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
By the time you're hearing this, the Kickstarter will have been running for about a week already,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but go ahead and click on the link in the description to check it out.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We've got a bunch of great perks, pledge $10 and get behind the scenes footage of RADCON 3.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
$20 get a pin, $50 get a t-shirt, $100 get a special shout out during RADCON.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And if you're an absolute mad lad who wants to pledge $1,000, you will be entered into the PCP Royal Rumble.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Becoming a meme god.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Six of the members of the Pro Crastinators are signed up to be there.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Best guy ever, Ben St, Digi Bro, Hippo Crit, Tom Oliver, and Munchy.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We are asking for $5,800 to make it happen and with your support, we know we can.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We just want to be able to get together again and make the content that we enjoy making and you love watching.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And this is how we get it done.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So for the full details and if you have any questions, head on over to the Kickstarter link in the description.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's a full breakdown of everything that I just discussed and so much more.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Check it out and please consider donating.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
God damn it, do we want RADCON 3 Arena to be real?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And check out our stretch goals.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For $6,300, we'll be able to afford GoPros and Nerf guns to make RADCON 3 Arena IRL.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Meaning, fucking shooting each other in shed.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's gonna be sick.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And if we make $9,001, we will literally max revive T-Back.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's a mean tier, but yes, we will actually do that if we reach that goal.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's our pitch.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thanks for listening and please click the link in the description and go check out our Kickstarter page.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You know how much we can deliver if we can make this RADCON happen.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you and enjoy the show.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not positive that Jesus is God, but I'm throwing in with Jesus rather than throwing in with you guys,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because you guys can't tell me how it all got here.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You guys don't know.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We're working on it.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Physicists are working.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
When you get it, then maybe I'll listen.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You disgust me.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay, here we go.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Procrastinator's Podcast.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's the PCP.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Filling your brain with higher dimensional thoughts that you've never been.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I am the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Hippocrates.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Admiralakba.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's high energy PCP today.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ben St.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm Wiccanow.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, Tom Oliver.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Jesus is the best guy ever.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, fuck.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Munchy.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where's TinyHat?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, guys, my strategy for this game is to rush calendars so I can pick up an early pantheon

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and then spam some caravans for my UA.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I didn't miss anyone, right?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's everyone.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, that's everyone here.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All the five boys are here.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And we did it, guys.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We cracked the life code, because today we're talking about the only question that matters.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Which video game is best video game?

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's Undertale.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just throwing that out there.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I got a strong contestant here.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Here.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have a strong connection here.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You guys say your favorite, so I'll get mine.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I like Undertale.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm a big fan.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I like Undertale, personally.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I need to bait that it's Undertale, like the way the truth of the life.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No, but let's just keep going through the motions.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The real question is who likes Undertale the most?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's really true.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The best video game ever made is Active Life Magic Carnival for Wii.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sponsored by Active Life Magic Carnival.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Four video games that are inferior to Undertale.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The Active Life Mac controller not included.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Cannot find this anywhere.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I looked on eBay.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not there.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, okay.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's a good contender.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I consider that sort of a subset of the greater Undertale worship community.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And really, what I think we need to do is start dividing ourselves into subdivisions of Undertale worship.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know, like there's the lowly papyrus clan.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There's the sans, you know, devouts.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The sans devouts.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The sans orthodox.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Indeed, indeed.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We need to form these factions and begin warring intensely with each other.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think that's the best way to kind of burn out the undesirable elements of our community here.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And just spiral into perfection.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Have to prove themselves in a trial by fire.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Otherwise, how do we know?

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I consider myself a hardcore Toriothian.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I live and breathe by the 95 hentais of Toriel.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
My favorite ones.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She is a thick boy, without a doubt.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Enough of this.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, it's religion.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's religion, guys.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We're talking about religion, such as Undertale worship.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And the other ones that are out there.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Most notably.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But Nate, what is religion?

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, excellent question.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's consult the sacred text over on UrbanDictionary.com.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, a religion.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
An organized group of people with a common belief.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Most religions strongly stress ethics and morals,

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
along with setting guidelines for people to follow in their day-to-day life.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait, wait a minute.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you're saying that a religion is...

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm disappointed.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Wait, wait, wait.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I need to just pause for a second.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is something really important.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is that a religion is an organized group of people with a common set of beliefs

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
with a high emphasis on ethics.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So Gamergate is a religion.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, shit.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, no!

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know what's interesting about this?

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've read every single definition of religion on UrbanDictionary.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Not a single one of them is like a meme or a joke.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
God.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And this begins when I think it's an important element.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is good.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because I think this is indicative of how seriously people take religion,

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
that there isn't enough of like even here on UrbanDictionary,

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
everybody's taken this way too fucking seriously.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Jesus Christ.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And it needs to be ridiculed roundly.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
At UrbanDictionary, I'm very disappointed.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know what?

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go to knowyourmeme.com.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's go to knowyourmeme.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes!

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes!

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh my, these cats are fucking on!

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Knowyourmeme.com, baby!

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's see what we've got for religion on...

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, there we go.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, you know your meme!

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
These guys...

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, they'll hook us up.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wait, sorry.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's not...

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're fucking this up for me, Nate!

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He doesn't know how to maneuver this new fang of kids.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think Christian memes would actually have a knowyourmeme page.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
God, God, God.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay, what do you got?

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What do you got?

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
About God as a religious concept typically described as a superhuman spirit.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is a core and often controversial topic of religious, philosophical, and political discussion.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Incredible.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Incredible.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Here's include advice, God.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I gave you free will, bottom text, so use it exactly as I command you to.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Real nice meme there!

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Knowyourmeme!

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm reading the knowyourmeme entry for a religion is also weirdly non-jokey.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, listen to this about religion.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Religion is a spiritual and cultural system of ideas, beliefs, behaviors, blah, blah, blah, built out of holy traditions.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Adherence of religion, blah, blah, blah, they worship.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is not...

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Where's the meme?

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate!

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I come to this meme for one thing and one thing only.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The reason that there's no jokes is because religion in itself is a joke.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's be honest.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There you go.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There you go.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let me just tip my foot over.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The comedy was here all along.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Exactly.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'd like to say that this, dear viewers, will be probably the most circle jerky, circular, secular, like non...

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This will just be all of us have the exact same opinion.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All of us have the exact same opinion because there's only one opinion to derive from this entire topic.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There is no discussion that can even take place at this point.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's all been discussed already.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There is only one position.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm interested in defending religion on this, just to be contrary to my own point of view.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What a shucks.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Nate playing devil's advocate on the religion episode.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, because I am the devil.

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The thing that I was planning on talking about just a little bit is the thing I like about religions is the sick architecture.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And the reason religion is bad in my mind is because they don't build any new really cool mosques and churches and stuff.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They just use the old ones.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And they don't have any cool new stuff.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's because they invented the internet and now they don't have the free time anymore.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
They've got better things to do.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The Muslims have it figured out.

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Look at this sick-ass cube that all the Muslims in perfect circles all gather around and bow to.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They worship the obsidian!

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh my God!

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, but seriously, this is like the most aesthetic thing.

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is so sick.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They've got it figured out.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, if I was going to make a religion, I'd probably want it to center around a cube.

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's not the whole point of this episode. We're going to make a religion.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We've already made a pyramid scheme.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We've already dipped our toes into this concept.

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Dude, I could totally make that in Minecraft right now.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It'd be fucking easy. It'd be baby mode.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Do it right now and we'll have it be the thumbnail for the episode.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's a good idea.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, I don't want to be distracted.

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But to be serious about it, if I was going to make a religion,

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I would sort of have it be...

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's just based on what I think anyway.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But it would be some weird...

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay, human beings are weak and need things to gather around and pretend is real even if it's not.

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They need some sort of spiritual fulfillment in some way.

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You're running thunder here, dude, but keep going.

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Fair enough.

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I would say the worship of intelligence or progress

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
or the human spirit or success of people, human happiness.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Those are the values that I have, so I would just send them a religion around those.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But the problem is that religions are fundamentally based on faith, obviously.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That is the core idea behind every single religion.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Not the best religion of all, Wicca.

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's based around casting six spells and enchantments and sorceries.

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you a cyber Wicca, aka a digital pagan?

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean, I don't want to limit myself to just one box of Wicca.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, there's so many labels, there's so many boxes.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why would you limit yourself to just one?

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I want to be a fucking Wicca, pagan, Christian, Islamic, fucking atheist.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And if I'm going to do that, you can't fucking stop me.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, it would be fucked up.

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It would just be dogmatic to say that you can't be all of those things at once.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Be bigoted.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Indeed.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Indeed, that's true.

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There is a real debate, I think, to be had here between some of us.

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because I generally think...

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We were saying before about how religion does have sick architecture.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Christopher Hitchens, old dead atheist who was pretty cool, used to say that the one thing...

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He would ask this question to people who debated about religion because he's a big atheist guy.

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Tell me one thing that you can get from religion that you can't get from secular humanism or whatever.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the one answer he got that he thought was reasonable...

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I mean, at the time, he said music.

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Like, divinely, faith-inspired music.

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The feeling of surrender to a higher power that is beyond comprehension is something that is basically fundamental to religion.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And that sort of feeling is hard to recapture.

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Can't you be an awe of the infinite universe and all that?

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I mean, I'm an awe of Obama all the time.

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can't you be an awe of Obama?

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I would write civilities about Obama.

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I would get castrated for Obama if I was in the National Obama Choir.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'd do that. I'd sign myself up for that.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, there's a particular type of thing here that you're in the hands of an omnipotent creator that's beyond understanding.

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you telling me that Obama doesn't have big enough hands to hold me?

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Obama's got the biggest hands in the fucking game! That's why he plays so much people!

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay, well, you know what? That's fine at all.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I find some things that...

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Crazy people also can make pretty cool art, which is what's going on here, I'd say.

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, look at this channel.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Look at this channel, fair viewers.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What I was bringing up with the architecture is obviously a lot of architecture back in the day was cool and stuff.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Just like all the religious stuff.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's not like religion isn't the reason we have cool buildings.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Catholicism is super aesthetic.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, it is.

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I love the aesthetic of it.

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, and it's not like I'm saying religion should exist so that maybe a church can be built.

277
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm just saying...

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Some people would argue that, though.

279
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Besides the obvious, like, yeah, it's not real.

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's nice to just let people enjoy the things about it.

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know, I just don't really mind too much about it.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, okay, here's...

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm glad you said that, because that ties into what I was going to get to.

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Here's where we can actually have a debate here.

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Christopher Hitchens would go on to say,

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
beyond being an atheist, he would define himself as an anti-theist,

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
which is that if there even was a God, he would be opposed to it,

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
because he finds the very idea morally reprehensible.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I have a lot of agreement with that position.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I think the idea that God is real...

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So Christopher Hitchens is El from Death Note.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, no, not El, near.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He's near.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He's by the Elf from Elf.

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
As seen in Elf.

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Correct.

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, yes.

298
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, you know what, while I'm at it, I'll just quote the near line that I...

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
As a child, this might have been the first time I really got, like, really fedora tippy just in my own life

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
when I read in the final volume of Death Note when near is about to capture a light.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is a quote that really inspired me.

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I would put on all my Facebook bios and whatnot when I was a young lad.

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It was, even if God exists and I had his teachings laid out before me,

304
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I would still decide for myself what was right and what was wrong.

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And I could not agree more with that.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's great. It's great stuff.

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a great line. It's a great line.

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What direction are we going to take with this?

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Are we going to talk about, like, our histories with the legend?

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Like, how we feel about it first?

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What we're going to do is we're going to talk about our stuff that we know about and think about religion.

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then we're going to create our own religions each.

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
God, I agree.

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And explain the teachings.

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay, here, I'm just going to lay out this before, like, spoiler alert.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is the only discussion that can occur around religion.

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This will just be a spoiler for the podcast here.

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm going to condense all the history of religious discussion into, like, a paragraph.

320
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I like God. Well, he's not real. There's no evidence.

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, but I like him.

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, but, you know, there's no evidence.

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, I know.

324
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It makes me feel comfort because I don't like the idea of there not being God.

325
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's nice to feel comfort, but it's fake.

327
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There, it's done.

328
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yep, that's done.

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, that's it.

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
All right, bye.

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's it.

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's the entirety.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What else could you say?

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, that's the thing.

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is it, okay, here's the anti-theist thing.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Is it, in fact, morally reprehensible to believe in God?

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I would argue yes.

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I would argue yes.

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think it just depends on what you do.

340
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
To believe in Him?

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, that's right.

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
To just believe in Him.

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like, to just believe that he's real?

345
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No.

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Like, if you're a kid and you say you believe in God because your parents were told to,

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I mean, in that case, it's different.

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But to be a functioning adult who says you believe in God, I find morally reprehensible.

349
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think.

350
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All right, here's my point on that.

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think, obviously, people don't follow the books 100 percent.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Like, not every person who isn't is a Muslim.

353
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They don't even read the books most of the time.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, they don't read.

355
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Like any adaptation.

356
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They don't know the whole thing.

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We don't cover everything in the books.

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They cherry-pick, you know, and they do whatever they do.

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So the idea that the book, I mean, it is like, it does make bad things happen.

360
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I think if someone just says, yeah, I believe in God, I don't think that initially means anything.

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I just, like, it depends on what they do.

362
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
See, I disagree already with that fundamental position.

363
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Because I think if you say that you believe in God, at the very least,

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
At the very least, it means you're an idiot, but that's all.

365
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Like, it means you're stuck in your ways and you won't change.

366
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But that doesn't mean anything, really.

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It just depends on what you do with, like, it's a case-by-case sort of thing.

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think it informs at least, I totally admit that there's a huge variety of people here.

369
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But if you believe in any God, that means that you believe that there is a creator who made the world as it is.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And, like, to spend any amount of time thinking that there is a God, therefore XYZ happens,

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Like, there is no logical way you can arrive at this conclusion that there's any reason to do so.

372
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So I would say that that is a waste of your time and resources.

373
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But you can't conclude that there's not either.

374
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But that's exactly the point, though.

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay, let me just clarify real quick.

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Atheism, simply, some people define it like, some people are identitarian, which is always a bad thing to be.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And say, I'm an atheist, therefore.

378
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm an atheist, and this defines who I am to person.

379
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The self-professed anti-theist is saying that identitarianism is bad.

380
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I've not actually, I would not never use a label on myself to describe who I am to person.

381
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Wait, what the fuck is identitarianism?

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It just, like, to be, to say that, okay, I'm a Christian.

383
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Like, that means I feel like I belong to this group.

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I am part of it, and this applies to any group.

385
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Like, I am, even saying, like, I'm male, therefore, like, I'm into male stuff.

386
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That is being identitarian.

387
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Which I've already crushed and proved does not exist in a previous episode.

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We've already discussed this.

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We've only proven that wrong.

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, very true.

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The concept of maleness sure is a slippery one.

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If someone is an atheist, therefore, they go and join tons of, like, atheist organizations,

393
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and they write on all their Facebook bios that they're an atheist.

394
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, like, if you do that, then you're, you are becoming an identitarian.

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You're using this label to define yourself, and people will use that to judge you.

396
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So, don't do it.

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Instead, be represented by your ideas.

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But here's the point.

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
An atheist simply means one who lacks the belief in God.

400
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I want, just to be super clear, because people fuck this up every time.

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Lacking the belief, meaning you have not been convinced that something is true.

402
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That is what it means, and therefore, everyone should be defined as an atheist from birth

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
until they have made a logical, educated argument to themselves

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and are convinced that God is real.

405
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That is when you should then say, okay, now I'm transitioning to a theist.

406
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I just feel like it, like, for a lot of people, they never think about it, ever.

407
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And it's just like an answer to a question.

408
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you believe, yes.

409
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I go to church every so often.

410
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, but I don't see too much of a problem in, like, a person who is just a normal person.

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Nothing about them is, like, unusual.

412
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll tell you exactly why it's a problem.

413
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Compared with, like, an atheist or someone who just grew up somewhere else.

414
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll tell you exactly why it's a problem.

415
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's because it allows the demagogues of society to say, look at America, 99%, you know, theists.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is a God-fearing country.

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Therefore, XYZ, I do, is justified in the name of God.

418
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What a great adjective, by the way, that people use it unimarcably, God-fearing.

419
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like, God, like, like, they'll use it as a positive.

420
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like, that's a good thing.

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like, that's something you want people to be.

422
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, yeah, that's a positive.

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
By the way, I really want to say, like, oh, like, I want to say, like, you know,

424
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
oh, you can believe whatever you want to believe it.

425
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I am currently saying that right now with my mouth.

426
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That is how I feel, like, you know, believe whatever you want.

427
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
However, I can't wrangle my empathy as well as I would like to.

428
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Because I just fucking hate him.

429
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I just hate him.

430
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Believe what you want.

432
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But I, it's, it's, stop.

433
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Stop it, please.

434
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If God is real, he is a moral monster.

435
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I don't want to hear any of this bullshit about free will.

436
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If I created a race of, like, super intelligent rats and set them in a cage

437
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and watch them tear each other apart because I gave them the gift of consciousness

438
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and, you know, therefore evil could be created.

439
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I am responsible for that just as God would be.

440
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, I mean, I think it's kind of hypocritical sometimes when people say that, like,

441
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
God is, like, a moral good despite all this.

442
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because we could, we extend ethical consideration to, like, animals

443
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
that we think are, like, intellectually lower than us.

444
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And we can, like, make decisions on, like, a macro scale that, like,

445
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
animals don't have the consciousness to be aware of.

446
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And, like, we didn't create them.

447
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We just look on the situation and be, like, we should do this thing.

448
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You know, like, conserve animal conservation and shit like that, whatever.

449
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So to say that, like, that is a moral imperative, like, that's a moral good.

450
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And then to be, like, well, God can just let us beat our own devices

451
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and that's, like, somehow also good.

452
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It seems like a contradictory position.

453
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, here's an observation.

454
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If you believe in God, you probably also believe in other foolish things,

455
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
like objective morality.

456
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And if you believe in an objective morality, you have to,

457
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
you have to be, like, well, okay, but what is that?

458
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And some people might say that, like, God is the definition of what is good

459
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and therefore anything that God wants is a moral good, like, by definition, you know?

460
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But as we already discussed, our friend, Nier, dispatched that argument handily.

461
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, that was just like his opinion, man.

462
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Well, I think that kind of, like, boils into what I was going to say about religion,

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
which I've already spoken about God and religion in depth in my, like, 45-minute

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
hyperbolic wine chamber episode, which everyone should listen to.

465
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But my kind of thing with religion is, like, I think it's basically just a social shorthand,

466
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
because, like, for an order for, like, a society to function competently,

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
you need to have a bunch of people who have a core set of foundational beliefs

468
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
or ideas that they all agree on, because that's basically the foundation

469
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
you build an entire social structure on top of.

470
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You know, people come together, they believe certain things,

471
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
or they have a certain kind of idea of what, like, good and bad is,

472
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
what, like, right and wrong is, there's, like, a foundation.

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You know, we have, like, law and stuff like that.

474
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And religion is a convenient way of being, like, these are the boundaries of society.

475
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This is the boundaries of behavior, right?

476
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So if you have a society that's all Christian, for example,

477
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
everybody's operating under the same sort of, like, social and moral assumptions,

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
so you have social cohesion that way.

479
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And the interesting thing with, like, America now is that because we're kind of, like,

480
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
stepping back and allowing all this intermixing of stuff to happen,

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
like, we're opening society up to new ideas, but at the same time,

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
society is also becoming more unstable because people can't agree on the essentials anymore.

483
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They can't agree on the foundation when everybody has a slightly different

484
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
resupposition of what that foundation is,

485
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
whether that's religious, whether that's social, anything like that.

486
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So I feel like it's very difficult to come to, like, a social consensus

487
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
when you don't have everybody agreeing on those foundational principles.

488
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I think even especially, like, back in the day, religion was a great way of being, like,

489
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
you know, where, you know, Roman Catholic and their Protestant and, like,

490
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
both those societies have that same sort of basic foundation

491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
that they've built everything on top of.

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It was definitely a great herding mechanism to fucking hurt the sheep idiots of the world.

493
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes, there's no way to disagree with that.

494
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Well, see, that's the thing.

495
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Depending on how you treat it, like, I mean, I am totally willing to admit,

496
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
it is possible that long-term humanity would do better to, like, dogmatically believe

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
in something like Christianity.

498
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It is possible that just, like, general people having the belief in this religion

499
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
will just make humanity do better, like, long-term.

500
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Whereas it's possible we might just, like, fall into chaos.

501
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But if it gets results, you know?

502
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, yeah, if it gets results, but here's the thing that I think guys don't bring up enough

503
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
is that I have, I have a, I put a core fundamental value on the idea of truth.

504
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I totally admit that my, one of the important things to me in this whole argument is truth.

505
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I care about what's real and what's not real for many reasons, including that which I think

506
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
that it's the way to achieve the best results long-term, you know?

507
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And I admit that that, like, is kind of up for debate,

508
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
but I think that it will work out the best long-term if we know all the facts such as

509
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
there is no God.

510
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I have, like, a big, it's sort of like a, maybe it's a cultural thing.

511
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh yeah, it's also that.

512
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But, like, I think it may be a cultural divide where, like, religion, God, yes, no,

513
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the ramifications of society is not a big deal in the UK as much, especially not growing up.

514
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Like, I never met, like, a crazy religious person that would, you know,

515
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
it just feels, yeah, I know it can be, like, terrible,

516
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but I just, I like this idea in my head of, like, I believe people can be okay

517
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and that you can have a conversation with fucking anybody if you're nice to them

518
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and you don't talk about things that would rile them up.

519
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So, like, I try to treat people, like, individually and to grasp

520
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and try and, like, discuss and think about the social ramifications

521
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
of an entire culture, civilization or world based on, like, whether you should

522
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
or shouldn't read a book.

523
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's just a bit too much for my fucking, like, scope of my brain to, like, really comprehend.

524
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Like, it's not to comprehend, but, like, it just doesn't seem like a good use of my time

525
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
to think about whether it's a good idea on such a large scale.

526
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'd rather just lay in it.

527
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But the fact is that people are out there feeling like it is a good use of their time

528
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and making it a big deal, whether you want it to be or not.

529
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I know.

530
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I feel the same way.

531
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Like, while I just said that I hate all of this, I do, you know,

532
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I have a lot of fucking, you know, religious family that I wouldn't, like,

533
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I wouldn't say, like, you know, crazy fucking snarky atheists bullshit to them

534
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
because, you know, I just like them as people

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and I don't feel the need to rile them up and, you know, I'll treat them as an individual.

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I just don't like this idea because, like, like, because, like,

537
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I guess it was different in the UK, but, you know, everyone's religious

538
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
from where I am coming from, my family.

539
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You know what was interesting?

540
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And you know what was interesting over the holidays?

541
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah.

542
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Sorry.

543
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You know what was interesting over the holidays?

544
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I went back home and was with my family for Christmas and whatnot

545
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and, like, there was a moment where I had a conversation with my dad.

546
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't remember why, but, like, the word...

547
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I mean, why would you ever?

548
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Indeed.

549
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The word atheist came up and, like, I was just like, yeah, blah, blah, blah.

550
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You know, the guy's not real, et cetera, et cetera.

551
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And my dad, I know, is religious.

552
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But then he looked at me surprised and said, wait a minute, are you an atheist?

553
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And what was weird was that I thought that we had discussed this specifically before

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and I don't know if maybe he just was like, yeah, he's just feeling this way right now.

555
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And then I, unfortunately, I just, like, I was like, oh, yeah.

556
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, yeah.

557
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Big time.

558
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, no.

559
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Like, the unfortunate thing about that was I feel that in that moment, he then began to project

560
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
everything from the, you know, 60 or so years of his life about what he had learned about atheists

561
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and his, like, idea of what an atheist is.

562
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like, he then was like, oh, now I need to project all this onto my son.

563
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah.

564
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Whereas, see, that's exactly my point.

565
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's what I did with vegetarianism right there.

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, exactly.

567
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That's exactly my point is, like, some people are very judgmental when it comes to labels.

568
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And so I just, like, I try not to do that to them.

569
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I try not to do that to anyone.

570
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I agree.

571
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's the way to do it.

572
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And they say, I'm very religious.

573
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm like, oh, well, I'm not.

574
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And they go off on me and then they're a piece of shit.

575
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But I'm not going to go away saying, I hate Christians now.

576
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't think any of us would be like, if someone were to say they are a Christian,

577
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
we would like, like fucking like block them and run away screaming.

578
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, but like, it's the same thing on just a larger scale to say most of them are like this.

579
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Because I've met like vickers and stuff who are just normal nice people who like the community

580
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and they just, they are good at stuff.

581
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
When they're not raping boys.

582
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't have any opinions on Christians as a whole.

583
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I have it on Christianity and just religion.

584
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't know anything about Christians as a whole.

585
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's why I was careful to say, I'm not like anti, I actually am anti-Christian.

586
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But I'm anti-Christian because I believe that I have a case to make that the ideas of Christianity are destructive.

587
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like it's not that I think every Christian is a bad person or any religious person, of course not.

588
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And like somebody like Sam Harris likes to bring up for like non-destructive religions like Jainism, for example.

589
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Jainism being this religion where like violence is like the ultimate taboo.

590
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So these guys go around in like monasteries and they wear masks over their mouth so that they don't accidentally inhale a bug and kill it.

591
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Because that would be a grave sin.

592
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And you know, things of this nature.

593
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I find Jainists pretty morally reprehensible too because of all the fucking time they're wasting caring about shitty bugs that don't matter.

594
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So, you know, fuck them, fuck them.

595
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I agree.

596
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm totally with you.

597
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's like what's the point?

598
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Like sure you're not adding anything, but what's the point?

599
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Who cares about a fucking bug?

600
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I just hear that the same sort of like zealotry in anti-religion that there is in religion.

601
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And I know that there's like...

602
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's funny how atheism has become a religion almost.

603
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, I hate that line so much.

604
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Fuck off.

605
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm not saying that.

606
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I know that there are objectively good things about atheism and stuff like that.

607
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Like I'm not arguing that religion should ever...

608
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Like if I was to say to someone, I wouldn't recommend any of them to anybody.

609
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But I just...

610
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I think to solve problems in society, instead of telling people to stop like doing their thing that gets them really riled up and angry,

611
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
it's to control other things like money.

612
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Like to make incentives aside from religion that would like...

613
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
In the UK, so many people don't go to church, but of course it used to be a very religious place.

614
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And it's because of things that just to distract them like technology and things that nobody cares anymore.

615
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Like the school system...

616
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
How did they admit a mockery of the whole fucking thing by making themselves head of the church?

617
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And then it was just like, well, I guess this is a joke now, so whatever.

618
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We'll just fucking...

619
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know whether that's it.

620
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But like it's...

621
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Close enough.

622
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Religion will...

623
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Canon does become pacified.

624
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
In America, it's kind of...

625
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Kind of...

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's kind of big.

627
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, until the fucking...

628
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So I don't know how that's going to change.

629
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But like...

630
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
There's ways to go about changing the world in the way you want without attacking groups of people who are very prone to get angry and mad and violent.

631
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You know what?

632
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm really glad you brought this up because I want to dismantle this argument that I personally am attacking anyone.

633
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Who the fuck am I attacking by making an argument that your God is fake and you're a fucking idiot for believing in him?

634
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's just...

635
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's not attacking.

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's just like common sense.

637
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
These people, they are very...

638
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But it's not to them.

639
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
They don't know shit.

640
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
They don't...

641
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They believe in God.

642
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
They're so stupid.

643
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That's the whole point.

644
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You can't approach them so undelicately if you want to change their minds about stuff.

645
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay, okay.

646
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You know?

647
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You know, there's this...

648
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Sam Harris talks to this guy at Majid Nawaz.

649
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
They've done a bunch of work together.

650
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And Majid is a former Islamic extremist who, you know, a lot of like left-wing people think that he's like a...

651
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They call him a fucking coon and shit, like a porch monkey because he like is trying to...

652
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, I mean, they really hate this guy because he is a...

653
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Did you hear the dude?

654
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Have you heard of the term coconut?

655
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I've heard that pop up.

656
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, okay.

657
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That makes sense.

658
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
When they're brown on the outside, white on the inside.

659
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
They're just like, oh my God.

660
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Brown and very hairy on the outside.

661
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

662
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So, you know, it makes sense.

663
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Very nice.

664
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It makes sense.

665
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It makes sense.

666
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But so like these guys work together, you know, Sam is an atheist who thinks that there's like problems with the fundamental beliefs of Islam.

667
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And Majid is a former Islamic extremist who himself like advocated for like the destruction of Western society as a young man.

668
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But now is like, well, okay, no, that actually is ridiculous.

669
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And he's basically an atheist, but he calls himself like a cultural Muslim at this point.

670
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And like, I totally agree.

671
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
If I want, for example, it's not specific to them, but for example, I'd like the Muslims, the Muslim community to produce just less terrorists.

672
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
We can all agree that there are some terrorists that come out of Islam just like they do from Christianity.

673
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The scale might be different, but it happens.

674
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I would like there to be less.

675
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And I think one effective means to do so would be to talk to the leaders of that religion and have them, you know, say that like, yeah, you know, this is some bullshit.

676
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
What we've been talking about like kill the Westerners and, you know, the women are horrors because they don't cover up and stuff.

677
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's the sort of change in attitude I would like.

678
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I would like that to be a first step towards everybody realizing God's not real.

679
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's bullshit.

680
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We're all people.

681
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let's just be friends together.

682
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That's what I want.

683
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That's what I want.

684
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So I think you're right, Gib.

685
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I think you're right.

686
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't disagree.

687
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah, I think that like most of this podcast, at least to me, is all basically 20 years old.

688
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's none of this.

689
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's like 700,000 years old.

690
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I feel like we're like, you know, it's been said that the PCP is turning into just fucking, you know, mansplain where we talk about shit that we don't understand.

691
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And, you know, none of us are theologists here.

692
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But like this is just...

693
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I was a Christian, man.

694
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm fucking confirmed.

695
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
We're just fucking...

696
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Like, again, there is no other conclusion to come to from this.

697
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Like, none of us, like Hippo, I agree with you.

698
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think we all agree with you.

699
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
No one hates Christians.

700
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This is all just nothing.

701
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This is all nothing.

702
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We've said nothing this entire podcast.

703
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You guys need to stop.

704
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You should stop apologizing for your opinion here that religion's ridiculous.

705
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I think it's counterproductive.

706
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Everyone's going around these days saying like, oh, it's so tired to say that God's not real.

707
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Let's just like lay off it for a while.

708
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's not what I'm saying at all.

709
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's not what I'm saying to even one.

710
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It is.

711
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You and everybody else out there is all like, oh, it's so uncool to say that God's not real anymore.

712
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
No, it's cool.

713
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's still cool.

714
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It will always be cool.

715
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm still cool.

716
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm not saying that we shouldn't have this discussion.

717
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm just saying...

718
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
This is not a commentary on the actual topics of the discussion.

719
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's of the discussion itself.

720
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And just like...

721
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
My conclusion to bring with this is just that, okay, like, confirmed God is wrong.

722
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Okay.

723
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I just want to say...

724
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I don't think the PCP has ever been about like making a change with the topics we talk about.

725
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We're just fucking around.

726
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
We're circle jerking.

727
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Now, let me make a case real quick for why you should literally murder every Christian you see on the street.

728
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

729
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Here's what we got.

730
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Here's what we got.

731
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Because they believe in God, they're willing to kill the gays.

732
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
They'll kill you if you commit adultery or anything.

733
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Like we are.

734
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It is your moral responsibility to kill every Christian you see at any given time, America.

735
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So wake the fuck up, get that axe out, get it nice and sharp, and get to work on the streets.

736
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I want to see mass murder by tomorrow.

737
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Nate says, kill the infidel who believes in God.

738
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah.

739
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

740
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Do any of us have any lingering thoughts about God?

741
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
How many of us grew up religious?

742
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Or at least in a religious environment?

743
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Hardcore religious group.

744
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Me and Nate grew up pretty moderately religious.

745
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Like we would go to church and stuff, but that was like the extent of it.

746
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But then I read Death Note and it all changed.

747
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We should like first communion and we got confirmed at our church and stuff, but like...

748
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I think our church was just real like pretty liberal about it and like I didn't even get the sense that the church even cared that much.

749
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Because heroic atheists such as myself have been beating down Christianity for generation upon generation,

750
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
leaving it the hollow husk that it is now and we need to do the same to all religions.

751
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Especially Janus.

752
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I will kill every Janus that's out there.

753
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Unproductive.

754
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
My family is not religious, but I did go to a primary school which had a church attached to it called All Saints School.

755
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And every Friday I think we would go in there because we didn't go to school on Sundays or whatever.

756
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We would go in there and have like, we have assembly every morning in the normal hall.

757
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And then on the Friday we would go into the church and we would sing hymns and stuff.

758
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But I never got the sense of like any of this was supposed to be taken as real.

759
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And even we had like RE, we would have like religious education classes every so often talking about.

760
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We would talk about, well it's not like the Christian stuff, it's just like religion in general.

761
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Like today we're going to learn about Sikhism and stuff.

762
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And then one day a couple times a year the vicar from the church who is like a really tall,

763
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
he was like seven foot and he had a big old white beard.

764
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He was basically Father Christmas and he was so fucking cool.

765
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And everyone loved him.

766
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He was like a paragon of the local community.

767
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And he would like read us things from the Bible and tell stories about it.

768
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Like he wouldn't just read it, he would like tell a story.

769
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And it's like dude, this is cool.

770
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's the yesterday man.

771
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I just never got the sense that it was real.

772
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And then I asked my dad like, is that stuff real?

773
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And he says, no.

774
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And I was like, oh, that's my religious upbringing.

775
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
There you go.

776
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Pretty sick.

777
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's just a bunch of cool hymns and fun shit and a cool church that I love.

778
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I have a weird relationship with God because well, I was in a pretty religious family.

779
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I have a personal relationship with God.

780
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I was in a pretty religious family.

781
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But like, I can't remember a time where I thought God was real, even though I went to church and like extensively.

782
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I just don't even remember a time thinking that.

783
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
My relationship, like I was never into God.

784
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But at this point, my relationship with God is basically the same sort of relationship I had with my kids

785
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
after my wife divorced me, after finding her in bed with another woman, non-existent.

786
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't have any lingering thoughts about that.

787
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Even though like I went to fucking, like I was a church boy.

788
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I went to Awana and shit.

789
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I just, I just hate it so much.

790
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I can't even remember if there was any time where I believed any percent ever.

791
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I remember being like, as much as the zero percent run on his religious speed running.

792
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

793
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I remember being like 14 or so and being in the shower one day and just being like, wait a minute.

794
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't think I really believe all this God stuff.

795
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Wait a minute, touching my willy feels so good it can't be wrong.

796
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
There's just no way.

797
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This is a sin.

798
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It was pretty, it was pretty sick.

799
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Did any of you go to Awana by the way?

800
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

801
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Awana? Awana means family?

802
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I saw that movie in theaters. It was okay.

803
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

804
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Awana?

805
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't know what you mean.

806
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But here, if it's alright, I would like to explain my experience with Awana, if that's alright.

807
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
If I could just have the floor here for a second.

808
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Okay.

809
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Awana was this, I guess I'll call it a program, that my mother enrolled me in to try and reinvigorate

810
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
my need to go to church, which was never there in the first place.

811
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But she was just desperately trying to convert me to become a Christian at this point.

812
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But she could tell that the light was fading from my eyes and my eyes were rolling back in my fucking skull.

813
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And I was getting an aversion to crucifixes and the like.

814
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I am a fucking ghoul.

815
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Anyway, so it's at this, it was this, like kind of late at night, like seven.

816
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Like an age group for this is I'm like eight or ten.

817
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Probably around eight.

818
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Anyway, at seven, there would be a church, you know, in my town.

819
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And I would go there at like every Wednesday at seven.

820
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And here's, I'm going to break Awana into three parts.

821
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The running around in the circles part, the killing part, and then the scary part.

822
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The first part was my favorite because it involved, there is a big circle out in the field, a lawn of the church.

823
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's just this big circle.

824
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And you would play games to warm yourself up into the God-loving spirit and into the God-fearing spirit.

825
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Sorry, sorry.

826
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You know, to get those little kids fucking fearing for their fucking lives with fire and brimstone.

827
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
If they ever, you know, betray God.

828
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So basically I would just run around in circles non-stop.

829
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Even when they told me to stop, I wouldn't stop because I just loved it so much.

830
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
There was free orange juice and it was great.

831
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And every single time I got lured into a false sense of security because I just loved orange juice

832
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and ran around in circles so much that I almost forgot the killing part.

833
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So it's like after like, like, like, like 20 minutes of me running around in circles.

834
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
They would like, alright guys, it's time to learn about the Bible.

835
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And they would like round us up, like, like fucking break us off into groups so we're easily to manipulate and like overpower.

836
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And they would lead us into like this big like fucking like, I guess I would call it like a library part.

837
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And they would just like force us for like two hours to just like do like school assignments and essays on the Bible.

838
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It was a fucking nightmare.

839
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And everything was dimly lit with candles.

840
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There were no actual lights. There were only candles because I guess that's how they did it back in the day.

841
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It was fucking terrifying and awful.

842
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And I had to write essays about the Bible, which at this point I already knew was like, I like, no, no, thank you.

843
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And after that, that wasn't even it.

844
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
They forced us to go to fucking like, like, like a church, you know, like into the real church part

845
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and just like stare at this fucking priest, give like a real ass sermon to these fucking like, like, like field sea of children

846
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
who don't even like know some of the words he's saying.

847
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
That's what was one of those like for like every week for like five fucking hours for my entire life.

848
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And it never, it never got a hold of me.

849
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm so happy it didn't even though my fondest memories of kid are still running around in circles.

850
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And I still do that to this day.

851
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's, that sounds rough, buddy.

852
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I also want to, you know, the reason that I suggested we do religion, it's because I wanted to come clean, guys.

853
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I need to confess because I am in fact a secret religious person, more than anyone in the world.

854
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
See, okay, the reason I have a problem is because I was deeply embarrassed by my own religious beliefs as a child.

855
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So now I feel the need to destroy the temple that these were founded on.

856
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So that's what this has all been about my whole life.

857
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So when I was a kid, we were in Sunday school and one fateful day, the teacher of the Sunday school,

858
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
this lady who I forget the name of, started telling us about like, okay, guys, real shit, my little Negroes.

859
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,000
What happens when you're in a situation where someone is using the word God or swearing and you as a good Christian, it makes you uncomfortable?

860
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
What the fuck do you do?

861
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And I was like, I mean, so this was all new to me that like any of this would be a problem.

862
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Probably like 12 or 13 or so.

863
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And was this like a quiz? Was this like a pop quiz?

864
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
No, this was just a discussion in our little class about like, she's just like, okay, real situation guys, someone's using God's name in vain.

865
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
What the fuck do you do?

866
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's what this was presented as.

867
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And so I began to reflect, God, I don't know what to do when the infidel begins speaking the Lord's name.

868
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Please tell me.

869
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So it was at this point that she's like, okay, guys, here's what happens.

870
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You calmly, politely go up to this person and say, excuse me, it makes me very uncomfortable that you are using the Lord's name in vain.

871
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And I would appreciate it if you would stop doing that.

872
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And she would say and do the exact same thing with her swearing.

873
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You go up to them and say, excuse me, I am a Christian and that kind of language is deeply offensive to me.

874
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Please cease and desist this activity at once because you're making me uncomfortable.

875
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Okay, this was the argument presented and this blew me the fuck away.

876
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I was like, this is it. This is the answer I've been looking for.

877
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This is what I'm going to be.

878
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
This gives me power over my peers.

879
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I can go lambast them for, you know, all their minor infractions against God and man, aka me.

880
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So here I go.

881
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:54,000
From this point on, I began a year-long crusade against those around me in school and otherwise who would use the word God in any situation and who would just swear to even the slightest degree.

882
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I became that kid in quotes, that kid, in fucking parentheses.

883
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I remember times in your childhood when you would just never swear.

884
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I remember years-long period where you would never ever swear.

885
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I remember it as just like, I'm sure that went on, but there was a distinct year where I became a zealot of telling people to not swear nor use the name God in any context.

886
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
In any context, you must say the Lord or, you know, just be polite about it.

887
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You got to say God in like the right context.

888
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So I just became, I became a fucking crusader.

889
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I started my own one-man crusade and just looking back on it, it's so humiliating to me that I did that, that I swore I would destroy the temple that indoctrinated me into this belief.

890
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So that's the real reason why I, you see, God is real.

891
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I just want to confirm for everybody, God is real, but I am mad at him.

892
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That's why I'm an atheist.

893
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's why I am an atheist.

894
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's, that's, this is real.

895
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
There you go.

896
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Okay, so that's, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

897
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Do you have a definitive moment when you realized you were not religious?

898
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Do you have like a moment?

899
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Ben shared his.

900
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I actually, I think what made me, like, what Gibbs said way before about like how people just don't think about it.

901
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:25,000
What, what I remember is that like, okay, when I was 16 and I was getting confirmed, you know, which is like, when you go through the confirmation, like the pros of like becoming a real Christian or whatever.

902
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You have to like, you get hate.

903
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah, like for us, it was like in our congregational church, you like, you have a mentor and you like meet with them and you talk with them.

904
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And you had to beat him in a hand-to-hand comment so he could be considered a real Christian, yeah.

905
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'll always, I'll always remember.

906
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I forget the name of the guy, but he called me, he said he liked me.

907
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Was it Mr. Waterman?

908
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, it was Mr. Waterman.

909
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Who called me a serious young man.

910
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
He was my like confirmation mentor too.

911
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, he was cool.

912
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
He was all right.

913
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I liked him a lot.

914
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But at the, during the process of like going through this thing of like, okay, let's actually think about God, like, what is he?

915
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Like, why do I believe in him?

916
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because I faced those questions, I realized, wait a minute, there like is no reason to believe any of this.

917
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And then I read Death Note and I was like, well, that goes on forever.

918
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's over.

919
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Question answered.

920
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So it was, it was like during, it was when Christianity was put to the test in my life.

921
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's when I realized like, okay, there actually is really no reason to like believe any of this.

922
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Boy, they really, they really didn't get the outcome they were looking for there, did they?

923
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Indeed.

924
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And no, we were, we were a Congregationalist Protestant, whatever that means.

925
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah, Congregationalist.

926
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Which, whenever I asked mom and dad, what does it mean that we're Congregationalists?

927
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Like, what is that?

928
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
They would tell me, but they would only explain it insofar as to explain how we were not Catholic.

929
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't think they understood what Congregationalism actually was.

930
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They just knew they wanted it to be a Protestant church and this was the one in our town.

931
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
The problem with Protestantism and Congregationalism and, you know, all these other Protestant subdivisions,

932
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
is that their whole problem is that they just, they believe that Catholicism is true.

933
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
They just hate it.

934
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They just don't like it.

935
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They know it's real.

936
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
They know it's real, but they're mad at it.

937
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Well, the whole reason the Protestant church got started is because they fucking wanted to get divorced.

938
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
That's, yeah.

939
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I mean, all right, the splintering of Christianity, because it does not make sense, like across the board,

940
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
began long ago with the initial fracturing between, you know, Catholicism and Protestantism,

941
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and I'm sure long before that as well.

942
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So, you know.

943
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Hey, hey guys, maybe you shouldn't be allowing people to buy their way out of going to hell.

944
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah, fuck the church!

945
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh no, what have I done?

946
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
See, that's why, if it would worse, I'm an atheist now, but if I ever realized if I changed my ways,

947
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and I'm like, shit, I fucked up, I was Roman Catholic, so I can just go in there, throw some 20s at the priest,

948
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
and I'm cool with it.

949
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

950
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's all good.

951
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It is such an absurd notion.

952
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I honestly think a lot of these people, like, just thought it was like an obvious joke.

953
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Like, kind of like Flat Earthers today.

954
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Like, it's either people who are just really dumb and not critically thinking,

955
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
or, like, they just think it's a joke that's just gotten out of control.

956
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And like, I think so many religious people are just the butt of a big joke going on in their face,

957
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and I'm like, guys, this is embarrassing, please, just like, think about this.

958
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
What do you, like, you're being humiliated publicly by me right now.

959
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I feel like this has become like the Christianity podcast.

960
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Do you have any, like, thoughts on other religions?

961
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I kill the other religions.

962
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I don't, I think they're all, I wouldn't treat any religion different than the other.

963
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Like, Christianity, I just mean any religion.

964
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Okay, because I, because I, um...

965
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's just easier to say than any religion.

966
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Okay, I guess.

967
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You know, you know what's a cool religion in the sense that it really isn't a religion at all?

968
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Buddhism.

969
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Buddhism.

970
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, I have something to say about Buddhism.

971
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But you go ahead.

972
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Buddhism's like a fake religion.

973
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Buddhism, like, pretends to be a religion.

974
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Okay, I mean, I get that there's, like, different sects of it,

975
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and, like, probably some Buddhists believe different things,

976
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and some of them are more, like, religious about it.

977
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
But, like, the version that I read about,

978
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
it was literally just, like, being a Buddhist just means,

979
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
like, don't let yourself get sad about the things that make you sad.

980
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

981
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And that's, like, the entire fucking thing.

982
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Like, I don't, yeah, I don't know anything about it,

983
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
but all I can tell from, like, the imagery of the fat guy

984
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
is that one fat guy was really happy,

985
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
and some other people were like, oh, I want to be like that.

986
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I want to be happy.

987
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
He was really happy after a period of being really sad.

988
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
My first girlfriend converted to Buddhism while we were dating.

989
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I mean, I don't see why you would need to convert to Buddhism,

990
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
because, like I say, it's not a real religion.

991
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, I guess convert to a strong word.

992
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Just start, she started adopting the principles,

993
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I suppose, it's probably more accurate.

994
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Okay, yeah, well, phrasing on it.

995
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
There was a while where I was uncomfortable calling myself an atheist,

996
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and I was just like, no, like, I'm just not into Christianity.

997
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm into, you know, God and stuff.

998
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Sure.

999
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And by the way...

1000
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
A lot of people go through that.

1001
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
In case you think that was contradictory to what I was saying earlier,

1002
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
this is in complete regard to how I presented myself to my family.

1003
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So I wasn't going to say to my mom, oh, I'm an atheist.

1004
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I was going to say, no, no, no, no, I'm just a Buddhist.

1005
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm just a Buddhist.

1006
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And she was like, oh, yeah, what are they believing?

1007
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And I was like, uh, you know...

1008
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Buddha.

1009
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yeah, obviously.

1010
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yeah, Buddha.

1011
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Right, yeah, no.

1012
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I love Hindu temples.

1013
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Those are, like, some of the coolest fucking places.

1014
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I've never been to one.

1015
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I think I've been...

1016
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I went to one...

1017
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We had, like, in primary school still,

1018
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
because it's a whole saints' church.

1019
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We have a few, like, religious expeditions.

1020
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
What do you call them?

1021
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
School trips.

1022
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Trips? Yeah.

1023
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yeah.

1024
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We went to see a synagogue.

1025
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I think we went to a mosque at some point.

1026
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And a church.

1027
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And a fucking Hindu temple in London.

1028
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
There's, like, one where you can be a Hindu.

1029
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And it's fucking...

1030
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It was so beautiful.

1031
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It was, like, white marble all the way around.

1032
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And it's so elaborate, like, pillars and stuff.

1033
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Just to contrast the non-white people.

1034
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah, they love it.

1035
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Hindus are pretty aesthetic religion, too.

1036
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'm quite fond of it.

1037
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
They've got that fucking elephant-man god.

1038
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah, Vishnu, I think.

1039
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That's him.

1040
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't know.

1041
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
That's a girl.

1042
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Okay, Nash, you're right.

1043
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1044
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Okay, well, this is all cool and all,

1045
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
but my favorite religion, I'm just going to say,

1046
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
in terms of aesthetic, I know I'm going to sound like a wee,

1047
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
but it's definitely Shinto.

1048
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Shinto is sick.

1049
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Shinto looks awesome.

1050
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Unacceptable.

1051
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Come on.

1052
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Those red things and their temples are beautiful,

1053
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and it's an, oh, my favorite anime.

1054
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh, my God, plus.

1055
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It looks nice.

1056
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Plus, let's not forget that the PCP guy

1057
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
is canonically a Shinto god.

1058
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Let's not forget that.

1059
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I do not understand what the fuck Shintoism is.

1060
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I guess it's about, like, there are spirits.

1061
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
There are, like, gods and spirits in nature,

1062
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and you have to, like, be cool with them

1063
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
by washing your hands a lot.

1064
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Correct.

1065
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Correct.

1066
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's how I understand it.

1067
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It's about the nut boys in the nut force

1068
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
playing some B-ball, a.k.a. Bushido ball.

1069
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Well, yeah, I mean, it's like Ben said.

1070
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's like Native Americans just, like, believe

1071
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
that all things have a spirit.

1072
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I'm not well versed in it, but, like,

1073
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
which is similar to Shinto,

1074
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
but I know in Shinto they think that there are, like, real,

1075
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
like Princess Mononoke is a pretty deep,

1076
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
like, obviously it's, like, cartoonized,

1077
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
but, like, it's a fairly decent summary.

1078
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Like, there's spirits that, like, live in, like, forests

1079
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and stuff and, like, protect them,

1080
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
and by, like, appealing to those spirits,

1081
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
you can, you know, like, get favorable outcomes and stuff.

1082
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I mean, I think that's the idea.

1083
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But it looks so cool, the redness.

1084
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Just the color red being, like, the Shinto color

1085
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
is sick.

1086
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It's so cool.

1087
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah, it really looks like Shinto aesthetic

1088
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
of, like, the really big sparkly eyes

1089
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and, like, colorful hair and small mouths and stuff.

1090
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Cloud was just the biggest Shinto propagandist

1092
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
of all time when he blew up the fucking Mako Reactors.

1093
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Fuck materialism, dude.

1094
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I saw this, I was watching this TV show,

1095
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
which is, like, well, what the fuck?

1096
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's called Death Note.

1097
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It had a lot of interesting things to say.

1098
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It was this guy who usually does, like,

1099
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
a gardening show about, like,

1100
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
you should prune these bushes over the winter months

1101
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
because blah, blah, blah.

1102
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's, like, this old, like, English guy who's like,

1103
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
oh, her, her.

1104
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And he went, he was going across, like,

1105
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Middle East places and palaces

1106
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
to look at the gardens of, like,

1107
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
kings and Muslim temples and palaces

1108
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
that were built around Oasis'

1109
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
because that's, like, a real, such an important thing

1110
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
in a desert, obviously, is water.

1111
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And if you have water,

1112
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
the way you show your wealth and stuff is to plant trees

1113
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and bushes and plants and it's, like,

1114
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and it was looking around all these Muslim things.

1115
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And, like, it's pretty good.

1116
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I like Islam now.

1117
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I want to know more about this fucking cool desert aesthetic

1118
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
because I've known about, like, the Christian stuff

1119
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and the Hindu stuff for a while.

1120
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But, like, I want to go to, like, a big old mosque

1121
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
and I want to look at all the cool, like, mosaic stuff

1122
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
that they have.

1123
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I completely agree.

1124
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
When I got super into Islamic

1125
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and also unrelated to Russian architecture

1126
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
for, like, five years of my life

1127
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I just draw fucking mosques in my sketchbook

1128
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
day in, day out because I just thought that, like,

1129
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
how do you even describe the weird, onion-shaped domes

1130
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
on the top of buildings?

1131
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We're just the coolest fucking thing in the entire world.

1132
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I used to think they were the best.

1133
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I think Aladdin did more for, like, positive Muslim vibes

1134
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
than, like, anything in history,

1135
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
at least in the West, at least in the West.

1136
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Why don't you be more of, like, a fucking Aladdin ices?

1137
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Come on.

1138
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Where's your flying carpets?

1139
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, asshole.

1140
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Why don't Alah give you some fucking magic carpets?

1141
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
That's all nice and all you fucking babies,

1142
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
but here's the big boy answer to what's the best religion,

1143
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the Aztec religion,

1144
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
because it has a god, a god, a fucking god.

1145
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh, that's a good one.

1146
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You've seen May Dragon 2.

1147
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I love how he thinks of you.

1148
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I love how big that character is.

1149
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
She's so hot, dude. Yes.

1150
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Oh, no.

1151
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Oh.

1152
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah, Aztecs and Mayans.

1153
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They, they, they, I love old buildings.

1154
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Why don't people build cool shit anymore?

1155
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Where's all the rocks gone?

1156
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Because we stopped believing in God.

1157
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh, you're right.

1158
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay, to completely rob the fun from this discussion.

1159
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Okay, let's not forget that, like,

1160
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Aztecs did perform human sacrifice,

1161
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and they should be lambasted.

1162
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
We know that it's sick and looks cool,

1163
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
but it is morally retarded.

1164
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Nate, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1165
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
No, you come on.

1166
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Nate, you were just, but every time they sacrificed somebody,

1167
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
they were killing someone who believed in God.

1168
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Well, you're not wrong.

1169
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
There are less people who believed in God

1170
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
as a result of their actions.

1171
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Have you guys seen The Road to Eldorada by any chance?

1172
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You probably have.

1173
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I have.

1174
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That's the greatest film ever made.

1175
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Nate, breaking out the hardcore killing people is bad.

1176
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Oh, fuck.

1177
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yeah, I know.

1178
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Thanks, Nate, for coming to this discussion.

1179
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
There's this thing we do where we, like,

1180
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
ignore the bad things about stuff

1181
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and just talk about how sick and cool it is,

1182
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and we shouldn't do that.

1183
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's wrong.

1184
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Are you really going to argue that,

1185
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
like, because I say that Aztecs killing people

1186
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
is a sick as fuck, which we all agree that is.

1187
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
People are going to be like,

1188
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
oh, Aztecs killing people was sick as fuck.

1189
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, I'll just kill some people now.

1190
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yeah, just kill them now.

1191
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
All I'm saying is there's a lot of murder going on

1192
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
in these video games I've been hearing about.

1193
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And I want you to stop immediately.

1194
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It needs to end.

1195
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
The greatest Mesoamerican invention of all time,

1196
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
video games.

1197
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Video games.

1198
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
What was a human sacrifice other than an IRL video game,

1199
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I ask you?

1200
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The Sacrificing of the Heart was literally a cheat code.

1201
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It was literally a cheat code to get a good harvest.

1202
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They were all wearing oculus riffs during this.

1203
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That was their ceremonial headdress.

1204
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I mean, what is the afterlife but a giant video game

1205
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
that we're all implored to buy like season passes to,

1206
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
that we're all implored to pre-order

1207
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
to make sure we get all the sweet loot.

1208
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1209
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, you're not wrong.

1210
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It's funny because it's actually true.

1211
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
All right, guys.

1212
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm going to queue up for competitive.

1213
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
He says lying down the sacrificial bed,

1214
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
ready to fucking die.

1215
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh, but the reason I fucking rode to El Dorado

1216
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
is because the one thing that is sick as fuck,

1217
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and I think they did this in one piece as well.

1218
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The thick bitches are good,

1219
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
but what's better is that I really like this practice

1220
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
they have when they do the sacrifice.

1221
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I don't know if every culture did it,

1222
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
but I know it was true in some places

1223
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
that if you were chosen as a human sacrifice,

1224
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
you got to live the next year as a prince,

1225
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and you would just be like the guy who's the man

1226
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
or the woman or whatever.

1227
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You would be an honored guest in the civilization.

1228
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You would be rich and all your needs would be taken care of.

1229
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Everyone would fucking love you.

1230
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You'd be sick as fuck.

1231
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I'm sure everyone would want to fuck you in that year.

1232
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You were literally made a prince,

1233
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and then after the year of all this good shit,

1234
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
then you were sacrificed.

1235
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's like they honored you,

1236
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and they made it worth your while,

1237
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
because a lot of people would never get this shit.

1238
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I read the Hunger Games.

1239
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
That is sick.

1240
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I read the Hunger Games.

1241
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I know what that's all about.

1242
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Because killing people is bad.

1243
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I know your district gets fed for the year.

1244
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah, that's cool.

1245
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Fucking Nadine is fucking Shintoism.

1246
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Jesus Christ.

1247
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
The Spanish Inquisition's way cooler than Shinto.

1248
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And they're also red.

1249
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah, guys.

1250
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
My favorite religion, the Spanish Inquisition.

1251
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, it's like that's not a real good religion.

1252
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's not a religion.

1253
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You know what?

1254
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It was so aesthetic.

1255
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Everyone wore red.

1256
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
They wore red.

1257
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
What else do you want?

1258
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
They all are.

1259
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I worship the Spanish Inquisition.

1260
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Also the Holocaust.

1261
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I worship human tragedies specifically.

1262
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Each of them individually.

1263
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's like I'm playing Fate Stay Night over here,

1264
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and all of my avatars are specific tragedies that happen.

1265
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
You know, human sacrifice, the Aztec civilization,

1266
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
the Holocaust, you know, bronies.

1267
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
These are all individual gods in my pantheon.

1268
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
We have even discussed the best part of Aztecs

1269
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
is that when they kill an enemy unit,

1270
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
they get free bonus at the culture points.

1271
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah.

1272
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Oh, yeah.

1273
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That is good.

1274
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
They can get a free social policy

1275
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
every time they kill a fucking enemy unit.

1276
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That's great.

1277
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That's incredible.

1278
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Fucking top to your thread.

1279
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I fucking love Eagle Warriors.

1280
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Those are the best units in the game.

1281
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
They literally are.

1282
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Dude, I love dark Templars.

1283
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You can't even see them when they're out there.

1284
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's sick.

1285
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's fucking ridiculous.

1286
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yes.

1287
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You better build a fucking observer, asshole.

1288
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Guys, why are we talking about this game

1289
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
when we all know Undertale is better?

1290
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He's right.

1291
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
He's right.

1292
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm just going to say,

1293
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
they literally gave the Pope a copy of Undertale,

1294
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
which is the most important.

1295
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Oh, no.

1296
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Impressive.

1297
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Amazing.

1298
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
A fucking map pad.

1299
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Fucking map pad.

1300
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Fucking steam key to Undertale.

1301
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Steam key.

1302
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Didn't after the Pope was given Undertale,

1303
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
didn't he like write like a blog post

1304
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
or however they do in the Catholic Church,

1305
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
about how like video games are evil?

1306
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Didn't that happen?

1307
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I'm pretty sure that's real.

1308
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
No fucking way.

1309
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
No fucking way.

1310
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
It's because he didn't like the undyne goat with elves.

1311
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

1312
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I told you.

1313
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It was a forced character pairing.

1314
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
That doesn't make sense.

1315
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It says the Pope in land.

1316
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah.

1317
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
That's what he was saying.

1318
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
He throws his copy of Undertale across the chapel.

1319
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh, we haven't talked about the best part

1320
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
of fucking religion,

1321
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
which is in the Simpsons game for Xbox 360.

1322
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
The ending fucking final level

1323
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
is you go and meet God,

1324
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and the final battle is you have to,

1325
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
this is completely removed

1326
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
from the rest of the gameplay of the entire game.

1327
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
You have to play DDR with the Xbox 360 controller D-pad,

1328
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and it never works as it's so unresponsive,

1329
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
so I died like 70 fucking times

1330
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
on that final level with God,

1331
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
where I had to beat him at playing Rocky like a hurricane.

1332
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It was the hardest video game of my entire life,

1333
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and I fucking hate it.

1334
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That's why God is real.

1335
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That is excellent.

1336
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It just reminds me,

1337
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
at the end of Dragon Guard 3,

1338
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
like you kind of like,

1339
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
it actually, it's like,

1340
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
it's an action RPG game,

1341
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
but at the very end,

1342
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
like the final battle where you are a dragon

1343
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
trying to slay like the combined unity

1344
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
of like all the gods of the world.

1345
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Slay.

1346
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yeah, you slay Queen,

1347
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and you literally slay these Queens,

1348
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
these Yas Queens, these presidents,

1349
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
who shattered the glass ceiling,

1350
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and now you're here fixing it,

1351
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
patching that motherfucker up.

1352
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You are a proud male dragon meaghtow

1353
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
who plays DDR to kill them.

1354
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That is how you win the game.

1355
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That is the final battle.

1356
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It's a sick DDR match that is incredibly difficult,

1357
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
and I did it, and it was so sick.

1358
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It was great.

1359
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Good game, fun game.

1360
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I've got a question.

1361
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I've got a question about video games.

1362
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Okay.

1363
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
What is your favorite,

1364
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
What is your favorite fake video game religion

1365
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
that you've seen in a game?

1366
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Good question.

1367
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You know what I really love?

1368
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I love, it's kind of a cop out,

1369
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
but in Final Fantasy Tactics,

1370
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
there is,

1371
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
it's called The Church of Zoltana,

1372
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I believe,

1373
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
that is basically a 100% parallel

1374
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
for the Catholic Church,

1375
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
but in that vein,

1376
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
it has sick demons,

1377
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
it has summons,

1378
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
it's got a bunch of evil stuff,

1379
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
it's just as corrupt and manipulative

1380
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
as the Catholic Church was,

1381
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
like throughout medieval times and whatnot,

1382
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and it keeps the sick Catholic aesthetic.

1383
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So I'm going to say that one.

1384
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
My favorite religion is the one laid out

1385
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
in the world ends with you,

1386
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
because after you die,

1387
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
you get to be a hip Japanese teenager,

1388
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
and you get to hang out in the trendiest part of Tokyo.

1389
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That's pretty sick.

1390
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
The ultimate reward.

1391
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The ultimate reward.

1392
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
The ultimate reward.

1393
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I don't want to have eternal salvation,

1394
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I just want to be a hip, trendy hipster,

1395
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and hang out in the coolest clubs in Tokyo.

1396
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Why would anyone want anything else?

1397
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Ben, just, I don't know if you've heard about this,

1398
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
have you heard they're making a remastered version

1399
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
of the world ends with you for Nintendo Switch?

1400
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Are you aware of this?

1401
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
No.

1402
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It's got new shit,

1403
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
it's got a new character,

1404
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
it's going to be something.

1405
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Alright, just throw that out there.

1406
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That's pretty cool.

1407
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Literally every single best guy ever video

1408
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
is sponsored by Nintendo, everyone.

1409
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
No, I'm good.

1410
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I am good.

1411
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Okay, go on, Munchie.

1412
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
What's your favorite religion in video games?

1413
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I don't play video games.

1414
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I don't play single player games,

1415
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
or a fucking cancer that I could never slog through.

1416
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I hate them.

1417
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Fucking CSGO is way better use of your time

1418
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
than your fucking TF2 hat swap simulator.

1419
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It sounds like a ball.

1420
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Because those games you can play with other people,

1421
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
which is the only reason I would even

1422
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
wake up in the morning is to be with other people.

1423
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I don't want to fucking play like an RPG.

1424
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You don't care about like final fantasy?

1425
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
No, no thanks.

1426
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Okay, you know what?

1427
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I take it back.

1428
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
The best religion in any video game

1429
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
is the one that the main character of hatred,

1430
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
not important practices,

1431
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
where he's out there murdering everyone.

1432
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's mine.

1433
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That is what I believe and do.

1434
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Well, I think the best religion in video games

1435
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
is the Juggalo religion from Homestuck.

1436
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh, no.

1437
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Because it's funny and it makes me laugh.

1438
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
That's all.

1439
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I don't actually have anything to say.

1440
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Let's cut to the fucking chase.

1441
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Let's finally get this actual topic started.

1442
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
We've been procrastinating for an hour and three minutes.

1443
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Time to get to the real meat in both of this topic,

1444
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
spirit science,

1445
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and how it reveals the entirety of the human history,

1446
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
and how to live your life to the fullest extent.

1447
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Dude, my Merkaba is fucking shining right now.

1448
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's glowing.

1449
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Okay, go.

1450
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Whenever someone like mentions Lemuria,

1451
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
my fucking chakras get so fucking blitzed,

1452
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I sit into another plane,

1453
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and I rip a hole in fucking space-time,

1454
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
so all of the lower dimensional spirits

1455
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
just spew out from my fucking body

1456
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and inhabit all the souls of the people around me.

1457
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Dude, you're being so Martian right now.

1458
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
You're being so male brain right now.

1459
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's fucking blowing my mind.

1460
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
We were so right-brained.

1461
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
We just couldn't fucking activate our chakras anymore.

1462
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Atlanteans are on Suicide Watch right now.

1463
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Dude, dude, literally,

1464
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
like the reason Hitler killed all the Jews

1465
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
because he knew they were aliens,

1466
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
and he watched the fucking History Channel.

1467
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
He knew, dude.

1468
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
He knew he had to get rid of these unearthly beings.

1469
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Look, I'm not gonna say Hitler did everything right,

1470
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
but that was one thing he did do right.

1471
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It had to be done.

1472
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The aliens had to be excised.

1473
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay.

1474
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
On the actual real point about spirit science,

1475
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
my mom literally believes that.

1476
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Oh, no.

1477
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
This is the reason I came on the podcast

1478
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
as identified by the fact that on the PCP sign-up

1479
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
like spreadsheet thing we have,

1480
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
it just says, my mom, where my name is.

1481
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yes, that's correct.

1482
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
My mom, for the past like two years at this point,

1483
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
whenever I enter the car with her,

1484
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
she'll have an audiobook playing,

1485
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and without fail, it's always about the law of attraction.

1486
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Nothing else, just the law of attraction.

1487
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Like gravity? Is that what that is?

1488
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
No, Nate.

1489
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
No.

1490
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Do you not know about the law of attraction?

1491
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Please explain it to me.

1492
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh my god.

1493
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I'm a child.

1494
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Prepare to get school.

1495
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You need to lecture us on the spirits.

1496
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
The spirit science stuff,

1497
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
because I still, I couldn't get through those videos.

1498
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
There's so many of them.

1499
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Believe me, hippo.

1500
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I'll give you and everyone else a lecture on spirit science

1501
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
sooner or later.

1502
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh.

1503
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Excellent.

1504
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Anyway, the law of attraction is,

1505
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
it's kind of hard to put into words without making it sound fucking retarded,

1506
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
because it is retarded.

1507
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:47,000
But imagine that you really want a cool hat.

1508
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Then if you just think with all of your might,

1509
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I really, like I will get a really cool hat.

1510
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I will manifest a really cool hat.

1511
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It will be great.

1512
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
There's no way this can't happen.

1513
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
From the secret.

1514
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
That's the secret, right?

1515
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Yeah.

1516
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
The universe will hear your call and give you a really cool hat.

1517
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
No questions asked.

1518
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Why do people believe this shit?

1519
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
What is happening?

1520
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You know what the thing about that is?

1521
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
That can kind of disguise itself as a real thing,

1522
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
because if someone wants to challenge it on a metaphysical level,

1523
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
you can backpedal and be like,

1524
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
oh, well, no, no, you see, because if you're thinking about it,

1525
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
you're more likely to take actions that will lead to it.

1526
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That's right.

1527
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I guess so.

1528
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
But that's not really what it is.

1529
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
That's not what the real argument for this law of attraction is.

1530
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
They're arguing that your thoughts have some sort of psychic resonance

1531
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
throughout the universe.

1532
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
What they say obviously do.

1533
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You need to get to higher vibrations or whatever.

1534
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Why is there even a fucking vibration?

1535
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
What we're doing is we're channeling our fucking Kundalini

1536
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
so it's snake-tun-hisses really fucking loud.

1537
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So the high dimensional beings will hear our call

1538
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and actual project a manifestation of whatever object or desire we want.

1539
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And bring it to our dimension.

1540
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I got a kind of Lingus Delini for you right here, my friend.

1541
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
All right, listen, listen, listen.

1542
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
When I hear someone say they believe in God,

1543
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
like, I'm not happy about it, but I'm like, okay, you know,

1544
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I'll forgive you if it's my friend.

1545
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, bit this one time.

1546
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But like, when I hear someone just like,

1547
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
and they always do it like apologetically and on the side,

1548
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
they're like, yeah, my crystals, you know.

1549
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1550
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
When I hear that shit, my fucking ears perk up

1551
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and my soul goes full male Martian.

1552
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I go full range.

1553
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It's like, what?

1554
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Full range.

1555
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You perform the Satan experiment.

1556
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
They're the Lucifer experiment right then and there.

1557
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I just, I say to them, what did you just say to me, my friend?

1558
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because they never want to defend this shit.

1559
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Did you just use the Lord's name in vain?

1560
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It brings me right back to those days.

1561
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I become the Crusader.

1562
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Oh my God.

1563
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That sort of reminds me, like, that's the way I think

1564
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and treat people who say, yeah, I mean, I believe in ghosts.

1565
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Like, it's never a religion thing.

1566
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's always something like ghosts.

1567
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Ghosts are cool.

1568
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But it's not about cool, it's about real.

1569
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
No.

1570
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
No.

1571
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Well, okay, okay, okay.

1572
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
If someone was like, I believe in ghosts,

1573
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'd be like, man, one idiot.

1574
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But then I would also, on the same hand,

1575
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
be like, dude, I know ghosts are so fucking sick.

1576
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Let's compare our ghost notes.

1577
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
See, I can't, I can't.

1578
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Okay, but like, when someone, like, the whole God thing,

1579
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
like, the entire world is engulfed by belief in God.

1580
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So, like, I get it.

1581
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Ghosts as well.

1582
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Like, this person, to some degree, you're not wrong.

1583
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So, like, the world is religious.

1584
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm working to fight against it every fucking day,

1585
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
but I get it, I get it.

1586
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But when I hear someone bring up, like, oh yeah, you know,

1587
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
can I get my crystals with me?

1588
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
They had to actively seek that out and subject themselves

1589
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
to that kind of manipulation.

1590
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It just tells me they're on a next level.

1591
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Maybe they need those crystals, Nate.

1592
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Maybe some people need their crystals.

1593
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
What?

1594
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Maybe some people find comfort in those crystals.

1595
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yeah, these people just keep your jail crystals

1596
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
at home, people, where I keep mine.

1597
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I don't bring them up in casual conversation

1598
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
with people I meet on the street like you do.

1599
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Like, what, what is the argument here?

1600
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Like, God, the people have made really, like,

1601
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
oh, okay, God has been, like, backed into a corner

1602
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
so fucking hard by rational arguments that, like,

1603
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
okay, there's no proof.

1604
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
So, okay.

1605
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
God's like a rabid and looked back into a corner

1606
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and we don't know what he's gonna do next.

1607
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Yeah, exactly.

1608
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But the crystal shit, like, what is the fucking argument here?

1609
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And what is your reason for believing?

1610
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Oh, I know what it is.

1611
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Okay, go ahead.

1612
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I know what it is.

1613
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Is they play too much Crash Bandicoot

1614
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and I think crystals actually have power.

1615
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
They play too much Final Fantasy.

1616
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
They're like, yeah, crystals are real, man.

1617
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I knew I should smack that controller out of her hand

1618
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
when I had the chance when I wanted to.

1619
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
My God, now.

1620
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
She's always talking about fucking bandicoots

1621
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
and groovy things.

1622
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It's too much.

1623
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm not saying that women shouldn't play video games,

1624
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
but I am saying gamer girls are-

1625
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But this is what happens when they do.

1626
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Gamer girls are far more susceptible to the insidious nature

1627
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
of the crystal indoctrination of so many video games.

1628
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
That's why so many girls love Final Fantasy.

1629
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I feel like it's important to chart the progression

1630
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
of how my mom got here, if that's all right.

1631
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
My mom grew up in the deep south

1632
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and was some sort of denomination of Protestant

1633
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
with a really strict household.

1634
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And then later down the road, when I came along,

1635
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
she tried to get me to become a God person as well.

1636
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And so I culminated in one Easter where I-

1637
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Unfortunately for her, you instead became a God,

1638
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
which was not part of the plan.

1639
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I'd be too powerful.

1640
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Anyway, one Easter, after Sermon was over,

1641
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I said to my mom, mom, churches are really scary.

1642
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
God, the Bible, it's scary.

1643
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It's scary, aesthetically pleasing, scary things.

1644
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It's like the same situation I get looking at the Bible

1645
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
or crucifix is like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster.

1646
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Those are scary things.

1647
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Ooh, ooh, oh, horror.

1648
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And I feel like I have mind-break dosing my mom

1649
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
by saying that the Bible is scary.

1650
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Because after that day, it's weird.

1651
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
She'll always insinuate that I am a hardcore Christian

1652
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
for some reason, which I don't understand.

1653
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Even though I've clearly told her that I'm not,

1654
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
she will just insinuate that I am.

1655
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And then she has gone into this weird fucking awful spiral

1656
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
into fucking insanity.

1657
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I've talked about her high saturation Jesus artifact shit,

1658
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
JPEGs, she has all right of room.

1659
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
She has a ton of weird awful chakras and fucking rocks.

1660
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
She goes to Sermons.

1661
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
The reason I fucking visited Ben was because my mom already had

1662
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
a plane ticket to go to Atlanta for a fucking weird crystal seminar.

1663
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
That's the reason I went.

1664
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Because it was a weird fucking crystal seminar.

1665
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Now we're talking.

1666
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
She started out as a normal Christian, which is still bad,

1667
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
but due to the fact that I told her that the Bible is scary,

1668
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
she had a weird fucking mid-religion crisis

1669
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and just googled how do I make God more interesting.

1670
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And then she just added some like special herbs and spices

1671
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
into her fucking God brew and fucking jammed out to this bullshit

1672
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
that is not real.

1673
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It just turtles all the way down with this kind of stuff.

1674
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
There's no foundation here upon which all this is built.

1675
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
If I'm wrong, please give me the evidence.

1676
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I mean, is the goal that like, does she just want to make sure

1677
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
you're a good Christian boy and your soul is safe and everything?

1678
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Is that the goal here?

1679
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
She's not trying to convert me.

1680
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
She just like, like she doesn't bring it up.

1681
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It's just that it is so integral to her being that I can't avoid it.

1682
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Like I said, whenever I enter the car, she'll be playing an audio book

1683
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
and then I'll just like put it in a headphone and she'll be like,

1684
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
oh, I know you don't like this stuff for whatever reason.

1685
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Yeah, I'll turn it on the radio for you, you fucking heretic.

1686
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And I was like, I just want to go to Chipotle.

1687
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
To just put out the olive branch to all religious people.

1688
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Like religious people, when they're sincere, many of them are.

1689
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Most of them, probably the best majority.

1690
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I'm sure a few of them actually believe this shit.

1691
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Well, it's a matter of logical conclusions.

1692
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But like, they want what's best for everybody for the most part.

1693
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
They're like, guys, like what you were saying, Munchy,

1694
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
just the fact that religion is weird and scary,

1695
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
at least like Catholicism is,

1696
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
just because it's scary and that they argue hell is real,

1697
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
that itself, of course, is an emotional argument

1698
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
that does not make it untrue in no way, just saying that it's scary.

1699
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Like, if it's real, it's the most important thing to get sorted out in your life

1700
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
or else you will go to hell forever and be tormented forever.

1701
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
And of course, you had another reason to believe that God is in fact evil.

1702
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Not if you actually...

1703
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's time for a fucking tangent.

1704
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It's time for a fucking tangent where I explain just how much pleasure I get

1705
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
out of knowing that like the hell that everyone believes in

1706
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
has literally no resemblance to the hell actually described in the Bible.

1707
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Do you guys know about this?

1708
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Is that true?

1709
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
No, no, no, I don't know.

1710
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Okay, well like the hell, the heaven and hell and stuff that you see,

1711
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
that people go to in Looney Tunes, like where you die

1712
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
and then if you're bad, you go to hell and if you're good, you go to heaven

1713
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
and there's some funeral.

1714
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Hell is all like red and there's like a lot of fire and stuff.

1715
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Like, okay, like the Bible is fiction, right?

1716
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
But that is like double fiction because that's like a fake interpretation

1717
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
of something that's already fake.

1718
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
The way hell actually word, as I understand it, according to the Bible,

1719
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
like prepare to get your mind blown.

1720
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
What actually happens is that when you die, you're dead.

1721
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Like you're not, you don't go anywhere.

1722
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You are just dead and you are dead in the ground corpse

1723
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,000
until the book of Revelation's apocalypse happened and Jesus comes back

1724
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
and then the dead are resurrected on earth.

1725
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
There is no heaven dimension that you go to.

1726
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
You are resurrected on earth and then Jesus and God and whatever,

1727
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
they judge everyone and there is hell, but hell is just,

1728
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
basically they just dig a big hole on earth and bad people get thrown into hell

1729
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
and they do not-

1730
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Is that the lake of fire that's mentioned in the Bible?

1731
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but they do not burn there forever.

1732
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
They burn there for like the worst that they were,

1733
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
the longer that they burn for as like punishment,

1734
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
but then ultimately they're obliterated, like they're just gone.

1735
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And then there's good people that are saved.

1736
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
They go to a shining city.

1737
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Like the heaven that they are going to is a city on earth.

1738
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I see.

1739
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
How fucking neat is that?

1740
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Is this all in the book of Revelation?

1741
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
That's way more interesting.

1742
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah.

1743
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, I mean, I'm not an expert,

1744
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but that's my understanding of what the Bible actually says happens to good and bad people.

1745
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So in this actual interpretation,

1746
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
there's no like after life at this point, like everybody who's dead,

1747
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
they're just dead.

1748
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah, they're just dead.

1749
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
They're just dead.

1750
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
They're not even in a better place.

1751
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Even all the religious people who say like, you know, like,

1752
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
oh, like mom's in a good, better place and she's looking down on me.

1753
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Not if the Bible has anything to say.

1754
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
They're in Bible stasis right now.

1755
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
My dad.

1756
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
That's fucking insane.

1757
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I know.

1758
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
My dad has said that like he looks forward to meeting his,

1759
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
you know, people who have passed on in the afterlife.

1760
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
It might have been a while.

1761
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Maybe that's dated information from the guy, but he has said it.

1762
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And I guess there's just literally no basis for it.

1763
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's just the crux of the issue.

1764
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Even though it's not what the book says.

1765
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
The crux of everything, of this entire thing.

1766
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Like that's the only really reason religion still has any sort of place in

1767
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
modern society with all this, this science and technological

1768
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
progression proving like the ancient myths or whatever.

1769
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Religion has been beaten back from every area where science can touch.

1770
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
The only reason it still has any sort of hold on anyone is

1771
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
because we're all afraid of death.

1772
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And this is like the way you cope with it is like, well, when I die,

1773
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I'm not actually dead.

1774
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Exactly.

1775
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
That's the well reason it still has any sort of sway on anyone at all.

1776
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
A, you're afraid of death and you don't want to be nothing when you die.

1777
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Also, you're afraid of not knowing what to do with your life.

1778
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And religion gives you like direction.

1779
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Ben, are you saying that the afterlife and hell and heaven and all

1780
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
of the eternal afterlife or suffering that you could experience in religion

1781
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
is the equivalent of no-wacking voices and vinyl scratch?

1782
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It's just pure fanning, but everyone agrees with it?

1783
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah, actually, like everyone's just going with it,

1784
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
even though it has no basis in reality.

1785
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yes!

1786
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
That's good to me.

1787
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Wait.

1788
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Well, I remember no-wacking.

1789
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Dude, you could forget.

1790
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Shout out to no-wacking.

1791
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
If you listen to this, we want you on the show.

1792
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
We want you on the fucking show.

1793
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I asked her if she wanted to go out with me at BronyCon and she said she was a lesbian

1794
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
and I was like, all right, cool.

1795
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Ben.

1796
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Is this a real story?

1797
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Yeah, that's a real story.

1798
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Oh my god.

1799
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That's insane.

1800
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I mean, I knew she wasn't going to say yes.

1801
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Oh my god, you almost dated vinyl scratch.

1802
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I know.

1803
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
What the fuck?

1804
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
He almost dated her.

1805
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I have to.

1806
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I have to.

1807
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Up to you.

1808
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It was like right on the cut.

1809
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It could have gone either way.

1810
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It was right there.

1811
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It was a coin toss.

1812
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Exactly.

1813
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Exactly.

1814
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I'm going to twist a fate, settle this matter.

1815
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Yeah.

1816
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
This time against Phantom Horn's favor, but next time, but next time.

1817
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
This is fucking insane.

1818
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
We should have a BronyCon stories.

1819
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
A BronyCon reunion cast.

1820
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It's time to get the gang back together, guys, and launch our new Christmas album.

1821
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I literally have hundreds of stories from BronyCon.

1822
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We could literally do that.

1823
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Yeah, we could.

1824
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Oh, what do we got that Raven Cosplayer back on the PCP?

1825
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Remember that, guys?

1826
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Oh my god, it'd be incredible.

1827
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Jesus Christ.

1828
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
She was good.

1829
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
We can do it through...

1830
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
What's her name?

1831
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
The big one?

1832
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It was just a...

1833
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
She was just some girl sitting...

1834
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
There was a time when we were all sitting in our thing.

1835
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Oh, kind of.

1836
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
She's a voice actor, never mind.

1837
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Oh, no, no, no.

1838
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Not Tara Strong.

1839
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Tara Strong.

1840
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I take Tara Strong in the PCP, though.

1841
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Shout out to Tara Strong.

1842
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
You come on the PCP if you're listening.

1843
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Come on the PCP.

1844
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah.

1845
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Do you remember anything else to say on the topic of religion?

1846
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I feel like we didn't have anything to say in the beginning.

1847
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1848
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I have something to say.

1849
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I didn't know when to say this.

1850
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I'll bring it up now.

1851
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I did start a religion a little bit.

1852
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Oh, I see.

1853
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I mean, okay, I say that, but it was a really half-hearted effort.

1854
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I went and I looked into it a little bit, and I remember it being a bigger deal than

1855
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
it was.

1856
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It's kind of embarrassing to even mention.

1857
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,840
All I did was make a Facebook group describing a new religion and see if I could get people

1858
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,840
to join it.

1859
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,840
Oh, it's funny you mentioned this.

1860
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,840
I attempted to do this at one point as well.

1861
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,840
I don't really remember that much about it.

1862
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Okay, I remember that it was called The Church of Transubstantialism.

1863
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,840
Okay.

1864
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,840
Oh, well, actually, I think I remember the basic tenet.

1865
01:22:53,840 --> 01:23:01,840
The basic tenet of it is that reincarnation is real, but there's only one soul in the

1866
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,840
universe.

1867
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:08,840
And you are that one soul reincarnated throughout time, and you will eventually be re-reincarnated

1868
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,840
as every living thing that has ever existed.

1869
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,840
Oh, that's kind of like the theory where there's one electron that exists everywhere simultaneously.

1870
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,840
Yeah, yeah.

1871
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,840
That's like lording-ish.

1872
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,840
That's lording-ish to you.

1873
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,840
Right?

1874
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,840
Yeah.

1875
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,840
So I thought that was pretty neat.

1876
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,840
So I made a Facebook group saying it was a religion, and I got a couple people to join

1877
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,840
it, and I felt pretty smug about that.

1878
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,840
I was like, hey, I don't even believe in this dude.

1879
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,840
My religion was totally different.

1880
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,840
I never ended up making a Facebook group or anything because I don't touch Facebook,

1881
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,840
but the whole idea was I was super pissed off at the fact that religions have exemptions

1882
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,840
for everything in society.

1883
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,840
And so I was like, if I can't beat him, join him.

1884
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:47,840
I wanted to craft a religion that was specifically designed to fuck over the government and abuse

1885
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,840
that exception constantly.

1886
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,840
The whole basis of the faith was that everything you ever did, everything you ever made was

1887
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,840
for God and God alone, and no one else had the right to take it from you until you offered

1888
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,840
it to God upon your death.

1889
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,840
So you were exempt from taxes, you were exempt from all this crazy shit, and the whole doctrine

1890
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:08,840
was just how to dodge every legal obligation you had in life in the name of God.

1891
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,840
They're just like a book of legislation.

1892
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,840
What was the name?

1893
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
I never got so far to give it a name.

1894
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
You should call it fuck the government.

1895
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
Yeah, yeah.

1896
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,840
I feel it's a little on the nose.

1897
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,840
Might make it easier to detect the gimmick.

1898
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,840
What about tax exemptionism?

1899
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,840
That's pretty good, you know?

1900
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,840
Exemptionism.

1901
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,840
Exemptionism.

1902
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,840
It's such a, it's such a, I think I want a neck-bearing concept.

1903
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,840
If you'll accept it, Tom, let's call it exemptionism and make that the official, like, let's apply

1904
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,840
that to the PCP.

1905
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,840
Exemptionism sounds almost like it could be a real rule.

1906
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,840
It does.

1907
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,840
It does.

1908
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,840
I'll accept that as the official religion of the PCP.

1909
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,840
Excellent.

1910
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,840
All right.

1911
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,840
The fucking hashtag, yeah.

1912
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,840
The Church of Exemptionism.

1913
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,840
Here we are.

1914
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,840
Start that up right now.

1915
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,840
Fucking hashtag that shit.

1916
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,340
Just so you know, the PCP is the official keepers of the religion.

1917
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,340
We are the popes.

1918
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,340
We speak to God directly.

1919
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,340
Yeah, yeah.

1920
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,340
We are the popes.

1921
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,340
I dub all my high priests of exemptionism.

1922
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,340
Oh, thank you.

1923
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,340
Thank you, Tom.

1924
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:07,340
We're ideologically opposed to paying any of the fees associated with Patreon, Kickstarter,

1925
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:09,340
YouTube, everything.

1926
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:13,340
It's all because everything we make is for God, and we shouldn't have any false idols.

1927
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:18,340
And to give away any of the fruits of our labor to anyone other than God.

1928
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:23,340
And since we are our own temples for God, by giving it to ourselves until we meet our

1929
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,340
maker and give everything we've created to them.

1930
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:26,340
Indeed.

1931
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,340
In the meantime, we have to hold on to everything.

1932
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,340
Which, incidentally, functions.

1933
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:35,340
We are heavily inspired by the ancient pharaohs where we need to be buried in giant tombs

1934
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,340
with all our possessions.

1935
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,340
Exactly.

1936
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,340
So please, government, do not take them.

1937
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:44,340
This is part of the pyramid, is our symbol, and the dollar is our also symbol.

1938
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,340
Yes.

1939
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:50,340
I've just created a new religion just now called Grind Jealousism.

1940
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,340
Grind Jealousism.

1941
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:59,340
And the longer, like, say you have a scooter or a skateboard, for as long as you grind,

1942
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,340
that time is equal to the time you have in the afterlife.

1943
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,340
So you shouldn't have to grind as much as possible.

1944
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,340
I'm gonna fire up Tony Hawk right now.

1945
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,340
Exactly.

1946
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:15,340
So the real devout members will fucking grind day in, day out.

1947
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,340
So they just accumulate the afterlife points.

1948
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,340
Dude, here's what I'm gonna be doing.

1949
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,340
It certainly does sound like a grind.

1950
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:27,340
Wait, but that's such a raw deal, because you have to spend all that time.

1951
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:30,340
You're wasting that same amount of time grinding now.

1952
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,340
Well, unfortunately for you, Ben, it's just true.

1953
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,340
So you better get it.

1954
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,340
Yeah.

1955
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,340
So, yeah.

1956
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,340
Bummer, dude.

1957
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,340
Yeah, exactly.

1958
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:43,340
I say, with my new, my new skater lingo.

1959
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,340
He says to please the god.

1960
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,340
Tabbing over to Amazon.com.

1961
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,340
Yeah, tabbing over to buy the hot new skateboard.

1962
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,340
Yes, exactly.

1963
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,340
With PCP branding on it, of course.

1964
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,340
Of course.

1965
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:59,340
Dude, we should literally get a PCP brand skateboard and sell that on some place.

1966
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,340
We should do that.

1967
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,340
And what was it?

1968
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,340
Grindology?

1969
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,340
I forget what it was.

1970
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,340
Grind jealousism.

1971
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,340
Grind jealousism.

1972
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,340
Grind jealousism.

1973
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,340
Excellent.

1974
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,340
Well, we've got two new religions for you to choose from.

1975
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:13,340
They're both 100% accurate and represent reality completely fully.

1976
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,340
So they now have a religious war in the PCP.

1977
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,340
And remember, don't limit yourself to just one box.

1978
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,340
So do them both.

1979
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,340
Yes, please.

1980
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,340
You can patron us twice with two accounts.

1981
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,340
So please do so.

1982
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:29,340
You're always free to have a personal relationship with God, however you see fit to divide that out.

1983
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:34,340
And remember, guys, if you want something, you'll get it.

1984
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:35,340
No matter what.

1985
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,340
That's the secret.

1986
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,340
Indeed.

1987
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,340
That's the secret.

1988
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:43,340
So the church of grind jealousism and the church of exemptionism.

1989
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,340
Both.

1990
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,340
All right.

1991
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:50,340
Now, and exceptionism, whatever you just said it fucking was.

1992
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:56,340
When we say that you're not allowed to give anything to anyone else, that's forcing.

1993
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:58,340
You're allowed to give freely.

1994
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,340
So go to patreon.com slash procrastinators.

1995
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,340
Exactly.

1996
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,340
And give to the donation box of the high priests.

1997
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:06,340
And you'll be rewarded greatly.

1998
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:09,340
It's the only way to make sure your money goes to the cause worth of it.

1999
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,340
In the afterlife, yes.

2000
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,340
Unless bonus episodes are of your jam.

2001
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,340
In those cases.

2002
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,340
You know what?

2003
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,340
We should make an exemption.

2004
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:20,340
Like obviously you want all your goods in the exemptionism to like be with you when

2005
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:21,340
you die.

2006
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:26,340
But there is a clause where if you funnel it up the pyramid towards the top of the exemptionism

2007
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,340
church, that's acceptable as well.

2008
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,340
So you set it straight to us via patreon.

2009
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:31,340
Exactly.

2010
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,340
You're still gold.

2011
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,340
You're still gold.

2012
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,340
Hashtag PC pyramid scheme.

2013
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,340
Exactly.

2014
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,340
Exactly.

2015
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,340
All right, guys.

2016
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,340
I think we've done it.

2017
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,340
This is excellent.

2018
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,340
I think we've solved religion.

2019
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:45,340
This is finally like the end stone to end all religion discussion.

2020
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:49,340
There is literally nothing that can be argued here.

2021
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,340
This is the end of the discussion.

2022
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,340
It was over before it even fucking started.

2023
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:58,340
So we're finally at the moment I see another person even mention God's name in vain.

2024
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:04,340
I will obliterate them as we've proven that that is antithetical to all sense of morality

2025
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,340
or ethical.

2026
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,340
We can all finally stop.

2027
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:09,340
We're all finally free.

2028
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,340
We should have our system.

2029
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,340
And this tired charade.

2030
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:14,340
Yeah.

2031
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,340
Fantastic.

2032
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:19,340
Well, let's shift on over to those questions, Familia.

2033
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:26,340
Actually, please give the Twitter pity question, the one Twitter pity question here.

2034
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,340
All right, everybody.

2035
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,340
Let's check out what we got here.

2036
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:37,340
Let's pull up some hashtag ask PCP questions for our lowly non-patroning viewers out there.

2037
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,340
Fucking disgusting.

2038
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,340
Let's see what we got.

2039
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,340
Okay.

2040
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:48,340
Xtreme42 asks, what's your process for watching a YouTube channel?

2041
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:55,340
Do you go by playlists chronologically or just watch whatever you deem interesting?

2042
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:59,340
If it's in series, I like to watch my playlists.

2043
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,340
Usually, I'll just click around.

2044
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:05,340
If I find a new channel, I'll just click the recommended videos and click around until

2045
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,340
I start to feel like I really love this whole thing.

2046
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:13,840
And then usually, I'll seek out a playlist and go through it and watch all the stuff that

2047
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,340
I haven't seen already.

2048
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:21,340
Yeah, when I see a new channel, I watch the recommended videos, same thing.

2049
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:25,340
But when I feel like I really like it, I go to the very first video and then watch the

2050
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,340
whole backlog.

2051
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,340
Same as Hippo.

2052
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:34,340
I've actually been doing a really weird thing, as I think I discussed in my own time here.

2053
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:35,340
I've been watching a lot of Hello!

2054
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,340
Internet because I want to catch up on that because I've never entertained that before.

2055
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:46,340
And I've been doing a really weird, awful, roundabout way where I've been slowly eating

2056
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,340
away from either side.

2057
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:53,340
I've been watching the latest episode and then one of the first episodes and I've been

2058
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,340
going back and forth like that.

2059
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:58,340
And eventually, I'll reach somewhere in the middle and that will be the last episode I

2060
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,340
watch and then I'll just move on forward from that.

2061
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:04,340
I don't know how this is starting but I can't stop it and it's fucking awful.

2062
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,340
So that's the way you don't do it.

2063
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:11,340
I've been meaning forever to actually watch the Angry Video Game Nerd and I feel uncomfortable

2064
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,340
just jumping in so I want to start from the beginning.

2065
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:17,340
I know, it's just a problem to not be watching already.

2066
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:22,340
I don't know, he's got sort of a narrative and a crafted show.

2067
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:25,340
So for a show like that, I want to start from the beginning.

2068
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,340
There's no narrative between episodes.

2069
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:29,340
There's just kind of memes and stuff.

2070
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:34,340
It's kind of like if you jumped into the PCP at this episode and we're talking about

2071
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:39,340
Mirkabuz and Christ Consciousness, you wouldn't know the buildup that makes those so funny

2072
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,340
and why we're all laughing our ass off.

2073
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,340
And there's a few things like LJN.

2074
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,340
He doesn't explain that every single time.

2075
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:49,340
You just have to know the mythos at some point.

2076
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:53,340
So it's like best watched from the start if you want the optimal experience.

2077
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,340
So that's my plan.

2078
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:58,340
It would be very interesting just to see how badly that is aged.

2079
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:00,340
Because it's so long ago.

2080
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:05,340
I've watched all of them quite recently and some of the earlier ones, they've never been that good.

2081
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,340
But there's like 10 or so episodes and they start becoming classics.

2082
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,340
Okay, that's good.

2083
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:15,340
The first one I watch is The Power Glove and that will always be close in my heart.

2084
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:19,340
I remember, this will show my fucking age here.

2085
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:24,340
I remember in 5th grade finding the Angry Video Game Nerd.

2086
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:29,340
And then on my way home from school, talking to my friend and we both watched it.

2087
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:34,340
And in 5th grade, I was like, you know, all he does is swear a whole bunch.

2088
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,340
I don't know if this is really the highbrow constant I'm making for.

2089
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,340
In 5th grade.

2090
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:43,340
I started watching.

2091
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,340
At some point I was so bored.

2092
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:51,340
I watched the entire series of Angry Video Game Nerd as a playlist.

2093
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:57,340
And at the end I was like, man, I'm glad I didn't have anything better to be doing.

2094
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,340
Sick.

2095
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,340
What a shame.

2096
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:05,340
I was just going to say that that's a show that I would watch in direct order.

2097
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,340
But there's tons of other stuff.

2098
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:09,340
I just watch with whatever seems interesting or whatever.

2099
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,340
Yeah, I don't know.

2100
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:15,340
On YouTube, I don't watch a lot of stuff that needs to be seen in order.

2101
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,340
We can't spend any more time on this.

2102
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,340
This is the pity question.

2103
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,340
He's right.

2104
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:28,340
From the Patreon Discord, from SuperFish, favorite national slash state slash providential flag,

2105
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:38,340
I would say my two good flags are either the original Union Jack, the Imperial Japanese flag, or...

2106
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,340
That's it.

2107
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,340
Bye.

2108
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:44,340
Easy answer, Maryland.

2109
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:45,340
Or Brazil, yeah.

2110
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:53,340
Maryland's flag looks like something that a sick knight would wear while he's like fucking blasting you off your horse with a lance.

2111
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,340
I'm googling this right?

2112
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,340
Yeah, that black thing that looks like a taxicab combined with a knight.

2113
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,340
With a Templar.

2114
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,340
Yeah, exactly. It's awesome.

2115
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:13,340
It's played out, but I really like the national flag of Nepal because it defies conventions.

2116
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:17,340
Because it's not a rectangle. It's like two tiny triangles.

2117
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:19,340
I hate that flag.

2118
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:25,340
And I also hate North Korea has a long flag. It's not as tall as a normal flag.

2119
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:30,340
Well, when Nepal does it, I think it's cool, but when North Korea does it, they're just trying too hard.

2120
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:31,340
I agree.

2121
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:36,340
I gotta go with my boy, the rebel flag, because hashtag heritage not hate.

2122
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,340
Wait, what rebel flag?

2123
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,340
The Confederate flag, of course.

2124
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,340
Star Wars.

2125
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,340
I'm actually joking.

2126
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:48,340
What's that one, the yellow one with the snake on it that says don't tread on it?

2127
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,340
Oh, that's fucking the Bunker Hill, boy!

2128
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,340
The Glaston flag.

2129
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,340
Is that what that's right?

2130
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:59,340
I don't know if that's how you pronounce it. It's called, like, yeah, the Glaston flag, I think.

2131
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:01,340
The Glaston flag. I know how to spell.

2132
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,340
It's don't tread on me. And our dad has a flag like that.

2133
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,340
Oh, shit.

2134
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,340
Yeah, yeah, he flies it sometimes, like in the front yard.

2135
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:11,340
He talks about, like, how it's like Bunker Hill, because, you know, we live in Massachusetts

2136
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,340
and we're like, you know, we know about Massachusetts history in shit.

2137
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,340
Okay, yeah, it's an American Revolution thing.

2138
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,340
Oh, yeah.

2139
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,340
Yeah.

2140
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:20,340
I like the Welsh flag, because it's got a dragon on it.

2141
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,340
Oh, yeah.

2142
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,340
The Welsh flag is sick.

2143
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:26,340
Hippo, I don't know if you'll even know.

2144
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:31,340
What is your favorite Union Jack, the original or the current one?

2145
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,340
The original doesn't have the extra white, does it?

2146
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:39,340
No, it doesn't have the extra red going through the, like, doesn't have the extra, like, red cross.

2147
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,340
Oh, yeah.

2148
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:45,340
I don't know. I'm not as...

2149
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,340
It also has a brighter blue flag.

2150
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:53,340
Wait, what is this original Union Jack? I can't find it.

2151
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:59,340
The Union Jack is a combination of flags, and there was a time when not all of the flags were in it.

2152
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:03,340
Oh, it's missing the, like, red bars and the diagonals.

2153
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,340
It looks way better with them.

2154
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,340
Uh, no.

2155
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:08,340
Uh-oh.

2156
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,340
Alright.

2157
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:10,340
It looks great.

2158
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,340
Okay.

2159
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,340
Union Jack is super exciting.

2160
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,340
I guess.

2161
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:15,340
I just like the English flag.

2162
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,340
It's just cool.

2163
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,340
Dude, remember when Gurren Lagann was going to be on the Union Jack? I remember.

2164
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,340
I remember.

2165
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,340
I remember.

2166
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,340
What?

2167
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,340
That was pretty cool.

2168
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,340
What the fuck are you talking about?

2169
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:31,340
There was a time when, like, Britain or something said, like, hey guys, we're looking for, like, cool suggestions for, like, a new flag or whatever.

2170
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:34,340
Yeah, I think it was, like, a meme or something.

2171
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:35,340
It was, like, for something.

2172
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:41,340
And, like, the one that literally won was just the Union Jack with the Diger and Don symbol.

2173
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,340
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2174
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,340
It was sick.

2175
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,340
Because it's the most aesthetic logo of all fucking times.

2176
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,340
I can see the Canadian flag here with it instead of the maple leaf.

2177
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,340
That's pretty sweet.

2178
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:51,340
Fucking leaves.

2179
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:52,340
Oh, yeah.

2180
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,340
Fucking maple niggers.

2181
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:55,340
Uh, yeah.

2182
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:56,340
Truck it.

2183
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:57,340
Fucking tree slurpers.

2184
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:58,340
Embarrassing.

2185
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,340
Embarrassing.

2186
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,340
Tree slurpers?

2187
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:04,340
By the way, hashtag California state flag, best state flag.

2188
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,340
I do like the bear.

2189
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,340
I do like the bear.

2190
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,340
I do like the bear.

2191
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,340
I do like the bear.

2192
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,340
The most powerful flag of all time.

2193
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:11,340
The most representative one of our current struggle.

2194
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,340
That's the Antifa flag.

2195
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:13,340
Okay.

2196
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,340
Oh, he's not wrong.

2197
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:15,340
He's not wrong.

2198
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:16,340
Black.

2199
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,340
Like, my here is an Isis.

2200
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,340
That's the good one.

2201
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,340
Um.

2202
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,340
That's a good one.

2203
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,340
My favorite, my absolute favorite flag is the tag football flags.

2204
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:29,340
Because I always put way too hard and ripped the fucking belt off of the people and push

2205
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,340
them to the ground, even though it was non-tackle football.

2206
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:34,340
And I would get sent to the principal office, but I didn't care because I almost fucking

2207
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:37,340
killed someone because I was so much bigger than they were.

2208
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,340
You know what I don't like about the Antifa flag?

2209
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:45,340
Is that it looks like a flag for like a local like sports federation.

2210
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:51,340
It looks like a flag that like the, like the lower, like the southern New Jersey district

2211
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:54,340
sporting commission would be putting on like a charity ball.

2212
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:57,340
Well, considering these are all like rich spoiled people just playing at revolutionary,

2213
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:58,340
I feel it's fitting.

2214
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:04,340
Well, that's all nice and all with your fucking beta cuck loser Antifa flag.

2215
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:10,340
But check out this MGTOW real fucking nigger blue lives matter flag.

2216
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,340
What?

2217
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,340
The most aesthetic fucking fucking entire fucking world.

2218
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,340
Oh, I get it.

2219
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,340
Oh, that's cool.

2220
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,340
Oh, that's cool.

2221
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,340
Is that it?

2222
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,340
Yeah, it's fucking don't tell.

2223
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,340
Ew.

2224
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,340
No, dude, no, bro.

2225
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,340
Ew.

2226
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,340
Why is only one bar blue?

2227
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:27,340
Because it's fucking boys in blue, dude.

2228
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:30,340
That is actually the worst thing.

2229
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,340
It's so unbalanced.

2230
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,340
It's so unbalanced.

2231
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,340
No, I'm getting dizzy.

2232
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:36,340
I'm like getting dizzy looking at it.

2233
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:37,340
It's like a lightsaber.

2234
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:38,340
That was probably the inspiration.

2235
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:41,340
They didn't like the representation of Luke in the new movie.

2236
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,340
So they were like, yeah, fuck this.

2237
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,340
His lightsaber is going on the flag.

2238
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,340
Oh, blue, like police.

2239
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:47,340
Oh, I get it.

2240
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,340
Like police, like police.

2241
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:53,340
I like the gay flag or like the LGBT flag with the brown and black because, you know,

2242
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,340
we got it.

2243
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:58,340
We got to rep, rep, rep our racial brethren, you know, our oppressed brethren.

2244
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:00,340
Wait, there's brown and black for black people?

2245
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:03,340
Yeah, they added that like a couple of years ago.

2246
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:07,340
Like there was like a meeting where like they added, I know it has nothing to do with it.

2247
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:08,340
That's so terrible.

2248
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,340
That's like so stupid.

2249
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,340
Yeah, I know.

2250
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,340
I know.

2251
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,340
Welcome to current year.

2252
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:14,340
Way to be a Nazi, Ben.

2253
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:16,340
Way to be a fucking fascist hater.

2254
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:17,340
What the fuck?

2255
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,340
Yeah, that's right.

2256
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:19,340
Right?

2257
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:20,340
That's awful.

2258
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,340
Let me see.

2259
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,340
It's so confused.

2260
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,340
Right, right here.

2261
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,340
Yeah, that's the one.

2262
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:26,340
That's the one.

2263
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,340
Why?

2264
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,340
Why?

2265
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,340
Oh, that looks so bad.

2266
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,340
It looks bad.

2267
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,340
And the meaning is just like, why?

2268
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,340
I mean, because they're a minority.

2269
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,340
Wait, wait, wait.

2270
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,340
Is that actually what it means?

2271
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:40,340
No, I swear to God that that was a thing that actually did happen.

2272
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,340
Hashtag more color, more pride.

2273
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:44,340
Okay, it's to represent LGBT people of color.

2274
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,340
Well, they're LGBT.

2275
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:47,340
The flag already represents them.

2276
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,340
This was the argument that everyone was saying.

2277
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:54,340
It's intersectionality just going a little bit off the rails in my opinion.

2278
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,340
Here we go.

2279
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:58,340
But the flag already represents all queer people.

2280
01:39:58,340 --> 01:39:59,340
I know.

2281
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:00,340
I know.

2282
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:05,340
They feel that minorities need more extra special representation within the LGBT community.

2283
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,340
They have a second flag.

2284
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:08,340
No.

2285
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,340
That's absolutely crazy.

2286
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:10,340
You can fly two flags.

2287
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:14,340
It's so funny because it now implies that the red stripe, the orange, the yellow, the

2288
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:18,340
green, the blue, and the purple are all different races of people.

2289
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:20,340
Now that's racist.

2290
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,340
No white flag.

2291
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,340
No white stripe.

2292
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:23,340
You're not allowed.

2293
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,340
White people are.

2294
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:25,340
Well, if you combine them all.

2295
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,340
So the red one's the Native Americans.

2296
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:28,340
The yellow one is the Asians, right?

2297
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:30,340
And then they also represent orcs.

2298
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,340
That's the green one.

2299
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:34,340
We need to get rid of that blue one because hashtag blue lives don't matter.

2300
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:37,340
I'm so confused because like what the black stripe is for black people and the brown is

2301
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:38,340
for.

2302
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:42,340
Just miscellaneous or like minority in general, I guess.

2303
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:44,340
Indian people or something.

2304
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,340
I don't know.

2305
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,340
I don't know.

2306
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,340
I don't know.

2307
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:48,340
It's so confused.

2308
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:49,340
Look, I get the point.

2309
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,340
I would have just added the black.

2310
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,340
Like even if I thought this was a good idea, like I would have just added the black.

2311
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:56,340
I actually don't hate this as much as a lot of people do, but I would just argue that

2312
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:59,340
like it doesn't doesn't actually help what they're trying to do.

2313
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:01,340
Like I don't have a problem.

2314
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,340
Okay.

2315
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:03,340
All right.

2316
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:04,340
There you go.

2317
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,340
I'm not like, I don't know.

2318
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:06,340
Yeah.

2319
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,340
This is with the asexual flag.

2320
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,340
That was one of the most asexual.

2321
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:17,340
That was one of the most aesthetically pleasing, you know, LGBTQ specific flags.

2322
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:19,340
Shout to the asexual flag.

2323
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:24,340
My boys, I love your, I love your, your platform and I support you to the end of my fucking

2324
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,340
life.

2325
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,340
Look at this.

2326
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,340
Look, look at these stripes for the asexual flag.

2327
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,340
It's sick.

2328
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:29,340
It's not bad.

2329
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:30,340
It's fucking dope.

2330
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,340
It's good.

2331
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:32,340
Not bad.

2332
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:37,340
My brothers, we're going our own way.

2333
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:38,340
What's that?

2334
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:40,340
There was actually a migtail flag.

2335
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:41,340
Of course.

2336
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,340
Of course.

2337
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:46,340
As seen on Nate's shirt in our retrieval.

2338
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:47,340
Yes.

2339
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,340
I'm looking for it.

2340
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:49,340
This is all right.

2341
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:53,340
This could be less manly than being artsy and making something.

2342
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,340
This is the symbol, but it's on.

2343
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:56,340
Put it on a flag and there you go.

2344
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:58,340
You got yourself a flag.

2345
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,340
Okay.

2346
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:00,340
Yeah.

2347
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:01,340
Okay.

2348
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,340
We're going to have a rabbit hole here.

2349
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:04,340
Let's proceed to our next question.

2350
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:07,340
Speaking of arm retrieval.

2351
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,340
Oh no.

2352
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,340
Tadpo in the patreon lounge.

2353
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:18,340
Who on this week's PCP hasn't supported or shared arm retrieval con three go fund me.

2354
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:19,340
I am.

2355
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:20,340
I did share it.

2356
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,340
I did share it.

2357
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,340
Because Homestuck is gay.

2358
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:23,340
I did share it.

2359
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,340
I did share it.

2360
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:28,340
Munchy, but I am also, like I shared it right before the show and I said, okay, well, I got

2361
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,340
to do the show.

2362
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,340
I got all the land on the paper.

2363
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:32,340
I am going to fucking, I am going to donate.

2364
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:34,340
That was always, that was the plan.

2365
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:35,340
Thank you.

2366
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:36,340
And so should you viewers.

2367
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:37,340
Yeah.

2368
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:44,340
So should you go to gofundme.com slash arm retrieval con II and in between all those

2369
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:46,340
words are dashes.

2370
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,340
Please go there.

2371
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,340
That's where I'll be.

2372
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:50,340
Give us some money.

2373
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:53,340
So arm retrieval con three can be a massive success.

2374
01:42:53,340 --> 01:43:00,340
This will be the only crowdsourcing, you know, event for any particular meetup or, you know,

2375
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:05,340
convention of any sort for the foreseeable future for as long as the fucking may breathe.

2376
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:11,340
This will be the only one that you will see for possibly the rest of the PCP systems.

2377
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,340
And there you go.

2378
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:13,340
Good.

2379
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:14,340
Good.

2380
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:15,340
Good.

2381
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:16,340
Good.

2382
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:17,340
Good.

2383
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:18,340
Good.

2384
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,340
Good.

2385
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:20,340
Good.

2386
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:21,340
Good.

2387
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:22,340
Good.

2388
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,340
I've donated.

2389
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:24,340
I gave in eight bucks.

2390
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,340
Oh, so that was not bad.

2391
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,340
Eight, it was a lorries.

2392
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:28,340
There you go.

2393
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:30,340
Listen, new, new real question.

2394
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:37,340
Please listen, I would give money to, to this arm retrieval illicit fun happening here.

2395
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,340
It's just okay.

2396
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,340
I got to think about where my money is actually going.

2397
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:46,340
Do I really want to send money to the, the, the disgraceful illicit Ethan and Steve.

2398
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:50,340
Is that something I can look myself in the morning and say I did a good thing today.

2399
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:57,340
I'll donate on the condition that they are banned from walking through here.

2400
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:58,340
Oh, perfect.

2401
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:04,860
Steam, famed remover of Syldex, he's the one who went back and edited all the old panels

2402
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:07,500
so they were removed from the comic.

2403
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,500
Is that true?

2404
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,500
Did he do that?

2405
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,500
No.

2406
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,500
Oh.

2407
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:12,500
I was thinking.

2408
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:17,380
He said he doesn't have access to MSBAInvention.com, dude.

2409
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:19,220
I thought he meant for a personal archive.

2410
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:23,180
Okay, well anyway, yes, everyone give money, all the money.

2411
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:24,180
Yeah, please do.

2412
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,180
Empty your wallet.

2413
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:31,180
For arm retrieval, because there will be nothing else besides.

2414
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,380
So okay, next question, what else have we got?

2415
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:34,380
Let me look over here.

2416
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:39,540
I have from Mecoolman in the Patreon lounge, when did you wake up today?

2417
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:47,620
As of this recording, 24 hours ago, 24 hours ago is when I woke up in real life.

2418
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:48,620
When you gulp woke.

2419
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:49,620
Yeah, I got woke.

2420
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:50,620
Okay, go back to sleep.

2421
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:52,620
Is this like a matrix question?

2422
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,620
Basically.

2423
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2424
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:55,620
When did you wake up?

2425
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:59,420
Is this like asking when we got fucking redpilled, is that what we're?

2426
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:01,140
Yeah, when did you take the red pill?

2427
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,940
I told you, when I was 14 in the shower.

2428
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:05,940
Yeah, yeah.

2429
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:06,940
Basically.

2430
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:13,300
I'll figure out when I was fucking redpilled, hold on one second.

2431
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:17,340
Okay, yeah, let me go on to the question.

2432
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:23,100
I found the exact date, August 10, 2011, the date Know Your Me My Little Pony was released

2433
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:27,180
and thus the day I first started watching My Little Pony, that's the day when I got

2434
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,180
woke.

2435
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,180
All right, not bad.

2436
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,180
August 10, 2011.

2437
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,180
That's good, that's good.

2438
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:35,860
All right, here's another question from Haid in the Patreon lounge again, favorite kind

2439
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:42,700
of meat, are you team chicken, cow, fish, ham boy, or other sort of meat?

2440
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:43,700
Does seafood count?

2441
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,020
Like, like does duchel fish count?

2442
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,020
You did say fish.

2443
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,020
Absolutely.

2444
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:53,620
Yeah, I would probably go, I think scallop might be my favorite meat of all.

2445
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,620
Where's cock meat?

2446
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,620
I'm gay.

2447
01:45:56,620 --> 01:46:02,940
We're talking about tariff, I go with beef.

2448
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:03,940
Yeah.

2449
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:08,140
Oh, what a New Englander, this lobster boy, how disgraceful.

2450
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:15,580
Tier one cow, tier two pig, slash, selfish, what are shrimp?

2451
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:16,580
Shrimp would also be beautiful.

2452
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,460
Shrimp or shellfish?

2453
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,460
Yeah, very.

2454
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:27,580
Tier three chicken and the rest, and then tier four is all the shit that does not matter.

2455
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:29,900
The answer is for sure, number one is fish.

2456
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:35,340
I love fish, they got omega threes, they're killer, I fucking love fish intensely.

2457
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:39,660
I think I like fish about as much as I like chicken, like fish itself.

2458
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:40,660
I'm happy to admit.

2459
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:44,100
Although I really like sushi and I guess you couldn't have that without fish, so.

2460
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:47,660
There is the novelty factor at play in fish for me, because I never had a lot growing

2461
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:51,580
up and I kind of made it seem cool in my own head, but I still love it and it's good for

2462
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:52,580
you.

2463
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:55,220
Yeah, it seems you just thought fish were just so cool.

2464
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:58,660
Eating fish was delicious and I didn't do it enough, and it is super low fat.

2465
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:02,100
We never eat fish and when we did it was like, whoa, we're having fish, whoa.

2466
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:03,660
Yeah, exactly.

2467
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:08,340
And it's super locale and it's got lots of great unsaturated fats.

2468
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:10,340
It's super local.

2469
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:15,260
I like fish is not very flavorful.

2470
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:19,740
You need to put a lot of oil and stuff on it before it tastes like anything, except

2471
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:20,740
prawns.

2472
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,740
Prawns are good.

2473
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:22,740
Okay, fair enough.

2474
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:23,740
Or shrimp, what do you call them?

2475
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:24,740
I don't know.

2476
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,740
Yeah.

2477
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,740
There's loads of different types of that little guy.

2478
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,740
You're right.

2479
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:32,780
Yeah, you're not wrong, but I would put chicken is like the main staple, chicken is best.

2480
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:39,180
Do you guys, has anyone like eaten prawns where you have to rip the shell off by hand and

2481
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,420
put your hands in the bowl?

2482
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,420
Yeah, that's the worst.

2483
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:42,420
I love that.

2484
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,420
You love it?

2485
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,420
For some reason.

2486
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:48,420
I don't mind that, but I have, okay, the biggest fucking pet peeve is when you get like, you

2487
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,980
get, I don't know, like shrimp scampi or something.

2488
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:56,380
You get some like pasta dish that has shrimp in it, but the tails are still on them.

2489
01:47:56,380 --> 01:48:00,740
Like what the, like you have to reach into your fucking pasta and pull the, why wouldn't

2490
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:01,740
the chef take it off?

2491
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:02,940
He took the rest of the shell off.

2492
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:03,940
What the fuck?

2493
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:04,940
Exactly.

2494
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:09,140
And like, all the butter and the garlic is like on the shell, now in the trash.

2495
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,500
Like, what the fuck was the point of this?

2496
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,500
What a waste.

2497
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,500
No, no, no, no.

2498
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,500
All right.

2499
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,500
Here's the point.

2500
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,060
Here's the point of keeping the shell on, because when you're boiling them, the flavor

2501
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:22,100
of like the meat, the flesh gets diminished if it doesn't have the shell on, like the

2502
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:23,660
shell cooks it somewhat.

2503
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:28,060
So when you serve it, you have the shell and then you take it off and it's like the

2504
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:29,820
freshest prawn of all time.

2505
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:34,500
Keep them in the shell, but like they, these are not shell shrimp, well, they are shell

2506
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,500
shrimp.

2507
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:36,500
Not in pasta.

2508
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,500
The shell is removed.

2509
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,740
It's just the tail is on, but you can't fucking eat it.

2510
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:40,940
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

2511
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:43,620
Which is like, the way you're supposed to have it is...

2512
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:47,420
Yeah, I get that, but I don't think that applies here.

2513
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:49,460
I like shrimp cocktails.

2514
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:52,500
You just eat the shrimp and you dip it in the marinara sauce or whatever it's called.

2515
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,140
Yeah, like in that case, it's fine because you hold it by the tail and you like, you

2516
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,180
kind of bite it out, but in like a pasta, oh my God.

2517
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,180
I'm so fucking excited.

2518
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:01,180
I'm so fucking excited.

2519
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:05,660
I'm actually a very big shrimp enthusiast.

2520
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:11,980
I have not tasted shrimp until I went to Denver, where I live on a coastal city, but I had

2521
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:16,500
never tried shrimp until I went to fucking Denver, Colorado, and I realized I liked it.

2522
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,500
Are you familiar?

2523
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:20,540
Hashtag fried shrimp is literally the best shrimp.

2524
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:22,500
Fried shrimp tempura is delicious.

2525
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:27,020
Are you familiar with the beaver boys by any chance, Munchy?

2526
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:28,020
What?

2527
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,020
Okay.

2528
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:35,380
The beaver boys are an elite group of young heroes living in America and living the high

2529
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:42,940
life that love two things and two things only, shrimp and white wine.

2530
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:45,560
These two things comprise the entirety of their being.

2531
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:49,500
Shrimp and white wine, the beaver boys, they are from Tim and Eric, and you should go check

2532
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
them out as soon as we're done.

2533
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,740
No, you mean beaver boys.

2534
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:57,340
They're from several Tim and Eric episodes you should check them out.

2535
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,900
They're excellent.

2536
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:00,900
Other questions?

2537
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:01,900
What else we got?

2538
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:02,900
A lot of bullshit.

2539
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:04,900
How about this right here?

2540
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,900
I don't know.

2541
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:10,180
Kaidera in the Patreon Lounge asks, if you could pass along any of your own skills slash

2542
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:19,460
talent to someone of the PCP, what skill would that be and who would you give it to?

2543
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,180
This is basically why I'm better than X person.

2544
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:29,220
I would give Ben my financial responsibility if I could, if only I could or that.

2545
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:33,260
If we give it, if we give someone the power, do we lose it or is we just clone it?

2546
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:35,140
I'm going to say it's copied in this case.

2547
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:37,140
You've got a one-time pass to give someone a skill you have.

2548
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:40,180
Because if I have to lose it, I ain't giving anybody shit because I'm already barely getting

2549
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,180
bought out of this.

2550
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:45,780
Let's say it's collapsing, I need another handicap.

2551
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:51,380
Well, Nate, I would give you my caring about my brother's feelings.

2552
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:59,980
My body would reject it like a bad friend's feeling without a doubt, without a fucking

2553
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:00,980
doubt.

2554
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:01,980
Indeed.

2555
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:07,500
I would give Digi my crippling aids.

2556
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,980
I would give Hippo my lung capacity.

2557
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:12,620
Oh, that's a good one.

2558
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:13,620
That would be good.

2559
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,620
I would love that.

2560
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:19,540
Imagine give puffing up like a puffer fish and you know, preparing to unleash a torrent

2561
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:25,580
of, I would give, I would give Munchy, I would give Munchy my heterosexuality.

2562
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:30,380
No, no, no, get that away from me.

2563
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:36,500
I would give that asexual flag as fast as you can.

2564
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:42,340
I would give Hippo my 3D skills because I want to see him make animations.

2565
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:44,980
I'm sick of give being 2D in real life.

2566
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:45,980
It's a real disgrace.

2567
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:46,980
He needs to get with the times.

2568
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:48,980
It's time to, it's time to fatten up.

2569
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:49,980
Time to get thick.

2570
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:50,980
That's what the people want.

2571
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,980
Oh, yeah, that's right.

2572
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:59,420
I'd give Hippo my incredibly disgusting eating habits when I just engorge on junk food so

2573
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,780
he can get some meat on his bones.

2574
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:02,780
Indeed.

2575
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,420
Though for you it just keeps you skinny for some reason, but you just got the fastest

2576
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,420
metabolism in the world, I guess.

2577
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:07,620
I just wear baggy clothes.

2578
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,620
You don't know.

2579
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:09,620
Oh, fair enough.

2580
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,620
Fair enough.

2581
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:15,620
I would give Nate my mussel-less body.

2582
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,620
Oh, no.

2583
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:19,620
It would be crippled instantly.

2584
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:20,620
No.

2585
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,620
How cruel.

2586
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:22,620
How vicious.

2587
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:24,540
Hey, here's a question for Gib.

2588
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:26,140
I'm just curious about this.

2589
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:30,980
EricBiden asks, Hippo, do you still play Fire Emblem Heroes?

2590
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:32,700
What is your favorite Fire Emblem game?

2591
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:34,140
This is a terrible question.

2592
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:39,060
No, I was just, I was curious if you still play in this game because it was like a thing.

2593
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:43,500
I had to take it off my phone because I wanted to play Pokemon Go and it kept updating and

2594
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,000
I didn't have space.

2595
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,260
It was all right and I might play it again, but eh.

2596
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:48,260
Okay, okay.

2597
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:51,540
I'm just curious about the continuity of all these kinds of mobile games because me and

2598
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:54,460
Kingdom Hearts have fallen out of ways with the mobile game.

2599
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:58,300
I just can't keep up with the fucking missions that are shit.

2600
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:59,300
It's not fun.

2601
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:00,300
It's not fun.

2602
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:03,980
Eh, what's your favorite Fire Emblem that you're a hero?

2603
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:07,820
Oh, eh, fucking Fire Emblem 7 or 8.

2604
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:12,220
It depends on my mood, but either of those games are the best game I've ever made.

2605
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:14,380
Hippo is a capricious creature.

2606
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,380
Indeed.

2607
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:16,380
Indeed.

2608
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,380
I see a pretty good question here.

2609
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:20,660
Let's make it the last one because I feel like we're wrapping up here.

2610
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:21,660
Yeah.

2611
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:22,660
Okay.

2612
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,180
I'm just going to ask, this question is based on the assumption that there was a point in

2613
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:28,580
life when you were a wee lad when you weren't actively pursuing art.

2614
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:33,500
How has your view of art and artists changed since actively pursuing it as a career?

2615
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,620
And my answer for that is just that I don't respect them as much.

2616
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,620
Reasonable.

2617
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:41,500
I don't think, because I'm kind of doing the same thing and now I don't think what

2618
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,500
they do is special anymore.

2619
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,140
That makes sense.

2620
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:49,700
I don't know whether I'm, like I can't remember a time where I wasn't thinking about doing

2621
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:54,340
art because I was always like, people praise my drawings when I was a little kid.

2622
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:58,020
So I don't really know whether I was ever thinking about doing something else.

2623
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:02,500
But I also at the same time feel more connected to them and almost like they're my friends.

2624
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,720
We have commonality.

2625
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:08,660
Sometimes I think about Andrew Hussie just grinding out pages of Homestuck for days on

2626
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:12,540
end and I just think like, yeah man, I feel you.

2627
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:17,060
Sometimes I think about Andrew Hussie losing all the money from his Kickstarter and sitting

2628
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:19,980
around for a fucking year not updating.

2629
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:24,220
Sometimes I think about Andrew Hussie dating some fan artist and then when she breaks up

2630
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:27,220
with him, she stays the PR manager of his company.

2631
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:28,980
I still don't know what's on my thinking about that.

2632
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:29,980
The ultimate cockledry.

2633
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:30,980
Okay.

2634
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:35,420
I mean, how sad, how unfortunate.

2635
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:41,060
My perception of artists has not changed at all, basically, basically.

2636
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:49,660
Oh, actually, actually, my perception of this band of artists, the PCP, has changed dramatically,

2637
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,660
actually.

2638
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:53,620
I now feel the same way Ben does.

2639
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,780
I don't feel like it's that special anymore.

2640
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:56,780
Yeah.

2641
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:57,780
That certainly makes sense.

2642
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:58,780
It's great.

2643
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,780
It's the best.

2644
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,780
I don't know.

2645
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:01,780
Yeah.

2646
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,780
I generally agree.

2647
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:08,980
I feel myself a little more jaded in a sense like, okay, a lot of people, I've been thinking

2648
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:10,180
about this lately.

2649
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:13,940
I've seen a lot of people talking about, I think I watched, maybe it was like Philip

2650
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:14,940
DeFranco or something.

2651
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:19,380
It was something about the new changes to the monetization stuff on YouTube.

2652
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:26,500
We're now like, if you have less than 1,000 subs or you haven't gotten 4,000 hours of

2653
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:32,820
watch time in the last year or something, then you're not eligible for monetization.

2654
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:38,380
I'm not commenting on that, but people were bringing up the point that, okay, it's really

2655
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:43,620
hard to make it as an artist on YouTube, and it's obviously just getting harder.

2656
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:48,300
Maybe I'll make it, but they've really been, a lot of people have been saying, you shouldn't

2657
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:52,340
make this your main thing unless you're super successful.

2658
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:58,460
You should keep working your job and just make this a hobby to keep it pure.

2659
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:03,580
I've really been rebelling against that in my own mind, but I don't know.

2660
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:05,060
I'm kind of split on the issue.

2661
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:11,140
I personally am dedicated to making it happen, but if you look at something like Weagawa,

2662
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:17,820
Weagawa is a reaction to my evolving understanding of how to make it in this world.

2663
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:23,100
I would rather be working on bigger projects that I could, like when I started on my channel,

2664
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:26,700
spending months and years preparing really big things.

2665
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:31,780
I am still doing that, but they're taking longer because of this other shit.

2666
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:35,380
I'm wondering, and in fact, if I am able to go full-time content creator, I might be

2667
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:41,260
able to then make a Weagawa and get my bigger projects out faster because I'm getting paid

2668
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:45,660
for doing art in general and don't have to go to a wage slave job.

2669
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:49,940
It might work out that I make more and better art in that way, but also, it's possible

2670
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:53,300
it might not work out that way.

2671
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:54,300
I don't know.

2672
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:56,300
I feel a little more jaded.

2673
01:56:56,300 --> 01:57:00,100
I feel like someone with your disposition would increase their workflow dramatically

2674
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,420
because you're not somebody who's just going to be like, well, I don't have to go to work

2675
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,420
anymore.

2676
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,900
I guess I'm just going to eat Doritos and watch anime.

2677
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,900
You know, I sort of feel that.

2678
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:11,300
I sort of feel that, but go ahead and give it to them.

2679
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:15,880
I think Jesse said this a long time ago on the podcast is that Mr. Plinkett, like Red

2680
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:22,860
Letter Media, the Mr. Plinkett's were great when they were around, but a lot of the half

2681
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:28,020
in the bags and just the silly videos with Mike and Rich just talking about something

2682
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:33,980
have just as many views and are also just as funny with so much less effort put into

2683
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:34,980
them.

2684
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:42,140
They've realized that not everything has to be a Plinkett review and not everything

2685
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:46,260
has to be like a big project that you spend a lot of time on to make it really good because

2686
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,780
at the end of the day, the effect is the same.

2687
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:54,140
At this point, you're totally right, and at this point, I have enjoyed half in the bag

2688
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:59,300
possibly at this point as a collective more than I have enjoyed the Plinkett reviews.

2689
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:00,300
Those are legendary.

2690
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,660
Nothing that's ever happened on half in the bag has had anywhere near the kind of impact

2691
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:05,660
on it.

2692
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:09,940
Well, there are some exceptions to this.

2693
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:16,900
The one video they did on Jack and Jill as a half in the bag is legendary and I think

2694
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:22,460
is makes just as good a point and artistically so as was done in the Plinkett reviews.

2695
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:25,900
I'm not going to say that artistically was quite on the same level as everything that

2696
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:32,300
happened in Plinkett, but the point and the meaning behind it is a really good one and

2697
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:36,380
very interesting and presented in a great way.

2698
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:40,940
When I was doing We Agua, just because I forced myself to grind out a bunch of videos, I ended

2699
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:44,300
up making stuff that was like some of them were really great.

2700
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:47,740
People really liked the one where I talked about working out.

2701
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:52,140
I was just scrolling on the 4chan looking for something to talk about that day and I saw

2702
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:57,580
the chart about the increase in people signing up for the volleyball clubs in high school

2703
01:58:57,580 --> 01:59:03,500
in Japan after the release of, I forget, the manga about or the anime.

2704
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:04,500
What was it?

2705
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:05,500
Was it Haikyuu?

2706
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,500
Yes, that's right.

2707
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:12,620
Haikyuu, the volleyball manga shown in jump slash anime and then I just grabbed me spiraling

2708
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:16,500
off thinking about all this stuff and I ended up making what I consider a really great video

2709
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:22,020
about that and non-kiromote or whatever it's called.

2710
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:30,180
So great things can emerge when you put yourself on the grind and it's less likely that a We

2711
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:34,020
Agua will be as good as you're growing like in video, but it's not impossible, which is

2712
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:35,020
the point.

2713
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,020
It's true.

2714
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:38,900
And you know what, I only slightly disagree there.

2715
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:46,500
I think even the newest plinket I think is better aesthetically or artistically, it is

2716
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:50,260
better than even the best half in the bag, which is the Jack and Jill one.

2717
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:55,340
It's like you have to ask what the point of the art is because when you think about it,

2718
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:59,620
the difference between a plinket review and half in the bag and the difference between

2719
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:05,460
a We Agua and Gurren Lagan is really mostly window dressing, right?

2720
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:11,420
Because it's like attracting people from the visual presentation and things like that.

2721
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:15,980
But if you made a We Agua about Gurren Lagan, you would have hit on the same points.

2722
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:19,100
It's just the presentation would have been very true static.

2723
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,860
I actually challenged this.

2724
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:29,300
I feel like this group in particular has been consciously moving away for not, you know,

2725
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:37,380
immoral reasons for a lot of, for I think mostly for, you know, economic reasons and

2726
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:38,380
shit.

2727
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:40,980
Yeah, economic and just, you know, not wanting to be stagnant.

2728
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:48,620
They've been moving away from long, like, like a big, big law, not long form necessarily,

2729
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:55,500
but big, concise, bombastic, huge, say everything you possibly can be, it can say about a topic

2730
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:02,620
in one video, highly structured and edited to a fine, mere shine, to just spewing out

2731
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:04,620
shit all the time.

2732
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:05,620
Yeah, that's true.

2733
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:06,620
Yeah.

2734
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:10,140
Honestly, because that works, at least for me, that's what We Agua was, so that I could

2735
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:11,980
keep myself engaged in YouTube and keep people coming back.

2736
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:18,340
I've tried very hard to not let my videos become like that, but I still try enough.

2737
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:23,860
But like, I feel like I also can't reach the heights, like I've tried, like the closest

2738
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:27,260
I got was my Rayman video, which everybody loves and it's a big old thing, but I don't

2739
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:31,940
even know whether that's like, on the same level, like proportionally, like in a ratio

2740
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:35,860
sense, to like a plinker review to what a half in the bag is.

2741
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:39,900
Like, I don't know whether I've reached like a big project yet.

2742
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:40,900
Well, I don't know.

2743
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:41,900
I don't know.

2744
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:46,860
It's all, all I want to say, I don't think there's like, like, you know, I, I, I love

2745
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:49,300
We Agua, and I watch it as soon as it comes out.

2746
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:53,500
I, I, that's, I just recently on the new one, I like, I got a letter from Psy who says

2747
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:59,220
that he like loves my old work, but he said he's gotten so much more out of We Agua than

2748
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:03,300
he did for like the, the like, like, look, there's like five best anime ever's because

2749
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:05,220
they each took six months to make more or less.

2750
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:06,220
So, you know,

2751
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:11,180
I, I, I will say like, sure, if we're going to look at it from like, like, like Lynn's

2752
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:15,860
like, like eagle eye point of view, what series have it gotten more out of?

2753
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:19,780
Sure, maybe due to the fact that it just is so much longer, I've gotten more out of

2754
02:02:19,780 --> 02:02:23,300
me and Maffa slash We Agua than best anime ever.

2755
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:28,980
But here's the thing, I rewatch best anime ever during the gone like, pretty fucking

2756
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:29,980
frequently.

2757
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:30,980
I do that all the time.

2758
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:36,340
And whenever I do it, I still am amazed by how well structured and fucking edited to

2759
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:41,260
a mere fucking shine it is, and how incredible it is on every fucking level.

2760
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,860
Whereas Oh, we Agua, I would never rewatch it.

2761
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:44,860
I would never do that.

2762
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:49,060
You know, I think it's good to put on and, you know, I can draw the background of it.

2763
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:51,460
I mean, I just have the same weight to me.

2764
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:52,460
You know, that's right.

2765
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:53,460
That's right.

2766
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:57,860
To remember is that the reason why like this pivot is happening, it's, I don't know.

2767
02:02:57,860 --> 02:02:58,860
Yeah, it's an economic.

2768
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,860
It's not a creative decision.

2769
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:05,900
Like if all things, if all things were equal and like Nate, you could have the exact same

2770
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:10,580
impact and make the exact same amount of money, just slaving away over the next best anime

2771
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,740
ever as opposed to doing we Agua, I'm pretty sure you would just do best anime ever.

2772
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,620
I don't quite agree.

2773
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:20,980
I think now that I've tried out we Agua, I do actually like staying sort of in constant

2774
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:24,180
communication with my audience, with like regular updates.

2775
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:29,340
So I think you like that because of the economics that I mean, what I like it because it keeps

2776
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:32,180
people interested in me, which is part of what I need to do.

2777
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:33,180
Right.

2778
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:34,180
That's my practical.

2779
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:38,500
There's always a practical component like we could dream that in a perfect world, like

2780
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:39,740
that was what I was proposing.

2781
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:42,860
I was proposing the reason this is it's an economic choice, not a creative.

2782
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:47,940
It's not just economic, though, it's it's it's like if I don't make just just practically

2783
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:52,420
if I put out a best anime ever every six months, people will just forget about me, regardless

2784
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:54,140
of like how much money I'm making.

2785
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:55,140
And I don't want that.

2786
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:59,660
I want to stay active and I want to stay involved, but I'm not I'm trying to, you know, counter

2787
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:00,660
your anything.

2788
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,660
Please go on.

2789
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:05,380
What's wrong with being like, what's wrong with being like a reclusive artist who just

2790
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:08,900
puts out a big bomb every now and then that's not a that's not at all.

2791
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,020
That's just not what I want to do.

2792
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,020
That's all.

2793
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,020
Okay.

2794
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,380
People people succeed on that model.

2795
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:15,380
Yeah.

2796
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:19,780
Well, not as much anymore, not on YouTube is exactly how it's way harder to Mr. Beetong

2797
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:22,380
is not succeeding on YouTube because he's not making any money.

2798
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:27,100
I didn't you were talking about succeeding as I was saying, Mr. Beetong as an example,

2799
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:29,380
like he's not an example of that.

2800
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:31,660
But like people love Mr. Beetong.

2801
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:33,540
You love Mr. Beetong so much.

2802
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:39,180
He's so niche and he's he doesn't overload you with stuff that is not interesting as

2803
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:40,180
interesting.

2804
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,180
Well, what are we talking about?

2805
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:42,460
Or like a good channel?

2806
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:45,100
Um, I'm I don't know.

2807
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:48,140
You were talking about the way you want to be perceived, like you want people to remember

2808
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:48,500
you.

2809
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:51,260
I want to stay a constant force in people's lives.

2810
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:52,100
That's that's true.

2811
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:57,540
I want them to reflect and say, Ah, yes, let's see what you say that your goals have

2812
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:02,380
changed as in a response to doing me a map of a and we go as a result.

2813
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:08,580
I well, let's not forget the reason I did me a map of a was because I was sick of people

2814
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:12,580
saying that they're that they only hear from me like every once every six months because

2815
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:13,740
that was never my intention.

2816
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:15,380
I wanted to get things out faster.

2817
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:17,180
I just, you know, have to work and don't have time.

2818
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:21,620
I don't really care at all how much people hear from me.

2819
02:05:21,820 --> 02:05:26,300
I just want to leave them with a good impression and I just want to leave them.

2820
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:29,220
I just want to give them something cool whenever I got it.

2821
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:30,460
You know, perfectly reasonable.

2822
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:31,820
That's that's what I care about.

2823
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:37,820
Not not even one iota of my original statement was to disparage we wag or short form

2824
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:38,940
frequent content.

2825
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:39,740
That's true.

2826
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:45,820
I know I want I'm I'm a little afraid that people will just only do short form stuff.

2827
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:50,900
But even though that is more economic, you know, and that's the reason they're going to do it things.

2828
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:54,300
You know, I would just like art to be what I like.

2829
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:56,660
I totally hear what you're saying.

2830
02:05:56,660 --> 02:06:00,300
But for someone like me, I would ask for people to be charitable.

2831
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:01,300
Anyone who makes this point.

2832
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:06,660
And unfortunately, this is asking kind of a lot, but do not judge someone like me on

2833
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:08,860
what I'm producing moment to moment.

2834
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:14,140
I would say in a few years, look back at what I created and then say, well, look, I didn't

2835
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:15,300
get the content I wanted.

2836
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:20,540
Therefore, this this time period, I would consider a failure because you didn't make a single best

2837
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:21,140
anime ever.

2838
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:25,260
You were too busy on the we Agua and I'm not, you know, it goes in the the the trashmen of history.

2839
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,420
I think that was a perfectly reasonable thing to say.

2840
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:28,460
Was that Tom?

2841
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:32,940
I think it's just well, it might be a failure to you as an audience member.

2842
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:33,300
Right.

2843
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:36,740
Just for your personal, yeah, you know, you can make a case, which is totally fine.

2844
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:40,660
Like I would argue that like the last year, for example, Twin Perfect is an interesting

2845
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:44,540
example to me where those guys actually it was very interesting.

2846
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:46,540
Recently, they've been doing this entire year.

2847
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:48,580
They've been doing a monthly recap.

2848
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:50,220
They called like the perfect monthly recap.

2849
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,180
And at the end of every month, they would review things that happened the previous month.

2850
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:59,300
The problem was by the time they were doing this recap, the entire news cycle for every

2851
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:03,420
story they talked about was completely over and nobody gave a shit anymore.

2852
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:07,180
So like these videos, they have like 55,000 subs or something.

2853
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,260
They would get like 4000 views.

2854
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:13,540
And then at the end of this experiment, that honestly, I kind of think is them reframing

2855
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:14,300
like what they were doing.

2856
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:16,620
They were like, Oh, that was just an experiment.

2857
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:21,900
And the whole like this was just in addition to our actual content that we actually care

2858
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:22,220
about.

2859
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:27,300
We didn't want this to be popular anyway of of like our big analytical videos that they

2860
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:31,180
did of like the new Alien movie, like Prometheus, something, something, the new one or whatever

2861
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,100
and other stuff.

2862
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:35,740
And those videos do indeed get like generally hundreds of thousands of views.

2863
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:39,140
People give a shit about those and they weren't into their review stuff.

2864
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:45,500
So like those are that's an example of guys trying something and like not not it's not

2865
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:49,380
working out very well in terms of like trying to do regular content because they didn't

2866
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:50,540
give the market what it needed.

2867
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:51,460
They weren't snappy enough.

2868
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:56,540
They weren't fast enough and they just like weren't engaged enough with the community,

2869
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:57,980
even though they were trying to.

2870
02:07:58,220 --> 02:08:01,820
So that's the sort of thing you need to avoid if you're trying to make this kind of regular

2871
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,820
content, I would say.

2872
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:06,100
But they're they're a very interesting case, but whatever, I don't know.

2873
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:11,420
Yeah, I I agree with everything said here.

2874
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:18,260
I just I just want like like I was going to say, did you please make another good video?

2875
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:19,660
There it is.

2876
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:20,780
There it is.

2877
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:21,220
Please.

2878
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:24,700
You didn't like you didn't like his like hour long Makoto Shinkai or whatever.

2879
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:26,460
No, that was fine.

2880
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:30,460
I don't like any of the other things that are constantly happening.

2881
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:31,740
OK, OK.

2882
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:36,460
The. Oh, God, I don't want to talk about this.

2883
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:41,060
Who does who does I am?

2884
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:45,340
Shout out to DigiBroni MLP.

2885
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:50,260
Shout out. What would you guys consider my like greatest project that I've made?

2886
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:51,340
Top 10 hippos.

2887
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:54,820
Top 10 fucking hippos is the greatest video of all time.

2888
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:57,460
Top 10 hippos is like probably the funniest.

2889
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:00,340
I am like, oh, no.

2890
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:02,580
I really love the G.R.P.J. is a lot.

2891
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:05,380
Mine is there's a fish at the door.

2892
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:07,620
Yeah, I really. Oh, that's true.

2893
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:08,420
I forgot about those.

2894
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:10,820
But yeah, yeah, your animations are really great.

2895
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:13,580
Hippo, I'm just going to tell you right fucking now.

2896
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:17,300
Here's the here's the munchy, munchy opinion.

2897
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:18,220
Here's just here.

2898
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:19,980
I want to lay it on the table.

2899
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:21,700
Game reviews stop.

2900
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:22,820
Stop it.

2901
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:25,060
Animate, draw that stuff.

2902
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:28,260
Here's here's what you're here's what you're going to do in my brain

2903
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:29,540
when I fantasize about it.

2904
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:30,380
Here's what I hope.

2905
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:33,460
And when you don't do it, I'll be disappointed as the fear of mind.

2906
02:09:33,460 --> 02:09:34,340
Munchy predicts.

2907
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:36,020
Yeah, exactly.

2908
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:41,260
You should become the literally new control of the lead and just make

2909
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:45,100
what are like weekly comics, not about video games, just like short comics.

2910
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:49,060
Just turn all of your puns on Twitter into short comics.

2911
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:50,460
You would be a billionaire.

2912
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:51,180
It would be great.

2913
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:52,260
I want to see you draw these.

2914
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:55,140
Your drawings are good and it would be funny and games.

2915
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:56,620
Fuck video games.

2916
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:57,940
Done.

2917
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:59,460
There's no more you can do.

2918
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:00,700
Reviews are dead.

2919
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:05,460
Analogical content is over by by by wiped off the map.

2920
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:10,540
Do new things, create actual art, real art that isn't fake, like analysis.

2921
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:13,060
Interesting idea.

2922
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:13,860
That's me.

2923
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:15,260
You're a butthole hippo.

2924
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:20,580
Oh, no, don't worry.

2925
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:21,220
I don't know.

2926
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:24,140
OK.

2927
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:28,940
I like the Bugs Life review.

2928
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:32,860
I like all of the videos.

2929
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,700
I just don't want them to be made.

2930
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:36,140
Don't backpile now.

2931
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:42,740
Well, now that we've slayed Gibb, that was a thorough examination of that last

2932
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:44,140
question, but it was good.

2933
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:45,940
Good stuff there.

2934
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:47,140
All right, well, I guess that's it, everybody.

2935
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:48,100
That was our last question.

2936
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:49,740
Thank you, everybody.

2944
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:09,260
I think something around there.

2945
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:09,820
Delicious.

2946
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:11,820
That one, that one is fucking scrumptious.

2947
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:12,620
You better.

2948
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:13,260
It's the best.

2949
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,060
It's I think it's my favorite one.

2950
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:16,940
It's it's incredible.

2951
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:18,900
It is the Alpha and Omega bonus episodes.

2952
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:20,380
Could it be our best work?

2953
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:24,380
I think it's probably could it could it be the PCP's first masterpiece?

2954
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:28,100
It's the new PCP's and you PCP's masterpieces for sure.

2955
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:29,180
Yes, for sure.

2956
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:29,860
It's incredible.

2957
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:31,180
It's signed the fuck up.

2958
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:34,060
And be on that PCP.

2959
02:11:34,060 --> 02:11:35,860
It's it's the act six masterpiece.

2960
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:37,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2961
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:38,620
There's no doubt.

2962
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:40,660
And other than that, it's all a bunch of bullshit.

2963
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:42,260
Give us all your money and thank you.

2964
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:43,740
We got some some merch.

2965
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:45,580
Redbubble link in the description.

2966
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:47,740
Hashtag ask PCP for the pity questions.

2967
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:51,420
If you don't want to give us any money, we might read one or two if we fucking feel

2968
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:55,980
if we don't come down from our pedestal on Mount Olympus, we might read one or two.

2969
02:11:56,860 --> 02:11:57,700
What else we got?

2970
02:11:57,700 --> 02:12:01,700
We got the podcast is up on iTunes and Google Play courtesy of Mr.

2971
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,460
Tom Oliver.

2972
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:04,540
Thank you as always for that.

2973
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:06,780
And I think that's everything.

2974
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:08,940
I think we've done it once again, everybody.

2975
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:09,980
Thank you for listening.

2976
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:11,980
Damn, we came.

2977
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:13,820
We saw we said religion forever.

2978
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:15,620
We answered the questions and we made it.

2979
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:16,820
I think I think the point.

2980
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:19,660
The point of this episode is that we're the only gods you need.

2981
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:21,500
That's exactly right.

2982
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:24,460
The only God is man and I am a real man.

2983
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:28,340
Just think of just think about what you've done for the past two hours

2984
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:30,140
and think about how much happiness we've given you.

2985
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:32,660
This is proof that short form

2986
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:36,140
content frequently is the best form of content.

2987
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:40,180
I think no, much more importantly, this was twice as long as church

2988
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:42,100
and like ten times entertaining.

2989
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:45,540
This is heaven here on.

2990
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:48,500
Oh, this is a city.

2991
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:51,620
Do do do the shining scene is PCPHQ.

2992
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:52,660
That's where all we're all.

2993
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:53,340
Yeah.

2994
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:55,300
That's right.

02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,180
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2996
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:58,260
Make it real.

2997
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:00,340
Donate to your church and God's.

2998
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:00,860
What was it?

2999
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:03,540
The church of equal the church's equal pay.

3000
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:06,820
I think is what we sell because the wage gap, I believe, is what we sell.

3001
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:11,660
Exemption is exemptionism, exemptionism and grind.

3002
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:13,260
Jealousism, grind.

3003
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:14,060
Jealousism.

3004
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:16,060
All right, sign up, everybody.

3005
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:17,060
Thanks for listening, everybody.

3006
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:19,020
And we will see you next time.

3007
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:20,020
Bye.

3008
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:57,420
I am a stupid I've got a deadline don't want to do it.
