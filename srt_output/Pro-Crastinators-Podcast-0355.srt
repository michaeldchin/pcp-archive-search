00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's ya boi Ben Saint and ya girl Gibbontake.

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:39,360
I don't know, okay. I don't know if this might be a voicemail. I haven't checked, but I want to post something that was posted in The Pro Crastinators Patreon Lounge.

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,360
And I just thought it was epic. So if you'll indulge me.

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Yeah, dude, I don't think I may have seen this.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
I probably did.

7
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,360
I don't want you to see it. I want you to hear it.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Oh.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Here it is. It's a little soundbeat from I'll Die.

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Oh, yeah.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,360
Yeah, you saw this, dammit. 3, 2, 1, go.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,360
I'm only the only thing I'm a slave to.

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Is the grind.

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Is the grind. Is the sigma grind. Is the rhythm. Is the rhythm of the jungle beat.

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
I'm also a slave to such beats.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
That little, that little, what is it, like a little cat's meow?

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Ow, in the background.

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,360
That's exactly what I'm talking about. This guy fucking gets it.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,360
I think that noise is like Diddy Kong going, ow.

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Yeah, I think it is. Yeah, I think it is.

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Ow.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,360
All right. That was pretty cool. The discord.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Did I say on the show what I want to do with the discord?

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Or do we just talk about that? Because I might mention it now.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
I can't remember.

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Well, I'll just say it.

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,360
When we release the Perfect Comic Party, I think I would like,

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,360
maybe we'll just make a new channel for people to do dedicated comic discussion.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Just the new comics that are in this, the latest episode of the,

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
of the Perfect Comic Party.

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Maybe that would also be where people might do like,

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
reader surveys.

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Or something, you know?

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Yeah.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Talked about like doing like Shonen Jump style reader surveys.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
But at the very least a channel for like,

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
discuss the comics in the thing.

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Yes.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,360
I have, I have about eight and a half pages of Beescapades done now.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Yo, nice.

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Yeah, it's coming along.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Maybe I can get the rest done this week.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
It's a bit ambitious, but you know, I'm going to,

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm going to keep trying and keep trying my way at it.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
What is your goal for pages?

46
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Around 20.

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
20, okay.

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Around 20, I think, because I feel like a page of Beescapades

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
is a little less substantial than a, than a Clarissa page.

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
So I thought I should have at least as many as there are Clarissa pages.

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Probably more.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I mean, I don't know about substantial.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Like it's hard to, it's definitely a single page of Clarissa takes longer to draw.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
There's a lot going on with all the text and stuff.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
I watched a bit of your stream when you were drawing it.

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Yes.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Yeah, that was this week.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I did my first draw stream in like years.

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,360
And I got like, I got like, I think I got like three pages done.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
On that one stream, which is pretty good.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
That's, that's pretty good.

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,360
As I've said, over and over again, Beescapades.

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm, I'm not going to, I'm not going to say what it is,

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
but like I was working on it like yesterday and this morning.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,360
And I'm, I'm, I'm introducing some stuff that is not going to be relevant

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
for a long time.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Beescapades has room to grow, let's just say as concepts.

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
That's all I'm going to say about it.

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited about it, but like there's a lot of like,

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,360
there's a lot of like setup that needs to happen.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,360
And I'm not sure, I'm not exactly sure what is going to happen in the rest of this first chapter.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Right now he's, it's been Bees, Bees hustler exploring like the town.

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
And then where he goes after he fully explores the town.

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,360
It's like, I don't know, I could, I could take it in like one or two different,

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I could take it in one or two different directions.

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I guess that's the beauty of being able to ask people to do the decision making part.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Yeah, I kind of miss it.

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I kind of miss it because I have not had consistent like reader suggestions.

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Like a lot of my, I kind of just, a lot of panels just, just drop like the command format.

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Like he just, it's like a real comic.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,360
He just does something instead of like there being a text command that he then follows,

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
which is, it's fine.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
It's fine, but it feels a little, there's just like less text.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
And I, I don't know.

86
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I kind of, it's sort of a, it would sort of be nice to just have someone tell me like,

87
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
have him do this next. And I'll be like, okay.

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Kind of takes the pressure off me a little bit.

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I don't have to construct anything.

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I just need to do as I'm told.

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Well, it's like this. Well, it's like this.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I know there are several things he could do and I'm not really committed to like,

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
oh, he should do them in a particular order.

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
So I guess it's just kind of nice to have the audience be like, oh, do that, do that.

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Oh, what about that thing?

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
And then it's like, okay, I'll follow the direction that, that someone is telling me,

97
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
that someone's interested in seeing it.

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Now, without that, I have to decide what the most interesting order is.

99
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
And it's like, I can't be trusted.

100
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
That level of responsibility.

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,360
I need to go back to my old Baaljape draw streams because I can't remember

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,360
how much it was like, I didn't stream drawing the entire comic, but a lot of the beginning,

103
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,360
when I was just like making stuff and there was a few people in chat and I know there was this idea

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
that it would be like, you'd say something in chat and I'll see if I could see what happens.

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
But I don't know if much of it was like that.

106
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I think a lot of it was just sort of, and then they go here and then they go there.

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
And it was kind of fun just making stuff up.

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,360
And it was like serendipitous how it came together at the end with all the little stupid things,

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,360
all the things I'd just drawn in the background, like the big wooden slingshot outside became like,

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:22,360
the snakes got stuck to it and then it became a slingshot and then the ball came and it smashed through the wall.

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
It's like, oh wow, I made it all fit.

112
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,360
But it's hard, it's hard to think so far ahead that you know that that's how it's going to be

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
and that that's going to be left there.

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,360
That's a, what's the thing, the gun, the Chekhov's gun?

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Oh sorry.

117
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
No, no, that's the main point, it's hard to do that.

118
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Did you know how jailbreak, I mean, Bale-Jape was going to end?

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
No idea.

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
You had no idea?

121
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Okay, because like I pretty much-

122
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I didn't even know what the location was until I drew like, oh, what if it's like in a big lava place,

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,360
like she looks out the window and there's lava and then you look out, you believe the window

124
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
and then it's like a big cathedral and it's like, and then there's ostriches.

125
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I don't know why I put that in there.

126
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:31,360
I know the kind of general arc of Beescapades and I think there's only one way it really can end,

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,360
so that's like not really-

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Consider this Beescapaded.

129
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,360
So that's not really up for debate and like how he gets there is kind of not, you know,

130
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:50,360
there's room for fucking around on the way there, I feel like, is why, you know, the reader input format there,

131
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,360
it's like, yeah, let people just tell me, like, oh, do this, do that, and we'll just see what happens.

132
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Because like, it won't affect the ultimate end.

133
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,360
I mean, I don't want to go, I guess I shouldn't say anymore.

134
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:16,360
You're in that artistic state where you really want to tell everyone, you really want everyone to know like how cool this is going to be,

135
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
but you can't say anything to anyone at any point.

136
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,360
If I say anything about it, it'll spoil everything.

137
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,360
If I said like, you know, Beescapades, it has concepts, it has guiding principles,

138
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:38,360
and if I said what those principles are, it would be like, I think it would spoil like, it would spoil where it's going.

139
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:48,360
There's going to be some reveals, and I want those reveals to be surprising and make people go, hmm.

140
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
You know what I mean?

141
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Yes, I do know what you mean.

142
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,360
There's like, I have ideas for Belle Jape too, that I'm cooking right now.

143
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Cooking, cooking.

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Let me cook, as they say.

145
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Let them cook.

146
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:13,360
And the larger, like for Belle Jape too, what happens is just stuff.

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Like there's no huge revelations, but the idea that there are revelations is like, oh yeah.

148
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I don't want anyone to know exactly what could happen, but it's not like one piece, right?

149
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,360
You know that the idea is that pirates are searching for treasure.

150
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Obviously, the end of the thing is going to be they find the treasure.

151
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:44,360
It's all of the things that happen in between that is like, are they going to make it through this obstacle on the way to their ultimate goal?

152
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Yeah, is this guy going to join the crew?

153
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Is that guy going to join the crew?

154
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Yeah, and it's like the journey is what's interesting and the ultimate goal of like, you know, will they find the treasure?

155
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
You know that there is a treasure that is not aimless.

156
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I think in Belle Jape, they're sort of aimless.

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,360
And so I should reveal some sort of a goal, but I don't want to show my hand as to all the lore that I've been building up.

158
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I don't want to have like a, I want to have it like come out in a sort of, I can't think of words.

159
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,360
This is why I'm a writer.

160
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:43,360
To be revealed at a pace where each, if you take the whole thing, each individual part of the lore, part of the story is not interesting necessarily all by itself.

161
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:52,360
But if you know everything, like if you know the big secrets, the smaller secrets aren't as interesting, but you want to start with the smaller secrets because they'll be like, oh, interesting.

162
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I didn't know that.

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,360
And then you like, and then it causes more questions.

164
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm really explaining this badly, but you know, you know,

165
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
You lost me a little bit.

166
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I mean, I get to start with the small stuff and build to the big reveals.

167
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
That makes sense.

168
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Start with the small stuff, build the big reveals.

169
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Nah, I honestly have lost myself.

170
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I don't know where I was going.

171
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,360
I was trying to relate to you as an artist.

172
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
I couldn't do it.

173
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Impossible.

174
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
I'm not a real artist.

175
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm just pretending.

176
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
All this art that I'm making, fake.

177
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
It's me.

178
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
It's mere artifice, actually.

179
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
You there?

180
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Yeah.

181
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
I don't know why I'm out of breath.

182
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Is it COVID?

183
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
No.

184
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
That's my first thought.

185
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
That's my first thought is it's COVID.

186
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I don't know.

187
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Maybe it's just the room is stuffy.

188
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm going to open a window.

189
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,360
It's cold, but like, it's not that cold.

190
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
It's the sun's shining.

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I'll be in a second.

192
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Sorry.

193
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Did I talk last week about my licorice experiments?

194
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
You did.

195
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Well, they've continued.

196
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,360
I continue, I continue to get a result that is either too,

197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
too soft and chewy, like an airhead,

198
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,360
or too stiff and almost like if you chill it in the fridge,

199
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,360
you can actually snap it into like a hard candy.

200
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,360
So I continue to, I think the missing ingredient might be

201
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
like palm oil or palm kernel oil.

202
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,360
I think that might be what lets it get so dense and chewy,

203
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
but not hard and crunchy.

204
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
So I might have to get, or maybe glycerin.

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
So I might have to get some of that and fuck around.

206
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm getting closer.

207
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I made one yesterday that was pretty close.

208
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
It was pretty close to a Twizzler.

209
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,360
It was just a little too firm and you kind of had to melt it

210
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
in your mouth for a minute before you could chew on it,

211
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
but it was like 85% there.

212
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
And that was pretty cool.

213
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
That was, that was pretty exciting.

214
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
I would like to make a licorice flavored one.

215
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm going to get some, some licorice extract.

216
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
And I got that, I got that the ammonium chloride.

217
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I got the salomonia, which apparently is used

218
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
in licorice flavoring sometimes.

219
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
I tried tasting it.

220
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I put a little bit on my finger and I tasted it

221
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
and it was a little bit painful.

222
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
It hurt my tongue a little bit.

223
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
So don't.

224
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
That's the right stuff.

225
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
It's like, that's, that's how you know.

226
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,360
It's got the, it really packs a punch.

227
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Yeah, it tastes, tastes weird, weirdly enough,

228
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,360
just putting a weird powder on my tongue tasted pretty bad

229
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
all by itself.

230
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,360
So, but you know, yeah, it's just a little surprising.

231
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,360
That's all I have to say about that.

232
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
It's fun.

233
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I like making various goose in the kitchen.

234
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Hell.

235
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
That is good.

236
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Hell fucking yeah.

237
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Sorry, it is, it is just sort of like stuffy in my room.

238
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
There's no oxygen here.

239
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Even though you open the window.

240
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Now don't worry everybody.

241
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
There is a carbon monoxide detector.

242
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,360
It would be going haywire and it cut, cut, cut to the thing

243
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
with no batteries are working.

244
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
It's not working.

245
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
That's, that's Chekhov's, that's Chekhov's.

246
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Chekhov's carbon monoxide detector.

247
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Chekhov's depleted batteries in the carbon monoxide detector.

248
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah.

249
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Okay.

250
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Chekhov's gun, Chekhov's bullet currently flying through the air.

251
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,360
I have, I have a horror story from this week to share with you.

252
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Do you want to hear the worst thing ever?

253
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
I don't know.

254
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
It sounds pretty bad.

255
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
You know how in, you know how in Beescapades, the beast hustler

256
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
occasionally learns baleful secrets.

257
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
That's what you're about to hear.

258
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Oh no.

259
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
No.

260
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Okay.

261
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
This is so fucked up.

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I can't believe, I can't believe I have to say this.

263
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I can't believe this is my life.

264
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:29,360
One of my roommates has seen my videos.

265
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
He like knows who I am.

266
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Oh dear.

267
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Yeah.

268
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
That's the price you pay for making a big Mega Man lecture.

269
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Yeah.

270
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,360
He came to my room the other day and he asked me if he could use my printer

271
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
and I was like, yeah, sure.

272
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,360
And he was wearing a Mega Man shirt and I was like, nice shirt.

273
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
And he was like, yeah, cool.

274
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,360
And then he said, he cosplayed as Mega Man at PAX East like last week

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
and I was like, lol.

276
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,360
And then he asked me about my like setup.

277
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,360
He asked me about my dual monitor setup and my tablet.

278
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
And he was like, are you an artist?

279
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
And I was like, yeah.

280
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
And then he asked me like, what do you do?

281
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
And I was like, oh, I make comics and I make YouTube videos sometimes.

282
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
And he was like, do you make like long form content?

283
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

284
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,360
And he was like, I think I might have seen your video.

285
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I was like, no, no.

286
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
So it was only like a, like he wasn't familiar enough with the video.

287
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Okay.

288
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,360
And you in it to know instantly that it was you.

289
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
He, yeah.

290
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
But he has seen it?

291
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
He didn't explicitly say he'd watch the video.

292
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I think he might have.

293
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm not sure, but he pulled it up YouTube and he showed me the thumbnail of the Mega Man video.

294
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
He was like, is that you?

295
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
I was like, yeah, that's me.

296
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,360
And he spat at you.

297
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
He slammed the door in your face.

298
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Okay.

299
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,360
So I was surprised by that, but I was more surprised by what happened next because he asked, you know,

300
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I was trying to print a document for him and he asked me like if I was making any new videos.

301
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,360
And I told him, like, yeah, I'm kind of working on, I want to do a battle network follow up,

302
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
but I have to play the games first.

303
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,360
So in the meantime, I thought I was going to do a history video about the history of this podcast I'm on.

304
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,360
And he was like, oh, you mean the, uh, the, uh, the procrastinators.

305
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,360
And I was like, I can't fucking believe you know what that is.

306
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
This is a nightmare.

307
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Wait, wait.

308
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Did they, how did he learn, did he learn about the Mega Man first and then the procrastinators?

309
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Or is it unrelated?

310
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I think so.

311
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,360
I think he might know that just because I mentioned the procrastinators in the Mega Man video,

312
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I think that might be why he knows what it, which is.

313
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
You do that right at the beginning, right?

314
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah.

315
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm surprised he would retain that information unless he was familiar with it.

316
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,360
But I mean, yeah, that's probably where he learned it from.

317
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,360
But like, I don't know, terrible, just, just terrible.

318
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
I don't know this guy.

319
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
This is a total stranger.

320
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I've been living with him for six months.

321
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
He knows my YouTube channel.

322
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
He knows about my podcast.

323
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
He's at the door right now listening.

324
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I'm going to, I'm going to die.

325
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I'm going, I'm going, I'm not going to make it.

326
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
This is it.

327
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
This is it.

328
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Some toast.

329
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
It's over.

330
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Do you think, I mean, what was the, what was the body language expression?

331
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Was he excited by this revelation that he was living with a YouTuber?

332
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Oh, he was ecstatic.

333
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
No.

334
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
I mean, he was, he was just surprised.

335
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,360
He was just kind of like, wow, I can't believe I've seen your videos.

336
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,360
And I was like, yeah, I can't believe you've seen that either.

337
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Oh, he asked me, he asked me if I made one about Kingdom Hearts.

338
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,360
And I was like, no, that was my brother, Lamal.

339
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,360
And he had, he had seen, he had seen the Animorphs one, but not the, um, oh no, he was, because

340
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,360
he'd seen the other lectures when he knew about the procrastinators because he'd seen

341
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
at least some of the other lectures.

342
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,360
He'd seen the Kingdom Hearts one and he'd seen not the Guilty Gear one, but he'd seen

343
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
the, the Animorphs one.

344
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
How fucked up?

345
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
How fucked up is that?

346
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,360
I mean, I, it's, it's not that fucked up.

347
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
No, shut up.

348
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
No, shut up.

349
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
It's fucked up.

350
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
It's so fucked up.

351
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,360
You put those lectures out to be seen by thousands and thousands of people.

352
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,360
No, I did not.

353
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,360
I didn't, I didn't ask for this.

354
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Do you think he's going to listen to the podcast now?

355
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Do you think, do you think he knows?

356
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
No.

357
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Or is he just not going to be that interested?

358
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,360
I, I sincerely, I mean, that's a big leap.

359
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,360
That, that's a big leap from, I've seen a couple of the posts you made on YouTube too.

360
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm going to become a regular listener of your podcast.

361
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,360
I, I would, I would sincerely doubt it.

362
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Unless he's like, what if, what if he feels like, unless he has like a morbid curiosity,

363
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
which would, yeah, he might have morbid curiosity.

364
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,360
I wonder if, I wonder if that Ben guy like shit talked me on the podcast that he does.

365
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Sam, go to hell.

366
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Don't listen to that.

367
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I hate you.

368
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
You shouldn't be hearing this right now.

369
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,360
This is a betrayal.

370
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
That guy's fine.

371
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,360
He's my, he's my, he's the, I would say of the current crop of roommates that he's the only one.

372
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,360
He's pretty much the only one that has not annoyed me at all.

373
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,360
None of my roommates are that bad or even particularly bad at all.

374
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,360
But you know, once in a while I'll have a little annoyance with one of them.

375
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,360
This is, this is the least he's the least annoying of a mostly not very annoying group.

376
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
So until now, until now.

377
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah.

378
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
This is the sin of watching your YouTube videos that you post publicly.

379
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Yeah.

380
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
That's terrible.

381
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,360
I really, I really resent that.

382
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Anyway, that was a nightmare.

383
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Yeah.

384
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
I know.

385
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
I can imagine.

386
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
It's over.

387
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,360
But like if somebody, if somebody knew, it's like the same feeling I get when I remember

388
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,360
that my mom follows my Twitter and I'm like, oh, mom.

389
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Does she follow big girl squish?

390
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
No, she has no idea.

391
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Okay.

392
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,360
That's, that's a lot of the reason why I don't do that stuff on my main.

393
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I see.

394
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
I see.

395
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Even though I do post like weird stuff on my main.

396
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
So it's still, I guess she reads it, but she doesn't use Twitter.

397
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Yeah.

398
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Just every so often.

399
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Yeah.

400
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,360
But still it's like, oh God, I know that's who I really am, but I don't want you to know.

401
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
About it.

402
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Yeah.

403
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Um, I remember, um, I remember like Nate said that like a kid at like his school like

404
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
knew about a best guy ever.

405
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,360
He got recognized by like a kid in a class with him or something.

406
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,360
And one time, uh, I remember when I was living in Georgia at a party, there was a guy who

407
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,360
came over to my house and he was just a friend of a friend who didn't had never met me.

408
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
And he was like, are you that son of a shoe guy?

409
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
And I was like, yeah, that's me.

410
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Uh, and now it's, it's happened again and he's my fucking roommate.

411
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,360
And he lives in my house.

412
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Terrible.

413
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Wait, what was the thing with a Nate in the classroom?

414
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I just, I feel like I remember that Nate said that he was going to like a college class

415
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,360
and a kid in the class with him like recognized him as best guy ever.

416
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Oh, so it's, hmm.

417
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Wonder when that would have been.

418
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I don't remember Nate talking about going to a college thing.

419
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
What?

420
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,360
I think he was still doing, or he, or he was like doing like, he was like finishing school.

421
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Oh, that's right.

422
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
He had some sort of school thing.

423
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,360
And yeah, he had to like complete his degree.

424
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Yeah.

425
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah.

426
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,360
That was must have been like five, would have been like five years ago, I think, four or

427
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
five years ago, maybe more.

428
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Crazy.

429
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Yeah.

430
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Um, so, you know, very strange, very, very strange.

431
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Oh shit.

432
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Speaking of, hang on, I need to check a number, but I think this year is my, my 10 year anniversary

433
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
of having posted videos on the internet.

434
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Uh-oh.

435
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,360
As Gibb and take as like the pony.

436
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Yeah.

437
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Yeah.

438
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
As the pony.

439
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
This December, 10 year anniversary of my first Gibb and take analysis video.

440
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
That's what it is.

441
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,360
So it'll be 10 years in December.

442
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Wait.

443
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Since I first made my analysis assemblage in fucking, I guess 2013.

444
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Hang on.

445
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Hang on.

446
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,360
My first TBAP in like 2014.

447
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,360
I don't, I mean, there was my little pony season three and then season four and you started

448
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
on season four.

449
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,360
And maybe you're thinking of that, but it would have been, yeah, I think I, my first

450
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
video was like December 13th.

451
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
So it was right at the end.

452
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
2013.

453
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Oh my God.

454
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
It was nine years ago.

455
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Wait, wait, wait.

456
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Okay.

457
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Wait.

458
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Oh no, it was the end of 2013.

459
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Yeah.

460
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Yeah.

461
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,360
The first, the first TBAP was, yeah, December 9th, 2013.

462
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Which means it's coming up on, on the 10 year anniversary of the horseshoe crew.

463
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Jesus fuck.

464
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Cause that wasn't that much longer.

465
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Yeah.

466
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Yeah.

467
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
You're right.

468
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
It would have been sometimes in the next year.

469
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh my God.

470
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Well, perfect time for a PCP retrospective by yours truly.

471
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Are you doing that?

472
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Are you doing like a lecture about that?

473
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
People have been saying you should do that.

474
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Oh, have I, have I not mentioned it on the, yeah, I said it in my Patreon podcast.

475
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,360
I, yeah, I think I'm probably going to do a lecture about the history of the PCP.

476
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah.

477
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
I think that's the plan.

478
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Are you going to try and keep it like bio-free, spite-free?

479
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Yeah.

480
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Okay.

481
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,360
I'm not going to, you know, like a historical.

482
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,660
It's, it's, you know, I can't, I can't say it's impossible to, to do anything completely

483
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,360
bias-free, but like, yeah, my goal will be to recount the history more or less factually.

484
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:31,360
You know, I might, I might let an opinion slip in here and there, but no, the goal, the

485
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,360
goal will be to like, if you don't know what the PCP is, here's, here's what it was and

486
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
what it is now and the, the story of how it happened.

487
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,060
You know, it's, it's, it's meant to be genuinely educational for someone who, because I mean,

488
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,860
a lot of people that have started following, there are a lot of people who have started

489
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,360
listening to the PCP, believe it or not, like post pony and then like post rad con.

490
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,360
There, there's people who still find it through like the Mega Man lecture, for instance.

491
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Yeah.

492
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,360
That's, and those people need to be brought up to speed.

493
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
They need to be brought to justice.

494
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,360
They need to be, they need to be stopped at any cost.

495
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Yeah.

496
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Uh, so, yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do.

497
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Uh, as soon as this freaking comic is done, as soon as this freaking periodical is published,

498
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,360
uh, that'll be my next, it'll be my next priority after the perfect comic party is.

499
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,360
I've got to, yeah.

500
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Uh, I mean, I want to get ahead on Clarissa chapter five just because it will take probably

501
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
a little longer.

502
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Well, I want to be, I want to give myself plenty of room to like fuck up a bit so that when

503
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,360
it's next month, we're not pushing it back.

504
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Yeah.

505
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Um, but yeah, I haven't done any of the other things like the, the contents page or whatever.

506
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Um, I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm working on my pages.

507
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,360
So, I mean, if you, if you've got time and you want to, you know, uh, do some like layout

508
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,360
stuff on some of those pages, you know, it would be, uh, helpful.

509
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,360
But, uh, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to keep getting my stuff done and, uh, and

510
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,360
then we'll, you know, we'll see what, what has yet to be finished when, when I'm through

511
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
with that.

512
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Uh, uh, we need, um, I don't know.

513
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
I don't know if you want to do anything fancy for like page layout.

514
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,360
We can, we can always, we can, we can, we can always get fancier later.

515
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
We can.

516
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm notoriously bad at choosing fonts.

517
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,360
I hate typefaces because there's so many of them.

518
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,360
I mean, I like them, but there's all, there's too many and I never know which one to pick.

519
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,360
And so I always end up using many different ones and it's just not, it's never cohesive.

520
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,360
And I'm like, uh, if only I knew about 7,000 different fonts that I could choose from, but

521
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I only know these ones.

522
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
We should use the defaults.

523
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Well, since we're, since this is a comic publication, we should use a font designed for comics.

524
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
The Garfield font.

525
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
I was going to say comic sans.

526
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Uh, there's the anime ace that comes with like Clip Studio.

527
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Yeah.

528
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
I mean.

529
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,360
And I think, I think that for like a letter from the editor, I feel like a pretty, like

530
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,360
a pretty normal freaking career.

531
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Honestly, courier.

532
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
No.

533
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Well, maybe, maybe, maybe bold courier.

534
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,360
I mean, I was just going for a letter from the editor.

535
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,360
I was going to say like fucking Times New Roman.

536
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Uh, is that boring?

537
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I mean, I'm sorry.

538
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Sorry.

539
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Sorry.

540
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
That's not quirky enough.

541
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,360
But like the, like a normal font with it is normal.

542
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Ariel's pretty normal.

543
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Times New Roman just, it feels, although it is a newspaper font, I guess it would fit.

544
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,360
I mean, for something like a letter from the editor, I feel like the font should be more

545
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
or less invisible.

546
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Uh, shouldn't, shouldn't draw attention to itself.

547
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
No.

548
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Yeah.

549
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Yeah.

550
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Um, maybe, maybe something like, uh, well, hang on.

551
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Well, hang on.

552
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Let me, let me, out.

553
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Are we gonna go font th Haven.

554
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
Yeah.

555
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Yeah.

556
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Yeah.

557
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Yeah.

558
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
We're doing this.

559
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
We're doing it.

560
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Um, all right.

561
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
What we got?

562
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,360
We got courier new de chavoux, uh, cracked Johnny.

563
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Oh, yeah.

564
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,360
That's a winner, uh, oh doc Champa.

565
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Oh, what the hell, uh, ethnocentric sounds good.

566
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,800
Fighting spirit. I've never even heard of any of these.

567
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Bonshrift is a good one.

568
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,160
Bonshrift.

569
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,360
No, Bonshrift, like German, B, A, H, N.

570
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Bonshrift. Yeah.

571
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,000
Pretty good. I use that, I think, for Clarissa Gunsmoke book.

572
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,200
Honestly, Calibri.

573
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,600
And that's all websites use that.

574
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,740
Wait, what's Calibri?

575
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,300
What's Calibri look like?

576
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,140
Oh, this is pretty normal.

577
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,300
Yeah, something like Calibri would be fine.

578
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Yeah.

579
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,980
I mean, you know, we can get we can get a little funky with

580
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,900
what about Karima, you know, Karima?

581
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
You'll know, you'll know what it is if I tell you.

582
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,940
Oh, the fucking.

583
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,780
The like Tim Burton kind of looking.

584
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,820
Wait, no, that's the death note.

585
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Is it?

586
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,280
No, Karima is the it's the font.

587
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,820
It's the prospect and derse like titles.

588
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,520
It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,280
Of course, I have that font block.

590
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,980
That one's pretty good.

591
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,520
We should use Karima.

592
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,820
Karima is a good, good meme, good meme.

593
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,320
Yeah, prospect, derse, who's who?

594
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
I think I'm Derse.

595
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,980
I mean, yeah, you got the color palette for it, I guess.

596
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,480
Yeah.

597
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
I always liked how

598
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,420
Prospect is not just the good characters on in Homestuck,

599
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,080
like risk is on Prospect.

600
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,120
Yeah, I mean.

601
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,220
Gamsie as well.

602
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,880
There's not.

603
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,580
There's not really any like real.

604
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,880
There doesn't seem to be any real logic to like who's a

605
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,820
Prospect dreamer and who's a derse dreamer.

606
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,020
I mean, with the humans, it kind of is just because it's like,

607
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,020
oh, look, the sweet, innocent.

608
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,720
Idiots and nerds are on Prospect

609
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,860
and the edgy, rebellious, like we don't give a fuck.

610
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
Kids are on Derse.

611
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,760
It might also be because like they're related, like like like

612
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,960
Dave and Rosa are siblings sort of.

613
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,860
So maybe it's maybe it's their bloodline.

614
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,620
Probably not.

615
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,220
Yeah, they would be together either way.

616
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,860
But like, yeah, I think that's the idea of like, oh, John,

617
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,920
because we learn about all these things from the humans,

618
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,860
John and stuff.

619
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,160
And they'd like, oh, John's a good boy, Jade's a good girl.

620
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,500
They're on fucking Prospect.

621
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,800
Therefore, the dark one is the other ones.

622
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,000
True.

623
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,300
Oh, yeah.

624
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,600
But then with the trolls, it's not it's not really like that.

625
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,000
The trolls, it seems kind of pretty random.

626
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,300
I mean, I mean, I wonder if you could read stuff into it.

627
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,700
I don't really know.

628
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,500
I mean, I never tried.

629
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,100
Vriska is a light player.

630
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,800
So wait, but Rose is a light player.

631
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,140
And she's and she's a dirt streamer, so never mind.

632
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,240
There's probably some sort of Tumblr theory somewhere.

633
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,700
Yeah, I'm sure the guy I'm sure I'm sure a blade kind eye wear

634
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,240
who wrote all the articles about type inversion

635
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,640
probably has a I'm sure I'm sure.

636
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,000
Dersen Prospect dreaming ties into it somewhere.

637
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Type inversion.

638
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,740
You mean like Karima.

639
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,600
Yeah, give.

640
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

641
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,540
Type inversion inverted to Cooper.

642
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,440
Let's see. All right.

643
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,840
Let's let's all right.

644
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,540
Karima, that's that's a winner.

645
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,940
Oh, Charlemagne.

646
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, yeah, Charlemagne STD.

647
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,140
And by STD, I mean standard.

648
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,440
Oh, ethnocentric again.

649
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,540
Why do I keep seeing that?

650
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,340
That's why do you have those?

651
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,840
I don't know.

652
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,640
I don't know.

653
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I didn't I didn't.

654
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,740
I must have downloaded a pack or something.

655
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,080
Silphane is my favorite like normal looking font.

656
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,640
I don't exactly know what's different.

657
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,480
It looks like Times New Roman, but it's not Times New Roman.

658
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,340
Franklin Gothic medium.

659
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,540
Oovani.

660
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,540
Oh, yeah, font script.

661
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,340
Be feel free to look up all these things we're saying at home

662
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,040
and be like, oh, yeah, I like that.

663
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Eleazar, Eleazar, throw up.

664
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,380
Eleazar, throw up images of all these fonts as we would cut a whimsy

665
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,380
Waverly, Vrinda, go, go, go.

666
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,980
No, no, no, no.

667
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
Oh, Hope Gold.

668
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
That's that's something I got from.

669
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,920
That's Homestuck.

670
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,380
No, well, yeah, it is a Homestuck looking.

671
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,720
I forget where I think I got it from like a pack of fonts from.

672
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,740
What's itch here?

673
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
Itch.io.

674
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
OK, I mean, whatever.

675
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,160
Fucking we don't really need to get we don't really need to get that weird with it.

676
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,660
You know, for like letter from the editor page, a patron, thank you page.

677
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,560
But now I'm thinking of like Prospect and Duris.

678
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,420
We should have our own Prospect and Duris and you're the Duris.

679
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,720
I am the Prospect.

680
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,260
And that's how we slice the editor page in half.

681
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,060
OK, sure.

682
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,420
Yeah, but yeah, let's just let's let's just do that for no reason.

683
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,920
Let's just do it.

684
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,360
What if there are two things and they had a line in the middle

685
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,160
and they were different just like that thing that remember those images

686
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,060
with the pony smiling and then angry on the other side.

687
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,560
Oh, sure.

688
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,220
I can be your angle or your devil.

689
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,660
Yes. Yeah.

690
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,020
That's that can only be done with two people.

691
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,260
True. We should lean into who is the angle?

692
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,160
Who is the devil?

693
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
We should lean into the fact that there's two of us.

694
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,460
That's like our that's like our bit.

695
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,760
That's like our thing.

696
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Yeah, what's what's our gimmick?

697
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,060
Well, there's two of them.

698
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,200
Maybe on the maybe on the submissions page.

699
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,800
Biblically, biblically accurate, give sorry.

700
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,700
So I was thinking angle and devil biblically accurate, give I.

701
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,800
OK, I'm thinking about submissions.

702
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,200
And I'm thinking how are we just going to have people like send an email?

703
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,100
I want I just I want people to have to like click a box or something.

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,760
Maybe maybe we'll have a form.

705
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,400
I think maybe we'll have like a form that you can fill out that's like

706
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,200
your name, the name of your submission.

707
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,960
I think I think I took some notes here.

708
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,800
I wrote down some crap.

709
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,460
Let me let me get my document.

710
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,400
I wrote down some notes make a specific email for it.

711
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,040
I think there should be a form and you should have to include this filled out

712
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,560
form with your submission.

713
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,200
And it would just be things like, you know, you you you agree that like,

714
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
you know, you own all the relevant copyrights to all the content you're

715
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,600
submitting, you know, you you grant us permission to feature your content on,

716
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,660
you know, digitally and archive it.

717
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,660
And this.

718
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,360
Let's see, sir.

719
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah, methods of contacting you just is is the is the work already

720
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,460
published on some other site, you know, include links to where it's published.

721
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,300
If so, is it based?

722
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,800
Is it cring check a box?

723
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,760
Check. Is it a dirt?

724
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,700
Is it a dirt streamer?

725
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,860
Is it a prospect dreamer?

726
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,260
And I think that's pretty much there is a prospect.

727
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,900
We'll have to come up with our own names for these stupid things.

728
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,400
I want this and.

729
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,100
Uh, poor, I can't think or bus.

730
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,460
I porpoise porpoise porpoise like a dolphin.

731
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,600
Yeah, I just think, you know, we should this.

732
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,800
This when you submit your thing, you should have to submit it along with a

733
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,800
thing that's like, you know, acknowledging I grant, you know, I affirm

734
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,640
that I am not stealing this content and it is mine to submit.

735
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,900
And I am I, the copyright holder, am granting you permission to feature

736
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,300
it in the thing and, uh, you know, it's not it's my fault.

737
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,340
If this turns out to be stolen, it's not your fault.

738
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,300
I assume all liabilities therein.

739
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:05,800
You know, uh, so we'll probably just have like a link to a page on the website

740
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,340
that has the form and it's like download the form, fill it out, send us an

741
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:15,340
email with the form attached, set the, the, the, the, the email, uh, we'll

742
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,100
have a certain include a certain something in the subject line that's

743
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,100
like perfect comic party submission, name of submission.

744
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,140
And that's, and that'll be how you submit.

745
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,900
I feel like that's probably the easiest way to do it.

746
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,300
Um, sure.

747
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,400
I think it's like a Google forms thing.

748
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, they can like automate that instead of having them download an image, you

749
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:42,700
know, yeah, there probably is like cheesy uses Google forms to like do pre-orders.

750
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,400
Yeah, I think that would be, yeah, that's probably making it a lot easier

751
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,700
for the, for everyone.

752
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,700
Yeah, I've never, I've never used that, but you're right.

753
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,800
That probably would be easier.

754
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That's probably easier.

755
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,400
Okay.

756
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,100
Well, maybe we'll do it.

757
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,100
Maybe we'll do it like that.

758
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,500
Um, but, you know, we'll have a page being like submit your comic.

759
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,900
Maybe we'll feature it in the next issue.

760
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,400
Um, and that's pretty, and that's pretty much it.

761
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,600
And then maybe in the second issue onward, we will have another page for

762
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,500
like, you know, reader response where like readers can like write us a letter

763
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,100
or something or write us an email or maybe even just like add us on Twitter

764
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:24,200
or something and we'll, we respond to those feature of Q and a page or something.

765
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,500
And that'll be, but that's, we don't have those for the first one.

766
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,300
Oh, and like a link to like on the thank you page be like, you know,

767
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,000
support us on cofire, patreon and get your name featured.

768
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,900
And yeah, yeah.

769
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,700
What if, what if all the submissions are bad?

770
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,000
What if everything sucks?

771
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Then we put a red man comic in its place.

772
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,100
Yeah.

773
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Okay.

774
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,300
Okay.

775
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,100
Yeah.

776
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,500
If there's no, we're not like guaranteeing people be on the comic.

777
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,300
We are just sort of like, we are publishers now.

778
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,500
Yeah.

779
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,200
You must be good enough or we will smite you down.

780
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:07,900
Yeah.

781
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,600
But that's not like a nice thing to say.

782
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,800
So we'll say, no, no, no, no, no, this is good.

783
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,300
This is good.

784
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,500
We should include that as a clause in the form like check the box.

785
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,300
You will be smote if your stuff is not, it's not good.

786
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,900
Uh, you know.

787
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,400
I like the idea of encouraging people to draw if they haven't tried to draw

788
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,200
like a comic before and they just want to start and it's like a good thing to

789
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,700
like a good reason to try.

790
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,300
Yeah.

791
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:37,500
Um, but yeah, the, I don't know, there will be, there will be possibility

792
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,500
of destruction that comes with that.

793
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,700
I, I, you know, I don't, I don't require that everything be like drawn by a,

794
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,600
you know, a professional draftsman.

795
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,500
I don't, I don't require like everything be executed at the highest level.

796
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,400
No.

797
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,700
But I'd only feature something if I thought it was good and had some quality

798
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,100
to it, some kind of hook to it, something to latch onto to be like, oh,

799
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
this is a good comic.

800
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,700
It has such and such going for it.

801
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,100
And if the, and if the submissions don't meet a certain level of that,

802
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,600
then, uh, we just won't feature any stuff and it'll just be you and me.

803
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,800
Yeah.

804
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,900
And that's, and that's okay.

805
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
We can have a thing as well.

806
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,100
If we disagree on a submission, you don't like it.

807
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,500
I do.

808
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,400
Or the other way around, uh, we can have it as like a Gibb pick or a Ben pick.

809
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,900
Sure.

810
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:35,600
So, so that the other is not, um, not, yeah, not liable, not, no, no blame.

811
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,200
Okay.

812
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,300
It's like Gibb endorses this, this comic.

813
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,600
Ben withholds his endorsements.

814
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,100
Well, I think, well, I think we should.

815
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm thinking maybe like, maybe like once a month, like after, if we get, if we get

816
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,200
into like a monthly release schedule, maybe once a month, like the PCP of that

817
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,900
week is like, it's the perfect comic party episode of the procrastinators

818
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,600
podcast where we talk about the content.

819
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,700
So wait, PCP episode, something PCP episode one.

820
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,300
That's right.

821
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,200
Correct.

822
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,000
It's, it's, it's the PCP.

823
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:17,600
PCP.

824
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,000
It's the PCP.

825
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,700
PCP.

826
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,300
PCP PCP.

827
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,900
It's the perfect comic party procrastinators podcast.

828
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,500
One.

829
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,900
So PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP.

830
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:40,100
It's, it's, it's PC, it'll be PCP three, five, six, PCP one.

831
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,200
Perfect.

832
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Perfect procrastinators podcast episode three, fifty six, perfect comic party episode

833
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,500
one and I'll be the subject line and and and like cowboys or something.

834
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:50,800
You know.

835
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:51,800
Yeah.

836
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,600
I like the idea of it being like episode one of a different podcast

837
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:10,200
called the PCP, PCP, PCP is not PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP episode one.

838
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:17,800
And then in small writing like procrastinated podcast episode number just so just so people know the number like

839
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:24,720
It's a different show. It's exactly the same show and it looks like that's the same show, but it's about a comic

840
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,840
Right, I mean a naming convention is fucked. It's funny. I mean it's still a podcast

841
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:38,160
It's just on this episode of the podcast. We will be discussing the comic the the the cut the comic. That's that's my idea

842
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,880
And then I thought I don't know if we if we feature certain artists, maybe we

843
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,200
We might have some of them as guests and like talk about their submissions. Maybe I don't know

844
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,880
If they're if you'll be a more of a themed episode. Yeah, and that's good. Yeah. Yeah

845
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,040
Well, but but but you know good good good comics only please good comics only, okay

846
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,480
It's an amateur amateur hour. It's an amateur hour. All right. This is serious business

847
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,920
You the the viewer listener will do not know what good comics means. So just submit anyway, and then

848
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,160
You know find out fuck around and find out. Yeah, please. Yeah, please. That's the that's how you do life. You'll know

849
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,640
You'll you'll know

850
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,680
You will find out. Yeah, that's good. I yeah, you're encouraged to fuck around

851
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Okay, well, I I

852
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,840
Don't know if I can get all of Biscopades done this week, but maybe and probably by next week

853
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
I feel like I can crank out another

854
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,600
12 pages

855
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:55,400
12 pages. I mean, I mean, like you said, I guess it's not that hard to draw. It's it's mostly um

856
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,840
Yeah, just thinking about stuff

857
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,320
The it's fucking around with the layouts and

858
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,200
And uh, just like

859
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,640
Getting it on to like a page because I'm still kind of figuring out like how to arrange it in page format

860
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,120
I kind of miss the gifs. I actually really miss the animated gifs

861
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,200
Uh, there's like a bunch of panels so far that I'm like, I wish I could just animate this

862
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,160
Hmm

863
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,440
Do you think you would make it gif version for your website?

864
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,960
Yeah, yeah, some parts some parts I I might go back and gifify them

865
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
Do you think all right, here's a

866
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,000
Suggestion because I know how it feels to have to go back to something and you never get around to it

867
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,960
Do you think it would be better to make the gif version?

868
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,240
While you're making it so that you're you know, the idea of how the motion goes

869
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,560
Then exists and can be put on your site whenever

870
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,600
And then you just take a still from it to put in the the the perfect comic party because

871
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
When I feel like oh

872
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah, I'll do that later for lots of things but in it definitely with comics

873
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,680
And stories writing lore and stuff. I'm like, yeah, I'll like I'll elaborate on that later

874
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,160
I'll I'll do that later and then I come back to and I'm like, I don't really remember what I was thinking

875
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah, oh no, I can't make it now. It's gone. You know

876
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,000
Maybe you're right

877
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,200
But I kind of thought of that and I thought yeah, I sort of wish I could animate it

878
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,760
But like if I just have to accept well, I can't

879
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,480
So I'll just do it

880
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,880
in a in a static image and just just make it the best static image I can

881
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,280
and

882
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,000
Part of me is like I'll come back. I should come back and animate this later

883
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:48,120
But on the other maybe I should just resist that urge and just accept that like, you know what this this is a comic of static images now

884
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,000
So I'll just draw it as static images

885
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,440
And I can I can I can tell myself. Oh, I'll come back and animate it later as cope

886
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,000
But it's maybe it's better to just accept that like

887
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,640
This this is the form it's in now, but the the gifts were good. They were they were good

888
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,920
Some of them were good

889
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,440
yeah

890
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,440
I know but like

891
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Is it worth is it worth

892
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,160
the stress of having to be like

893
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,520
Keep it in my head. I must come back to this and I must

894
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,880
Well, that's why I'm suggesting. Yeah, like take a little longer with it and then maybe make less pages, but then get the gifts ready

895
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
There are

896
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,520
I think people would appreciate the gifts

897
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,280
If and and would be happy if you took the time to make them

898
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
I mean I would I mean

899
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,360
uh

900
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,560
I don't know because it's like the people that are the people that read it in the perfect comic party are not

901
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,280
Going to then need to go to my website and read it on my website where they'll see the gifts. They'll they'll have already read it

902
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,720
So who is it for?

903
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,720
um, well, it's

904
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,400
I mean, okay. Here here's how it is, right? Bale jpe has gifts

905
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,240
Yeah, if I make a physical print version of bale jpe, which I probably will do at some point

906
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,840
um, well, it's I'll definitely do at some point because right now I can put it on amazon. There's no hassle, but

907
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,320
um

908
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,880
It's going to be static. I'm gonna have to un-giftify all these things. Yeah, and so

909
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,400
The reading experience is going to be different reading it physically than it is on the internet

910
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,520
uh for

911
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,720
so

912
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
There will be a reason to go to your website

913
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,080
Even though they have the perfect comic party because it's a different experience. It's it's an it's an additional

914
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,960
layer to the images that they can't get on the pdf. I

915
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
I I I get what you're saying

916
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,040
I just

917
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
That it's I get that

918
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
Are you

919
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:06,760
Okay, what's your angle here is your angle that the comic is just better with gifts because I don't disagree. I like the gifts

920
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,760
uh, I I mean, I think the

921
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,040
Uh for the for the fact that it needs to be

922
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,960
Uh, you know a singular document and you can't put gifts into a pdf

923
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,080
Then it's just like an unfortunate reality. If you could put gifts in a pdf

924
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,880
I would say make gifts and put them in the pdf. Yeah

925
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,520
Um, you can't print a gif obviously

926
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
And those are like limitations. I don't think

927
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,920
The biscuit page needs to now be limited because of one publication when the original

928
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,320
You know how as you would making it

929
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,760
Is so cool with the gifts. I don't think it needs to I don't think you need to like

930
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,640
To alter it permanently. I don't know. That's what I'm saying

931
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:00,040
I don't know. I I kind of think that like if I'm if I'm publishing biscuit page in the perfect comic party as a pdf

932
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,120
I should make it for that

933
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,360
format

934
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,360
I

935
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:11,880
Kind of feel like yeah, some of these images might look nice with a little bit of animation

936
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
But

937
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,720
It sort of feels like

938
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,640
It's putting effort in someplace that there's like little return

939
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,920
I can appreciate that I can I can appreciate

940
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,320
that like

941
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,320
It's more work, but like

942
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,120
I don't know

943
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,120
A lot of things are a lot of work

944
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,760
Phantom's revenge was a huge amount of work and that's really cool

945
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,800
Yes, but you can't put that but you can't put that video game in the book

946
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,280
I know but it wasn't made

947
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,160
Well, I I tried to translate it as best as I could to the book

948
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,760
But it wasn't made for a book. It was made as a game

949
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,600
But if biscuit page is made for a pdf

950
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,120
Then it's made for a pdf

951
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,960
and and

952
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,520
Maybe and I and I feel like the thing to do

953
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,400
Is to be like well, this is now a comic of static images. I'll make it out of static images

954
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,840
I

955
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,120
and

956
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,640
If I'm doing if I were to do the thing where I okay, I'll make static images for the thing

957
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,920
But then I'll make I'll gifify them for the website. It's like I'm making two

958
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,280
Different comic. I mean, that's not entirely true

959
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,360
I just feel like why re why make it twice

960
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,000
Uh, if I can just make it once and put it in one place so people can just read it there

961
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,120
I'm otherwise I'm like splitting the audience

962
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah, sort of

963
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,600
I don't think yeah, that was the thing

964
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,760
I don't think you're splitting the audience because people who read it in static form

965
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,280
Will be encouraged to go to your site to see it animated. Here's

966
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,840
I

967
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,520
I think

968
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,600
Most people are only going to want to read it once. I don't think most people

969
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,800
Who are going to read it on the thing are going to be like, oh, let me go see how it looks animated

970
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,800
I think they're going to read it once and and so I feel like it should just it should be in one one place

971
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,800
Uh, so in other words like go here. This is where to read it

972
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,560
I don't know. Um, it's

973
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,200
I mean commenters, let me know what you think

974
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,920
There are

975
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,920
Yeah, there are there there's a there's a there's a one particular there's one or two

976
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,640
Okay, in the old

977
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,160
Chapters of Beescapades, uh seeing the like the the shopkeepers behind their desk with a little like bobbling animation

978
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,160
I thought that was nice. I thought that was cute

979
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,840
Uh, and there's there's a couple of scenes in the new ones where things are like sparkling

980
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,520
And a little like and a little like shimmering sparkling animation. I think would have added a lot to it

981
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:54,440
But it can live it can I mean it it it it doesn't like ruin it that it doesn't have those things

982
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,200
And I guess it doesn't ruin it

983
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,560
But I still I'm gonna I'm gonna champion gififying or or making gifts first

984
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,840
And then static making you know making a taking a screenshot whatever

985
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
single frame because um, but

986
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,080
Yeah, I mean, you know my opinion now. Yeah, I mean, yeah

987
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,160
When you talk about like there's one place to go to see the thing

988
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,800
I was always thinking about

989
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,080
My comic in terms of like it it can like it'll be on my website for free

990
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,200
So therefore there's no reason it can't be on every comic hosting site. There is I just haven't gone around to all that

991
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:40,440
but um the idea is to get as many eyeballs in many different places as possible to read it wherever they are

992
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:46,200
so that then I can funnel them towards maybe being interested in buying the volume or

993
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,680
You know following my social media so they can keep track of new ones

994
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,600
And so it's like I think I see what you're getting at large large web and then all follow coming towards me

995
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:04,120
So that then I can say hey, did you like that comic you read on all those different websites or like one of many different websites?

996
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,840
You can buy it now and then more customers potentially you're saying

997
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:16,360
That even if I even if it's in the pcp in a non-gift form if I have it in gift form on my website

998
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,920
some people

999
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,120
Might check it out on my website as well. And that's a way to funnel an audience from

1000
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,080
To my other stuff because they'll be yeah website. I mean that's that

1001
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,960
That's true. That's it's not it's not it's not about like as well

1002
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,560
It's like some people will only find it from your website because they'll go to your website from watching a youtube video

1003
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,400
And they won't go to the pcp potentially and they won't find the perfect comic party

1004
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,440
Like there's there's no reason for it to be all over the place

1005
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,320
if it's online for free anyway, I

1006
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,400
I don't think a substantial amount of people are going to discover Biscopades through my website. I just I just don't think that's gonna happen

1007
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh, how do the people discover your website like?

1008
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,560
Through they they they find my website through my twitter or my youtube channel

1009
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
Nobody finds me through my website

1010
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,160
No, no, no what I mean is

1011
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,040
Uh, they'll follow they'll see you make a man lecture. They'll see you do stuff. They'll go to your website

1012
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,440
instead of

1013
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,440
Going to the podcast

1014
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
so if

1015
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,920
I mean if you're gonna post it on your website anyway in non-gift form that would be fine, I guess

1016
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,880
I just like the gifts

1017
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,320
you know

1018
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,320
I think

1019
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,760
Maybe if I you know, uh, maybe if I just

1020
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,600
Rain it in a little bit and just do very specific

1021
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,080
gifts

1022
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,080
for very very particular scenes

1023
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,440
Just just in moments when I think it's like most appropriate just it would just take just one every here in there

1024
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
uh

1025
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,800
I mean when I used to post it on twitter

1026
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,520
There was the limitation that I couldn't I would normally post it in like four image

1027
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,040
Sets because a twitter lets you post four images at a time

1028
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,080
But I couldn't post four gifts at a time if I had a gift I could only post one gift at a time

1029
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:17,560
So it was kind of limited in that way. So already like most of the images were not gifts. Most of them were were pngs

1030
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,040
um

1031
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,520
Yeah, there's I'm thinking of one or two panels that I'm like that that could be

1032
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,760
That could be a gift

1033
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,960
uh, so

1034
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,720
Yeah, I don't know maybe

1035
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,720
I just um

1036
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,520
You know, I really like to not

1037
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Create work for myself

1038
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,160
True. No, I'm only saying I'm only uh sort of pressuring you because it's because you seem like you like the gifts

1039
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,240
You wanted to keep them. I do

1040
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,640
like them

1041
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,640
I think I was a little bit

1042
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,120
I think the I mean it was kind of part of the format of

1043
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,680
Biscopades the first time

1044
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,200
Is like

1045
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:05,240
It's sort of made to be that I can like simply like make these somewhat simple assets

1046
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,080
And put them together into an image and and animate them lightly

1047
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,720
And that was kind of like the mission statement of Biscopades, although I don't know it's not like key to the story or anything

1048
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,720
It was just a format thing

1049
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,000
uh, you know if Biscopades is

1050
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
on the

1051
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:29,560
In a pdf form then, you know, it just has to it has to lose that aspect and

1052
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,120
That's mostly okay

1053
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,840
Yeah, there's trade-offs. There's trade-offs that come with it and those trade-offs could be

1054
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,560
mitigated with extra effort of making of gififying them for my website

1055
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,840
I mean, there's some

1056
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
audio elements to it that

1057
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,240
Are

1058
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,960
Going to have to be on the website and will not be able to be heard in pdf form

1059
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
obviously

1060
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:06,440
So like the jungle beats like the jungle beats. I mean I'm talking about the song of longing you remember the song of longing

1061
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,920
I actually haven't reread Biscopades in a while. Well, there's um

1062
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,120
There's a song that he attempts to sing and he fails

1063
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,280
But that's cute. Yeah

1064
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,640
Uh, so that'll that'll come back at some point

1065
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,080
Uh, so yeah, that's that's that's that's not gonna be that's not pdf friendly

1066
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,320
Um, you know our art

1067
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,040
Is so hard and it's impossible actually

1068
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,040
I might as well not do any you simply can't you simply you simply can never fully

1069
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:50,920
Actualize any artistic vision you will ever have in your entire life. You'll maybe your entire life will be lead

1070
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,200
Giving into a series of trade-offs and compromises

1071
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
True true

1072
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,840
Negotiating

1073
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,400
How much of this is is reasonable to actually do and is it still worth doing if that's all I can make happen

1074
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,200
And you just gotta and you just gotta make those choices you make those hard choices sometimes

1075
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Uh, and that's what I'm freaking doing

1076
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,000
Uh

1077
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,200
Life's hard

1078
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:29,080
I feel real busy these days. I'm drawing and I'm and I'm streaming and like I'm lifting and like every fucking day

1079
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,360
I've got

1080
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,200
Shit to do

1081
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,720
That's good though

1082
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:38,600
Better than having nothing going on. I mean it's kind. Yeah, it is better than having nothing going on but

1083
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,520
I kind of sometimes I wish

1084
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,720
I just want to sleep. I just want to stay in bed all day

1085
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
You're allowed days like that

1086
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,720
but it's it is good to be busy with stuff because then

1087
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,960
uh

1088
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,520
I don't know the mind likes to be occupied. Yeah, it's true

1089
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,520
It's true, but then I'm always like

1090
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,240
Every day I'm always like I could be doing one thing. Do you have the days off?

1091
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,960
I I purposefully do not work on a weekend

1092
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,880
I do not allow myself to do work on a weekend and that's very that's allowed me to be like

1093
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,080
Pretty fine with with all the amount of stuff I do

1094
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,960
I mean, I mean lifting is not like an all-day activity. So I mean

1095
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,920
the well

1096
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,080
I mean, I don't have really have any days. I don't have designated days off

1097
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
I have days where I have no

1098
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,520
Particular responsibility and those are just the days that I'm supposed to draw on

1099
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,880
uh

1100
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,680
I I don't have designated

1101
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,800
I don't have designated we've talked about this before you give yourself designated days off. I

1102
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,840
just

1103
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,680
feed

1104
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,760
Feel like I should be drawing whenever I have anything else that I shouldn't that I don't have to do

1105
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:06,440
I know but that that's entirely the problem because it's not designated you could feel that stress at all times

1106
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,400
You're maximizing stress potential. It's no it's not it's obviously

1107
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,880
Bad for for for burnout and stuff

1108
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,520
Oh god

1109
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,200
Um, yeah, you should have you should have a day and just say that's my self-care day

1110
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,200
And I'm just gonna do whatever I want

1111
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,720
But no work, I guess because you might want to work

1112
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,360
I mean

1113
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,920
You should resist the urge

1114
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,160
genuinely

1115
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,480
Do you find that resisting the urge to work on your day off

1116
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,000
Increases your motivation to get your work done on your day's on

1117
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,960
well, I think

1118
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,040
now that I'm into the in the

1119
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,320
I'm used to it. So it's like it's not even a question

1120
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:04,040
It's not like I wanted work, but like early on it was like, but I could get work done

1121
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:10,520
Uh, you know, I feel that stress that anxiety about like I'm supposed to be enjoying myself and relaxing

1122
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,800
But like this is a whole day. I could be doing something

1123
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,120
And that sort of goes away after a while after a routine is set

1124
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,240
Um, I mean and yeah, it does I as to answer your question. It does help

1125
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,640
I mean, I definitely I definitely waste days. I'm I don't work every day

1126
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,960
There are definitely days that I don't do any work, but they're not days that are designated to not work

1127
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,440
They're days when I think I could work today and maybe I will but then I just never do it

1128
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,360
Yeah, I think that having a day where you're not allowed to work

1129
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
goes a long way to making

1130
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,280
Waking up on a Monday and being like, all right, let's get some stuff done that that that's so much easier for me now

1131
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,160
than it used to be

1132
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:56,360
Even though sometimes I still just have like a I can't fucking think of anything and it's just nothing nothing happens

1133
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:02,520
It's still easier to wake up and be like, all right, let's have some breakfast. Let's get a coffee. Let's go

1134
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,840
Let's do something I get a little bit done. Even if it's not a lot

1135
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,840
It's it's always like possible to for that to happen. Well, I mean

1136
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,400
um

1137
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,920
I don't I mean, okay. I guess uh, I guess to be like

1138
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,440
I mean, I guess I'm like my Saturdays. I don't really have I mean I I lift on Saturdays, but other than that

1139
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
I don't like do anything

1140
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,080
Uh, there's nothing like I don't know

1141
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,120
I I have I have no particular thing that I like want to be doing on my day off

1142
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,080
uh

1143
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,080
Other than just like fuck around

1144
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,480
Just just waste time

1145
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:46,360
Fuck around play a video game play. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing like you can have

1146
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,680
If you get like obsessed with a game like noita if you have your designated no work day

1147
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,320
It'll be like, well, I know what to do today. I want to play that game. So I'm gonna play the game all day

1148
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:03,720
Hmm. Yeah, so it's like easier to like slot that activity into that time slot

1149
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,920
And then the work into the work time slot so that you're not

1150
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,560
thinking about doing two things

1151
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,960
For the rest of the week. I've been um

1152
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,920
I've been playing a rain world if you played rain world

1153
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,280
Is that the one where you're like a little liquefied rabbit?

1154
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,480
A slug cat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1155
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:26,440
I haven't played it, but I seen the clips it looks it's very tough. I think

1156
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,480
Yeah, it's pretty tough

1157
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,760
And it's very like it doesn't tell you what

1158
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,680
You need to do you you have to like figure out stuff through experimentation

1159
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,120
And the world is very much like kind of doing its own thing

1160
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:47,400
Regardless of what you do like there's an ecosystem of all these creatures and the creatures just go around hunting on their own

1161
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,080
And some of them will hunt you and some of them will ignore you and and just hunt each other and stuff

1162
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:00,120
Uh, I'm about like three or four hours into it now and I feel like that's not long enough to have really like figured it out

1163
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,920
um

1164
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,920
I'm getting a little bored of it

1165
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,280
uh

1166
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:10,200
Everyone tells me it's really good and really deep and stuff

1167
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,160
And I feel like maybe I'm just bad, but I'm starting to get bored because

1168
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,120
I think every every I'm just like wake up go out

1169
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,560
Hunt around

1170
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,520
Oh, there are animals avoid them eat food

1171
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,800
Maybe I'll maybe I'll get killed and then it's like okay. Well, I didn't make any progress

1172
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:38,280
Maybe I'll find a door that I can get through and then it's like okay. Here's a here's another ruined area

1173
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:45,080
Oh, okay. I'll find a new place to sleep. Oh that now that's my nest now. Okay, cool and then repeat and

1174
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,800
I don't know. I have I have yet to feel I've I've found new areas

1175
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,640
I have yet to feel like I've made any significant progress

1176
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,560
of any kind other than moving to different places

1177
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,480
And that's not a good feeling and I don't like it and I get that the game is like not holding my hand

1178
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,200
but I

1179
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:13,080
I'm I'm really I'm really hungry. I'm really needing the game to give me some glimmer of like what am I doing here

1180
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,280
What's the point? I get that I'm hunting my buddy or my brother or whatever he is

1181
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,320
uh

1182
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,480
Just feels like

1183
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,040
No progress has been made

1184
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,120
And I don't like that

1185
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:33,400
Uh, I'm more like lame world. I'm getting a little fed up. I I want I don't want to write it off

1186
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,680
I want to keep giving it a chance because I really like a lot of stuff about it

1187
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,480
It's just not giving me anything

1188
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,360
Uh, but maybe I need to keep at it a little longer

1189
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,880
I'm sure I think I feel like

1190
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,080
Tio is always in my stream asking me how's you played rain world you're playing rain world. He's gonna be so mad

1191
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,560
He's gonna be so mad that I said I said this

1192
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,520
Um

1193
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
I'm not I'm not gonna give up

1194
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,920
I'm not gonna give up

1195
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,240
You're not gonna give up just like I did with inscription

1196
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,840
Ah, it's so good. You were you were getting there. There's there's secrets

1197
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,440
The secrets give you don't even know you understand. Are they baleful then?

1198
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,400
Um, yeah, some of them are a little bit. Yeah, some are a little bit baleful. Um

1199
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
Are they bale shape?

1200
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
They are not

1201
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,520
I'm sorry. Oh

1202
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,240
Uh, yeah, they should have been. Um

1203
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:39,640
I try I tried to play noida the other day and then I realized I have a save file going where I have like an all-powerful god build

1204
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,040
Made I have a wand

1205
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:48,200
That simultaneously teleports me and for one frame creates a giant black hole

1206
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,920
Where I teleport to and then deletes the black hole before I can do anything

1207
01:08:53,320 --> 01:09:00,440
So the wand like rapid fire machine gun shoots out teleport spells that travel instantaneously

1208
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,440
Create a black and so they it deletes any matter that's in front of me

1209
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,080
So I can just travel in a straight line through anything through like a mountain

1210
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,960
Just dig right through it and like it like it's not even there

1211
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,680
Uh, it's pretty funny

1212
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:21,800
It's it's pretty cool. But uh, you know, I'm at that point and I'm like, well, I pretty much built the ultimate wand

1213
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,240
Uh, I could just go win the game. I guess but

1214
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,320
But it'd be such a shame to end the save file when I'm so powerful

1215
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,880
So I like booted the game up and then I remembered. Oh wait, I have like a god mode run going

1216
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,720
Ah, never mind games boring games sucks. Don't want to play it

1217
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:45,480
Played rain world instead was like, ah cool game. But what am I doing here exactly gave up on it? Stop playing it

1218
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,160
Uh

1219
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:51,320
You know, there's just nothing good in the world on on earth. Yeah

1220
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,800
Video games are the worst thing

1221
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,280
That anyone ever thought of what if you went outside?

1222
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,240
That don't even get me started on going outside. You think video games are bad

1223
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,640
Don't even freaking talk about that. Uh, Jesus

1224
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,920
There's so much to be found in nature. There are birds and rocks

1225
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,200
Who cares who cares genuine genuinely who cares? Um, who gives a fuck me?

1226
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,560
Stupid annoying. I like I like the nature. I like seeing

1227
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,920
The sunshine dance upon the leaves

1228
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:30,600
I'm shaking my head in shame in shame and bemusement and confusion. I

1229
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:38,680
We're just not gonna we're just not gonna agree on this one. We're not gonna make it

1230
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
We're not we're in gmi

1231
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,360
No, I hate outside

1232
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,320
There's COVID out there

1233
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,320
There is COVID out there

1234
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,760
I'm surprised I haven't gotten COVID again. Well, actually, I'm not that surprised. The only place I would get it would be on the bus

1235
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:03,160
Uh, but I haven't gotten it. So that's pretty good. I thought I was getting sick the other day

1236
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,840
But I it was fine. Didn't didn't come down with anything

1237
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,720
I um, I'm expecting a sickness

1238
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,320
People were coughing my dad was coughing and he's like, oh, yeah, there's this thing going around and I hadn't gotten anything yet

1239
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,640
So I'm like, fuck. I'm the last one who's gonna get it

1240
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,840
Oh, well, it's not COVID. I probably not nobody's having a problem

1241
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,480
Yeah

1242
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:32,360
Cases are really cases are quite low in my area right now. So I seem like like I'm pretty unlikely to get it

1243
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,160
soon

1244
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Even in the worst case scenario

1245
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,320
So that's nice, I guess

1246
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,520
Um, well then if you don't like video games if you don't like the outside, what about anime?

1247
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,480
Uh

1248
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,720
What about it, uh

1249
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,720
Uh, what do you want to watch some?

1250
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,040
No

1251
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,800
Why do you is there one in particular your no, well, I um

1252
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,120
Somebody asked me

1253
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,440
I think it was prince isolation and on my stream

1254
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,360
Asked me what my favorite anime was and it seemed like just a genuine question

1255
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:17,800
Uh, yeah, and I'm like I I couldn't answer immediately. So I went today

1256
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,760
I tried to figure out all the animes that I've seen

1257
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,520
Uh, all of or most of which is not that many

1258
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:30,600
And I put them in a tournament bracket and I tried to figure out who is the best of my favorites is animes

1259
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,480
Which is my favorite anime here's an image of the tournament. Yeah, I was gonna say show me

1260
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,560
I mean

1261
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,880
Monster, okay

1262
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,160
So what's your thoughts on these these choices?

1263
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,760
Uh, there's a there's a bunch here. I haven't seen

1264
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,920
I have not seen monster. I have seen a little bit of inferno cop

1265
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,800
I've never seen onigai teacher never seen revolutionary girl utina never seen bleach

1266
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:03,240
Never never even heard of wait kenpu denki berserk. What is that? Is that like berserk?

1267
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,560
That's the berserk from the 90s. It means like the

1268
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,080
The the you know the golden age arc or whatever

1269
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,520
Because the the the the more recent one is just called berserk and it's the one that sucks

1270
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:21,400
I have not seen oh the 3d one. Yeah, 3d one. I guess there's another one as well. I don't I don't know what that's called

1271
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,800
Never seen hands off isa can never seen sungatsu no lion

1272
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:32,280
Sungatsu no lion is so good. You would like it because the guy is uh, uh, he's got glasses and he's sad

1273
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,080
That's all I need. That's all I need

1274
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,840
Uh, never seen I've seen some of the melakara of hara hara isusami

1275
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,560
I've never seen gun demore in the pocket pocket. I've seen all of

1276
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
I've seen all of uh

1277
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,760
The rest I think you've seen space runaway idiom

1278
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,720
There's a few in the second round that weren't in the first round. Oh

1279
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,520
Death note space

1280
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
runaway idiom

1281
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,840
Gorin lagann and lucky star

1282
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,120
No, I've never seen space runaway idiom

1283
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,960
I think I've seen all the all the rest um

1284
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,480
so

1285
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,200
Did you so

1286
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,880
Am I reading this right? Did you say that sungatsu no lion is your favorite anime?

1287
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,880
Uh, no berserk is my favorite sungatsu is very good and it's second place

1288
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:33,000
And then in the bronze the third third the best is kari kano the the romance one

1289
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,800
Kari kano is really good and it's so

1290
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:41,240
Doesn't it just end like it doesn't have an ending right? Yeah, it just sort of ends. I think the manga

1291
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,000
Goes on a bit longer, but it's sort of also it just ends

1292
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,720
Can't remember if I read all of it

1293
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,960
Have you you have not seen um

1294
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,080
Samurai shampoo. No, that's one of those ones I kept hearing about and I just never go around

1295
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:02,040
I think it's better than cowboy bebop if I'm if I'm well honest if I'm honest with myself

1296
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,360
I like it more

1297
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,360
um

1298
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,360
I mean, yeah, these are

1299
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,440
pretty good

1300
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
pics I guess

1301
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,200
I

1302
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,360
I don't know

1303
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,360
I don't really have uh

1304
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:25,240
Don't really have okay. You thought you thought cowboy bebop was better than kill a kill

1305
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,800
No, I guess I'd agree with that. It's it's close. You know cowboy bebop. I love it. He thought cowboy bebop was better than

1306
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
diebuster

1307
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,880
I

1308
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,880
I know I you know, you know, I'm a little I'm a

1309
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,720
I love diebuster

1310
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,720
I'm a little bit of a cowboy bebop hater

1311
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,040
Like I don't like it as much as everyone else does like I just think it's kind of good. Uh, you know

1312
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,480
It's hard on reflection. There's so much about cowboy cowboy bebop that I like that is

1313
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,800
mostly vibes

1314
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,240
Rather than like oh this episode. So there are a few episodes. They're just sort of like I don't I don't really

1315
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,200
I don't really vibe with it. I don't really love the vibe cowboy bebop. I know I I

1316
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
I feel like it's heresy, but

1317
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:11,400
I don't know. It's it's cowboys in space. It's it's exactly those vibes combined in a very brown

1318
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,400
great

1319
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
the the kind of like

1320
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,520
Jazzy noir vibe is just not my

1321
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,640
It's not super my cup of tea. I think the I like I like shampoos viable a lot better. Mm-hmm

1322
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,360
Where is um

1323
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,520
Where's gun buster on here? Oh gun buster

1324
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:37,080
Gun buster lost to one piece which is you fucking idiot you fucking moron. Fuck you

1325
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
I was waiting for you to find that one

1326
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:46,360
One piece beat death note. What's wrong with you because I just I like on reflection all of it like one piece is

1327
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:52,600
Got a good anime actually. It's actually very good. Nothing doesn't it's it's good in places. It's good in parts

1328
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,760
Yes, I think that's not really falls off after L's death and it's just sort of like yeah, it does

1329
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,880
Okay, but the first half of death note is like

1330
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,320
I don't know. I mean it's a good anime. It's it's

1331
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,440
Obviously the manga is better as it almost always is yes if this was a manga thing

1332
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,000
It'll be different. It would be different very different. Although. I don't know one piece might

1333
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,600
Soundcaster no line also has a manga and it's also very good

1334
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,200
Die buster and gun buster for me would make it like all the way at least to the semifinals

1335
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:31,160
For these wait a fucking second. Do you think try gun is better than fully cooly? Oh, no

1336
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:37,640
You're fucking cracked. You're fucking cracked in the coconut. All right. I I had I thought about it and I'm like

1337
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:46,040
Fully cooly is pretty cool. It's not like I didn't like anything. I think I like basically everything except like

1338
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,040
pokemon

1339
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,000
and a lot of bleach and Naruto are lame

1340
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,840
um, yeah

1341
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,520
But like fully cooly is great. Try gun is it edged it out?

1342
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,960
I don't know what to say. I couldn't think of like a smart reason

1343
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,360
You

1344
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,680
You just don't know I don't know just like oh my god. Is it just because there's more of it? No, no, no

1345
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,400
That's not I haven't even finished try gun

1346
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,880
I just really like the the aesthetic

1347
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,960
I I I get that I do like the aesthetic of try gun

1348
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm with you on that try gun's a fucking mess like the original try gun show like it's a total

1349
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,240
It's a total mess. Maybe maybe

1350
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,760
I it's it's it's all aesthetic

1351
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:37,880
And I I don't know honestly try gun try gun does have a good aesthetic. I I I strongly agree

1352
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,640
But so does fully cooly. It's so does fully cooly. It's hard. I think I think the thing about fully cooly

1353
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,200
Was just I was completely confused and I need to rewatch it

1354
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,640
I need to rewatch it and then I'll I'll I'll put a higher up

1355
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:56,440
Yeah, I mean sure true true. I watched it and I was like, huh?

1356
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:02,200
Oh, it's over. Wait a minute. You think neon genesis even galleon is better than bleach?

1357
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,920
What the fuck?

1358
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,920
They don't they don't even have a single giant sword in neon genesis eva and galleon

1359
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:16,760
They do they have like a like a they just have a big lance. Yeah, it's uh, it's basically a sword

1360
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:24,120
It's basically a bank. Hey, you know, it's in that's incorrect. It's not it's not accurate. What if shinji was a shinjigami?

1361
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:32,040
Oh my god, what do you what would I don't know what I would do in that scenario?

1362
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:35,960
I just I just I've been I've been like getting further and further for my microphone

1363
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:41,160
I'm sorry if my voice has been getting quieter and quieter. Well, you're screaming you're screaming about anime and it's it's

1364
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,240
I've just been leaning. Yeah, I

1365
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:49,640
I gotta say I do now that you say I do strongly disagree with a few of a few of these match-ups

1366
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,200
I really don't know

1367
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,320
What is going on with you dog?

1368
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,160
Well, that's the reason I brought it into the show

1369
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,760
Viewers at home, please seize and cope

1370
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,400
and rage against me

1371
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,560
Also, um, I

1372
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:14,280
I like I do like I like the karekano beats melancholy of haruhi susumi agree agree with that. Yes agree with that one

1373
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:20,840
Where's utena? I was I was annoyed that utena went up against gurren lagann immediately because I really like utena

1374
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And it's stopped to the first round

1375
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,920
You you think you think eva you eva beats gurren lagann for me gurren lagann beats eva no question

1376
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:36,200
But I mean it's a little hard. I understand I understand why someone would like eva better. It's a it's a different sort of feeling

1377
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,760
Um, obviously eva is very dark

1378
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
Shinji's a little fucker little fuck boy

1379
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,080
and he's

1380
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,080
life sucks

1381
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,840
And I think oh, you know what I was going through my head as I was doing this

1382
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,560
I was like I clearly have a preference

1383
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,000
um for four by three like

1384
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,720
drawn on cell animated shows

1385
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,160
Things that are like hd digitized stuff

1386
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,720
I tend to not like the look of them so much

1387
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,200
Which is why san katsu no line getting all the way to the finals is quite good

1388
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:16,760
I really like that. I I I I understand that aesthetic preference. I I really do

1389
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,480
um

1390
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
I mean, okay

1391
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:28,520
I try to rewatch gurren lagann not too long ago. It's not like I it's not like I don't understand

1392
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,160
What there is to like about

1393
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,400
These shows even the ones that I don't think should have made it so far

1394
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,320
Uh, I mean, you know pretty good. You know what I like you know what I like about this list is that there's not too many

1395
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:47,240
Items on it. It's comprehensible if you'd seen like 40 anime this list would be a nightmare. Oh, yeah

1396
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,640
I would have multiple different images. I suppose there'll be like brackets

1397
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:58,040
It'll just be like, you know, what's funny. I realize I had not seen a single dragon ball, you know anime

1398
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
I've only read the manga

1399
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,680
Maybe I should make a uh

1400
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,160
A tier a thing like this because I haven't seen that many anime. Yeah, I would love

1401
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,600
I would love to see probably seen more than you but not by like that much

1402
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,280
I would love to see you do a tournament bracket anime thing. How did you?

1403
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,240
How did you make a list of of anime you see?

1404
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:21,160
I google's tournament bracket generator and this website came up

1405
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,920
But it was really annoying because it asked me to sign up so that I can start the tournament

1406
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,400
Um, I've you I've used this website before this this tournament

1407
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,920
Yeah, I remember it not being quite as annoying the last time I used it

1408
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,240
But yeah, you have to sign up now. Um, I can't remember what website it was on and I closed the tab

1409
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,640
But how did you come up with your anime list? Did you just think of them off the top of your head?

1410
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,560
I thought of the ones I could think of and then I went to my anime list and I scrolled down

1411
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:52,920
Did the top most popular animes and I was like every so often I'd be like, oh, how did I forget space dandy got to put that on there

1412
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,920
Things like that. Yeah

1413
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:01,160
I haven't really seen any like super obscure stuff other than like garzi's wing. You didn't put garzi's wing on here

1414
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,800
I don't think I actually watched the whole thing or like a lot of it. You didn't put mad you didn't put mad bull on here

1415
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,160
Oh mad bull. Yeah, we watched that how much did we watch all of it? We I

1416
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,000
We watched a couple episodes. I don't know how much of it there actually is

1417
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:19,000
Mad bull mad bull should be on this if it's like an ova

1418
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,400
Which plebeian weave episode what what what plebeian weave show did you watch?

1419
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,080
I watched the k-lon movie and this this doesn't include animated

1420
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,480
Anime movies just ova's and yeah serialized tv

1421
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,760
Yeah, one of the ones that I would have to put on my list would be I think it was called planetarian

1422
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,440
The show that I watched for that. Oh, I guess that I guess that's a good time to mention that

1423
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,760
I have I have made the plebeian weave blu rays. I'm no longer selling them. They're free now

1424
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,880
They're on my website. The files are downloadable

1425
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,120
stcomics.com

1426
01:23:54,120 --> 01:24:00,840
Slash store.html the iso file is just up for download and if you have a burner you can download it and you can

1427
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,320
Burn your own plebeian weave blu rays

1428
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,120
If you I've the power to the people

1429
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,960
Uh, they're democratized now lol

1430
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:15,560
Uh, okay. Yes, uh, there are four episodes of mad bull

1431
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:22,360
And I think we would have watched the whole thing. So I should have put mad bull. I forgot mad bull that mad bull was great

1432
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,240
Mad bull was pretty good. It was pretty

1433
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:33,320
I don't know if I would I don't know if I would have liked it as much if we didn't watch it in a big room with people yelling

1434
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,200
And getting drunk and getting drunk

1435
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,960
Yes, um, it definitely benefited from that

1436
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:45,080
But I think it's I mean we were all like cynical at the beginning like uh, this is

1437
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,800
Is this like a really cheap shit thing?

1438
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:54,200
And then and it kind of was it kind of it was it's pulpy. It's like really like pulpy

1439
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,680
I would maybe maybe say exploitative exploitative and like, um

1440
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,440
Um

1441
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:04,040
We we really came to like it because it was insane

1442
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:10,680
But then it became self aware about how insane it was and it just kept going and it was like, oh now it's now it's now

1443
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,520
We can like it normally

1444
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,520
And we're not laughing at it. We're laughing with it now that that now that they have shown

1445
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,160
That they understand that this is like

1446
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,240
You know

1447
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:25,480
It it is silly, but like it insane and cool and mad bull himself

1448
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,200
It's like the coolest guy

1449
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,520
He's so cool

1450
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,600
He loves the ladies

1451
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,480
Just like me

1452
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,040
It's like he's an american

1453
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,120
And then the the little guys like a japanese transfer or something

1454
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,920
Wait, does the show take place in like new york?

1455
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,760
Yeah, yeah, he's I think it's in new york and his the main character is like a japanese

1456
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,920
Officer that's on like fucking exchange program or something

1457
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,600
Yeah

1458
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,560
See to see how the real cops do it in nypd

1459
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,080
A cab includes mad bull, but you know what I still support him

1460
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:12,680
He's he is a bastard, but he's a he's a lovable bastard, you know, he's just you love to hate him

1461
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,080
Uh, what was what was this website used to make this tournament? Um

1462
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,600
Mad bull monument

1463
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,320
He could vor the little guy so big

1464
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,080
Jesus

1465
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,440
tournament

1466
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,520
Bracket generator. Yeah

1467
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,880
Challenge is it challenge? Yes. That was the website. All right, cool

1468
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:41,560
Well, I won't I won't make it now. Um, but that will be fun. I will try and make one of those for the next episode

1469
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,560
Yeah, once I finished utena, I will be looking for a new

1470
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,000
Like cool anime to watch that's

1471
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:55,320
Uh, give her watch, uh, give her watch. Okay, should I include anime that I've seen like two episodes of?

1472
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:01,080
I could have added so many to this if I included like one or two or three episodes

1473
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,360
I've seen like two episodes of i've seen like two episodes of musishi

1474
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,240
I don't know if I should include that one

1475
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,360
Oh

1476
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,400
Fuck what was the what's the what's it called?

1477
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,880
Um, oh

1478
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:21,400
No, I can't remember it. Um, munchie loves this. It's a cg anime

1479
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:26,760
With a guy with wearing a red and white stripes like full body something or other

1480
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,080
And there's a little dog demon guy with a mask on her face

1481
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,240
Chainsaw man

1482
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:40,360
No, not chainsaw man. It's it's like a kids show like 3d animated

1483
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,080
But like creepy looking

1484
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:49,080
And it's kind of insane like are you talking about like poppy the entertainer poppy? Yes

1485
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,800
That's not an anime

1486
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,540
That's an anime. That's not japanese

1487
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,520
Isn't it?

1488
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,360
No, that's like an adult swim original poppy the performer

1489
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:06,920
Is a series of 3d cg shorts produced for kids nation one of the old time

1490
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,440
Well, the all anime satellite stations in japan. Yeah, no, there's japanese

1491
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,640
Oh, what the fuck poppy the performer the show is produced by husband and wife team ryuji misuda and waka

1492
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
Wakako misuda

1493
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,240
Okay, well shit

1494
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:29,240
Maybe it counts as an anime. I would say it counts because it's like it's I mean, it's an odd sort of thing

1495
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:32,600
But like it doesn't it doesn't feel like an anime. It doesn't

1496
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:38,200
Feel like it should count. Uh, well, I I feel I feel like it should count

1497
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,760
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, okay. I I get it

1498
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:49,480
Okay, so poppy the performer mad bowl. I'm gonna do like right now who wins. Oh, no, that's too difficult. Ooh

1499
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,680
poppy versus mad bowl

1500
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,480
Who could who will survive

1501
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,240
the battle

1502
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,240
I've actually seen a lot of

1503
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,920
I've probably seen a lot of like crappy anime like if I if I combed through mal

1504
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,000
I could probably remember a bunch of stuff that I like completely forgot that I

1505
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,960
Watched once upon a time like show bits. I've seen show bits for some reason

1506
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,960
Yeah, on a guy teacher was one of those like steel angel karumi

1507
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:22,680
I I I learned about anime and I watched like Naruto on some site and then I was like, oh

1508
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,040
What's these other things and I think on a guy teacher was one of them

1509
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,760
And I was wait, have you know?

1510
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,280
Oh, sorry

1511
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,320
Yeah, I've never seen on again. I don't I think it's just sort of like

1512
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,400
Oh wait, no, I remember the guy there's a man boy teen boy

1513
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:45,240
Um, he wakes up man boy teen boy. Gotcha. He wakes up from a coma and he is

1514
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,560
A teenager on the inside

1515
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,360
Or something. No, I can't remember Conan detective Conan

1516
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,000
No, no, I read detective Conan for a bit

1517
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,880
There's something something

1518
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,560
like

1519
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:10,360
Waking up out of a coma and being like too old for all the people around you or something

1520
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:17,880
I don't remember I hate that's how I feel every day when I wake up one day K Kusanagi notices a strange glowing woman by the lake

1521
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:24,280
What he discovers that the woman is actually an alien officer from the galaxy federation. Hang on. This isn't the right thing

1522
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:30,520
She's also his teacher and in spite of the setback he and his teacher gradually get to know each other romance blossoms

1523
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,760
What

1524
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,040
They get married

1525
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,920
There's no way I watched this doesn't seem right

1526
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,560
Have you have you not seen full metal alchemist?

1527
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,040
No, I did

1528
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:49,240
There's two shows and I didn't know which one to pick because they people say oh, they're both good in their different ways

1529
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,760
And I'm like, okay. Yeah, I've I've only seen the old one

1530
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,560
Okay, there's lots of like things I've heard about and I'm like, oh cool

1531
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,680
Never did you did you never watch Yu-Gi-Oh?

1532
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,440
I I caught like an episode a hero there

1533
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,320
I actually caught an episode of like Yu-Gi-Oh gx or like some Yu-Gi-Oh movie

1534
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:17,720
I actually watched a somewhat can I would probably have to include Yu-Gi-Oh not like gx or any of the sequel series

1535
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,440
But the original series I watched a bunch of it just because it was on

1536
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:30,200
I'm getting distracted if I if I let myself all oh just make my list right now

1537
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:38,840
Oh ichigo marino. She is uh, yeah, I remember now. It's the loli character, but with the she's aged up

1538
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,600
mentally

1539
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,640
She's young. She's not a kid, but she's 15 outside and she's been in a coma

1540
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,680
For a long time and her real age is 21 wait, huh?

1541
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,560
Wait, how does this make sense?

1542
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,040
She resembles a 15 year old

1543
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,200
But her real age is 21

1544
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,640
Her physical development was stunted due to stand stills

1545
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,840
To the same way they affected k

1546
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,920
stand still

1547
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,360
What the fuck is that?

1548
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,560
You know

1549
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,600
I guess I remember it making sense while I was watching

1550
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,680
Is that like a magic thing?

1551
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,080
No, no, I think it was I think it was

1552
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:23,800
It was all well the teacher's an alien. I don't remember that part. I guess it is my teacher is an alien

1553
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,240
Oh, do you mean the series of children's novels by bruce coville?

1554
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,720
That I read when I was a little kid and that taught me to be a communist before I even realized it

1555
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,680
Yes

1556
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,360
That's what you're talking about, right? Yes. Yes

1557
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,360
um everyone everyone everyone should go read we should we should have a

1558
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,960
We should do a podcast. We should make a new podcast

1559
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,720
We should make a new podcast where we just read my teacher is an alien

1560
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:55,080
You know, you know the animorphine time guys. It was tyler who was a big animorphs fan making nate

1561
01:32:55,560 --> 01:33:01,320
Read animorphs for the first time. I should do that to you. I should make you read my teacher's an alien for the first time

1562
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,920
He's like third grade reading level children's novels and be like, yeah, yeah

1563
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,760
Isn't brach's home based and you'll be like yes, and I'll say thanks

1564
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:16,120
Yes, it's brach's home kreblem

1565
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,320
There was the blue one

1566
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,080
And I think that's it I think there were just three aliens

1567
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,880
I may have also watched

1568
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,240
Onigai twins. I thought it was maybe part of the same series

1569
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,760
Might be but it's like a different guy

1570
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:38,360
So so anime movies don't count like paprika doesn't count a millennium actress is not no

1571
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:43,160
I mean, I think they count in like my anime list people would say. Oh, what's your favorite anime?

1572
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:49,560
And they say spirited away and like it's something about it feels wrong just because like I associated with like a serialized long running

1573
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:52,360
Or other ways multi-episode little thing

1574
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,240
Okay, I won't I won't yeah, no no if I included movies there would be like a lot more

1575
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:03,320
Yeah, and how do you how do you compare spirited away to like uh inferno cop

1576
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:10,840
To inferno cop. Oh, you know what I watched uh like this past week in a call in the in rfck

1577
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,720
Uh, I watched porco roso for the first time

1578
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,240
Yo, that's a great one that one. It was great. It was awesome. It might be my new favorite ghibli

1579
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,520
My old one was kiki's delivery service, but the porco roso might be better

1580
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:28,760
It's it was so good. It was awesome. It ruled. I love how he's he's not recommended enough

1581
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,400
He's a piggy

1582
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,400
Okay

1583
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,840
So I'm not supposed to understand why he's a pig, right?

1584
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,040
I think it is theme. Well

1585
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,280
That it's not like it's

1586
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:49,320
Only we can see it people do refer to him as a pig. I think the girl the girl asks him. Why are you a pig? Yeah?

1587
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,880
I think um, it's a thematic reason

1588
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,840
Like he like yeah

1589
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:59,960
Something something pig. I I don't actually know why something something pig. Yeah

1590
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:04,280
But I think if you analyze that you could come up with a good, you know theory as to why

1591
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,560
Well, well when she asks him why he's a pig

1592
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,560
He says

1593
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:15,720
Basically, he tells that story about how his whole squadron was shot down and he basically he told he should have died

1594
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,880
He had a near-death experience where he saw his whole squadron

1595
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,240
Go to heaven basically and he was like on his way to heaven

1596
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,720
or maybe hell

1597
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:29,080
But then like god sent him back and I guess

1598
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,120
He was a pig after that

1599
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,360
I guess is is what i'm supposed to take away from that

1600
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:37,720
I love that scene by the way of them rising up through the clouds

1601
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,360
Yeah, I just kept

1602
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,360
I just kept wanting him to reach down

1603
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,920
And scoop up some of the cloud

1604
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:50,920
Like liquid that he's like floating on in his plane. He was it was like right there. It's just just scoop up some in your hand

1605
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,240
um

1606
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,240
Yeah, it was a good scene, but

1607
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:00,360
Is it is it like a is it like a joke about pigs fly is is that it?

1608
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,120
I mean if it is a joke it would be a japanese joke

1609
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:10,280
So it might be something that doesn't make sense in English. I wonder if I wonder if they have that expression in japanese

1610
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:19,640
It's something about like almost going to heaven but being turned away turned him into a pig

1611
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:24,520
Maybe like and then okay, but then it feels like he's not good enough to be alive

1612
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,400
And like god has rejected him like he should have died with his people

1613
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:36,200
Yes, he said he said loathing. I'm a pig like it's sort of something he said all the good. He said all the good ones died

1614
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,960
Yeah, and like maybe god would reject you if you're like a little beastling a little pig guy

1615
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:53,240
And so he sees himself like that and it's manifested physically literally just the plot of that of that bones in the ocean song

1616
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,440
same

1617
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,240
Same story. I was like as a shanty. It's not a real shanty. It's a it's a it's a modern

1618
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:11,320
It's a modern band made it in the style of an old shanty. So it's not like a genuine worker's song

1619
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:19,080
Uh, but it's the same the plot is a guy like has like survivor's guilt basically over the fact that his whole crew drowned

1620
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,080
And he was the only survivor

1621
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,840
Uh

1622
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:27,720
There's this scene. Okay at the end the end credits though. They show all those like

1623
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,440
drawings of a whole squad

1624
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,840
of pigs

1625
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,840
and I I think

1626
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,840
I I wonder

1627
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,800
If that's his his crew in heaven

1628
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:46,440
That's the only thing I can think of is that when you go to heaven you become a pig and he

1629
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,720
Went but was turned away and he became a pig

1630
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:54,920
But he didn't go to heaven and now he's just he's a he's a heaven pig on earth

1631
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,400
Hmm

1632
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:04,040
Like like the idea that he sees himself as like a worthless guy who you know, he's not one of the good ones

1633
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,400
He should have died then

1634
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:10,040
Um, he sees himself as a pig. It's like like on the face of a derogatory

1635
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,200
But then it turns out

1636
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:15,960
God loves pigs more than anyone else. I kind of feel yes

1637
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:20,120
That's kind of what I came is that it's some sort of like weird like heaven blessing

1638
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,000
Yeah, is that his like his brush with heaven turned him

1639
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:28,520
Maybe he comes back. This is what an angel looks like. He came back with an angelic glow and he doesn't realize it

1640
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,280
That's what I think and I might be reading too much into the like

1641
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,360
I feel like the drawings at the end of like the whole like everyone's a pig

1642
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,800
That might just be like concept art that they use and they didn't mean for you to like

1643
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,640
Read into it that much but like reading into it is like who are these people

1644
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,680
And the only thing it's they show a whole squad of pilots and they're all pigs like is this his

1645
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:54,440
Or is this his squadron? And that's the only that's the only thing I can think of unless it's like

1646
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,240
No, that's the that's the only thing that makes sense

1647
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,640
I I if I either I discount that as like not canon or

1648
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,000
What what else could be that's my interpretation

1649
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,120
And it's very it's very smart. Thank you

1650
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,520
Uh, good good good movie though and now I understand

1651
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,880
You remember mr. Boop

1652
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,600
Yes, did he do a porco rosso thing?

1653
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,920
Yeah, the gina gina from porco rosso is like his ex-girlfriend

1654
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,520
And when he's like and when yeah when he's um

1655
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:34,600
I think it's when mr. Boop or it's when betty gets kidnapped by her dad mr. Boop

1656
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:41,800
Uh, he like goes to see his ex-girlfriend gina from porco rosso and it's like I don't know what to do about my marriage

1657
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,680
And she's like if you love her you got to go after her

1658
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:49,400
Uh alec and he's like, yeah, thanks gino from porco rosso

1659
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:55,960
It's too bad our relationship didn't work out because you don't like having orgies and I love having orgies and she's like, yeah

1660
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,840
Okay

1661
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,680
Good old mr. Boop

1662
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:11,160
And I was like now I get it now I get who gino from porco rosso is she's a nice lady. She's a nice lady

1663
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,480
Yeah, like a little

1664
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,920
Weird world war two speakeasy sort of place

1665
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:21,560
She like a server or like a singer or something. I don't remember. I think she was a singer

1666
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,280
I I wasn't sure if porco is supposed to be like an old guy, but I don't think he's not like that old

1667
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:33,480
And he's like 30 or something because like he's a world war one pilot and this is like

1668
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,600
The interim in between world war one and world war two. So like it hasn't actually been that long

1669
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,720
Since world war one at first of the movie began. I thought he was supposed to be like an old old guy

1670
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,720
But no, he's just a somewhat his his little

1671
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,680
He looks old being a pig being a pig really really puts years on

1672
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,400
in photographs

1673
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,400
on film

1674
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,480
It has that effect. Yes

1675
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:05,080
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm glad we anyway. I just wanted to talk about how good porco rosso is. Um

1676
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:11,160
Just the the the the exuberant joy of flying really comes through and

1677
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,800
porco is just a very

1678
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,440
Fun and funny and likable

1679
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:19,720
Dude and just the vibe of the film is immaculate

1680
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,600
Yes, I always loved the uh

1681
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,240
the way it's I mean the

1682
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:27,880
The vistas and the

1683
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,520
The the shots of like of like the clouds

1684
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,920
Um casting shadows on the ocean flying through that like that's

1685
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:38,120
That's real shit. That's what I like to see in real life

1686
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:45,880
Yeah, the the vistas and just how like you you're always seeing you're always seeing just like people in town

1687
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:50,920
Just like going about their lives and doing stuff and like the whole team working on the plane. It's just like

1688
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,040
What a nice time everybody's having

1689
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,840
Yes, just great

1690
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:58,920
um

1691
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:03,320
Yeah, well, I won't put that on my tournament list because it is a film

1692
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,880
But it was good, uh, okay

1693
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:14,440
I have another thing to say about this week and it's uh another horrifying

1694
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,480
terrible nightmare

1695
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:21,480
Uh, so there was like a an april fools video from gino samuel

1696
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,480
You know

1697
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:26,760
Do you know about this? Do you see this? No, I didn't see anything about that

1698
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:33,080
Yeah, well, they they recently uh got to the part where I have the conversation with chris on twitch about

1699
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,560
the merge and stuff

1700
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,560
and uh

1701
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:42,520
I guess the april fools video includes like an ai generated conversation between me and chris

1702
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,080
And I guess it ends with like chris

1703
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,120
gets the good good it's like good ending

1704
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,800
And I I I didn't watch that. I just heard second hand, but uh apparently good ending is like

1705
01:42:54,600 --> 01:43:01,000
Fully transitions gets bottom surgery goes on to become a you know a fully realized

1706
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:04,760
woman leading a in the big city leading a

1707
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,880
Prosperous life or whatever, uh, and it's a you know

1708
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:16,120
Whatever they they aide me is the is the point the ai convote me over on gino

1709
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,760
And that's fine

1710
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,760
And that's fine

1711
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,320
I I guess it's fine

1712
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,760
It's fine. It's fine

1713
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,240
That's the worst part

1714
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:34,520
No, it's okay. Everyone told me like it's someone told me that like it's it's obviously a joke like nobody's gonna watch this

1715
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,880
Yeah, I mean, I I think it just sucks that like

1716
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:42,600
people who have interacted with chris chan are gonna be part of those

1717
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,560
3000 hour documentaries on youtube

1718
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,440
it it it does

1719
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,360
Make me look a little escance that like

1720
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,320
Yeah, gino

1721
01:43:55,320 --> 01:44:00,520
It seems like he'll just read any series of tweets that like anyone had at any point with chris

1722
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:05,320
And like that's a video like that's a dot in goes into in the documentary

1723
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,720
uh

1724
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:12,120
How on earth could really really feels like scraping the bottom of the barrel for like relevant content

1725
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:15,960
How is that the the big playlists that gino samuel?

1726
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,440
I guess

1727
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,440
It's like 70 episodes now 78

1728
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:26,360
How is there like a like a thing you can do to see how long a playlist is?

1729
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:33,400
Uh, I think it says if you click on the playlist and it and it opens it up in its own window

1730
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:36,760
Like the playlist list on the right side should have the number of videos in it

1731
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:42,600
But I mean like the the watch time like how long have people I've been watching this for

1732
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,360
How many hours of their own lives have they wasted?

1733
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,320
I mean

1734
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,320
I mean by that metric lots of things have wasted huge amounts of

1735
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:59,560
Yeah, but like the chris chan documentary does not like you could tell that story so much more succinctly

1736
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,880
Like it's so bloated whatever it's going. Yeah

1737
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It's it's bloated

1738
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,480
I I get it. I I get

1739
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,560
I get that like you can continue to make content

1740
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:16,760
So why not just continue to make content and I get that like people just want stuff to listen to

1741
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,160
I get it

1742
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:23,240
But it it it really does feel like scraping the bottom of the barrel

1743
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:27,960
like it's it there there's not actually 70 episodes worth of like

1744
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:35,160
Explanation required to understand this we're just kind of we're just kind of rolling in the slop now

1745
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:40,440
We're just kind of reveling in in the same old shit, which is okay. I'm not judging anyone

1746
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:44,040
I don't I don't even I don't even begrudge it. I mean I I get it

1747
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:50,120
I get I get the appeal from both the creator's perspective and the audience perspective of you know, pretty repetitive

1748
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:56,440
Not particularly edifying. We're not actually gonna learn anything from this. Whatever. We're just here to waste time. That's fine

1749
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,680
Well, yeah, um, yeah

1750
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:04,280
That style of content. I guess it's just the fact that it's like it sort of betrays the real reason

1751
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,840
people

1752
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,200
like

1753
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,840
Think about chris channel all the time is not to

1754
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:16,200
Answer questions like wow wonder what's going on there and then they need a like a explained video

1755
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,840
It's just to like revel in the slop

1756
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,600
forever

1757
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,600
That playlist will never end. I don't think

1758
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,200
People will will want to just think about how much chris is cringe

1759
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:34,760
Over and over again for the rest of their lives and it's the fact that it's the fact that it's made it to 70 episodes

1760
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:41,640
Yeah, tells me that there's pretty much no bottom to like how irrelevant something has to be in order to like be included

1761
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:45,800
I guess he's going in like roughly chronological order. So I feel like it's

1762
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,160
It has to run out at some point

1763
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:52,200
I mean when they get to the the trial

1764
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:57,800
Or the you know the incarceration. Oh, she's out. She's she's free. Did you know that?

1765
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:04,120
And I think that was mentioned last episode. Oh, sorry. I think so. I can't remember

1766
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,760
It all runs together. Yeah, okay

1767
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:10,360
I I got a little boost to my chris chan videos because she was in the news

1768
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,840
Well, you know on twitter a bit

1769
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:15,240
Uh, because she's fucking been bailed out

1770
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:21,000
No word on like what she's doing or I don't think there's been any further details about it

1771
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:26,200
I mean, I I'm kind of curious like who bailed her out. Where is she?

1772
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,760
Uh, I'd like to know

1773
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:30,200
but

1774
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:36,440
But uh, you know, we'll probably won't know until she gets back on twitter or something if if that even happens

1775
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,280
I've soured on it

1776
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:45,320
I was curious when I heard about sonichu for the first time. It's like wow, this comic sucks. What the fuck?

1777
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:50,440
But I always felt like it really does. I always felt like it was kind of like

1778
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:52,680
You know

1779
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:57,880
um endearing in a way that somebody has this little idea and they just keep drawing a comic and I'm like

1780
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:01,000
That reminds me of when I was like five. Yeah, I like that

1781
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:04,520
But then it became so much more horrible

1782
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:13,000
Over time, you know, I like the outsider art aspect of it. I like to think about like, you know

1783
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:19,560
It's it's interesting to read this comic and be like this this comic is so weird and then to understand like

1784
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:25,400
You know what the thought process was behind why the comic is this way. It's like, well, that's interesting

1785
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:32,680
Uh, yeah, and that's why, you know, my videos about it are about the comic and like they reference the author and they talk about

1786
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,200
What was going on with her at the time? But that's not

1787
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,360
You know, you can't avoid talking about that, but that's not like the focus

1788
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,840
Now the focus is clearly

1789
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:48,440
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're talking about your thing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, but you're saying yeah the focus of like on

1790
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,680
on her personally, I mean, I'm just curious because

1791
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,680
Like where she is now because like, you know, the the bad

1792
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:00,360
thing is that like did a troll bail her out is some troll like

1793
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,680
Holding her hostage or something. Uh, it's possible

1794
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:09,720
I think it might be more likely that some relative might have might have bailed her out

1795
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:15,560
I don't know. I I'm genuinely just I'm shocked that she was bailed out on on the charges

1796
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:19,480
I'm shocked that like that that was apparently not supposed to be an option

1797
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:25,480
But somehow it became one and it's very strange and uh, you know, it doesn't seem

1798
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,280
Like that should be

1799
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,880
the case

1800
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,120
Seems dangerous. It seems like a dangerous situation

1801
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,400
I don't know. I feel like I don't care

1802
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:41,080
All right. All right. I get you. It's it's just like the only reason we're hearing about any of this

1803
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:43,960
is because of the

1804
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,200
status of chris chen as a

1805
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,080
Public figure that everyone's paying attention to

1806
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,000
Yeah

1807
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,680
Otherwise it would have been it would have been this, you know, we like the comic and if if chris chen wasn't well known

1808
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:00,520
This may have happened anyway, and it would have been like a small article

1809
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,760
and we've never heard about anything and

1810
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:05,320
This all could have happened the exact same way

1811
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,960
And we just would not be none the wiser

1812
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,080
And I think that's that's just, you know

1813
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,080
Doesn't need to be looked at honestly

1814
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:18,840
Uh, I guess I guess you got a point

1815
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,800
um

1816
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,520
Well, I mean, I'm not like

1817
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,000
I'm not like looking into it, but I assume that someone will tell me

1818
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:33,080
Like people just messaged me to be like did you hear did you hear chris chen?

1819
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,280
Was bailed out and I was like no wow

1820
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,920
Wow damn

1821
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,240
Uh-oh

1822
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:44,600
So I'm sure I'm sure bailed back in did you hear she was bail japed?

1823
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:52,440
Now you're interested. Uh, I'm not interested in a heartache. Yeah

1824
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:57,480
Uh to beat bail japed is to be put in a prison surrounded by lava

1825
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,320
That's probably what should have been done

1826
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:09,800
Uh, but I just uh, yeah people said gino samuel ai'd me and I was like, okay. All right fine

1827
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,760
Just have just have your way with me then

1828
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,560
If you do it do what you must

1829
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,840
Uh

1830
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,040
It's fine

1831
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:25,560
Uh, it seems it seems like there was no like uh, the the particular

1832
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:30,600
The mockery or humiliation perpetrated so can't really complain

1833
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,560
Uh, and that's all I had to say

1834
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,720
About my week really that's the end of my

1835
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,680
List of things

1836
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,520
All right, I think I had something else to say but I forgot it

1837
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:44,600
Uh-oh

1838
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:48,600
I was talking about anime. Oh my oh my yeah, it's a gun smoke

1839
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,560
Uh, I got oh, I got mine mine arrived

1840
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:55,720
During the stream. I think it was during the draw stream and you were there in the chat and I said

1841
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,120
I found it in a box on my

1842
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
counter in the front hall

1843
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,560
I have it right here. I can see it right now. It's on my table. Have you read it? Have you read the new chapter?

1844
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:10,600
Read the new chapter. Yeah, it's got the first four chapters in

1845
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:16,520
That's the that's the idea is that you can see I thought

1846
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,040
The fourth chapter if you pay early

1847
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:25,960
That that was my my relationship. I didn't I didn't realize there was new content in in the book

1848
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:33,000
I wonder how many people didn't realize I didn't realize that. Okay. Well, I'll have to read it now. Okay. Um, yeah, it's it's

1849
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:37,560
The way I'm gonna do things going forward is gonna be like I'll make the chapter

1850
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,920
Post it on, you know, amazon

1851
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:45,720
pdf kofi so people can pay for the privilege to see it first

1852
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:49,960
And also that's just nice. Thank you. Um, and then

1853
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:55,000
Uh, it'll come out on the perfect comic party and then it'll come out on my website

1854
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,560
So it'll be like staggered release

1855
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,160
Okay

1856
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:08,360
That's the way I want to do things. Oh also my patreon. I guess I don't know how that's gonna work. I want to give them something for it

1857
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:12,600
But I don't know if I want to just give them the chapter maybe like

1858
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,440
To get it before my website

1859
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,400
or something

1860
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:29,080
Anyway, uh, I got some new orders today just I refreshed I got two more

1861
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:34,760
Based total orders 33 33 books. I got four books today

1862
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:39,000
You know, I hope I hope they continue to to trickle in

1863
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:45,880
Oh, we got a new one from canada. So canadian's gotten a getting gonna get a print clorissa gunsmoke

1864
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,720
Uh-oh

1865
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,160
uh-oh

1866
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:55,640
We got united station at a kingdom australia germany japan and canada those are that's uh six countries

1867
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:00,040
That my book is in it's so cool and so easy

1868
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,160
I know

1869
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:07,720
Did I did I complain on here that amazon doesn't let me print in landscape format?

1870
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:11,560
I don't know if you mentioned it. Uh, I remember you're saying that somewhere

1871
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:19,560
I I might have said it in the stream or I might have just messaged you about it because like yeah, uh, I looked into the amazon printing and

1872
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:24,520
Printing my book would cost it would be about 19

1873
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,400
19 to 20 dollars

1874
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:30,520
Just like to print and ship it which is like

1875
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,280
Say it does that saves me money

1876
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:42,840
If I if I if I only printed a certain amount if I printed enough it would eventually become cheaper than that for me

1877
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,600
To ship to america, but not to ship abroad

1878
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,880
It would never it would never become cheaper than that to ship abroad

1879
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:56,760
But so there's like a potential monetary benefit there to using the amazon and of course the the fact that it's just easier

1880
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,840
but

1881
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:02,840
They don't give me that much freedom in terms of choosing like book size

1882
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,200
That so that I can't print in the size and landscape configuration that I wanted and there's a couple other little

1883
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:12,920
Niggling issues too like the fact that they don't let me uh, they don't let me put

1884
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:17,400
Uh, they don't let me print on the inside cover

1885
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:23,240
Which is I mean, it's not that big a deal, but like, you know, the other company will let me

1886
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,960
Oh, yeah

1887
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:33,480
The back cover of the things. Yeah. Yeah the the interior side of the of the cover is just you know in in mine

1888
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:38,040
That's where I put like, you know copyright information and like a little bit of credits stuff and

1889
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:40,840
You know just looks nice

1890
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:43,640
it looks nice because like in because uh

1891
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,000
Simon punishment like the pages are black like everything is black and it's it's like colored print on black

1892
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:55,000
Background so, you know, it just looks nice to have the inside cover black as well. I can't do that on amazon

1893
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,080
I see yes

1894
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:59,240
I guess that's just because i'm very like

1895
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,200
particular with how uh, I set this

1896
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,520
book up

1897
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,440
No, yeah, the amazon is is like it's quality

1898
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:15,240
To a point. I don't think you can really do like bespoke luxury goods in terms of print on demand

1899
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,480
Yeah, you can make

1900
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:21,000
Books honestly printed somewhere else and then sell them through amazon

1901
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:25,800
I think if I didn't if if I if my book were a little more normal looking

1902
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,880
I I think I probably might do it like like for the vapors or something

1903
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,760
Like if I ever made like maybe a vapors volume

1904
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:35,880
You know, uh

1905
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:38,120
Put them all together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1906
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:48,040
Because that I wouldn't care about like printing on the inside cover or landscape orientation or whatever

1907
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,560
Oh, I think I may have already mentioned this but I can't wait

1908
01:56:54,040 --> 01:57:00,920
I can't wait to be able to make a volume in the same shape as all the manga volumes

1909
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:04,120
If I have enough pages of like Clarissa

1910
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:09,000
Probably Clarissa at the end like I'll just have a little tiny baby version

1911
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,640
If you want a tiny baby manga version of Clarissa gunsmoat, I want to make that

1912
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:19,080
Because I just want to have that I just want to have like it with like the the low quality paper as well

1913
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,480
Isn't it just the same but smaller

1914
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:24,840
It would be the same but smaller. No, well, it would be not just volume one

1915
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:29,000
I would do like all the volumes like the whole Clarissa every all the chapters together

1916
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:33,560
So you would so you if you made like an omnibus, you would just make it small

1917
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:39,880
Well, I would probably make like a large one or the one that's the same size as like the other ones

1918
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:45,320
But then I just really I just really want a small like the idea of a manga size. That's funny

1919
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,240
Yeah, I get why not. Yeah, maybe some people would prefer it in manga size

1920
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:53,880
Yeah, and the the fun thing about that is that I can just put it on Amazon for no

1921
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,960
Like I don't have to pay a commission for it to be listed. I just put it up there

1922
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:04,280
So even if nobody buys that one, I can buy it and I can have it and it's like it's for me

1923
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:12,600
Okay, I get you I get you dog. Uh, yeah, why not?

1924
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,400
Why not have it in multiple sizes?

1925
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,080
um

1926
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,080
It'll also be very cheap because like the the manga

1927
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,800
volumes they use that slightly

1928
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:27,320
Lower grade like cream paper instead of white paper. So it'd be like a little rougher

1929
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:34,680
And it'll be like a little I don't know nostalgic. I guess I've got like manga volumes from years and years and years ago

1930
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,800
of like Dragon Ball and I'm like, ah

1931
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:41,240
The the ink's fading. This is so cool

1932
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,960
Uh like an ancient tome

1933
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:51,080
The pages they're they're all dog-eared and fallen out like oh, but that's just the authentic manga experience

1934
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:53,980
They're they're all going like crusty brown-ish

1935
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,240
Sun baked a little bit

1936
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:02,520
More like sun-based hot hot. Yeah

1937
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:08,280
Yeah, that's right. So yeah, I'm gonna I have been sort of using my kindle

1938
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:10,840
um management thing

1939
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:19,160
Link in the description to buy gibbs book Clarissa gunsmoke volume one get a copy get a copy and if you don't

1940
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:24,600
If you don't want a if you can't afford or you don't want a physical version you can go to the co-fi

1941
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:31,240
Right. I also have if you go to gibb and take that site you can there's like links for for both versions

1942
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:38,760
I don't know where I'm gonna put it. I have I have like a drawer that I keep a bunch of like

1943
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:43,880
Comics that I've purchased from people's kick starters and stuff. So I'll probably put it with those

1944
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:49,960
Along with my problem sleuth volumes, etc. Yes when I make a bell jpeh book

1945
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,840
I'm also going to make it similar science to problem sleuth

1946
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:58,280
And even if nobody buys that it's like I mean it's a lot of work to make it into a book

1947
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:01,880
So I hope people buy it when I do that, but it's

1948
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,960
uh having

1949
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:12,760
I finished I finished organizing the book version of slime and punishment and like I I still don't feel like I'm done

1950
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:17,480
I'm still thinking like maybe I should shrink it a little more like maybe I should uh

1951
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:23,240
Maybe maybe I should add a couple more like pieces of like fan art in the index that I forgot to include

1952
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:27,320
Uh, maybe I could shrink the text more and and squeeze it into fewer pages

1953
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:29,960
uh

1954
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:37,000
It's literally harder than drawing the panels is just putting the panels on the page is the actual hard part

1955
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:43,080
And as my biscuit page is hard even though I draw it like a fucking baby scribbling

1956
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,040
It's because the scribbling is the easy part

1957
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:50,760
Yeah, I I I reference the homestuck volume and the problem sleuth volumes

1958
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:55,560
I have a lot to figure out when I when I was doing the pages I have like a

1959
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,760
Like a photoshop document of like bell jpeh in book form

1960
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:06,680
But I'll need to check with amazon what the sizes are so I can I'll have to move everything around probably

1961
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,400
Yeah

1962
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:14,200
Oh, it's exciting though. I love books. I love physical media

1963
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,920
Uh, I feel you know, I had to I had to put I had to put my printing aside for a moment

1964
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:25,960
For the slime and punishment to get the perfect comic party set up, but that's okay

1965
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:31,400
Uh, biscuit page is all important too. And now that I'm back in the swing of it. I'm glad that I did

1966
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:34,440
uh, but

1967
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:39,480
I'm excited for my book as well. Uh, that'll be pretty cool

1968
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:45,480
Maybe they'll sell a million copies. Maybe I'll make a hundred thousand dollars on Kickstarter

1969
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:51,160
Oh, thank god, and then maybe I'll finally like the face that I see in the mirror

1970
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:56,360
Nah, you'll be able to plate it gold. Hmm

1971
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,560
gold face

1972
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:06,920
Hey guys notice anything different about me. Hey, homa. You're the biggest man in the world now and you played it in gold

1973
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,520
Remember that

1974
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:16,920
Yes, that iconic simpson scene great. Yes. He said he first says like, uh, I don't know homo. You got a new haircut

1975
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,400
Look closer, Lenny. Oh, yeah

1976
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:23,400
The biggest man you're the biggest man in the world

1977
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:27,000
Because you got lots of money and now you're huge

1978
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,520
Uh

1979
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:42,360
I have food now there was food given to me. That's great. So I will make noises with my mouth. I will mute myself a bit

1980
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:49,160
Uh, I don't really have anything else to talk about for this. Yeah. Um, I think maybe we could go to voicemails

1981
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:55,240
Okay, uh, but let me go to the bathroom real quick. All right. I'm gonna take a hiatus

1982
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:01,560
So

1983
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,800
All right, uh, I'm back

1984
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:23,240
You there. Mm-hmm. I am still here. You're still here. All right. Well, hey, we're

1985
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:25,240
damn

1986
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:30,680
Depending on how long these voicemails take we're on track for an under three hour episode if you can even believe such a thing

1987
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:37,640
You know what that'd be great. That's horrifying. I can't I I I don't I don't even know our audience will riot

1988
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:43,960
Our audience and we will feast we will feast on all the free time that we've saved for ourselves

1989
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:51,800
Yes, I need that. I need so much free time. I'm I know no more seven hour episodes, please

1990
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:59,320
Translate it it literally translates directly into like more biscapades done. Yeah, more biscapades. That's what I'm gonna do. Yeah

1991
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:04,360
Uh, all right more healthy hearty happy hosts

1992
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,800
And you want that don't you?

1993
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,680
No, they want us to suffer. That's that's why they watch

1994
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:14,680
All right first voicemail

1995
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:17,560
Oh

1996
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:19,800
Gotta open up speak pipe

1997
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,600
Okay

1998
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,920
Well, the the first one is just a twitter meme

1999
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,560
Say the line luffy

2000
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:34,200
What does what does that mean? I'm gonna be the pirate king probably kaizuku is the pirate

2001
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:36,760
king

2002
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,360
Yeah

2003
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:41,080
Oh, or it doesn't mean pirates kaizuku is pirate

2004
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:47,400
I feel like the funny the funniest part of this meme is the fact that luffy's iconic like bursting out of the barrel

2005
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:52,920
Like is posed in the same way as all the kids in the classroom. That's the only that's the only thing that saves this meme

2006
02:04:54,440 --> 02:05:00,200
The fact that the he's they're asking him to say the line and he's just happy to do so and he's happy and everyone's happy

2007
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:02,680
I love to say the line

2008
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,880
Uh

2009
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:07,880
Next one is oh

2010
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:12,360
Sorry, no good voicemails this week either. Who is this?

2011
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:16,760
Is it a postman could this be could this be the voicemailer?

2012
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:21,400
Is this a self portrait maybe

2013
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:24,440
What had it what hat is that?

2014
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Where who wears a hat like that?

2015
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:32,120
Um, now we'll see now. We'll get some good ones. No, no, no, we're we're we're gonna make it

2016
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:34,440
Uh, next one is

2017
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:38,040
Write a tweet in the style of act drill about ben saint

2018
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:42,200
I asked ben saint what his favorite color was and he said the void

2019
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:50,360
This man is a walking black hole and I mean that in the best way possible. Hashtag bless hashtag ben saint

2020
02:05:52,840 --> 02:06:00,760
That's good void void void void. Yes. I'm into it. This man is a walking black hole

2021
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:05,640
I don't I have no idea what that means

2022
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,600
It's pretty drill like

2023
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:16,360
Um, uh kind of yeah a little bit. Um, it's a little out uncharacteristic of drill to be so positive about someone

2024
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:20,360
Yes, it's also like a little bit too coherent

2025
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:25,160
It's a little bit too like spelled correctly and like sounds normal

2026
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:31,960
Um, but um hashtag blessed hashtag ben saint. Yeah, true other with that true

2027
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:38,600
Uh, okay next one is called mad from cars suck at gmail.com

2028
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:41,320
three two one go

2029
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:51,320
Hey, so y'all were always or are always like oh post food post leave can't wait to change my body to

2030
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:54,360
robotics stuff

2031
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,360
Iro guys post car too

2032
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:02,680
Because a lot of younglings of my age like have no interest in owning a car and stuff

2033
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,720
Like I hate traveling too. I

2034
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:11,560
I'm never traveling again. Fuck you mom. I'm never going

2035
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:15,240
I have no interest in cars

2036
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:17,240
Yeah, I hate cars

2037
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:21,400
I'm I'm happy to that's literally why I live in boston is so I don't need a car

2038
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:25,160
I feel like I can just take the bus everywhere. Yeah, that's why I like living in london as well

2039
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:31,320
It's like yeah, there's buses everywhere. There's trains like so far into london beyond it's like

2040
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,120
such a hub such a hub of

2041
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:39,880
Going to places like literally almost I mean not every day, but like most days I hear

2042
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,080
Not not the roommate that knows my videos

2043
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:47,960
But two of my other roommates I hear one of them come upstairs and knock on the other one's door and be like

2044
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,760
Hey, man, can you move your car so I can pull out

2045
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:55,800
And it's like I would kill myself. I couldn't I couldn't deal with that every imagine

2046
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:00,440
It's like one of them has to move their car for the other guy or the other guy has to move it for the one guy

2047
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:05,960
They're just they're big and cumbersome. They're expensive. So if something happens to them, it's really bad

2048
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,920
You have to pay insurance just to own them

2049
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:12,040
You have to pay more money just to operate them in gas

2050
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:17,800
You have to get them in for repairs every now and then I can't even be bothered to get my human body in for repairs

2051
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,040
As often as it needs

2052
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:26,360
I don't need a freaking mechanical thing dragging me down even more. I I would I I hate I literally hate cars

2053
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:31,560
I hate them. I'm so grateful that I don't have to be fucking yoked with one

2054
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,200
I feel sorry for anyone that does

2055
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:38,280
And if I want to like feel the experience of driving

2056
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,520
Um, I could just play a video game that does that and I can drive off a cliff. You can't do that in real life

2057
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:50,360
Uh, if I that's what I would do if I were a dirty filthy car owner

2058
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,680
I would drive up a mountain

2059
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:59,080
And like in gta and I would and I would jump out of the like I would drive off cliff jump out of the door

2060
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:02,040
And I would get my parachute when my bazooka

2061
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,360
when I was at

2062
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:05,880
astro camp

2063
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:11,720
Uh, the drive up the mountain to astro camp. I mean some parts of it had guardrails on it

2064
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,960
some did not and like

2065
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:18,840
Some parts you were kind of close like the road went kind of close to an edge that like

2066
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:23,560
You would die you would go over the edge and you would fall a long way and die

2067
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,200
And it was really scary

2068
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:27,720
uh

2069
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:31,800
That's not really the car is fault, but i'm gonna blame the car for that anyway

2070
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:38,520
I do like the the um the experience of being driven sometimes like on like a cool

2071
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,840
I don't like country trail that you couldn't reasonably walk to

2072
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:46,840
And there's no trains like when when infrastructure falls away

2073
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:50,840
It is nice to have a little bit of a car moment, but like

2074
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:55,160
Not for the not like you don't need them in the city

2075
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:58,920
We don't need motorways as much as we think we do

2076
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:05,720
I don't I don't really like the car moment. I don't really like the experience of being in a car with people

2077
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:11,160
Honestly, I guess right driving by myself is like it's okay. I've done it before and

2078
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:15,320
It's not that bad other than the fact that driving is dangerous

2079
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:20,680
And I feel like I am extending my potential life expectancy by avoiding it as much as possible

2080
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:27,000
The experience of driving by myself. Okay the experience of being in a car with people. I don't like it. It's awkward

2081
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:30,760
I I would agree. I think it's it's just the sort of like um

2082
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:37,720
The the independence you have with a car to go to various locations is cool

2083
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,520
Yeah, it's just the fact that

2084
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:43,240
it's so

2085
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:48,040
Like people who own cars don't all go on cool road trips off-road to amazing places

2086
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:53,880
They usually just have a car and then they use it to go to like go and yeah to go into normal places

2087
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:57,640
It's a waste if you get a car you should have an adventure

2088
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,440
You should not replace your

2089
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:05,640
Like use it as a replacement for a bus because buses is easy. You just get on

2090
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:11,880
And I mean I get my groceries delivered and that costs me more than buying groceries regular

2091
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:16,840
I guess theoretically I could save money on groceries if I drove to the store and bought them myself

2092
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:22,520
But then I'd have to pay for car insurance and gas to do it. It would probably like not even make up the difference

2093
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:25,000
Uh

2094
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:29,640
I think if you're in a car you should go on like the cool you could go on on a magical adventure

2095
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,880
I think that's the only reason you should have a car

2096
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:38,760
You should go on a fucking jeep drive through the Sahara desert or not

2097
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:42,200
Sahara desert as savannah african savannah and see the lions

2098
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,880
I feel like there are other kinds of magical adventure

2099
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:50,120
That I could do carless and I think I would probably pick one of those

2100
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:55,080
Oh, yeah, I mean there's lots of adventures you could do but if you if you had a car

2101
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:59,880
That's that's the that's the morally correct way to justify it for you

2102
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:05,800
If they used it for that if they if they said they were gonna do that and they just never did then it's like

2103
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:10,040
Oh, yeah, well, you're wasting a lot of money betrayal betrayal

2104
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:16,680
Uh, okay, I guess we're I guess we're pretty much on the same page. Yep. Fuck cars

2105
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:19,640
Wars walk wars

2106
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:22,600
Fuck fuck fuck and fuck you

2107
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:27,880
Uh listener, uh the next one is uh from prince isolation. It's an image

2108
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:33,160
Sorry pinkie, but I just don't get what's so darn funny about a farm supply store

2109
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:36,280
What does it matter what the previous owner was called? Uh

2110
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,880
Uh, oh is that the

2111
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:47,720
The chuck suck and fuck. Yeah. Yeah, you mean sneeze feed and seed. Uh, whoops whoopsie

2112
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:54,760
I saw I saw a chat gpt to failing to explain why sneeze feed and seed joke is funny

2113
02:12:55,720 --> 02:13:02,940
Uh, that was kind of that was pretty good. Uh, okay next one is from prince isolation

2114
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,920
Okay, so this is this is me

2115
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:11,880
I was asking people in my discord like

2116
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:17,880
I I asked you the same thing about like shipping to the uk because I thought it might save money to have the books

2117
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:23,080
Shipped to a country or to the eu or to south america and then have a guy

2118
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:25,800
Or somebody in that region who would then

2119
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:32,600
Send the individual ones for me and I maybe I could just pay someone to do that. So I was asking around in my discord

2120
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:36,200
And then uh, okay

2121
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:39,880
So, uh, here here I am you're in chile, right? I got a question for you

2122
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:45,800
How much would it cost you to mail a one kilogram package from where you are to someone in another country in south america?

2123
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:51,000
I asked alias. I said it would cost him like 50 plus from argentina, which is insane

2124
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:54,840
I guess anyone in south america could theoretically answer this question

2125
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,800
we've got the

2126
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:01,400
I'm making drugs. I'm making drugs

2127
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:06,840
Yeah, you know, uh, was it gustavo fring is from chile, I think

2128
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:09,720
Uh, is that right? I don't remember

2129
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:11,800
well

2130
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:18,280
Here I am making drugs with slime gusts and slime jesse and slime waltz and they're they're jealous

2131
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:22,040
And this is what my room actually looks like pouring like liquids into beakers

2132
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:28,440
That are glowing. Oh, um, yeah, uh, one of those beakers that had the um

2133
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:35,400
The alcohol solution of the glowing, uh, quinine that I had extracted from the

2134
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:38,760
That I had extracted from the diet tonic

2135
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:43,320
Uh, one of the the alcohol eventually evaporated off and it started growing mold

2136
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:47,800
So that I need to get rid of that. Uh, I just noticed that yesterday. It's like dammit

2137
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:52,680
Dammit, but I got to examine it under the black light. I wonder if the mold would grow would glow

2138
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:58,760
Probably not there'd probably like a layer of the of the glowing stuff underneath it and the mold is just like on top of it

2139
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:01,320
is this slime to be

2140
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:06,760
What was the slime for just it was that to put on your teeth or like the stuff you were gonna put in the bottles

2141
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:12,840
The original idea was that I was going to cook it down into something that I could paint my teeth with to make them glow

2142
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Uh, that is like not

2143
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:20,120
There's such simpler ways of doing that so I'm not gonna do that anymore now

2144
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:22,840
I was just like cook it down to just see what happens and

2145
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:25,400
turns out what happens is

2146
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:31,320
Uh mold starts to grow on it when you let it grow until the alcohol evaporates. Yep

2147
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:35,560
Now I know, uh

2148
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,600
Next

2149
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:41,880
Next one is uh another image. It's an album

2150
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:49,000
Uh, I love images. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. That one had an audio with it. I forgot. Oh, okay. Three two one go

2151
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:54,360
Yeah, this is the most shy drawing I've ever done, but I just needed to get the thought out there

2152
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:57,260
Okay, it's fine. I am not sorry

2153
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:04,600
It's a good drawing prince. Uh next one is um an album

2154
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:07,800
Let's see

2155
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:10,120
Uh

2156
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:16,280
No, Ben sainte supports non consensuals

2157
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:20,040
You do

2158
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:24,760
It's not for me to have sex with someone it's two other people

2159
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:30,200
You do this is exactly

2160
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:35,880
It's exactly what happens. It's exactly how I would act in that situation. Yeah, I would think

2161
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:42,120
Let's let's let's let's intervene and fix this problem. We got a problem here and I got the solution

2162
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:47,080
Something funny just about the because these two people they're lying down on the bed

2163
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:51,480
And but you're standing straight up like next to the bed. I just walked past them

2164
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:57,080
You do actually actually, uh, I think uh

2165
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,960
Uh

2166
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:06,060
Thank you for that. Uh next one is called pretty good at I love card games at gmail.com

2167
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:08,440
three two one go

2168
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:14,440
You two are probably already occupied with trash. I mean games like fire and the mega man

2169
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:17,800
But if anyone wants to ruin their own life

2170
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:20,760
Check out monster train

2171
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:23,880
No, so train

2172
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:25,880
No

2173
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:28,120
I've already got a bunch of bad games that I don't like

2174
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:35,720
Even aside the ones that i'm contractually obligated to play monster train. Uh, it's got like it's got like the the the color

2175
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,440
red and blue

2176
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,680
Is that a problem?

2177
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:44,840
Well, it's it just sort of is the the main thing that every

2178
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:47,720
video game looks like on the cover

2179
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:51,320
Of this one's this one's a better image

2180
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:56,600
My first impression is oh, it's home. It's hearthstone and it's also generic in other ways

2181
02:17:56,760 --> 02:18:04,120
It does look generic. It does look like hearthstone. I mean the yeah, I know a lot of people use the orange and blue like whatever

2182
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:10,120
I'll never use orange and blue ever. This is a terrible voicemail. This is a terrible voicemail

2183
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,920
Just like hey, have you heard of this game?

2184
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:17,560
One no and you didn't even tell me what I why I should care about it

2185
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:20,040
Why even why?

2186
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:22,120
Oh

2187
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:25,640
We're in your life

2188
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:31,400
This is an awful voicemail. It's a waste of my time. Um, next one is uh called

2189
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:35,400
Well, it's uh god. It means a youtube link. Um, I said

2190
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:40,760
Hey, you missed one. There's another image. Wait, did I? Oh, yeah

2191
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:43,320
Uh

2192
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,560
This is me. Let's look at it. I guess

2193
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:49,240
Huh, it's give and take circuit to 2015

2194
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:51,560
Oh

2195
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:55,240
No, not the pretty dress. I guess in my coco pomel

2196
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:58,680
Uh, give and take review

2197
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:03,480
Uh, where I had a little of something guesting. I think

2198
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,520
They did the art

2199
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:09,640
And there was a joke about a pretty dress and I said no

2200
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:11,880
Oh

2201
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:14,360
Well now yes, yeah, I get it

2202
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:19,000
This is just like the end of the witch when the devil asks would you like a pretty dress?

2203
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:21,880
Would sell like a pretty dress

2204
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:28,120
Would sell like the taste of butter would sell like to see the world. I think that's what he has. Yes to all three

2205
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,960
Yes, please

2206
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,960
I love butter

2207
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:33,160
I do

2208
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:38,120
I wonder how many other things like that there are of me saying no, I would never be a female

2209
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:42,520
Uh, I don't remember that video in particular

2210
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:46,440
But I would never want to wear lipstick

2211
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:49,720
True

2212
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:51,720
Okay, next one is uh

2213
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:57,560
It's a youtube link. It's a it's a it's a geo center. It's a seven

2214
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:04,120
Okay, it's a it's a it's a flat earth conspiracy thing. Who cares? Okay

2215
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:09,000
Uh, next next one next one is goku sucks three two one go

2216
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:13,240
All right, you guys are artists, right? No

2217
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:16,120
The real question is

2218
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:20,600
How many of our original characters can beat goku? I have

2219
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:23,240
at least

2220
02:20:23,560 --> 02:20:25,560
Five so so

2221
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:29,480
None

2222
02:20:29,560 --> 02:20:31,560
None of my original characters can be goku

2223
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:38,360
Yeah, I guess I can't mine can't either so but but Clarissa has a gun she can shoot him

2224
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:41,400
She could just shoot him

2225
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:45,160
You ever think about that? It's true. Mm-hmm. It's like launch

2226
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:47,240
Yeah

2227
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:50,120
Did you I was looking at launch talking about baby goku?

2228
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:57,320
Yeah, baby goku. I mean if you got the if he got the right beast the beast hustler could maybe give baby goku a run for his money

2229
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:59,480
Yes

2230
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:05,480
But like launch in in dragon ball the lady who sneezes and changes her personality in her hair color

2231
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:07,880
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I love I love launch

2232
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:15,000
She I realized uh, not too like just the other day when I was looking for some reason at at her

2233
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:21,160
I was like wait, that's the reason I like girls with guns. That's the reason I like like the idea of gun girl

2234
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:27,000
She's blonde and she's got a gun and she hates you. That's funny. I like blue hair launch

2235
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,080
I don't like blonde launch

2236
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:31,320
I I like both of them

2237
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:35,720
They're so pretty. I like I like the I like the blue one. I like the one that's nice

2238
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:41,720
Actually, I have just like marge simpson just like just like marge simpson. Yes

2239
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:45,240
What if marge simpson sneezes and turns into

2240
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:52,680
Lisa uh lisa lisa's blonde. I just I just I just now have realized that

2241
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:58,040
Why are they blonde are the simpson's are the simpson's kids blonde? Is that what they're

2242
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:03,320
I mean, they they do not have a different color from their skin color

2243
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:07,080
Hair, they do not have brown hair. Homer had brown hair

2244
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:12,920
They do not have a marge had blue hair so marge was it

2245
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:15,640
Yeah, when she was a teenager it was blue

2246
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:22,600
But did she always dye it? I forgot if that was ever like established that she has a canon real hair color

2247
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:29,560
Uh, she dyes it blue now, but when we see her as a kid, it's still blue. So I mean

2248
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:32,520
I don't think she was dying it ever since she was a kid

2249
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:38,760
Oh, yeah, and our dad had blue hair. Yeah, so that that's just a thing not not not in every time we see him

2250
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:43,080
I think there's at least one time we see him when he had although that might have been when he was old his hair might

2251
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:48,360
I feel like the one where we see him and he's an a flight attendant. He had brown hair

2252
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:54,600
But I think there's another one where we see him with patty and selma and he had like you had like light blue hair

2253
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,640
I feel like it's inconsistent with with mr. Bouvier

2254
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:01,000
I am pretty sure the flight

2255
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:03,880
Oh clancy Bouvier. He's got orange hair

2256
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah, and I'm seeing the different images now

2257
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:11,160
knew it

2258
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:15,480
Because I watched I watched that uh, that uh, who's that one simpsons tuber?

2259
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:19,880
Real gyms. I'll watch the real gyms video about the mr. Bouvier

2260
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:24,120
So I know this look at the back of my hand

2261
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,440
Um, yeah, but gun girl is his lunch

2262
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:33,400
She shoots you she doesn't change her personality. I guess she does. I guess she does shoot me

2263
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:37,640
Yeah, she shoots you with angry eyes. It's like the perfect woman

2264
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,720
True

2265
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:43,480
I love a girl who'll

2266
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:44,840
shoot me

2267
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:47,720
Uh, next one is called. Um

2268
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:52,200
Wait a second. I didn't download that one. Next one is called a lost vagrant husk

2269
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:54,760
3 2 1 go

2270
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:59,080
When I saw the ova

2271
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:03,240
I thought that what I desired was

2272
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:05,720
Nate

2273
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,720
But I realized something

2274
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:13,000
Nate has not been here for years

2275
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:15,960
What I saw it was

2276
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,520
nearly a

2277
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,520
simulacrum

2278
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:22,680
The memory of him

2279
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Is dust in the wind

2280
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:27,800
being grown away

2281
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:30,200
Where they ever crushing

2282
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:32,680
obsession of

2283
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:34,440
time

2284
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,200
I

2285
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:38,200
Had an epiphany

2286
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:41,000
I no longer crave

2287
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:43,640
for

2288
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:45,880
succulents

2289
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,440
Ben

2290
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:50,040
I have lost

2291
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:52,040
my purpose

2292
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:54,040
What am I to do now?

2293
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:56,760
That I no longer desire to

2294
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,000
fuck

2295
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,600
a member

2296
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:01,480
of

2297
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:02,440
the

2298
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:04,040
PCB

2299
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:10,040
Well, you better figure it out before find purpose november rolls around. Oh my god. Yeah, remember that

2300
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:12,120
Wait to find my purpose. Yeah

2301
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:15,480
It's a few months away. So you got time, but uh

2302
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:21,720
Don't dilly dally because if you end no no find purpose november with no purpose

2303
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:28,120
The freaking uh, the the collectors come around like in homestuck and they say spit your purpose into this bucket

2304
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:30,200
And if you don't they kill you

2305
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:33,640
Uh true true

2306
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:37,160
So, you know, I I thought he was gonna say he wanted to fuck you

2307
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:44,280
Yeah, but now now he now he just has no one to want to fuck. No, it was it was it was Nate or nothing

2308
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:48,040
As the saying truly a tragic tale

2309
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:53,960
Uh, next one is called hey gibb comma three two one go

2310
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:58,200
Hey gibb, how do you feel when people sexualize you on the internet?

2311
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:04,040
I would ask ben but he already violates enough social contracts that I have no respect for him. Mm-hmm

2312
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:06,040
I

2313
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:08,280
Honestly don't like it all that much

2314
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:11,080
Hmm. I think

2315
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:13,160
It's it's fine up to a point

2316
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:18,760
But like weird comments. I've actually got a few weird comments. I just like

2317
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:21,480
so like

2318
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:26,200
You're a little presuming that I would be like just fine with you saying that

2319
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:32,760
Are you talking about on twitter or in youtube comments on twitter? I don't think I've seen that many youtube comments

2320
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:34,760
maybe a couple um

2321
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:39,640
And I guess I guess the the guy who does the voicemails where it's like whenever

2322
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:45,560
It's like oh, I saw gibb on twitter and he does like a oh come thing. That's his voicemail gimmick

2323
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:48,680
Uh, not a big fan of that but like

2324
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,880
It's obviously a goof. It's just sort of like ick

2325
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:54,600
A little bit achy. Yeah

2326
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,760
Yeah

2327
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:58,920
I feel you dog

2328
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,600
um

2329
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:07,320
Okay, and that's the answer next one is how to penetrate a social group

2330
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:13,640
Uh, wait, let me download that last one. Okay download how to penetrate a social group three two one go

2331
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:16,760
Okay, so let's say

2332
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:18,760
you um are

2333
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:20,760
know somewhere

2334
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:24,520
And you don't know anyone there and everyone there knows each other like

2335
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,240
How are you supposed to um

2336
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:31,560
Interact in such a scenario like

2337
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:36,200
Um, are you supposed to like I don't really

2338
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:40,040
I mean, so it's a tough

2339
02:27:40,360 --> 02:27:43,960
Question you just got it. You just got a pipe. You just got to find something to say

2340
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,840
You just got to think of something. I mean a lot of the time

2341
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:51,400
I have a lot of trouble with this when like everyone knows each other and I'm like, okay

2342
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:56,120
I know what I should do is like engage with a conversation. They're already having

2343
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:57,640
um

2344
02:27:57,640 --> 02:28:01,080
But then they end up talking about nothing that I care about and I'm like, you know what I don't care

2345
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:07,480
Like it's I should I should try a little harder. I guess if if they're already having a conversation

2346
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:09,880
I wouldn't necessarily say like butt into it

2347
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:16,280
Well, no, but like sometimes they're always they're always having a conversation with each other and you're never like considered

2348
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,240
so

2349
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:20,440
Yeah, you have to try and worm your way in somehow by either

2350
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,200
being something like a subject of the conversation or by just

2351
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:28,520
Having a quip having a point on what they were saying. Oh, I heard you were talking about this

2352
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:32,040
Did you know or like just I don't know. It's difficult

2353
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:34,280
It sucks

2354
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:37,480
you you kind of yeah, you kind of just got to try and uh

2355
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:42,280
You kind of just got to look for an opening and just say something

2356
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:47,320
And uh, you know, I guess if you're there for like first impressions

2357
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:51,800
Yeah, first impressions are like people say first impressions are very important

2358
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:54,360
and the reason I

2359
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:58,520
I don't think people like say this part because I didn't get it for a while

2360
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:04,200
The reason the first impressions are important is that's the only time that it seems normal

2361
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:06,760
to talk about yourself

2362
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:11,960
And what you do and who you are and what you like because if you know them from like having seen them already

2363
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:14,280
And you just sort of say hello every so often

2364
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:16,760
It is weird to suddenly come up to them

2365
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,720
Unprompted and start talking about what you like and asking them questions. I mean, it's not impossible

2366
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:25,960
But it's sort of the weird, you know, it's weirder to say it after you've met them

2367
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:29,800
Then well while you're meeting them, you know, I guess so. Yeah

2368
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:31,560
um

2369
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:35,320
Because once they know things about you they can think about you

2370
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:37,080
um

2371
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:42,840
When topics of conversation come up and think to include you or like to talk to you about something because they already know stuff

2372
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:47,480
I would say that if you're talking about be you're in like a I don't know maybe like you

2373
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:48,920
just

2374
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:53,160
Joined a new school or something or you're in a new job or something

2375
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:55,880
uh, I would say

2376
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:58,920
First thing is is don't be weird

2377
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:01,320
and don't

2378
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:05,640
Like you do want to like eventually break into the conversation and think of something and say something

2379
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:07,640
But you don't want to be weird about it

2380
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:14,600
So like I would say just be chill and like if there's if if they're not talking about anything you have anything to say about

2381
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:18,520
And there's nothing and you don't see any natural

2382
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:21,480
Way of like opening a conversation

2383
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:23,000
Don't force it

2384
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:28,040
And because you'll be weird about it if you just like be okay with like not saying anything

2385
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:33,080
Because it's normal to not have anything to say to people you don't know just be fine with that

2386
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:39,000
But if you see an opportunity or you see something you have an observation to make about or they're talking about something you have an interest in

2387
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:43,560
It's okay to pipe up and be like, hey, I have a thing to say about that

2388
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:46,440
Yeah, don't yeah

2389
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,760
It's it's always weird when the person is hovering because nobody draws attention to it

2390
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:52,680
But everyone can know

2391
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:57,000
Everyone notices when somebody's hovering around a conversation and not involving themselves

2392
02:30:57,720 --> 02:31:02,920
If you're just chill and doing your own thing like I was imagining it like a work environment if you're at a new job

2393
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:08,360
You're all there to do work. So it's not weird that you're in airshot of whatever they're doing

2394
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,160
Yeah, but like if it's more of a social setting

2395
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:16,600
It is odd to just go up to the group and

2396
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,560
Hang around

2397
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:23,880
Yeah, you definitely do not want to be some freaking uh silent orbiter

2398
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:26,840
That's not good

2399
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:30,600
Uh next one if you're gonna orbit you should do it in outer wilds

2400
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:38,840
Hey, honey, uh, did you bathe you smell great? Did you bathe? No, I used the Orion scent

2401
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:41,160
Well, may I orbit your belt?

2402
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:44,360
Sonichu

2403
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,360
next one

2404
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:53,640
It's a fake a fake ad that chris put into one of the issues of sonichu for uh, for uh, axe body spray

2405
02:31:55,160 --> 02:32:00,440
Great. Yeah. Yeah. You yeah, you're welcome. Uh, next one is, uh

2406
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,120
VVV work doodles, baby

2407
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:08,040
Oh my god

2408
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:10,600
Oh my god

2409
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:17,720
This is grotesque. Oh, this is the version of that. Jesus the image where you're big and I'm small at the table

2410
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:21,080

It's what we slog. That's what we what we strive to do

2440
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:40,760
Uh, the idea that the person who's having a boring life just wants it to be more uninteresting

2441
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,440
Yeah, I love having a boring life more of the pcp to that end. I've made my life boring on purpose

2451
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:33,720
So you will remain dead for those years following I will remain dead for those 90 years. Yeah, it seems likely

2452
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:39,240
It seems likely that implies you come back that implies there's a resurrection spell

2453
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:42,120
Well, I hope so

2454
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:44,120
Well, I sure hope so

2455
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:48,120
If you got resurrected after you were dead long after you were dead and you were a skeleton

2456
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:54,920
Um, uh, how would you what would you what? Uh, what's gonna happen? Huh? What are you gonna do about it?

2458
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:06,360
as a you you have the sensation of sight

2459
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:08,840
despite not having eyeballs

2460
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:11,880
Um, and I think that uh, I guess

2461
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Hearing but I guess that's it

2462
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:18,280
So you can move around and you can hear and see can I speak?

2463
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:24,360
Nope, you're a skeleton. Well, I would probably um, I don't know. I would probably

2464
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:30,840
Probably draw and write stuff then I'll just start drawing. I don't know

2465
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,800
I can still do that

2466
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:35,160
true

2467
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:39,480
Yeah, be fun to be a skeleton so not so you don't have to worry about not much would change anything

02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:15,640
Ben, you're like the oldest.

2573
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:17,640
You're like the oldest one.

2574
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:19,640
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'm the smartest

2575
02:43:19,640 --> 02:43:21,640
or that I have the most

2576
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:23,640
resilience to peer pressure.

2577
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:25,640
Certainly not.

2578
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:27,640
None of us have like the we were just too young to understand.

2579
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:29,640
No, we don't.

2580
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:31,640
Except for Munchie.

2581
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:33,640
Except for Munchie, yeah.

2582
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:35,640
And none of us stopped him.

2583
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:37,640
Well, hey.

2584
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:39,640
I'd live and learn.

2585
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:41,640
Live and learn.

2586
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:43,640
As I go.

2587
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:45,640
Hanging on the edge of tomorrow.

2588
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:47,640
No, the sonic one.

2589
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:49,640
Yeah, live and learn.

2590
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:51,640
Yesterday.

2591
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:53,640
Yeah.

2592
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:55,640
I forgot that part.

2593
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:57,640
If you beg or if you borrow,

2594
02:43:57,640 --> 02:43:59,640
something find a way.

2595
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:01,640
Right?

2596
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:03,640
I'm pretty sure.

2597
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:05,640
I don't know these things.

2598
02:44:05,640 --> 02:44:07,640
I'm a big sonic fan.

2599
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:09,640
That's more sinful

2600
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:11,640
than having said the N word a bunch of times.

2601
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:13,640
I would agree.

2602
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:15,640
Agree.

2603
02:44:15,640 --> 02:44:17,640
Did you see the sonic, the visual novel

2604
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:19,640
that they just

2605
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:21,640
released on April Fool's Day?

2606
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:23,640
Yeah, the murder of Sonic.

2607
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:25,640
I thought it was pretty funny.

2608
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:27,640
Yeah, it was pretty funny.

2609
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:29,640
I like when they do an April Fool's Day

2610
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:31,640
and then they actually do it.

2611
02:44:31,640 --> 02:44:33,640
They didn't just do it.

2612
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:35,640
Say it as a joke and then not make it.

2613
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:37,640
No, they actually made a little game.

2614
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:39,640
And that's cool.

2615
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:41,640
I think I've had my April.

2616
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:43,640
I hate April Fool's rant before,

2617
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:45,640
so I don't need to say it again.

2618
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:47,640
I don't really hate it so much

2619
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:49,640
as I'm just

2620
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:51,640
apathetic to the whole thing.

2621
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:53,640
Just like, yeah, okay.

2622
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:55,640
I don't think it's super amusing

2623
02:44:55,640 --> 02:44:57,640
to just see someone

2624
02:44:57,640 --> 02:44:59,640
and like, oh, hey, they posted a thing

2625
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:01,640
that they would never say.

2626
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:03,640
They're pretending they're going to do a thing

2627
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:05,640
that they would never do.

2628
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:09,640
Oh, it's misinformation.

2629
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,640
Yes, I love the April Fool's.

2630
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:13,640
Like, April Fool's,

2631
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:15,640
even though some people just do

2632
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:17,640
things that suck

2633
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:19,640
and all that,

2634
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:21,640
I do generally enjoy

2635
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:23,640
the feeling that it's

2636
02:45:25,640 --> 02:45:27,640
a time where

2637
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:29,640
everyone is on board with this one thing

2638
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:31,640
and they're all doing something.

2639
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:33,640
You know, it's a holiday

2640
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:37,640
and everyone's taking part

2641
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:39,640
and it just feels nice, I guess.

2642
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:41,640
The only thing that sucks about April Fool's

2643
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:43,640
is that for people

2644
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:45,640
who don't upload a lot and then they suddenly upload,

2645
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:47,640
it's just disappointing.

2646
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:49,640
And then the next day,

2647
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:51,640
all of the things in your feed are like,

2648
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:53,640
oh, yeah, that was from yesterday.

2649
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,640
That's a joke. Don't need to click on that.

2650
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:57,640
It's probably not going to be funny.

2651
02:45:57,640 --> 02:45:59,640
That's a joke. That's a joke.

2652
02:45:59,640 --> 02:46:01,640
There's nothing to watch today.

2653
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:05,640
Yeah, exactly.

2654
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,640
When it's fake content,

2655
02:46:07,640 --> 02:46:09,640
when there's not real content,

2656
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:11,640
people will say,

2657
02:46:13,640 --> 02:46:15,640
if they just said, oh, what if we made

2658
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:17,640
this visual novel where you

2659
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:19,640
solve the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog

2660
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:21,640
as a joke, that would be lame.

2661
02:46:21,640 --> 02:46:23,640
It's cool that you can actually play it.

2662
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:27,640
But I didn't play it because I don't care

2663
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:29,640
that much, but I just thought it was nice.

2664
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:31,640
And that's the last of the voicemails.

2665
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:33,640
We're done.

2666
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:37,640
Oh my goodness.

2667
02:46:37,640 --> 02:46:39,640
Plebenweeb.

2668
02:46:39,640 --> 02:46:41,640
Underneath three hours.

2669
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:43,640
Plebenweeb, Blu-rays, they're free now.

2670
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:45,640
The file, the ISO file,

2671
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:47,640
you can burn it to a disc.

2672
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:49,640
The Plebenweeb Blu-ray is free,

2673
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:51,640
stcomics.com.slashstore.html.

2674
02:46:51,640 --> 02:46:53,640
Jesse and Trixie both have my permission

2675
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:55,640
to make their own Blu-rays with the work

2676
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:57,640
that I did for them. They will not

2677
02:46:57,640 --> 02:46:59,640
because they do not care.

2678
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:01,640
Lamal.

2679
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:03,640
I'm still looking at this version

2680
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:05,640
in Saint vs. Chad Endless One and just seething

2681
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:07,640
because it wasn't funny.

2682
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:09,640
I thought it was going to be funny jokes, but no.

2683
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:11,640
It's just some cringe, Lord.

2684
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:13,640
Genuinely coping and seething and

2685
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:15,640
malding about my

2686
02:47:15,640 --> 02:47:17,640
own, about my savage

2687
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,640
own of their favorite idiot

2688
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:21,640
that they probably

2689
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:23,640
give money to on Patreon for some reason.

2690
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:25,640
For 18 Let's Plays a Month.

2691
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:27,640
Die, die, viewer.

2692
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:33,640
Sorry, I was in a fugue state. What were we talking about?

2693
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:35,640
We were ending the show. That's right.

2694
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:37,640
We were talking about Clarissa Gunsmoke.

2695
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:39,640
Go buy it on Amazon

2696
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:41,640
and Ko-fi

2697
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:43,640
and look forward to the perfect comic party

2698
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:45,640
where it'll be new

2699
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:47,640
and fresh and

2700
02:47:47,640 --> 02:47:49,640
it's the new thing.

2701
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:51,640
So this

2702
02:47:51,640 --> 02:47:53,640
the volume one

2703
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:55,640
is all the Clarissa that is

2704
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:57,640
done at the moment, right?

2705
02:47:57,640 --> 02:47:59,640
Yes. Chapters one to four.

2706
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:01,640
So the first three were already done

2707
02:48:01,640 --> 02:48:03,640
and the fourth one is

2708
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:05,640
exclusive for now.

2709
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:07,640
I...

2710
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:09,640
Well shit, I'll have to actually read that

2711
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:11,640
new one that I didn't realize was in here.

2712
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:13,640
Lol.

2713
02:48:13,640 --> 02:48:15,640
Thanks for telling me.

2714
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:17,640
Um...

2715
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:19,640
Become a patron

2716
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:21,640
patron.com.

2717
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:23,640
We will give you a shout out

2718
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:25,640
in the perfect comic party when that

2719
02:48:25,640 --> 02:48:27,640
comes out soon.

2720
02:48:27,640 --> 02:48:29,640
Also bonus content

2721
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:31,640
so many bonus episodes

2722
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:33,640
and the Radcon

2723
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,640
OVA commentary

2724
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,640
if you want to hear us opine

2725
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:39,640
about what all that means

2726
02:48:39,640 --> 02:48:41,640
to us in the year 2023.

2727
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:43,640
Anything else?

2728
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:45,640
Uh...

2729
02:48:45,640 --> 02:48:47,640
Nope. I think that's it.

2730
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:49,640
Alright, that's it. End of the show.

2731
02:48:49,640 --> 02:48:51,640
Thanks for listening. Under three hours

2732
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:53,640
we're out. We did it.

2733
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,640
A clean break. Okay, that's... Goodbye.

2734
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:57,640
Goodbye.
