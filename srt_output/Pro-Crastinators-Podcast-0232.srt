00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:23,160
With us we got me, everyone's favorite, Ben Saint, we got Gibbontake, we got Tom Oliver,

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,240
and we got our guest this week, who I am stoked to present to all our listeners, who I'm

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:39,760
sure you've all heard of Aria de Mezzo, the self-described transsexual anarchist satanist

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,080
running for Republican sheriff of Keen, New Hampshire. Did I get all that right?

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,680
Mostly except it's not Keen, New Hampshire, it's Cheshire County. Keen is just the largest

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,920
town in Cheshire County. Oh, okay, okay. So, right, even it's bigger than just Keen.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,200
Your power would have extended even further. Yes, I have, I want to ask one question before

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:16,160
anything else. Are you named after the song from Final Fantasy 6? I am. Yes, I got it.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:25,200
I did it. Okay, nice. Well, thanks for coming on. It's been a pleasure talking to you. I appreciate,

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:37,560
no, I'm sorry. I, yeah, so I, so I saw, I must have saw like a Twitter article or someone,

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,440
someone mentioned you and I followed it through to an article and I read about it. And I don't

13
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,400
know, just on a whim, I decided to look you up and I saw you on Twitter and I followed you. And

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:55,040
then like a couple weeks later, I think you followed me back and I was like, well, let's,

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,280
let's say hi. Let's say hello. Yeah, in general, I try to follow people back, especially if they're

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,440
like some sort of content creator. But you know, when this first started, I was getting just constant

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,080
notifications on Twitter. So I lost track of everything that I would have liked to have done.

18
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,080
But eventually I started catching up. You were, I saw you were followed by another guy I follow

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,000
called a bow of the fifth column. I'm not sure if you're, if you know him, but I saw that he was

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,360
following you. Okay, okay. I don't know him. I've talked with him on Twitter briefly. There was a

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,080
possibility that I was going to be on his show, but that fell through the cracks for us both. I

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,000
imagine he's actually a potential voter for me. Is he? Wait a minute. He lives here in Cheshire County.

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,560
What? Yeah, that's what he said. I thought he lived in like, I thought he lived in like Alabama or

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,320
somewhere down in the, in the Apple, Appalachia. Evidently not. That's wild. That's wild. Okay,

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,440
I had no idea. Um, I, I was, if I, if I were a Cheshire County voter, I think, I think I would be

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,320
happy to vote for someone running on a fuck the police platform. You know, we got, we got Ed

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,320
Markey here in Massachusetts running for Senate. He's fine. He's cool. He's not, he's not that cool.

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:16,680
So, um, I, I, uh, I endorse you. I think your platform sounds pretty good. I'm excited. I'm

29
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,560
excited to see you running. Uh, I find it a little inspiring. Uh, I find it, uh, I think it's great.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,560
I think it's, um, this past year I've contemplated maybe in the future I might try running for some,

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,120
for some office somewhere. Uh, but I don't know. I don't know which one or anything.

32
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Haven't thought that hard about it. Sure. I would recommend it. I would recommend everyone run for

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,840
some sort of political office, even if they don't intend to do the job. Like being the secretary

34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,560
of deeds or the register of deeds or whatever this, someone wrote me in for a land management

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,160
position of water management. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it's like,

36
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,360
instead of doing that, they should have just run for that office. I mean,

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,200
they would have been able to do anything, but they would have run for and wanted office and

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,640
could have gotten their message, whatever their message is, actually out there to people.

39
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,960
It's when I, when I got the, um, the, the primary ballot earlier in the year, I looked and like

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,120
the people on there, there were, there was, there were so many of like these minor like

41
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,840
city council offices where people running unopposed or like, you know, two people,

42
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,080
maybe two people running against each other who I, I went and I looked them up to compare them

43
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,000
and they had like no online presence. They had like no, I had like, I, it was, they had like no

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,440
profiles whatsoever. Um, and it made it, yeah, it got me wondering like, what, what, what little,

45
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,960
what position could I, could I sneak my way into and just like, you know, start, start fomenting

46
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,320
from the inside out. I don't know. Well, if you pay attention to your state's registry about who

47
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,000
has filed for office and who hasn't, if you find any blank places for either, either political

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,280
party, just go ahead and file for that because I think my nomination proves that they will just

49
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,640
vote for you because you're on their ballot. I think, I think that's a good segue because

50
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,880
we're talking about this Twitter article, but like not everybody who's listening to this podcast

51
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,240
may have seen it. So I, would you like to like kind of set the stage and like explain what you,

52
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,200
what your game plan was just for anybody listening who doesn't know

53
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,680
why, why you're even on the podcast, you know, like we haven't, we haven't set the scene at all. So

54
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,800
I figure maybe that might be helpful for someone who's like, who is this person?

55
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
I forget that not, not everyone is as clued in as I am.

56
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,200
So the plan was to become sheriff, right? I ran as a libertarian candidate for sheriff

58
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,840
two years ago and this year the Republican didn't file. So I ran instead. The libertarians lost

59
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,560
major party ballot access here in New Hampshire because of the poor performance of our previous

60
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,000
governor candidate. And I expect we, we probably won't get it back this year. So I would have to

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,560
go around and collect signatures and all of that crap in the midst of, you know, COVID-19 where

62
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,120
most people won't even open their doors to speak with me, or I could just join one of these other

63
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,040
political parties that already exist and already can bypass all of those hoops. And the Democrat

64
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,440
party in Cheshire County is very strong, which is unusual for New Hampshire. There's almost no

65
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,400
Republican presence whatsoever. So I took the weakest one and that happened to the Republicans.

66
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,520
And the goal wasn't to troll Republicans in any capacity that just sort of happened when

67
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,880
they went online and started complaining about, you know, how did this happen?

68
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,320
You, you would have done it. You would have done the same thing if it was the Democrat slot that

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,960
was open. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Okay. I was a little confused about the whole Republican-Satanist

70
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,640
anarchist thing, but that clears it up. If I'm, if I'm not mistaken, you are, you are also,

71
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,920
you're a high priestess. Correct. Correct. Of the Church of Satanism. I feel like I read that

72
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,800
somewhere. Of the Reformed-Satanic Church, actually. The Reformed, the Reformed, can you,

73
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm not sure what the, what the difference is between the Orthodox and the Reformed.

74
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,040
Well, the Church of Satan fought for 501c3 status so that they could be tax exempt like all churches.

75
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,080
And then they went on to proudly pay their taxes and they make it a point to always say,

76
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,080
hey, look, we're proudly paying our taxes. All other churches should. And I'm over here watching

77
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,560
the state drop bombs on weddings and doctors without borders hospitals. I was like, you are proudly

78
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,560
paying for that. I want nothing to do with that.

79
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,840
I see. Yeah. Okay. I understand. So, so you're a, I want to ask, so, so you ran in the past as a

80
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:55,240
libertarian. That would be, that was your party of choice before the, before losing a, I forget

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:04,360
losing a ballot status, right? Correct. And I, so I read that and I was surprised to see,

82
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,840
I don't know, what do you think? Tell me if you agree with this, but I, when I, when I hear about

83
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,480
libertarians, there's a, there's a strain of libertarian, especially like online, that is very,

84
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,440
it's pro gun, you know, a pro like anti taxes, but it's, it's like pro police. So,

85
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,040
like, you know, because police protect property. So I was a little surprised to see that, okay,

86
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,520
she is running, yeah, she, she runs on an anarchy, a fuck the police platform.

87
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,920
Do you have like a, do you have like a, do you consider yourself like a part of like a certain

88
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,960
ideological splinter group or faction with regards to that? Or what do you think about that?

89
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah, the label libertarian is kind of complicated and it can include a lot of different groups. Like,

90
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,600
if you take the most bastardized version as possible, you would have to include Rand Paul

91
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,800
as a libertarian, which he obviously isn't. There are a lot of socially conservative

92
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,560
libertarians who more aligned politically with the Republican party, but

93
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,680
consider themselves to be libertarians for whatever reason. There's also the left libertarians,

94
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:27,000
which is generally what I would count as despite being hardcore economically to the right.

95
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,480
What do you think about my man, Bernie Sanders?

96
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,520
I think he's probably a snake oil salesman.

97
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Oh dear. Okay. You know what? It's, it's okay. I can take it. It doesn't hurt my feelings.

98
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, I mean, he turned around and endorsed people that he adamantly opposes, right? It would be like

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,120
me going out and endorsing Donald Trump. Yeah, well, I mean, I wouldn't want to go that far,

100
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,240
but I know what you mean. He, yeah, I mean him and like, I mean, Noam Chomsky is another like,

101
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,880
is another like a lefty thinker or person who is like very much like lesser of two evils, like,

102
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,800
you know, vote Biden. It's, it's, it's an unpalatable position that, that makes me very upset,

103
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,960
but I understand where they're coming from when they do that.

104
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,760
For, for my part, I just turned in my ballot this morning.

105
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,800
The post office was closed. Thanks a lot, Christopher Columbus, but the, the town hall,

106
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,640
the town hall mailbox was open for early votes and I dropped mine off and I would have voted

107
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,800
Biden. I would have done it, but I thought about it and I said, what's the point of voting Biden

108
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,800
in Massachusetts? One of the blue estates in the union. So I thought, so I went, I went with a

109
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:50,440
pragmatic choice to do the most good with my vote and I voted green. Dab, dab. That was my,

110
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,720
that was the story of my morning. And I wish a happy, happy indigenous people's day to all of our

111
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,680
listeners. This will be coming out a week later. So it'll be too late, but the intention is there.

112
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:14,200
The intention is there. That's right. Um, yeah. Okay, that's all. Somebody else take over. Somebody

113
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,480
else say something. I've been rambling too long. Well, I mean, I gotta be honest, I haven't looked

114
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:32,520
up too much about you, Aria. No problem. I am very recently transgender. So I thought maybe

115
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:40,520
that could be something to talk about. How long have you been out as trans, I suppose?

116
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,040
Officially about three years, but the process really began five years ago. But you know,

117
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,920
it's a slow process. So yeah. So we had three and a half years, really.

118
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,760
Two, two, we've had two people. We've had two people in our little, in our little click

119
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,760
come out as trans in the last, in the last couple months.

120
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah, I really feel like it was accelerated by COVID and staying inside and being like

121
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:21,640
having nothing but your own thoughts is like, what if, what if, you know, my entire life was

122
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,920
wrong that I thought and it was all different. And a lot of people have been coming out as trans

123
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,960
that I know at least started with Digi. And then I was like, Oh, God. Oh, God, maybe me too. And

124
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,560
yes, it was me too. It was like six or seven months of just thinking about it. Recently, I've come out

125
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,800
and I'm on E already because I'm, I hate NHS sucks. Everybody can't get any of that stuff

126
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,920
legitimately. You have to buy it. Everybody is waiting for me to be the next one to come out

127
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:02,840
because I'm, because I'm already such a cucked soy boy. I don't know if it's going to happen,

128
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,160
but if it does, this will be stay tuned. This, this will, I'll announce it here if I'm going to do

129
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,960
that. Have you been thinking about it, Ben? I don't want to like push you into it, but like,

130
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,480
have I been, I, every, every time I see, every time I see someone speculate on that, I think about

131
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:29,000
how funny it is and a little annoying, but mostly funny. So yes, but not really.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,960
I had a similar issue getting estradiol here in the United States, but it was because I lived in

133
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,080
the South where doctors, you know, are very conservative. There was no precedent for a

134
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:49,400
male to female trans person in North Mississippi. So I went online to a international drugmart.com

135
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,200
is what they were. And I ordered them there. It's not ideal because it would take six weeks for me

136
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,600
to get them. And if I happen to run out, there were always delays. Sometimes it would take,

137
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,840
you know, 10 weeks or whatever. And I would just have to go that period without any of them.

138
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,800
So it wasn't good, but I was ultimately able to take those empty packets to one of the doctors

139
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,480
in Mississippi that I had rapport with. And I was like, Hey, look, this is happening.

140
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,200
Here's a year's worth of estrogen that I've been taking. Will you just prescribe me this so I can

141
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,680
just go to the pharmacy to get it? And he agreed. That's good. But we don't have the NHS here. I

142
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,920
understand that does complicate things. Yeah. I mean, the NHS at the moment is like, it's, you know,

143
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,200
free healthcare, but like, so, so badly funded by the government that it's so it's like,

144
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,760
completely unable to facilitate basically anything. My brother's been like having

145
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,160
been waiting like almost all year to get like a diagnosis on this leg problem that has been

146
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:02,360
making him unable to walk. And it's like, I feel like the problem he has could have been like

147
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,840
getting worse over that period of time. Obviously COVID is like taking priority. But even before

148
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:18,520
that, it's just it's been known that transgender prescriptions take months and months to get you

149
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,440
even in touch with a therapist through the NHS before they can like tell you ask you questions

150
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,720
for months and months. And then they can say, Okay, we think that you're, we agree that you're

151
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,840
trans. And now we're going to say you can have the thing. And it usually you're on a waiting

152
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,040
list for then years to actually get the thing. It's like, it's, it's like terrible. It's quote

153
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,200
unquote free. It's like the worst sort of video game ever. I went to a, you know, it's paid away.

154
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,480
I went to a consultation recently for breast implants. And the surgeon there told me that

155
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,000
I would have to have a note from my therapist authorizing it. I don't even have a therapist.

156
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,720
I don't need or want a therapist. I have six grand in cash. I want you to do this for me.

157
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,040
Why is that so freaking difficult? Why are we putting all of these roadblocks in the way of

158
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,640
trans people transitioning? Since women don't have to have a note from their therapist.

159
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,320
That's absurd. That's super fucked up when you put it like that, like you have to be

160
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,920
you have to prove that you're insane enough to want this in order to God. That's kind of like

161
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,960
what it is though, isn't it? Yeah. The implication is absolutely that trans people are by default

162
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,760
mentally ill. I mean, I could, I could understand to a degree if you're going through like your

163
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,040
health insurance and I needed to clear with like your provider or something. But if you have cash

164
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,400
in hand, if there shouldn't be any issue, you should just be like, here's the money.

165
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Like maybe, maybe if you're like, if you're like 13 or whatever, or like 16, but if you're an adult,

166
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,800
imagine being 30.

167
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,440
Like you would probably need some sort of written permission from an adult if you weren't quite

168
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,120
an adult yet. But like, if you have the money, you should just be able to get it.

169
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,760
I mean, especially over, you know, breast implants, those are easily removed if it turns

170
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,360
out that I don't want them. We're not talking, you know, sexual reassignment surgery here.

171
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,760
We're talking about just augmenting what is already here. Sure. And if I decide six months

172
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,200
from now, oh no, I wish I hadn't done this, they could easily undo it.

173
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,800
Yeah, that was one of my biggest like things thinking about it, like

174
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,720
taking estrogen is like, oh God, everything's going to change. What if I don't like what happens

175
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,240
in the future? But I looked into it and it's a lot of it is reversible except breast growth,

176
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:43,560
if that happens, it will happen to some extent. But then breast reduction surgery is easy.

177
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,200
It doesn't, you know, it's not too much of an issue to get it all back to how it was.

178
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,520
As long as I don't chop off my gonads, I'll be all right.

179
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:00,600
Exactly. I can do whatever I like. I am curious. I'm sorry, not not to derail,

180
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:08,760
not to derail or anything, but I did mean to ask about sheriff duties. If you become sheriff,

181
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,080
I read that you are going to have your sheriff's deputies police the regular police and pull them

182
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,600
over if they're like harassing people or like pulling people over. Are you still committed to

183
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,040
this position? Absolutely. That's so cool. Wait, no, no, no, it was better than that. You said

184
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,440
you want you'll have them do that or if they won't do it, they can just sit around in the

185
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,840
office and play video games. Yes, I respond to crimes where there are victims when those crimes

186
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,920
are reported. Yeah, sure. Or they can quit. Or they can quit. That's going to be the sheriff

187
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:48,440
department under my leadership. Will you quit your day job? Probably not, because I can't imagine

188
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,400
that the sheriff's department, as I envision it, will really require very much of my actual presence.

189
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,920
Do you get like, is it a salaried position, sheriff? I'm sure it is. Yeah, you're not sure?

190
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,200
I don't do it. I'm not doing it for the money. Sure, sure. But I mean,

191
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,520
that'd be funny if you became sheriff and then it just turns out like, I don't know,

192
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,440
now you pay you like six figures or something. I don't know what a sheriff makes, but that would

193
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,640
be pretty neat. Oh, the other thing, you've been getting, you've been posting on Twitter,

194
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,840
you've been getting hassled, right? Someone's been fucking with you and your campaign

195
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:38,520
right? Several people seem to have been. Yeah. Can you tell us about that? Well,

196
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,920
yes. So I have a sign in my yard that says, fuck them both 20. It's a presidential sign,

197
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,560
and someone keeps stealing that one up. I don't know if it's because they don't like that it

198
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,200
actually has the word fuck on it. Most of my signs for, you know, me running for sheriff,

199
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,360
they don't actually have the word fuck on them, but these do. And I'm not putting them up around

200
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,720
Cheshire County. I'm just putting it in my yard. But someone keeps taking it. It hasn't happened in

201
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,880
more than a week though. And I think it's because the last two people who did it found out very

202
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,360
quickly that I do in fact have security cameras and they are clearly there on YouTube stealing the

203
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:23,000
sign out of my yard. But more recently, I think it was Saturday night, someone in a gray Chevy

204
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,360
pickup truck went around Cheshire County pulling up almost every single one of my signs.

205
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,760
A woman saw this and reported it to the police. Presumably she also gave them the plate number

206
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,440
of the pickup truck. Police then contacted me asking me if I wished to file a report or do

207
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:50,200
anything about it. I thought about it and I ultimately declined. However, this is actual

208
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,320
property theft. There is an actual victim when it comes to property theft. And I will pursue it

209
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:05,560
if it happens again, because I lost $1,500 in signs that one night. And then I had to go back

210
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,960
out and put them back out there the next day. So I lost time. What do you think? A disgruntled

211
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,640
Republican? That would have been my first assumption, except one of my friends lives here

212
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,280
in Keen and he's got an apartment and he had one of my signs in his apartment window

213
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,920
that's on the ground floor. Someone actually ripped his screen out of his window. They stole my sign

214
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,280
and they replaced it with a Rivera for share of sign. Rivera is the incumbent Democratic candidate.

215
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,840
So it could be upset Republicans and it could be upset Democrats. Or it could be both. I think

216
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,640
if it's both, it's proof that I'm doing something right. But I can't identify.

217
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,000
They've put aside their differences. They've formed a truce. I mean, that doesn't even sound

218
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,320
like a joke. It sounds like, yeah, of course they would do that.

219
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,280
I'll upload the status quo, I suppose. Yeah. It's all the corporate wing at the end of the day.

220
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,400
This is really interesting because I read one article about this because I found,

221
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,240
I think it might have been you retweeting it or something, Ben. And at first, I thought it was

222
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,760
like a complaining article like from like a more of a right-wing slant, like, oh, there's this crazy

223
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,680
person trying to run for sheriff. But then I quickly realized that was not the case and it was way

224
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,440
cooler than that. But I thought I read at the end of the article that once you, you would like

225
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,840
withdraw your candidacy or something, but like now you're saying no, like you're going through this

226
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,760
and you have plans to change the way the sheriff's department works, which sounds sick. Do you have

227
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,760
any other interesting ideas besides like policing the police? What are your platforms? What are

228
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,000
you campaigning on right now in a general sense? Liberty, individualism, and the right of individuals

229
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,120
to do as they want as long as they don't hurt people. That's the wider philosophy that I'm

230
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,680
trying to get out there that I'm campaigning on. Good. Okay. I'm getting swayed. I'm getting.

231
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,280
Here in the United States, the police routinely violate that. And it's because of the mythology

232
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,200
of the state. You know, we don't call it kidnapping. We call it arresting. We don't call it,

233
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,840
you know, extortion. We call it fines. We call it tickets. But if you're a victim of having

234
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:31,080
been extorted for money or kidnapped, then in 99% of cases, made up statistic, by the way,

235
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,400
it's going to have been a police officer who did that crime to you. It's going to be a police

236
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,280
officer who extorted money from you, threatening violence if you didn't comply, or kidnapping

237
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:47,480
and threatening to kill you if you didn't, if you resisted the kidnapping. I oppose kidnapping.

238
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,960
I don't believe police should be out there kidnapping people for crimes where there are no victims.

239
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:01,960
The, they say, you know, when, when the punishment of a crime and like the punishment for lots of

240
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:09,960
crimes is like fees and fines and stuff. And it really bugs me that basically that means

241
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,520
that crime is just legal if you have enough money. Like if that's the punishment for crime,

242
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,280
you can, that's just saying, okay, if you have the money to burn, you can commit this crime.

243
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,320
But like, you know, someone who doesn't have money can't do it in the same way.

244
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,400
That's very true. But someone who has money would just get an attorney and a private defense,

245
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,640
a private attorney and the private attorney would just go in there and get the charges dropped

246
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,680
or get a not guilty. The entire system is like that. They don't care whether you're paying

247
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,320
in a private attorney or whether you're paying the state by pleading guilty because that's what

248
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,040
your public defender told you to do. They don't care. The entire legal system is set up so that

249
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:55,000
you're going to pay someone and it doesn't matter to the judge or to the DA or to anyone else who

250
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,320
you're paying because that defense attorney, he wants to one day be in the judge's spot. That

251
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,280
judge, he used to be a defense attorney. That defense attorney, he used to be a public defender.

252
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,480
They're just constantly rotating through and they don't care which one of them is actually

253
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,000
getting the money as long as you're paying one of them. And if you can't, I mean, like if you

254
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,600
can't pay anyone, then you can always just get sent into the private prison industrial complex.

255
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,720
There's money to be made there. Fuck money. If you don't have any money, we can monetize your

256
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:38,120
labor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It can be... What is it? Meme on Twitter. I've been seeing this week.

257
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,960
It's that face Kamala Harris made at Mike Pence's sassy face. Like point of view, you're up for

258
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,960
parole, but the prison industrial complex industry is booming. Like no thanks. Actually, no, I don't

259
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:02,120
think so. USA. USA. USA. And of course, the police love to be out there arresting people for this

260
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,960
kind of nonsense and finding people because otherwise, you know, they can't pay their bills

261
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,600
and they can't justify their own employment. If police officers, if all of these police

262
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,840
departments out the United States only responded to crimes where there were actual victims,

263
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,960
instead of going out and responding to crimes like, okay, this guy is selling cigarettes or

264
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,840
this guy is smoking pot or whatever, they were only responding to victim crimes. We would

265
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:31,720
immediately see in the United States that we could cut 19 out of 20 police officers and we

266
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,800
could still accomplish that same amount of work. 100% agree. Yeah. And they don't want that. That's

267
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,040
why police unions are against ending the drug war. That's why police officers are against

268
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,640
ending the drug war because otherwise they can't justify their own employment.

269
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:55,320
It's the same with real war. You kind of want war to be happening so you can sell all those

270
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:02,920
bullets you're making. Yeah. That's why Lockheed Martin is so pro-war. They need customers or

271
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:15,720
victims. Yeah, I'm a big, you know, it's like you can invest in like other things like social

272
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,560
programs and like education and stuff, social welfare and that's whatever infrastructure you want

273
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:29,480
that like prevents crime or you can invest in, you know, the police which, you know, fight crime

274
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,840
or, you know, you know, persecute it or whatever. Well, that's what we're told, right? We're told

275
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,560
that they fight crime but police have no obligation whatsoever to protect. The U.S. Supreme Court has

276
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,560
upheld that. You had that school cop in Florida who ran and hid during a school shooting.

277
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,360
Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. And he had the Supreme Court ruled again that he had police

278
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,400
officers, no obligation to protect anyone. If they walk down the street and they see someone,

279
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,440
they're getting their head kicked in, they're not required to actually intervene.

280
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,320
That's so fucked up. I wish I wasn't required to like flip burgers when I worked at McDonald's.

281
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,480
Like you're supposed to do it but you don't have to. If it gets busy, you can just kind of go in

282
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,960
the back and like play video games for a while. You just run away because like it got too stressful

283
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,720
That's really messed up when you think about it. What's your position on victimless crimes?

284
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,840
Because if they're not the police's job, should it just be decriminalized or should there be

285
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,880
another kind of support layer in place to take care of those kind of things like drug issues

286
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,400
or anything else of that matter? Well, ideally, they would just be legalized. Of course, that's

287
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,080
not within the purview of a sheriff. But yes, sex work, drug work, all of these things,

288
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:47,160
they should be legal. We don't have people, we don't have Budweiser trucks getting blown up

289
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,560
as they deliver their fear to convenience stores because alcohol is legal.

290
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:59,480
We don't have sex trafficking in large numbers in these places that have decriminalized sex work

291
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,040
because it's legal. It's happening there above the board. People can check it, make sure everything

292
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:13,160
is legitimate. Even for like harder substances, anything that you would make the argument like

293
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,600
this is bad, like this is like a social ill like heroin or I don't fucking know, whatever.

294
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:30,200
The punitive model of policing and sentencing is really fucked up that you get sent to jail for

295
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,680
that. They're road pirates. Because it is a victimless crime. I mean, ideally, I think we would

296
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,400
have really easily available counseling services and rehabilitation services. But even in the

297
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:49,080
absence of that, it would at least be better if you didn't go to jail. Sure. I mean, it's weird

298
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,080
because we generally believe in bodily autonomy, but we have this whole drug war which kind of

299
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,920
spits in the face of that concept from like, it's very rude, which is really strange.

300
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,120
Yeah, I don't like it. I don't like it very much. It's not that great.

301
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:15,000
You should bring back gladiatorial combat arenas because the police, you know,

302
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,320
you could tell them, oh, you're supposed to like, you're not supposed to punish people,

303
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,280
but punishing people is fun with extreme violence. They want to do it. They want the itching to beat

304
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,480
the shit out of anyone they can see. That's probably why you're cops, yeah. So you just give

305
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:41,080
them a different job, make it a sport, make them kill each other. Give them, you know, hard, like

306
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,640
heavy metal objects. I thought you were okay. So instead of like, no, no, no, we can fund the police,

307
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,040
but like we fund them with like, we give them like Klingon, like Battle Place or whatever.

308
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,000
I thought you meant like, we bring back like a trial by combat, like in Game of Thrones or

309
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,880
whatever, like, you know, we don't need police. The DA will challenge you to single combat to send

310
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,680
you to the prison industrial complex or whatever. They have all this rage inside. They need to let

311
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,640
it out somewhere. So turn them on each other. Give them a faction name. They don't want a fair

312
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,680
fight. You know, they want they want to kick the shit out of somebody that has less power than them.

313
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Blindfolded. Blindfolded. And they just like are told that they're fighting a child.

314
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,520
And they never have been, but they don't learn.

315
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,880
I mean, you're right. Police obviously do. They're predators. So they seek out the weakest

316
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,280
people to attack, just like all predators do. You know, lions out in the Savannah,

317
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,720
they don't go after the healthy gazelle. They go after the one that's already injured or the one

318
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:58,040
that's sick and can't run as fast. Same thing, cops do here. I mean, I mean, cop is already

319
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:05,240
statistically a fairly safe job. But you know, but everyone's like, oh, you can get shot. Oh,

320
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,960
if you're a police, you can get shot. You know, why are risks getting shot going after like a

321
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,520
dangerous criminal when you can just go after a nonviolent drug offender who's not even going to

322
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:25,560
do anything. Yeah. And whether or not required to do either fight back. Yeah. Yeah. Um, man, boy.

323
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Yeah, fuck the police. We can all agree on that much.

324
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,480
General power dynamics and the police are in a great position to have a lot of authority and

325
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:46,440
power over the general population. I spend way too much time on Twitter, getting mad,

326
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,480
getting mad at people, quote unquote people, quote unquote journalists, just retweeting some

327
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,920
bullshit about about how like, you know, protesters are gonna are, you know, burning down, burning

328
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,880
down the entire West Coast or whatever. And we need to we need to deploy more secret police or

329
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,800
whatever into cities to, you know, to quash it. This is like, this is the thing that like makes me

330
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,720
matter. This is the thing that I'm like addicted to is seeing Tim Poole tweet some of that and

331
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:26,600
say, oh my God, oh, Biden's gonna, Biden's gonna come for your parents if he's elected and I'm

332
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,480
hooked on the rush, the rush of the fury. I don't think that's healthy. I don't think that's healthy.

333
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,400
Yeah. It's a victimless crime, though. So I can't stop you. You don't think so. You don't think,

334
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,240
you don't think that's that's a good way to be spending my time? You know, your life. I'm not

335
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,480
gonna tell you what to do. That's right. That's right. That's right. You better fucking not.

336
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,080
No, Ben, you have to be producing media for me to consume. How about I throw you down a fucking

337
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,440
well instead? Oh God. Well, you know, that actually relates back to your question about heroin and

338
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,960
particularly destructive substances like crocodile met crystal meth and all of that, you know, I

339
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,880
may not think it's a good idea for someone to do it. I may not think it's healthy, but that's their

340
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:17,800
call to make. Sure. Sure. Yeah. The education should be there and that's all. The education

341
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,200
should know what the risks are and then they can decide. The education, hopefully, and then for

342
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:30,200
when that fails, you know, ideally, you know. Well, we do have support groups like Alcohol Anonymous

343
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,520
and things like that. I mean, we would probably have those for other drugs. Sure.

344
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,400
And failing that like a like a snarky side eye, like, are you really gonna be looking at Twitter

345
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:47,160
comments? Oh, like bullying? Oh, yeah. Oh, like if someone like you just bully someone who's doing

346
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,840
heroin and like make them feel bad about it. You think that would work? I don't know whether it

347
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,880
would work. I'm not a fan of bullying. That's what the police do. And I don't want them doing it.

348
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:08,520
I, I agree. It's, that's what people say, like, ooh, we have to, we have to, we should, we should

349
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,360
fat shame more people. If we fat, yeah, that doesn't mean there would be there would be less fat

350
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,400
people. That's a really great line of thinking that has proven to work time and time again.

351
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah, there's no collateral damage involved in that at all.

352
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Same, same. I mean, what is same thing with drugs? Same thing with

353
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,920
crime, generally. Same thing with anything we don't like.

354
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Race. Don't ask me what I mean by that. Like a formula one. Yeah, like formula, like formula one.

355
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,880
That's right. That's correct.

356
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:50,280
Damn. Okay. Okay. So anyone play any good video games this week?

357
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,560
I really want to play Genshin Impact because I've heard good things about it, but recently I purchased

358
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,520
the Link's Awakening remake and I haven't even had the chance to sit down and play that yet.

359
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,400
It's been at least a month since I've played anything and that sucks.

360
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,520
I keep seeing video of Genshin Impact on my timeline and thinking like that looks pretty cool.

361
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,280
That looks pretty cool. I, okay, but I read that it's a gotcha game and I don't really know what

362
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,480
that means. I don't quite, I don't think I quite understand what Genshin Impact is.

363
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:37,320
As far as I understand a gotcha game is one where you, you do a whatever gameplay and then you

364
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,480
get points that you can spend to randomly collect more of a character or a thing

365
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:50,120
and you're, you know, it's a lot of work based on what you get and a lot of them have anime girls

366
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,480
and the rare ones are the best ones. It's loot boxes to unlock new characters and the idea is

367
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,960
you spend real money to get fake money in the game to spend on these boxes. There's a whole

368
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,560
Breath of the Wild clone built around it to incentivize the spending of said money.

369
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,240
But aside from that, I mean it's like a, it's like a open world like what MMO? Like a free to

370
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,640
play MMO? It looks, I think it's a Breath of the Wild clone because like the aesthetic of the game

371
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,560
is almost identical to the Zelda Breath of the Wild. So I'm assuming the mechanics are probably

372
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:30,040
pretty similar. But it's multiplayer right? Or am I crazy? I don't know. I haven't looked into it too

373
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,040
much because as soon as I heard it had gotcha mechanics I'm like oh I'm too emotionally weak

374
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:42,200
to resist those things. I refuse. I'm pretty good at resisting the siren song of paying for things.

375
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:49,000
So I am unless I like it. Like if I like something I'll, I'll, I'll lose all of my, my

376
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,960
reservations. I will like play a game free to play even though I'm not having a good time just

377
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,440
because I refuse to spend any money. I'll play it for like 200 hours and I'll be like nope I'm

378
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,680
able to play it for free. I'm gonna play it for free. I don't care. I just hate the business model.

379
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,000
I think it's shady and corrupt. I mean if you want to charge me for your game, fine.

380
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,640
Charge me for your game but don't, don't present it as free and then withhold massive amounts of

381
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,200
content until you get money from me. The business model is like it's not only

382
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,280
is it corrupt, like everyone is perpetuating it knows it is. There's a, there's a great,

383
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:33,480
I don't know, I say great with quotation marks, talk on that kind of monetary incentives on

384
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,160
YouTube called Let's Go Wailing and the guy opens up his talk saying like, now just because

385
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,200
this one, we can talk about the ethics of this at a later day and I'm like if that's how you open

386
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,440
up your talk you know you're about to like open the can of worms on some evil fucking shit and

387
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,360
he just goes on for like 40 minutes about like this is how you literally fuck everyone who's

388
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,040
playing your game over and trick them into spending money and I'm taking great pleasure in

389
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,680
and revealing how I've screwed over my customer base and it's just like wow wow you are scum please

390
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:11,640
die. I mean it's like some kind of the balancing act of like you know you got your free to play

391
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,520
game obviously though you want to monetize it so you got to put in you know loot boxes or

392
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,400
microtransactions or whatever you're going to do it and you got to balance it so that it looks

393
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,920
to the to the greatest extent possible like these are a non-essential part of the game

394
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,640
but that actually is as enticing as possible well you know yeah I mean and actually does

395
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,800
gate off as much as you can get away with right like the only reason people spend money in those

396
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,920
things is because they're enticing for some reason whether it be if it's like in fortnite the

397
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:52,360
cosmetics are um you know if you're a kid at school and you don't have the cool cosmetic you

398
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,160
don't have the cool dance you haven't downloaded all of the stuff then you get bullied for being

399
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,120
the shit kid the poor kid you can't spend the money on the game so for them it's like oh I gotta

400
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,400
do it otherwise I'm an outcast and it's not even like it's not like a social byproduct of playing

401
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,720
the game like that's inherent to the design from the get-go like in this wailing talk the guy talks

402
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,800
about you have to create a culture of consumption in your in-game economy you have to like if you

403
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,280
playing with your friends you have to build in that every time one of your friends buys something

404
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,000
you get a notification so you feel like you're missing out by not purchasing things and just

405
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,240
like all these little psychological tricks to like pray on like the herd mentality and the

406
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,360
fear of missing out like from people like you know in real life that are playing the game with you

407
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,120
to try and just manipulate you into spending money and this guy's just up on stage with a big

408
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,000
shit-eating grin like this isn't as great how he can just make money off of like stupid people

409
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,560
and I'm just like I hate this this is the most uncomfortable youtube video I've watched in a

410
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:58,200
long time. I've wondered like you know I mean people talk about whales and like there's I guess

411
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:04,040
there's two kinds of whales this either just people with too much money to spend or people who are like

412
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,920
who have like like an addictive personality yeah a compulsive personality that's like

413
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,840
and I wonder like to what extent to what extent does whale money come from you know one versus

414
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:21,400
the other because like I would think if it's largely just like a lot of people with too much

415
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,040
money to spend and then like a few people that are like you know psychologically vulnerable

416
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,640
I think I would think it was less bad like you know what I mean I have no data to save one

417
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,680
way or the other but I have a feeling that it would be more in line with you know people's

418
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:47,160
not like that they have a compulsive spending sort of personality but the games as a medium have

419
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,800
fine-tuned the act of making people want to spend money on all of these games so well that it

420
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,040
affects far more people than it used to. Well when you think about it like if you're like

421
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:06,440
if you're like 18 right now you've grown up and video games have just always had microtransactions

422
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,320
oh yeah what do you mean like this is just what video games are. That's so fucked up. My brother

423
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:17,640
was talking about this uh this he was he's had this Minecraft server that he's been making

424
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,880
and he's a programmer so he's had all these cool things in it but he hasn't bothered with like

425
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:29,800
paid services and and like buying ranks or buying levels or whatever you know every other

426
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,320
Minecraft server is like extremely pay to win if you jump into the server you can go to their

427
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:42,440
website and buy hundreds upon thousands of you know dollars or pounds worth of stuff for your

428
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,560
Minecraft account in that server and um he's had friends tell him that they want to pay for things

429
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,720
and when they jump into a new Minecraft server they if there's nothing to buy they feel like

430
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,600
it's a bad server like they just have outright said that they think it's a bad server if they

431
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,360
can't pay to win because they expect it so readily it's so prevalent. What do you what do you pay for

432
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:14,120
in Minecraft? Well the servers are like modded so that you know they have uh the admin creates

433
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:21,240
a world um and has stuff and maybe there's like skills like you can get a special ability to mine

434
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,200
really fast or something or you can pay for like a your own private plot of land to build your own

435
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,960
Minecraft house that nobody can grief or something like that stuff that you could get in game by just

436
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:41,000
playing or you could pay and just get it quicker and people like are legitimately interested and

437
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,800
happy to be able to pay for that because they know and have been and like through all these

438
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,240
triple A games that have sort of pushed the idea that games are boring and long and arduous and

439
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,640
terrible and not fun unless you pay so if they there's no microtransactions they they automatically

440
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,400
don't like what they're looking at they're like oh what I can't pay to skip the grind because they

441
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:13,480
can't imagine a game that doesn't feel bad to play. Civilization is in decline. It's the end.

442
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,640
We have to go back. We've roamed and fallen a day you know. This is this is this is the beginning

443
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:31,800
of the end. It sucks. Well that it does yeah blows blows pretty hard. I want to make a game that is

444
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,000
the best game ever but unless I put a microtransaction in I won't get any money because people think

445
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,240
it's lame and I mean you could just sell the game to people. Oh my god.

446
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:55,080
I'll put a whole price tag on it. Right. It's perfect. Yeah. Why didn't someone else think of

447
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:01,800
this. People are actually this is a new idea. This is a brand new is the future of gaming looks

448
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,880
actually looks worse because a lot of triple A developers publishers have learned that you know

449
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,240
they can still sell the game at sixty dollars but then include a ton of microtransactions and DLC

450
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:19,880
that should be part of the season pass that idiots are paying for anyway. I didn't buy Skyrim until

451
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,000
about yeah two years ago because I wasn't going to buy it until it was actually finished.

452
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,680
They just keep releasing Skyrim over and over again. I don't understand.

453
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,640
I don't understand how we as a culture have not become sick of Skyrim.

454
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,880
Yeah. Yeah. I've never played it on Elder Scrolls but you're still sick of it.

455
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,840
Morrowind is better. Why didn't they just stop?

456
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,680
They're making the sixth one. They could sell Skyrim like seven times.

457
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh wait wasn't Bethesda recently bought by Microsoft. Microsoft bought Xenomax which

458
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,080
owns like all that including Bethesda. So they might actually make another one.

459
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,120
They already said they were working on six like two years ago. They're just going to take forever

460
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,680
because they're also working on Starfield and a bunch of other games and they're going to sell it.

461
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,480
They're going to sell it for money. Probably and then they'll fill it with microtransactions.

462
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:30,600
It's funny. It's funny. People are actually usually pretty okay with just buying a thing

463
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:36,280
if you can even believe that. People are generally willing to make a straightforward exchange

464
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,240
of currency for a user service. The road to this point though has been very,

465
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,560
very gradual. Like you said Rome didn't fall in the day. First it started with releasing games

466
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:51,720
half finished because oh we can just patch it later. Then they added DLC which then of course

467
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,040
they started cutting content from the game that was already on the disc so that they could resell

468
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:02,200
it to people as DLC. Then they kept adding DLC and season passes and then they created DLC that

469
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,280
didn't count for the season pass and then they just started adding microtransactions and now we

470
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,000
have all of these things and a typical game to get Skyrim completely if it had microtransactions

471
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,200
would cost tens of thousands of dollars. As it is, it's probably going to be a $250 game if

472
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:29,000
someone bought it as everything came out. $50 for the game, $50 for Dragonborn, $50 for Hearthfire.

473
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:38,040
It's insane. It's not as much a AAA thing but it's more of an indie thing but I guess

474
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,080
increasingly there's crossover between those two sectors now. Games that come out early access

475
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:52,920
but like charge full price and then never really reach a point of ever being done because everyone

476
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,240
already bought it in early access. So what did they care? They made their money. It's like the

477
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,400
Final Fantasy VII remake. I'm not ever going to touch it because Square Enix is promising like

478
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,640
six of these things and I didn't think it needed to be remade anyway and I don't trust the current

479
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,960
company to actually do the job. If they want to bring on the team that made the original and have

480
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,440
them remake it, sure, I'd probably play that but they promised they're going to have like six

481
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,160
different parts to it. I will be stunned if they ever get past the third part.

482
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:28,120
I mean the first part took like, I don't know how long they were working on it or how many times

483
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,040
they reworked how they were going to do it but the first one took years and years to come out,

484
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:39,800
right? Yeah. So how are they going to fucking do six parts? Six parts? It'll be like 20,

485
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,880
it'll be like 2045 by the time. Wait, I thought they were going to do three parts. I heard it was

486
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:56,280
like, so like, oh. Those are like Resident Evil. I think it was Revelations II that had the,

487
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,120
but any example of these games that, oh, we're going to release this in parts over the next,

488
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:09,080
you know, 10 years or whatever, none of them have fulfilled that promise. Yeah. I never trust

489
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,280
like something that comes out with chapter one. I'm like, okay, I don't care. Come back when there's

490
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,680
the full thing. Maybe I'll have a look at it. I don't want to be strung along for an indefinite

491
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,960
period of time to see maybe if they will develop the next part. You know, things happen. I can't

492
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,440
trust it until it's fully finished, which means I don't, I don't get into a seven part series.

493
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,760
Oh yeah. Namco cut their funding so they had to put four games worth of plot into the third one.

494
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,480
I didn't know they even made a third one. I remember they made the second one and it wasn't

495
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:52,280
as good as the first one. Yeah. And I think I gave up after that. Well, I have to get ready for work.

496
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,600
Oh yeah. I guess we've, I guess we've been going for an hour. All right. We, we can,

497
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:07,960
we can maybe move on to doing answering voicemails. And Aria, thanks so much for coming on and anyone,

498
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,680
any of our listeners in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, I would recommend,

499
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,200
I would endorse that they vote for you. Oh, thank you. Thanks for having me on.

500
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,400
Yeah. I'm, I really appreciate you coming on. Thanks so much.

501
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:27,720
Take it easy. Thanks to you. Thanks very much. Thank you. Very nice. Oh man. That was great.

502
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,560
That was cool. That's so cool. It was such a different vibe than normal PCP. Very different

503
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,840
vibes from normal PCP. I said, I said in the call before we started, I said, like, you know,

504
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:45,720
usually we have just like random clowns from YouTube on, you know, idiots like Cyber Shell and

505
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:53,160
whatever, Oblivionfall. People have no real consequence. Yeah. Yeah. They're not basically

506
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,640
not even real, you know. They're not sheriffs. So like, you know, I hope she, I hope she does it.

507
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:07,720
I hope she pulls it off. God damn it. I hope she becomes sheriff and then promotes our podcast.

508
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:14,920
Ooh. The official podcast. The official podcast of Cheshire County, New Hampshire.

509
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,600
Damn. Can't believe she'd do my boy Bernie dirty like that though.

510
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,440
That was fucked up. Right. We can all agree that was true. The truth hurts Ben. That was pretty

511
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:33,720
fucked up. No, no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't ever. He did endorse

512
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:42,600
Hillary. Yeah. And Joe. After the DNC fucked him and everything. Yeah. I mean, his choices were

513
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,120
really minimal, but like campaigning for Biden right now. Yeah. Harder than Biden is.

514
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,120
Actually cringe. Yes, actually cringe. Stop. No, Bernie. I mean, he's done good work in that he

515
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:03,880
is in, in brought the conversation more to the left. It is good. You know, I'm, I'm very sad

516
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,800
that Bernie is not the candidate. Nevertheless, it will be very good if Biden wins and Trump is

517
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,280
gone. You know, at this point, it's just like someone who's like too selfless and it starts to

518
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,480
like offend you. You know, you're just hurting yourself. You're not, you're not being kind.

519
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:25,800
You're being like self abusive. That's what Bernie is politically. He's a monster. He can't be

520
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,480
stopped. And you know what? Well, Bernie can't be stopped. Yeah, exactly. He can absolutely be

521
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,520
stopped. Well, you had stopped by the DNC twice. He can be stopped from succeeding, but he can't be

522
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:43,080
stopped from trying is what I'm saying. He will die in the political sphere, but he will never die

523
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:52,920
in our hearts. He's an old Jew from Brooklyn. He's going to live to be 130. So there. Sanders

524
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,840
2024. I'll fucking vote. I'll fucking vote. Sanders 2024. I don't give a shit.

525
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,640
All right. So the whole argument against him at that point, but you're so old.

526
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,880
No, which is already the point. I know the fucking fucking people, the same people,

527
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,680
the same people who are like, guys, don't, don't, don't laugh at Trump for getting COVID.

528
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,000
Like we need to pray. We need to pray that he makes a full recovery. We're the same people who

529
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,560
are like, oh, have Bernie Sanders got a heart attack. He's so fucking old. He's going to die.

530
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:35,880
What a loser. The same people. It's almost like people just care about their team winning.

531
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,480
Fucking libs involved at all. Fucking libs. I should have. We should have asked Aria what she

532
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,240
thinks about the fucking libs. We should have. Get her back in the car. Get her back in the car.

533
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,520
We should have. I should have asked her to like, hey, could you, could you for,

534
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,600
can you, can you give me a shout out and say fuck the libs? Yeah. Would you own the libs for me,

535
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,400
please? Oh, missed opportunities. God, if only we planned these podcasts and had a list of

536
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:06,280
statements prepared, we could have secured that. I, as I was, as I was walking home from the post

537
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,360
office today, I started thinking like, hmm, what should I, what should I ask? What should I ask

538
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,880
the future sheriff of Cheshire County, New Hampshire? Oh, I should ask about the

539
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,560
libertarians who support the police thing. Like, yeah, it's kind of interesting.

540
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,440
And I was interested to say about that. We can do, we can go to voicemails unless either of you

541
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:33,640
have anything else you wanted to bring up. Oh, no, no, I've zoomed out for one minute.

542
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,960
Disgusting. I was just looking at another chat. Sorry to say that again. Do you need me to repeat

543
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,800
my, I said we can go to voicemails unless either of you wanted to raise any other

544
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,240
issues of discussion this week on the procrastinator's podcast.

545
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,960
Nah. Nah, fuck it. All right, cool. Then here we go. First one up, we got the tar.

546
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,120
This is a topic episode, everybody. It was a topic episode. Are you happy? Are you,

547
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:08,200
we did it. It was a topic episode with a guest. It was. It's true. It's true. Vote, vote Aria.

548
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,680
Aria Stark.

549
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,720
I didn't realize the thing about the, hey, Eleazar, I hope that in the episode when I said,

550
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,040
when I asked that question about the song from Final Fantasy, I hoped you played the song. If you

551
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:29,800
didn't, you fucked up. It was only today. I was googling. I was like, you know, let me, let me

552
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,200
make some, do some last minute, get some articles up so I know that I don't make a fool of myself.

553
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:41,880
And I put her name into Google and this time it auto-corrected to the song, which is Aria

554
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:51,320
de Mezzo Caratato. And I was like, wait a minute. That's the song. That's, that's that one. That's

555
00:55:51,320 --> 00:56:03,320
the opera song with cellis. You know, everyone's favorite. Yeah. She's going to sing that when she

556
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:15,320
gets the badge at her coronation. Would they pin the badge too? All right. First voicemail,

557
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:22,360
Tarbuck transom on ethics. Three, two, one, go. Hi, fast fucking craftsmen and indestructible

558
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,560
super god Tarbuck transom. And wow, Ben, I really like you, but I really do not like this plebeian

559
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,320
take about what it is or isn't utilitarianism. Oh my God. The thing that makes something utilitarian

560
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,040
isn't about the method of weighing things using absolutes or situational ethics or any of that.

561
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,000
It's about your priorities. All of the philosophies try to do as much good as they can. Only the work

562
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,600
of individual writers is about method. If you think that doing good just means making people happy,

563
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,840
then, and you say you shouldn't torture people because suffering is bad, then that's utilitarianism.

564
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,080
But if you say that you shouldn't torture people because the act of torture is wrong in itself,

565
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,880
that's deontology. Oh, he's right. If you do a problem and you decide to pull a lever and kill

566
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,280
one person and save three people because you're maximizing life and happiness, that's utilitarianism.

567
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,080
If you save three people because it would be morally guilty of you by your inaction,

568
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,360
then that's deontology, even though you made the exact same choice for nearly identical reasons.

569
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,680
You still tally things up with literally every decision that you make and you try to make the

570
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:23,880
most optimal decision available to you. Everybody does that. But if you consider your actions

571
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,240
to whatsoever, you will do this moral calculus. But why you weigh things one way or the other

572
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,000
is the real distinguishing factor of your ethical framework. Fuck's sake.

573
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:43,080
Okay, well, I've been demolished. It sounds like ethics and morals are stupid and they don't exist.

574
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,960
Like if you could make a decision for almost exactly the same reason

575
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,480
and you can qualify in two different ways,

576
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,560
um, maybe just don't qualify it in either way and it doesn't matter.

577
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,640
No, no, you've gone, you've gone too far.

578
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,640
They've gone too far now.

579
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,400
Words are stupid. Labels?

580
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,440
No, the point is, the point is that you're using a different, a different reasoning

581
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,680
to arrive at the conclusion and a different reasoning might give you the same conclusion

582
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,560
in this case, but it might give you a different conclusion in another case.

583
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,480
Oh, well, could you explain another case?

584
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:30,920
Sure. Like, if you say suffering is bad because, you know, if you're, if you're a,

585
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,240
a, a, a, a, oh God, what's the...

586
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,520
A dermatomologist.

587
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,240
If you're a utilitarian, you say suffering is bad because pain is bad, is morally bad and suffering

588
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:45,800
causes pain. Or if you're a deontologist because you think torture is bad, maybe you're, maybe

589
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:52,600
you're a Kantian, uh, fucking, uh, oh, what's the word, um, categorical imperativist and you're

590
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,920
like, well, if we tortured everybody, then everyone would just be getting tortured all the time and

591
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,400
that wouldn't be ethical. Uh, that would, that would lead to bad outcome. Like, you don't want

592
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,120
to be tortured.

593
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,520
I don't, this doesn't make any sense at all.

594
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,360
Yes, it fucking does. And then you, you come to another, okay, and then you apply the same

595
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:13,960
logic. You're like, oh, um, hmm, abortion. And then you're like, hmm, uh, then you're for

596
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,360
utilitarian. It's like, well, you know, a bundle of cells, you know, doesn't have any, any brain,

597
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:23,880
it doesn't feel pain. Therefore, it doesn't actually cause any suffering to abort a, a, a, a zygote

598
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,840
versus a deontologist or versus your a Kantian. And you're like, oh, well, categorically,

599
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,840
imperatively speaking, what if we just aborted everyone, then everyone would be aborted. And

600
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,080
we don't want that. So, you know, different, different lines of thinking lead to different

601
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,440
conclusions that are different, under different situations. There you go.

602
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:46,360
I really, I have no understanding of what you just said. Maybe I'm stupid. Maybe that's the thing.

603
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:52,840
I, I'm pretty sure I know how to come up with an opinion on abortion without knowing how or why

604
00:59:52,840 --> 01:00:00,440
to label what my methodology of thinking. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Maybe you don't, maybe you

605
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:08,040
don't know what or if, you know, there's like some like ism label for the way you arrive at it. But

606
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:13,400
like, you still have like a reason, like a method of reasoning that maybe if someone asked like,

607
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,960
okay, well, why do you, why do you think abortion is okay? You could say, well, it's because I think

608
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,400
that this is bad and abortion causes this and therefore abortion is bad. Is there an ism for

609
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:32,360
changing my mind in every situation, depending on how I feel about it, and not having like a

610
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:39,160
structure that I use every time because I'm a human and I don't do that? Surely, surely you

611
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:47,000
must have some axiomatic principles that you fall back to in the case of like a difficult moral

612
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,400
quandary. Surely there must be some things that in general you think you can, you would consider

613
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,600
to be morally good or morally bad, and you might would apply those things in other, in other cases,

614
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:04,200
right? Maybe I just feel like I would change my mind even over the course of a discussion.

615
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:11,080
Like, I don't think I could like, like actually stick to any specific thing. Maybe somebody could

616
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:18,600
figure it out for me, but I don't know. Like, how do I think it differs? I don't know. I mean,

617
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:24,920
I think to have a consistent moral position, you really need to nail down what are your

618
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:35,640
axiomatic principles? My principles are liquid. They swish and slush. They go tight and tight out.

619
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,840
It depends on whether, it depends on the tide and on the moon position. On the moon?

620
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:48,920
Depends on the phase of the moon? Yeah, that'll do. Okay. We got another one from Tarbuck. It's

621
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:58,520
called the pro clownfish podcast. Three, two, one, ago. First mage left and then Digi came out as a girl.

622
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,800
Then Digi vanished and Gib came out as a girl. Now it's been a few weeks without Gib. So who's

623
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:10,120
the next clownfish to be a girl now that the previous one is gone? Place your bets now! I'm

624
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:15,640
gambling that she didn't come back for what will have been last week because I forgot to get this

625
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:22,040
mail in before you guys record this week. You idiot. Digi was on the bonus episode. Explain

626
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:29,880
what the clownfish? I don't know. Clownfish can change their gender. Wow. So can humans.

627
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:38,920
You got me. You got me. Fuck. Yeah, Digi was on the bonus episode. So if you want to hear about

628
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
what Digi says with her mouth, you can go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators and

629
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,960
subscribe for money to hear it. It's true. It's true. What was the question? Wait, was the question

630
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,080
who's coming out as trans? It's me because I'm a soy boy cuck. That's why. That's how it works.

631
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,600
What if mage comes out as trans and she comes back as a man?

632
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:14,200
I mean, well, I'm not going to say that I think it will happen, but I could imagine stranger

633
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:20,120
things happening, I guess. I don't know. Yeah, I could see it. Why not?

634
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,520
Yeah. Yeah, that's fucking everyone's trans.

635
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:38,680
A broke. Ben is the next trans because of what a communist antifa cuck he is. A woke mage

636
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,440
because she's a blackpilled migtail.

637
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,080
Mage finally wanted to be a proud boy in every sense.

638
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,760
I'm sorry. She got mad the last time I said that, but I'm joking, I promise.

639
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,720
The last time you called mage a blackpilled migtail, she got upset. I can't imagine why.

640
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,440
Yeah, I don't know. I don't understand it. It doesn't make any sense.

641
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,240
What would even be the context other than a clear joke like this?

642
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,960
I don't remember, to be honest, was like a year and a half ago.

643
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:16,600
Next one is called Margar, presumably it is from the man himself. Three, two, one, go.

644
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:25,160
Margar here, still in voice jail. I would like to escape the official death of Ben St. Samurai

645
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:31,400
master. Though he had started a Yakuza gang and was beginning to threaten me, I feel.

646
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,760
I don't know. I don't believe it.

647
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:42,360
His death sets a grisly precedent for now only unimportant goons and faceless inmates had been

648
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,000
killed. I think he probably threw down a smoke bomb or something.

649
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:53,480
Samurai was a plot important main character and his death has grim portents for my fate.

650
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,560
We'll see what happens, but I'm not feeling good about this.

651
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,200
I think he probably replaced himself with a log at the last second.

652
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,800
If I know that guy and I do.

653
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,520
Oh, like the ninjas from Naruto.

654
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,960
Substitution no jutsu.

655
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,960
Yeah, I would imagine so, yeah.

656
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,400
I never understood how that worked. They would need really long arms.

657
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:25,480
Uh, they use their fucking chakra to pull a log? Like the force?

658
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,840
Chakra's the answer to everything.

659
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,040
I've, now, now hold on a second. I can believe that you can use your chakra to

660
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:38,120
fucking create like nuclear holocaust level like whirlwind hurricane blasts.

661
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,640
But moving an entire log, I draw a line.

662
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,520
I mean, it's inconsistent with the way other techniques work.

663
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,560
It's just all I'm saying.

664
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,280
If you could move rocks around like that, why wouldn't you just throw rocks at them?

665
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,320
Nobody throws rocks.

666
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,960
I mean, there's probably someone with a rock throw no jutsu.

667
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,480
There's rock throw jutsus.

668
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,440
There definitely is.

669
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,120
Jutsus are just magic, so they can, yeah.

670
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,760
They had a lot of science mumbo jumbo put in there.

671
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,840
Yeah, like how the world, how the world of like Naruto's hair like shows like which,

672
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,960
which direction he needs to spin his chakra to do the most powerful Rasengan.

673
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,040
Yeah.

674
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,920
And the whole like learning about how to do the Rasengan was cool.

675
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,080
That's true. It was.

676
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,360
Unironically, it was based.

677
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,280
I mean, they added all that fucking filler.

678
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,400
They had all that fucking filler in Shippuden that made me quit.

679
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,120
I never finished it.

680
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,720
That I never watched.

681
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,400
I watched all of Naruto Kai.

682
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,600
They just cut out all the filler.

683
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,480
It was just like, here's a bunch of like 90 minute chunks

684
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,200
that are the equivalent to one volume of the manga.

685
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,160
And I just watched that.

686
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:49,800
It was great.

687
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,760
It was a great watch.

688
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,360
Did it include, include Shippuden?

689
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:53,320
Yeah.

690
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,000
It was all, it was the whole thing.

691
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,880
Just cut down.

692
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,760
They cut trimmed down the fat and it was just the good stuff.

693
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,280
That sounds pretty good, actually.

694
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,080
Peak way to watch.

695
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,400
Yeah.

696
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
Naruto, when it was good, was actually pretty good.

697
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,560
Yep.

698
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,920
Hot, hot take.

699
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,480
All right.

700
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,560
Next one is from, or is called, Antonio P.

701
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,520
Three, two, one, go.

702
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,440
Hello.

703
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,920
How do you cope with the absence of meaning in life?

704
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:19,960
I don't.

705
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,880
Uh, I don't need it.

706
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,080
Meaning in life, I guess.

707
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,080
Makes me sad all the time.

708
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,760
Like, if I'm not, like, I don't know.

709
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,000
Meaning as in like, oh, when I die, nothing will have changed.

710
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,520
Like, I don't know.

711
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,000
I don't care.

712
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,920
Meaning would be way more stressful because of that would mean

713
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,960
there's an objective goal everyone would have to move towards.

714
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,640
And then you could measure yourself against everyone else in the world

715
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,520
and how close they were going to that objective goal.

716
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,480
We kind of already do that.

717
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,600
But now there's no meaning.

718
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:52,920
You know.

719
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,000
I mean, yeah, you already do that subjectively.

720
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,440
But there's no, you can at least have the comfort that that's fake

721
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,920
and in your head and you're struggling with that internally

722
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,080
as opposed to it being an external truth.

723
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:03,960
You know what?

724
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,480
I'm going to change my answer.

725
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,040
It's actually not the lack of meaning that bothers me.

726
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,680
Yeah, the lack of meaning is fine.

727
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,880
Like, I can deal with that.

728
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,840
It doesn't matter.

729
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,560
I don't know.

730
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,440
What would it mean for there to be meaning in life anyway?

731
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,160
Like, who would even get to decide that?

732
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,640
Uh, that's like an opinion.

733
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,480
The great big dog in the sky.

734
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,680
Clifford the big red dog.

735
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,560
Clifford the big red dog.

736
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,040
Um, uh, no.

737
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,720
I'm sad about all kinds of other existential problems,

738
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,320
but the lack of meaning is not one of it.

739
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,560
Uh, yeah.

740
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,360
It's weird when you break, when you break it down,

741
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,920
that's like, oh, what's the meaning of life?

742
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,600
It's like, well, who are you, who are you asking?

743
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,560
Who are you asking that question on?

744
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,360
That's an opinion.

745
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:54,600
Uh, okay.

746
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,040
Answered.

747
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,160
Meeting of life solved.

748
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,440
Next one is called,

749
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Your words are like deadly that pierce my heart.

750
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,480
Frowny face.

751
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,320
Three, two, one, go.

752
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,200
Konnichiwa.

753
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,160
I knew it.

754
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,680
This is the log.

755
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,320
Use the log.

756
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,080
Sad boyo samurai.

757
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,200
Oh, he's upset.

758
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:23,480
Many people accuse samurai of racism.

759
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:31,400
They say in the discord, that the samurai voice is racist.

760
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:38,440
Samurai, cannot change the voice that the samurai

761
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,560
partner with them.

762
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,400
You bring a great dissonance to samurai warrior.

763
01:09:46,360 --> 01:10:09,000
I'm with you.

764
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,560
I'm with you.

765
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,360
You know what, I actually, I think that samurai

766
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,600
is great representation.

767
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,240
Yeah.

768
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:17,640
Thoughts?

769
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,480
How do they know what is racist?

770
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:24,440
Yeah.

771
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,320
We meet him in person.

772
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,160
Pretty insulting to assume that it's some white guy, you know?

773
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,680
Fuck you.

774
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,160
Sounds like.

775
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,200
I mean, even if he was white, like, it doesn't matter.

776
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:37,400
Really?

777
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,320
It's a silly thing.

778
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,200
We meet him and he's black, he's like, I don't know.

779
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,400
He's some kind of, some kind of just, you know,

780
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,080
just weird.

781
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,240
He's like Scottish or something.

782
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:49,720
I don't know.

783
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,600
He's an Italian.

784
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,520
I think he's Australian.

785
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,760
How would you even know that?

786
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,160
Because I saw him in a discord.

787
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,080
He's in your server then.

788
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,600
He exists.

789
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:02,440
Wait.

790
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,960
He's infiltrated your server.

791
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:10,120
I thought, I thought he said, I thought he said in a voicemail that that was not him in my discord.

792
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,800
Oh, well, I don't know.

793
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,440
Unless there was like a different one.

794
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,800
Unless he was white later.

795
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,960
And that is him.

796
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,400
Boy, what a fuck, what a quagmire.

797
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,640
We got, we got like ninja clones going around.

798
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah, yeah, he's multiplying.

799
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,920
He's like, he's like Clyde Cash.

800
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,040
You know, everybody, everybody is like claiming to be him.

801
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,640
You know, everybody's taking credit,

802
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,880
attributing their actions to a singular identity.

803
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,680
He's like, he's like Spartacus.

804
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,960
You know, everyone's like, oh yeah,

805
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,240
oh yeah, that's me.

806
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,000
The famous line from the movie Spartacus.

807
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,720
Oh yeah, that's me.

808
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,960
Next one is called Homestuck Preservation Problem.

809
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,040
Yeah, sounds like a cause for concern.

810
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,920
Three, two, one, go.

811
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,760
Okay, so I've got a problem.

812
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,640
I just recently started reading Homestuck for the first time.

813
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:09,400
And I, I realized that the way that Viz Media is preserving a lot of the flash

814
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,120
is by recording, like screen recording it,

815
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,640
and making it into YouTube videos.

816
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,120
And in theory, this sounds fine.

817
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,480
But the person who's playing the game sections

818
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,440
is just fucking mashing through all the dialogues.

819
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,200
So the fuck, you don't text play them yourself?

820
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,800
Or on screen for about a frame.

821
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,480
And I have to fucking pause it,

822
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,960
go back frame by frame just to read the text.

823
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,440
And also, I'm on Act 6, Act 3,

824
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,720
the game where you're running around is Jane.

825
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,160
And there are multiple moments

826
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,720
where you're supposed to click on a text bubble

827
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,520
and talk to Roxy and talk to Dirk.

828
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,680
But in the videos, they don't do it.

829
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,440
They just walk right the fuck past them.

830
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,800
Because what it does is it sends you a, it's a link.

831
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,960
If clicking on a little text bubble is a link

832
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,320
to a full text log on homestuck.com.

833
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:02,760
And they can't really, I guess, show that in a, in a video, which makes sense.

834
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,720
But it's just proof that the video

835
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,040
is not a proper way to preserve this shit.

836
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,920
The first time through, I was looking at it on my phone,

837
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,400
where, which doesn't have the option of using Flash.

838
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,080
And I just, I just had to skip all those fucking conversations.

839
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,440
Which is awful.

840
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,640
Like there needs to be another solution to preserve this shit.

841
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,960
It will be gone in December.

842
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,400
And Hussie clearly doesn't give a fuck

843
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,840
about preserving it properly.

844
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,040
Yeah, I, I've, I've heard, like, I, I mean,

845
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,480
it's the saddest thing ever because, you know, homestuck.

846
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,960
There's no easy Flash to HTML5, like converter.

847
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,560
How is this not something that exists?

848
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,720
I mean, maybe it does exist, but they just haven't done it

849
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,280
because there's like a billion pages of homestuck.

850
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,600
But they should still do it.

851
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,120
Yeah, but they're not all Flash.

852
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,840
Not all Flash.

853
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,600
They have had, for the longest time ever,

854
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,400
since they changed the website to homestuck.com

855
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,840
instead of MSP, Adventures, whatever.

856
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:09,720
It's, they've had like the, to experience this page of Flash

857
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,320
as it was intended, click this link

858
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,800
and it opens a little Flash thing so you can play it.

859
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,160
Or like, remember to unblock Flash from your browser

860
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,680
so you can play the game.

861
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,800
Otherwise, here's this video.

862
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,760
And the videos are terrible.

863
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:29,080
And Cascade, obviously, is like the worst hit by this

864
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,680
because of like the really cool thing of it.

865
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,800
Wait, wasn't Cascade a YouTube video anyway?

866
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,400
No. Do you not remember when you go to the site,

867
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,440
when you get to Cascade, it's a small Flash thing.

868
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,760
You click on it and as the Flash plays,

869
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,040
it slowly expands to cover the whole screen.

870
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,520
And it turns out the Flash file was the entire screen the whole time.

871
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,360
And it's like, whoa.

872
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:59,480
I think, I thought, what I remember is that it's a YouTube video

873
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,040
that is like big in the screen.

874
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:06,840
And when you play it, it starts out as like a small, what?

875
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,080
No, no, no, no, no.

876
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,080
It was part of the webpage the first time.

877
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,120
It was a Flash.

878
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,520
It was, it was trick you because you couldn't have known.

879
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,320
Maybe you're thinking about Collide, that was the later one.

880
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,400
Maybe I'm thinking of like, maybe it was a YouTube video

881
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,400
at some point because like the Flash version

882
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,640
was crashing Newgrounds or something.

883
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,520
They did make a YouTube video version of it,

884
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,200
which is the one that's the default now.

885
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,200
But like, no, you must have experienced it like the Flash one

886
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,960
because that was, the video has not existed for a long time.

887
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,840
But it was like, it was when Hussie was like learning

888
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,240
that he could use, you know, the webpage itself to tell the comic.

889
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,840
The whole thing prior to that was like in the banner at the top.

890
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,760
I know that it like expands.

891
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,200
I know that it does that.

892
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,400
I just remember it doing it as a YouTube video, which it kind of does.

893
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,400
The YouTube video does include that element sort of.

894
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,840
It's like, it's just such a sad situation

895
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,600
that it's not being preserved properly.

896
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:10,840
There is no way, even if the person was not fucking it up,

897
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,120
like it sounds that they are.

898
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,880
Like when they're playing the video to record,

899
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,880
or playing the game to record it for the video,

900
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,280
like watching someone play it on a video is just not like,

901
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,720
it's just not the same as just clicking through it yourself.

902
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,520
It's just not as engaging.

903
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,440
I can't imagine that it would ever be.

904
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,280
That one he's talking about with Jane.

905
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,080
The like missed one, right?

906
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,440
Where you kind of go from room to room

907
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,200
and you click the little yellow arrows.

908
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,160
Yeah, like it's a pseudo point and click adventure.

909
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,440
You have to solve a puzzle.

910
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,960
It's quite simple, but it just involves all like clicking through

911
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,480
and like quietly experiencing the planet.

912
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,320
And if somebody else is playing it,

913
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,720
you don't feel like you're doing anything.

914
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,880
It's so unfortunate.

915
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,440
It feels like almost that the books will eventually be

916
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,920
the preferred way to read Homestuck, which is terrible.

917
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,440
Ugh, God.

918
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,920
Hey, what about some problem sleuth?

919
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,520
Is Flash going to like fuck that up?

920
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,680
I don't think so because those are all gifts.

921
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,040
Those are just many, many gifts in that.

922
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,400
Yeah, you might be right.

923
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,040
You might be right.

924
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,040
I think that the conceit of Homestuck was like

925
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,120
how he had made a webcomic that it utilized gifts

926
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,320
in a really intense way and it was like,

927
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,360
well, what's the next thing?

928
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,320
Maybe I could do like an entire webcomic that's animated

929
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,920
and he made like the beta of Homestuck, page one,

930
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,040
where it was like smooth in Flash.

931
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,480
It was so fucking smooth.

932
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,080
Yeah.

933
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,760
And then he was like, no, that's not going to work.

934
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,040
And then he did it like mostly PNGs, gifts,

935
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,560
and occasionally a Flash.

936
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,960
Yeah.

937
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,240
So problem sleuth is fine.

938
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,520
Boy, I don't know.

939
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,920
Like I really hope they fucking, yeah,

940
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,360
are able to just convert it to something better

941
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,600
and not do it in a stupid shitty way.

942
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,520
Like it sounds like they're doing.

943
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,720
I mean, I don't, I haven't read Homestuck,

944
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,000
so I don't really care.

945
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,880
Tom.

946
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,240
I'm looking, I'm looking.

947
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,600
Tom, you got to read Homestuck.

948
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,160
It's already too late almost.

949
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,280
There's a, there's some like community project

950
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,720
called Flashpoint, Blue Maxima's Flashpoint.

951
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,640
I guess it's like an open source project

952
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,800
of people just trying to like port and convert

953
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,640
Flash games to something that can still be played

954
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,000
without Flash.

955
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,240
And looking at their list, there is a fair bit

956
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,040
of Homestuck content that has been converted and

957
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:37,160
saved essentially with this group of people

958
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,760
trying to bank as much as the Flash Internet

959
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,560
as possible before the inevitable destruction of it.

960
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:43,800
So.

961
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,360
Glad somebody's looking out.

962
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,680
It's, it's evolved into an international project

963
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,200
involving over a hundred contributors

964
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,600
encompassing both web games and animations

965
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,480
from numerous Internet plugins frameworks and standards.

966
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,800
So if you care about Homestuck more than me,

967
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,240
yell at these people to fix it on before it dies

968
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,120
because there's a discord you can join and all that good shit.

969
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,360
Imagine, imagine not reading Homestuck.

970
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,880
I, I live it every day and you know what, it's okay.

971
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,680
Cringe, cringe.

972
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,240
No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

973
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,840
Who incidentally is you?

974
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,280
Well, I'm glad, I'm glad you're looking out for me.

975
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,480
Because you haven't read Homestuck and for that reason alone.

976
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:24,680
That's fair enough.

977
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:31,960
Uh, next voicemail is from so spoke the moon on a late morning jog.

978
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,400
It's the same where I can.

979
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,320
No, maybe.

980
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,680
Three, two, one, go.

981
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,920
I'm looking up inside right now and the freaking moon is visible.

982
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,080
What the heck's going on, man?

983
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,240
Do you ever look at like the moon?

984
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,880
Think like what the heck?

985
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,320
Like what is going on?

986
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,880
It's just like an orb, man.

987
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:01,240
It's just like an orb that's so far away that we need to build like rockets to reach it.

988
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,720
Man, like what the heck's going on?

989
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,040
Where there's just like, we're living on an orb, man.

990
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,360
The earth is an orb and it's just floating.

991
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,680
Like what, where are we?

992
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,560
What the heck?

993
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,320
It's like how did the universe start, man?

994
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,400
Yes, big question.

995
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,240
God didn't like, what the, what the heck's going on?

996
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:32,600
What the, why, like holy, holy fuck, man.

997
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,440
It's just, oh my God.

998
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:41,160
Voice grail, voice grail, voice grail, voice grail.

999
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

1000
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,640
I'll allow it.

1001
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,640
So spoke the moon, so spoke the moon.

1002
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,600
Congratulations, you just said it.

1003
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,440
You said it so elegantly.

1004
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,280
I couldn't have said it better myself.

1005
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,960
We're on an orb, guys.

1006
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,240
Where are we?

1007
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,920
Like what's going on?

1008
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,000
Dude, the next, the next time you get into an argument with a flat earth or just play this

1009
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,040
and they'll be convinced.

1010
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:10,920
I like, when I look up at the moon, I like to look at the sky whatever time of day it is

1011
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:17,000
and think about, you know, maybe, like maybe it's like late and maybe I can see that like

1012
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,960
the sun has gone down, but I can see like part of the sky is like a little lit up because

1013
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,600
the sun set over that part of the horizon.

1014
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:30,840
And I like to look at the moon and think about, hmm, where's the sun in comparison?

1015
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,080
I think, okay, it's down that, that direction over the horizon, but like way further away.

1016
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,800
And then think about like, oh yeah.

1017
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:43,080
So, so that explains why like that the moon is lit up from that direction.

1018
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,600
It's because the sun is over there and further away in that direction.

1019
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,760
So yeah, the sun would be lighting it up more or less in that way.

1020
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,520
And sometimes it makes intuitive sense.

1021
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,920
And it's like, yeah, I can see why it's like how it's pointing that way.

1022
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,360
And other times it like is weird because like the perspective is off because this

1023
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,280
sound is like a billion fucking times further away.

1024
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,160
And it like feels it's like hard to even, even like imagine the angles involved there.

1025
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,080
But I like to think about that.

1026
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:09,640
It's fun.

1027
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:15,320
Yes, I like, I like looking straight up at the sky and then imagining that it's a

1028
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,520
like a, like a dome.

1029
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:23,240
And if you look up the firmament, like if you look up enough, like straight up, like lie down,

1030
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,080
you can sort of feel it.

1031
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,560
You can sort of feel that the horizon line is a circle that is encompassing you.

1032
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,200
And the sky is a dome built on that circle.

1033
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,880
You can feel the skybox.

1034
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,800
Yeah, you can feel the skybox life.

1035
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,160
That's what the, that's what the Bible says.

1036
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,520
The Bible says, and this is my, this is one of my favorite parts.

1037
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,000
It says that God made the firmament.

1038
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,400
And it specifically means that he made a big blue dome and he set it over the earth.

1039
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,800
And he sat it there like a solid object and it was the firmament.

1040
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,680
That's one of my, that's one of my favorite words, uh, firmament, firmament.

1041
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,360
It affirms my beliefs.

1042
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,680
A friend of mine was going to make, he had, he had like some tentative plans to make a

1043
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,920
rogue like one time and the game was going to be called firmament.

1044
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:18,360
And the game was going to be about ascending like vertically, like level to level climbing

1045
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,400
the mountain basically.

1046
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,320
And I thought we brainstormed a little bit and I thought it would be cool if like the end of

1047
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:29,240
the game was you reached like the highest Z level you could beat the fucking boss or whatever.

1048
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,640
And then like you would try to ascend another level, but you would like,

1049
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,280
you would like crack the screen, right?

1050
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,720
Like you were breaking out of your computer screen because you had like come up.

1051
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,200
You get it?

1052
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,000
You get what I'm saying?

1053
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:46,600
Cause like it's like you're looking down at like a flat grid and you go up, up, up,

1054
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,520
up and then you hit the screen because you go too high.

1055
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,400
Do you get it?

1056
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,040
Do you get it?

1057
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,640
Yeah, break the glass ceiling.

1058
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,200
Yeah, I get it.

1059
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,160
Break, break the glass ceiling.

1060
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:53,560
That's right.

1061
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,040
That's right.

1062
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,840
Ah, good times.

1063
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,480
Never happened.

1064
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,600
Anyway, voice grill.

1065
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:00,760
Yeah.

1066
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:06,280
Next one is from Ray three, two, one, go.

1067
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,480
These past few weeks have been horrible for me.

1068
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,440
You know, back in September, I got COVID and so I was going to die.

1069
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:17,320
And then later in October, I got shot on the shoulder and was rushed to the hospital.

1070
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,040
Is this President Trump?

1071
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:22,200
Luckily it wasn't anything serious, but I just wanted to say that I was listening to the episode

1072
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:26,360
with Cybershell and that should really cheered me up while I was in the hospital.

1073
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,680
I just want to thank you guys for still doing this stuff.

1074
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,600
The podcast has been something that's been helping me keep on going and

1075
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,280
now letting this dress get to me.

1076
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,400
So I just want to say thank you again and keep being cool.

1077
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,000
How the fuck did this guy get shot?

1078
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,960
He got COVID and then got shot in the shoulder.

1079
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,120
And our podcast was what helped him.

1080
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:44,680
That's incredible.

1081
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,480
Oh my God.

1082
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:49,960
He got shot and he was like in the hospital with COVID and the doctor comes in.

1083
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,080
He's like, nah, fuck this.

1084
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,280
Oh God.

1085
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:02,680
Well, like a doctor is like, I got to, you know, I'm going to end you like peacefully,

1086
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,240
like right now, but he is a really terrible shot.

1087
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:11,160
He's like, well, you know, he tries to like roll to avoid the shot,

1088
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,120
but it goes through the shoulder.

1089
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,480
Damn, imagine, God, imagine getting shot like fuck.

1090
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,880
That shit must hurt real bad.

1091
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,120
Are you saying the doctor shot him and he rolled out of the way like Dark Souls,

1092
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,440
but his eye frames ended a little too early.

1093
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:24,920
Yes.

1094
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:29,080
He rolled straight out of the hospital bed, knocking everything over around him.

1095
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,440
He had the chlorinthine ring or whatever.

1096
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,760
So he just like cartwheeled like right up.

1097
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,440
And you know, this is a real person that really got shot.

1098
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,720
And here we are just being abrasive as fuck about it.

1099
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,680
I know, God.

1100
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,480
Hope you're doing good.

1101
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,720
You know, I read all this scary shit about COVID and like, I know it seems like

1102
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,040
a lot of cases are pretty mild and like don't get that bad.

1103
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,680
But like, then I'll read about one that's like, oh, yeah, did you know that in some cases,

1104
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,560
COVID gets in your brain and permanently deletes your sense of smell and taste?

1105
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:11,320
Like that happens to some people and they have to do like physical therapy to like

1106
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,200
relearn how to like smell and taste things afterwards.

1107
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,600
That's the thing that's happened to some people.

1108
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,480
Dude, that's super fucked up.

1109
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,840
Yeah, yeah, it's better than death.

1110
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,680
It's yeah.

1111
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:30,760
Well, yeah, I would say so, in my opinion, based on the axiomatic principles that I hold.

1112
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,720
But anyway, yeah, neutral.

1113
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:40,200
Hope you're doing good with the COVID and the bullet wounds.

1114
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,840
Yeah, Jesus Christ.

1115
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,760
So fucking it's so fucking cool.

1116
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,800
I don't know if I'd cool, but

1117
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,200
cool that you are alive and able to make a voice.

1118
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,400
I wonder if he got I wonder if he got shot by police because he was out

1119
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,560
because he was out fighting for civil rights.

1120
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,800
That's my that's my head cannon.

1121
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,480
Okay, okay.

1122
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,280
Cool.

1123
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,480
Okay, next up is Bob's story one.

1124
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,520
Three, two, one, go.

1125
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:16,680
Okay, so this is a story about 10 years old and

1126
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,280
I hope that Pippo and Tom are also there.

1127
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:28,280
And I know at least Ben knows enough about Christian to know the horror of this story.

1128
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,960
But I hope you guys can also appreciate this.

1129
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:38,200
So 10 years ago, I'm working and I'm working this girl I work with

1130
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,480
had like really big tits and I was super into that.

1131
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:41,960
Nice.

1132
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,560
And like big booby mommy milk or kind of shit.

1133
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,440
Yeah.

1134
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,040
But like she was also a horse girl.

1135
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,320
So she was super fucking weird.

1136
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,040
A horse girl.

1137
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,520
But into horses maybe.

1138
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,800
We started hanging out and I introduced her to Christian's bullshit.

1139
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,520
Now that's not what you should have done Christian.

1140
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,040
That was a peak bullshit.

1141
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,240
That's not how to do it.

1142
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:08,360
So like one night we're hanging out at her house and got to her house.

1143
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,080
It's reading the old wiki.

1144
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,560
Just like I guess she's into it.

1145
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,600
This is not how you get laid.

1146
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,040
All of his bullshit.

1147
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,160
I don't know what's working so far.

1148
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:23,960
And I want to say this was like I think that was like doing liquid Chris's bullshit.

1149
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,120
So like the heights.

1150
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,680
Like yeah peak the peak bullshit.

1151
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah.

1152
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:29,160
Yep.

1153
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:29,320
Yep.

1154
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:29,880
Yep.

1155
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,800
Um but yeah.

1156
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,240
Hold on.

1157
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,520
I'm going to hear another voicemail.

1158
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:37,400
Okay.

1159
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,200
This is awesome.

1160
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:38,600
All right.

1161
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,280
Oh god the suspense is killing me.

1162
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,600
We're going to have to do part two.

1163
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,880
Here's Bob's story two.

1164
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,560
Three, two, one, go.

1165
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:47,640
Okay.

1166
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,600
So part two of the story.

1167
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:58,440
But like we were reading about Chris on the wiki for a couple of hours.

1168
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:05,320
And this was like liquid Chris time.

1169
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,760
So peak Christian bullshit.

1170
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,360
But for some reason she wants to try and fuck with Chris.

1171
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,400
So we take a bunch of pictures of her and she's naked.

1172
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,640
Emailed them to him.

1173
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,600
Texted them to him.

1174
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,120
How the fuck?

1175
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:20,760
Got no response.

1176
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,360
Fuck Chris.

1177
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,560
If you're listening Chris, fuck.

1178
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,160
This poor girl all she wanted to do was fuck with you.

1179
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,320
She sent you so many pictures of those tits.

1180
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:29,880
Well yeah.

1181
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:30,520
You did not get a fuck.

1182
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:30,600
Yeah.

1183
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,520
How dare Chris make her do that.

1184
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,000
But uh.

1185
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,840
What the fuck is this?

1186
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,120
I'm very confused.

1187
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:36,280
Yeah.

1188
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:36,680
What's the point?

1189
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,640
Yeah I don't think you're being a bunch.

1190
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,680
That night she got really turned on by Chris Chan.

1191
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:41,640
What?

1192
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,440
And like I said she was a horse girl so I knew she was weird.

1193
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:51,080
But it's been like 10 years and I've never been able to properly explain this to anyone

1194
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,360
on how fucking weird it was.

1195
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,880
I don't know if you've done it today.

1196
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,920
I mean no.

1197
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,080
I feel like yes.

1198
01:29:59,080 --> 01:29:59,960
Super weird.

1199
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,360
So uh yeah.

1200
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,000
Wait.

1201
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:11,320
So the story was there was a girl at work or whatever that he managed to get

1202
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:18,280
into Chris Chan and she thought it would be funny to send Chris pictures of her tits

1203
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,880
and she got it really into it.

1204
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:24,680
To.

1205
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,120
I mean.

1206
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,040
And he this guy finger banged her he says.

1207
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,720
That's what he said.

1208
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:38,200
So like a good job and then what that is that it.

1209
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,400
That's the end of the story.

1210
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,400
I feel like I could have been told in 30 seconds.

1211
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,680
Yeah.

1212
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,240
Yeah.

1213
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,040
Definitely.

1214
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,960
But like what was the horror.

1215
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,200
Did something happen after that.

1216
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,080
Did she.

1217
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,760
No.

1218
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,640
There's no horror.

1219
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,400
He mentioned there was something it would be horrible at the beginning.

1220
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,320
What's weird to me is that.

1221
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,040
Like okay.

1222
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,440
First of all strange.

1223
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:08,840
I mean I guess stranger things have happened.

1224
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,640
But it's it's curious to me that you meet this girl at work.

1225
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,840
Introduce her to Chris Chan and yet she's still willing to come over to your house.

1226
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,560
I'm like all right.

1227
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,040
You're right.

1228
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,200
He was at her house or something.

1229
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,320
Oh he was at her house.

1230
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,760
Yeah.

1231
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,080
Okay.

1232
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,320
Well either way it doesn't matter.

1233
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,200
But okay let's accept that.

1234
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,640
And then okay you're there you're reading you're reading the quickie together you know.

1235
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:43,560
Sure why not this is a mutual interest you have I guess fine and so you're doing that and then she's like.

1236
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:49,560
Hey wouldn't it be funny if like I fucked with Chris by like taking a bunch of nudes of myself.

1237
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:55,000
I mean what I wonder is like okay well like were you was you there when she took the nudes

1238
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,520
like did you take them for her or did she just like hey hey you wait here I'm going to

1239
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,920
like go in the bathroom and take a bunch of nudes of myself and then I'll send them to Chris.

1240
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,080
But like you can't see them.

1241
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,600
Like they're not for you they're for Chris.

1242
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:12,440
You know like were you like involved with it or was this like a thing that she was doing separately.

1243
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,880
He was involved with it.

1244
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,320
That was my sense too.

1245
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:19,960
Which it's it kind of almost seems like maybe this was like sort of an excuse that she was using.

1246
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,600
She was like I want to like get naked or whatever.

1247
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,640
I want to like make this scenario sexual.

1248
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:34,200
Perhaps perhaps using this this Chris Chan pretense will be a good excuse for me to move

1249
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:39,480
the scenario in that direction so that this fucking beta cock that I have over my house

1250
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:43,960
will just finally fucking nut up and finger bang me god what is it going to take.

1251
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,880
I think if I was here that's what I would have been thinking.

1252
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,720
Thoughts prayers.

1253
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,280
Uh just prayers.

1254
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,400
Just prayers.

1255
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,600
Definitely prayers.

1256
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,040
Satanic prayers.

1257
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:02,680
I I mean the the follow-up question for me is what happened.

1258
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:05,240
Like why did you just finger banger the one time.

1259
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,320
Did did she did you did she move.

1260
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,280
Did she quit.

1261
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,280
How come where did this where did it go from here.

1262
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,000
Was she just like yeah I think we shouldn't do this anymore.

1263
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,280
Don't ever come to my house again.

1264
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:21,640
I think I think there was a part that I almost missed where it was like fuck you Chris.

1265
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:27,320
She sent all she wanted to do is fuck with you and you didn't care about all the tits she sent.

1266
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:31,320
Maybe that's weird like that's that's weird.

1267
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,160
That like yeah that he seems annoyed at Chris about it.

1268
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:41,160
Yeah so maybe maybe to him maybe this this was like a one time thing.

1269
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:46,520
Maybe maybe she just like you know decided that it was okay to get finger bang because

1270
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:50,760
like she was already naked from taking these new yeah maybe she was more in it for the Chris Chan

1271
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:55,880
fucking and like because he didn't go anywhere she lost interest and was like I never mind.

1272
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,760
And like if Chris had responded this relationship could have blossomed.

1273
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,680
What a strange way to start anything.

1274
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,960
Yeah yeah thought provoking.

1275
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,760
I like it good story Bob appreciate it.

1276
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,240

We can do that at the end.

1285
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:44,520
We don't have to talk.

1286
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,560

01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,560
We counted in don't worry it's easy.

Yes we did the commentary check it out check it out at the patreon link in the description.

1298
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:39,080
If you want to if you want to to have a little blast to the past and go back to five

1299
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:44,760
fucking years to 2015 and revisit the good old days with us.

1300
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,720
Where they maybe maybe they were kind of shit actually though.

1301
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,000
You'll have to pay five dollars and find out for yourself.

1302
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:55,960
True.

1303
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,280
Next one juicy high lights.

1304
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:04,040
Here we go three two one go.

1305
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,880
Yo shoutouts to the fucking PCP highlights channel.

1306
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,640
Y'all got to chill that shit bro.

1307
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,280
He's right.

1308
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:17,480
Elisar is working hard he's right some of those juicy highlights out there.

1309
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,720
He's right true I don't check it myself enough but yes that is a thing that has been going on

1310
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:28,920
for a while now there are plenty of highlights of the PCP all the good bits without all you know

1311
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,880
the whole podcast thing that sucks just the funny bits.

1312
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:39,480
I see I see it on Twitter I'll see that like I don't know I assume it's Nate who's posting them.

1313
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:46,680
I have no clue who is that who is posting the clips onto Twitter but somebody is and I'll see

1314
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:54,520
them there and yeah we've got the the highlights channel that's just like little like you know

1315
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:59,400
highlight snippets if you just want to listen to some fucking some goofy shit that we said

1316
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,840
one time or another subscribe damn it.

1317
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:09,000
Next one oh the next one is called cross music recommendation for Gibb.

1318
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:13,640
Oh okay three two one go.

1319
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:18,280
As a genderfluid individual I've been super into the gib gone fem arc so I wanted to

1320
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:21,960
recommend her a song that I resonate with a lot on this topic and I know you did that whole thing

1321
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:25,560
where you ask for music recommendations to listen to while working on stuff so it all

1322
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,440
kind of fits together.

1323
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:30,920
The song is Boys Will Be Bugs by the artist Cave Town and I think you'd really like it as

1324
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,200
well as a lot of his other music.

1325
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,960
Anyway hope you had a nice vacation and here's a less than five second clip of the song so you

1326
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,080
won't get copyright claimed.

1327
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:42,840
Oh that sounds nice.

1328
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:44,920
Yeah Boys Will Be Bugs.

1329
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,400
That's pretty cool.

1330
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:49,080
All right I'll listen to it.

1331
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:53,880
Ha ha well as a cis male I might go and colonize it by listening to it myself.

1332
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,840
Like an ant colony?

1333
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,240
Like Christopher Columbus.

1334
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,800
Oh the ant.

1335
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:00,520
How festive.

1336
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,640
Yeah yeah fuck yeah.

1337
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:33,640
Uh, okay based next vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo vo

1338
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,840
movements, but the samurai is still at large. Be careful.

1339
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:43,640
The thing about the samurai is that like even before he had the necronomicon,

1340
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:50,640
he had no shortage of ways to either to fake his own death or survive his death

1341
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,640
or like undo his death or whatever. Like death is like with the least of his concerns.

1342
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:03,040
So, you know, thanks for looking out, Margar, but you know,

1343
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,040
you got to get up pretty early in the morning, something something when you're in the voice

1344
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:15,040
when you're in the voice jail and it's time for you to make some more goddamn license plates

1345
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:24,040
for two cents an hour. Baby, next up, yellow chairs, three, two, one, go.

1346
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:29,040
Konnichiwa. This is Eddie Murphy.

1347
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:38,040
Haha, not really. This is Samurai-sama, but how do you do it for a moment? Top cake.

1348
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:45,040
Anyway, Samurai, not a hero to torment Beno-san this week,

1349
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:55,040
but Restore Short, Shinobi Pinnis, coming soon to Butter Hall near you, Beno-san.

1350
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:03,040
Samurai-sama, make a big announcement. Reaver of Abosensu.

1351
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:12,040
Out of priority material and Blue Road last week. I mean, honest.

1352
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:20,040
So until next time, I mean until whatever time. Sayonara.

1353
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,040
Did you catch that?

1354
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,040
No. I think it was a little too Japanese for me.

1355
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,040
It was a little too, yeah, a little too Japanese.

1356
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:31,040
I'm a little too white to understand that.

1357
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:39,040
I think he said something about like taking a break from pre-written material?

1358
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:45,040
Is that what he said? Is that what he said? Should we listen again?

1359
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:56,040
Listen, you know what? I'm sure it's fine. Listeners, don't go back and listen to it again and know what he said for sure.

1360
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:00,040
Don't make certain of anything. Just leave your life on the edge.

1361
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:09,040
Next up, the priest touched my poopy. Haha. 3, 2, 1, go.

1362
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:14,040
Konnichiwa. Reaver of Abosensu. Over.

1363
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:20,040
Reaver of Abosensu. Fakayu. Benno-sa. Return to scroll.

1364
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:24,040
Until next time. Sayonara.

1365
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:27,040
Okay, so that was his leave of absence.

1366
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:36,040
I see, I see. Damn. If only I'd known. If only I'd made sure to understand his wording precisely.

1367
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,040
I could have avoided all this embarrassment.

1368
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:46,040
Okay, next one is called cringe. 3, 2, 1, go.

1369
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:52,040
That last voicemail. Pretty cringe, bro.

1370
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:56,040
Tell me about it.

1371
01:41:56,040 --> 01:42:03,040
People are getting meta with the order of voicemails.

1372
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:12,040
I agree. Imagine still wanting to recover the scrolls after all this time, you know?

1373
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:20,040
It's like Samurai would clearly have done the yellow chairs and then as fast as possible done the next one.

1374
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:27,040
So as to ensure that he was played twice in a row for the maximum comedic effect.

1375
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:32,040
Now this person is like saying that last whatever it was voicemail was cringe.

1376
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:37,040
It's cool. It's nice to see people are experimenting.

1377
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:43,040
This is an experimental podcast. This is an avant-garde podcast.

1378
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:51,040
This is the only podcast you need anymore from now on.

1379
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:57,040
Next up. Entitlement. 3, 2, 1, go.

1380
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:02,040
I like the new format and I'm perfectly fine with digenate and munching while leaving and wanting to move on.

1381
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:08,040
I get it, people move on. But isn't that kind of only fair that they make some kind of official statement about leaving?

1382
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:12,040
Because when it exists in this weird limbo state of them just staying and not going anywhere.

1383
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:17,040
Well, it's kind of like equivalating or just selling a false truth and you're kind of acting entitled.

1384
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:23,040
I mean, you're really not acting any different than Donald Trump saying he was going to do something about COVID but didn't.

1385
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:28,040
Sorry, but if you refuse to cut them off and make it clear, you guys are the entitled ones, not us.

1386
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:31,040
We pay for it. We pay. Do it.

1387
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,040
I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad.

1388
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:42,040
At the beginning of the podcast we never said like this show will always involve ex-members.

1389
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:47,040
It's always been whoever's around. So that logic doesn't work.

1390
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:53,040
Okay, I don't want to spend too much time on this because it's really stupid.

1391
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,040
I thought this was a joke. Is this serious? Are we taking this seriously?

1392
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:00,040
I don't know. Am I being an idiot? Am I being an idiot to take this seriously?

1393
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:06,040
I don't know. I just don't think comparing us to Donald Trump would ever be a serious comparison.

1394
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:11,040
That part is a little funny. That part's clearly a joke, yes.

1395
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:17,040
The thing about, shouldn't you make a definitive statement? We did.

1396
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,040
We talked about it in no-

1397
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,040
I thought that was part of the joke.

1398
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,040
Oh God, I'm too stupid for this.

1399
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,040
No, maybe I'm stupid. Maybe you're the smart one and I'm being stupid.

1400
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,040
I don't know.

1401
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:32,040
People criticize me for not being able to recognize a joke and these voicemails a lot of the time.

1402
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:35,040
I feel like maybe I am inclined to take them too seriously.

1403
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:40,040
Good one, Mr. Entitlement, sir. You really pulled one over on me.

1404
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:45,040
Okay, next one is called Ben Words Good.

1405
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,040
Yeah, three, two, one, go.

1406
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:53,040
So back when Nate was talking about shower speed runs for the first time,

1407
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,040
Ben asked the question, what is this strange and esoteric ritual?

1408
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:02,040
And that phrase is something that I have not been able to get out of my head.

1409
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,040
It's etched into my memory forever.

1410
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:09,040
It's because it feels like something about it feels so like perfectly,

1411
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:14,040
like it perfectly captures the idea it's trying to convey in tone and meaning.

1412
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:19,040
And like, Ben does this shit all the time or are you just like,

1413
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:25,040
for random, just out of the blue for totally regular ideas,

1414
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:30,040
we'll just suddenly find incredibly elegant ways to say them that are like,

1415
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:35,040
wow, dude, those words were so cool, dude.

1416
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,040
That was epic.

1417
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:37,040
Fuck yeah, bro.

1418
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,040
Keep using cool words, Ben.

1419
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,040
I value clarity.

1420
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:47,040
I think that a simple word is better when it conveys meaning

1421
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:51,040
as well as a complicated or obscure one.

1422
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:58,040
But yeah, I like to get a little fancy with my vocabulary sometimes

1423
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:05,040
because yeah, it can impart a certain tone that I enjoy speaking with

1424
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:09,040
at the right for comedic effect or just for interests.

1425
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:16,040
Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's just nice to use words that are just not used as often

1426
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:23,040
so that you sound like you're saying something that not everyone else says all the time.

1427
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:27,040
Does this trend I've noticed over the past few years where people say super?

1428
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:32,040
Oh, I'm super excited and I notice it now and I don't like it.

1429
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,040
You think it's become cliche?

1430
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,040
I think it has.

1431
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,040
I think it's become super cliche.

1432
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:43,040
Maybe, maybe I've noticed super kind of making a comeback a little bit.

1433
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,040
Maybe.

1434
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:54,040
Listen, don't just follow the crowd.

1435
01:46:54,040 --> 01:47:01,040
You gotta crack open a dictionary, find some words of your own that nobody else uses

1436
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,040
and just use them as often as possible.

1437
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,040
Squeeze them in even when they're not appropriate.

1438
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:10,040
Use exemplary instead of good.

1439
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:16,040
There is a really subtle joy of being really specific with your vocabularies.

1440
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:18,040
Yes, it's really cool to learn.

1441
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:25,040
The words have very complicated meaning in just one word.

1442
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:31,040
One word can mean so much and we invented it for that reason and we don't use them.

1443
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,040
For me, my new word is canard.

1444
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:39,040
I'm gonna say canard every chance I get until I get bored of it

1445
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,040
and no one can stop me.

1446
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:50,040
So, you know, I think that this whole, the whole scheme of like stealing all of Aria's signs off of yards

1447
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,040
sounds like a liberal canard to me.

1448
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,040
That's what I think that probably is.

1449
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:58,040
For instance, use it in a sentence, there I just did.

1450
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,040
What does it mean, sir?

1451
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,040
Thanks for the urban dictionary in real life.

1452
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:08,040
I said on the stream that I thought it meant like a deliberately spread lie.

1453
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,040
I think it's actually a little less specific than that.

1454
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,040
It means here, I can answer this.

1455
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:19,040
I can answer this once and for all, a canard is an unfounded rumor or story,

1456
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:26,040
or second definition, a small wing like projection attached to an aircraft forward of the main wing

1457
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:30,040
to provide extra stability or control, sometimes replacing the tail.

1458
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,040
The more you know.

1459
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,040
Think about it.

1460
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,040
Learn a lot today.

1461
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,040
I think that second definition is a canard.

1462
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:44,040
I couldn't have said it better myself, could not have said it better myself.

1463
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:54,040
Oh, etymology, etymology time from mid 19th century from the old French caner,

1464
01:48:54,040 --> 01:49:05,040
which means to quack into the modern French canard literally duck like the bird or also hoax.

1465
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:12,040
Maybe it's because like a wooden duck uses like a decoy.

1466
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:15,040
Maybe that's the connection there.

1467
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:19,040
The reason why just the word for duck also means a hoax.

1468
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:26,040
Is that why quack doctors use quack as the word?

1469
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,040
Fuck.

1470
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,040
Fuck, I don't know.

1471
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,040
Let's find out.

1472
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,040
This is on the rabbit hole.

1473
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,040
This is real dictionary.

1474
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:39,040
We're going we're going down the rabbit hole free dictionary dot com quack doctor.

1475
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:44,040
Yeah, untrained person pretending to be a physician, a charlatan.

1476
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,040
Oh, this is good.

1477
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:53,040
A definition to a charlatan semicolon a mount a bank.

1478
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:57,040
You definitely don't want to get called a mount a bank.

1479
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:04,040
And then verb it quacked quacking quacks to act as a medical quack or a charlatan.

1480
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,040
What is the what is the etymology?

1481
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,040
What is the etymology here?

1482
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:12,040
I don't I don't please.

1483
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:20,040
Okay, middle middle English quack of imitative of imitative origin.

1484
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,040
So, so it's different from the duck thing.

1485
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,040
I guess that quack.

1486
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:35,040
Maybe they thought that, like, the sound of a duck quacking was a duck, like, trying to, like, imitate.

1487
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,040
No, what the fuck.

1488
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,040
Trying to make.

1489
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,040
That's going.

1490
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,040
They go.

1491
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:46,040
Maybe maybe the middle English quack.

1492
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,040
Maybe quack is not related to quacking.

1493
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:52,040
Maybe it's etymologically similar dissimilar.

1494
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:59,040
Like, like a new bonus episode dictionary reading, like a niggardly, you know, no, no relation.

1495
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,040
Nothing.

1496
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,040
What does that come from that comes from?

1497
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:10,040
What's the the that is from in a in a stingy or meager manner.

1498
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:13,040
And that yeah, just comes from an old English word.

1499
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:19,040
Niggard, which is like a person who is like greedy and and stingy.

1500
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,040
So, you know, there you go.

1501
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:24,040
What does that word come from?

1502
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:30,040
What sort of person from middle from middle English, late, late middle English.

1503
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,040
Oh, alteration of earlier.

1504
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:36,040
Negan probably of Scandinavian origin.

1505
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,040
Okay.

1506
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,040
So there you go.

1507
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,040
A stingy or ungenerous person.

1508
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,040
No more, you know.

1509
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,040
Yeah, I want everyone to go out and say that word.

1510
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,040
Whoops.

1511
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,040
Next up.

1512
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,040
Next up is not a joke.

1513
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:56,040
Three, two, one, go.

1514
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:09,040
You know, every time like hypocrites or Digi bro, or whoever starts talking about like gender, I just kind of skip ahead five minutes.

1515
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,040
And anybody else do that.

1516
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:17,040
Yeah, me for sure.

1517
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,040
Incredible.

1518
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,040
Whatever.

1519
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,040
Just kidding.

1520
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,040
No, I'm just kidding.

1521
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:25,040
I mean, if it's a topic you're not interested in, it doesn't matter.

1522
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,040
I don't know why he's asking us.

1523
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,040
We can't skip ahead.

1524
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,040
Yeah.

1525
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:36,040
I feel like this is a dress to the audience and people can sound off in the comments.

1526
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,040
Oh, sure.

1527
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:42,040
It's the same way like if somebody starts talking about Final Fantasy 7, I'm like, oh, I don't know.

1528
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,040
Yeah, you know, that's fair.

1529
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:52,040
Yeah, my version of skipping ahead is like, go doom scroll through Twitter for a while.

1530
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:58,040
Okay, next one is called Praying for a Digi and Hippo.

1531
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:03,040
Three, two, one, go.

1532
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:07,040
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

1533
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:12,040
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

1534
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:19,040
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1535
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:24,040
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

1536
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:28,040
Hail Mary, full of grace, but what Lord is with thee.

1537
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:32,040
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1538
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:35,040
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners.

1539
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,040
What, did you have to pray in middle school?

1540
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:40,040
Oh, yeah, I went to church until I was 17.

1541
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:43,040
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, the Creator.

1542
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,040
I mean, I went to church when I was a kid.

1543
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:49,040
I never said a hail Mary.

1544
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:54,040
My mom was like super religious, so we would go to church every Sunday.

1545
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:57,040
We'd have to do a rosary all the way there and all the way back.

1546
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,040
Really?

1547
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,040
Yeah, it was a nightmare.

1548
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,040
Were you Catholic?

1549
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,040
Yep, hardcore.

1550
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:08,040
I mean, I didn't buy into it, but I was forced at gunpoint to do the dance.

1551
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:17,040
This definitely reminds me of that one or two times I've been to church, where I talk over the guy speaking with my friends.

1552
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:21,040
The resurrection of the body and life everlasting, amen.

1553
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:24,040
That was for you, Gib.

1554
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:26,040
That was all legit. That was all real.

1555
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:30,040
Do you feel better? Do you feel touched by the Lord?

1556
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,040
Do you feel more manly?

1557
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,040
Nah.

1558
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,040
Damn, fuck.

1559
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,040
Satan wins again.

1560
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:42,040
I don't know what he was praying about. He was just saying God.

1561
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:45,040
Damn.

1562
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,040
I think we're being a little unfair.

1563
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:53,040
Maybe these were prayers for a good, solid, strong transition.

1564
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,040
Everything goes great.

1565
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,040
We don't know what this is talking about.

1566
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,040
You're right.

1567
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:04,040
I mean, who's more supportive of trans people than the Catholic Church?

1568
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:09,040
You know, the Pope is a crypto leftist after all.

1569
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,040
Right, right.

1570
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:17,040
Oh wait, I was going to say, I went to a Protestant church.

1571
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:23,040
We didn't say Hail Mary, but we said the Lord's Prayer and I don't know.

1572
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:25,040
It's one of those other ones.

1573
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,040
I get the flashbacks from the first half of it.

1574
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:33,040
I recognize the first part.

1575
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:39,040
My first school had a church attached to it, like an old English church.

1576
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:44,040
So we would go in there every Friday to do a prayer thing.

1577
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,040
I was like, whatever.

1578
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:48,040
Wait, are you at school?

1579
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:49,040
Yeah.

1580
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:53,040
We had every morning that was an assembly before we would go to lessons.

1581
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,040
Four days out of the week, we would have it in the school hall.

1582
01:55:56,040 --> 01:56:00,040
And then on Friday, we would have it in the church because it was right there.

1583
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:04,040
Did you go like a private religious school or something?

1584
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,040
No, no.

1585
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,040
It was called...

1586
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,040
Your school was called...

1587
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,040
Yeah.

1588
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,040
I don't know what it meant.

1589
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
It was just like a school that was right next to a church.

1590
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:19,040
I think it may have been like a religious school at one point.

1591
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:23,040
It was just a school that had access to a church.

1592
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,040
It was like, let's use this.

1593
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:26,040
We used the church for the nativity.

1594
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,040
It was really actually epic.

1595
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:31,040
I really like churches.

1596
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,040
You did the nativity?

1597
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,040
It was like a school play thing?

1598
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,040
Yeah.

1599
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:40,040
That's the thing you do at Christmas time.

1600
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,040
The year six would do the nativity.

1601
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:45,040
That's not secular.

1602
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,040
It was a church.

1603
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,040
Of course, it wasn't secular.

1604
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,040
You stupid fuck.

1605
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,040
No, but it was a school, though.

1606
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,040
I'm talking this was at school, though.

1607
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:57,040
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1608
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:02,040
I'm just surprised that in the course of your regular schooling things,

1609
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:05,040
like your state, your public state school,

1610
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,040
you would do religious observances.

1611
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,040
That's fine.

1612
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,040
That's surprising.

1613
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,040
I never did that shit.

1614
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,040
I don't know.

1615
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:15,040
I don't know how it normally works.

1616
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:18,040
I mean, a lot of schools didn't have churches attached to them.

1617
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:22,040
It was literally like two seconds walk outside the front building.

1618
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:27,040
It doesn't surprise me that you would use the church or do things in this old church,

1619
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:31,040
but that you would have school prayer time is like, hmm.

1620
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,040
Well, it's not really prayer time.

1621
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:41,040
It was just like there were hymns and a prayer was said when we were in the church,

1622
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,040
because it's just a thing.

1623
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,040
Yeah, prayer time.

1624
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,040
Yeah, it sounds exactly like prayer.

1625
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:50,040
That's what I said.

1626
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,040
I don't know.

1627
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:59,040
Like the thing with it is that it was strangely like, you know,

1628
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:03,040
like it wasn't like said to be true in a way.

1629
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:07,040
Like you were left to think whatever you felt.

1630
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:10,040
And yeah, it was, I don't know.

1631
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:12,040
Like when I learned about how America was,

1632
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:15,040
I was like confused that people actually believed all that stuff.

1633
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,040
I thought it was just stories because that's how I was taught it.

1634
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:21,040
It was taught as like parables and stuff like, oh yeah, cool.

1635
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:25,040
I never once thought that it was actually true and I would go to hell.

1636
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,040
None of that happened.

1637
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:34,040
But like, I mean, you must have known some people who were sincere believers growing up, right?

1638
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:38,040
No, I knew a Hindu person in a Sikh.

1639
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:42,040
And you didn't know any Muslims?

1640
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,040
Maybe there were a few Christians that I don't know that they were like devout,

1641
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:49,040
like followers of anything in particular.

1642
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,040
Most people were atheists.

1643
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:55,040
Okay, like Christmas, like observing Christmas,

1644
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:58,040
when like what Christmas is was being explained to you.

1645
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:03,040
Did nobody say like, yeah, you know, people believe in like the,

1646
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:08,040
you know, the salvation of man through the blood of Christ or whatever.

1647
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:14,040
I mean, I probably just assumed that it was all part of the festivities

1648
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:19,040
and it wasn't like a serious thing because it, you know, it's like,

1649
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,040
oh yeah, when you're in the church, you say all these things,

1650
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:23,040
say your hymns and prayers.

1651
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:26,040
And that's just, you know, that's the fun of the thing.

1652
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,040
And you know, I didn't like saying the prayers all the time,

1653
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,040
just sort of mumble it.

1654
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,040
Yeah.

1655
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:34,040
It's like in the same way that like you, I don't know,

1656
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:37,040
you wear green on St. Patrick's Day, like whatever.

1657
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:40,040
Yeah, like it's not like a sincere religious belief.

1658
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:44,040
Even though I'm sure a lot of people like parents and stuff,

1659
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:46,040
they were religious, they did all that stuff,

1660
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:50,040
but they didn't like, the conversation never really came up.

1661
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:53,040
I think everyone was just coexisting, which is cool.

1662
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,040
Sure.

1663
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,040
Okay.

1664
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,040
That's weird.

1665
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:59,040
That's weird was kind of interesting.

1666
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,040
Thanks for the, thanks for the tidbits.

1667
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,040
Haha.

1668
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,040
Now I know where you went to school.

1669
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,040
Uh-oh.

1670
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,040
I'm going to get you.

1671
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:07,040
Oh, wait, wait.

1672
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,040
I'm going to get you.

1673
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:12,040
Elisar, Elisar, scrub that from the record, the name of the school.

1674
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,040
Wait, really?

1675
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,040
I don't know.

1676
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:18,040
What if they like, you know, send a nuke to it with my name on it?

1677
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:21,040
Hahaha.

1678
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:25,040
Ah, based, based, based, based.

1679
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,040
Next up is a MBF.

1680
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:33,040
Uh, three, two, one, go.

1681
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,040
Mon.

1682
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,040
Uh, bark.

1683
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:38,040
Fart.

1684
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:39,040
Fart.

1685
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:41,040
I think that's classic.

1686
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,040
That's a triple threat.

1687
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:46,040
Hahaha.

1688
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:48,040
That does conjure a funny image.

1689
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,040
It's sweet.

1690
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,040
It's a triple threat.

1691
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:53,040
Like you, like you finish the, the, the coitus.

1692
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,040
You're nuts.

1693
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,040
Finish the coin.

1694
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,040
Hahaha.

1695
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,040
She enjoys it.

1696
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,040
At the same time a dog barks and you fart.

1697
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,040
It's the perfect triple.

1698
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,040
Hmm.

1699
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:02,040
Hmm.

1700
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:05,040
Ah, God, I, God, I wish that were me.

1701
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,040
I want what they have.

1702
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:11,040
Uh, next up, communist cowboy.

1703
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:14,040
Three, two, one, go.

1704
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,040
Yeah.

1705
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:19,040
Musical interlude.

1706
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:22,040
It's been a while.

1707
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:25,040
Welcome to the top fourth wall.

1708
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:26,040
Hahaha.

1709
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:27,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1710
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,040
Hey there.

1711
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,040
Sorry, I didn't see you walk up.

1712
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:33,040
It's me, your old pal, communist cowboy.

1713
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,040
Hey.

1714
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,040
The elite want to keep you poor and enslaved under their

1715
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,040
corporate crack system.

1716
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:40,040
They've rigged the social structure, placed the masses in a

1717
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:44,040
state of stagnant subsistence while a mass near a fathomble

1718
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,040
levels of wealth.

1719
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,040
Instead of uplifting their workers and citizens together,

1720
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:52,040
they'd line their pockets past necessity in a shallow

1721
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,040
attempt to make themselves feel something in those hollow

1722
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,040
hearts layers.

1723
02:01:56,040 --> 02:02:00,040
Remember, fought for labor rats, unionization, and

1724
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,040
healthcare for all.

1725
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:05,040
And finally, never forget, from each corner of their

1726
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:08,040
ability to each according to their need.

1727
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,040
Thanks for coming.

1728
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,040
Play the guitar again.

1729
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,040
Communist cowboy out.

1730
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:13,040
Yeah.

1731
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:16,040
Woo, I love you communist cowboy.

1732
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:23,040
What a majestic creature.

1733
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:28,040
Yeah.

1734
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:36,040
I imagined the engineer from Team Fortress 2 was talking to us.

1735
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:44,040
He's a big communist, that guy.

1736
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,040
Next up.

1737
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,040
Spoopy stories one.

1738
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,040
I wonder if this will be spoopier than the story of how

1739
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:55,040
you finger banged a girl who got turned on from sending

1740
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:57,040
nudes to Christian.

1741
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:00,040
That's the scariest thing I've ever heard in my life.

1742
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:03,040
Three, two, one, go.

1743
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,040
Hey, thanks.

1744
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:07,040
So it's October and spoopy season has officially begun.

1745
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,040
And I was wondering if any of you have any scary, weird or

1746
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:13,040
cold stories from any place you've ever lived at.

1747
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,040
I'll give you three examples where you can think of stuff and

1748
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:19,040
I'm going to tell these stories from least to most spoopy.

1749
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:22,040
So I live in an apartment complex and there's a room in the

1750
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:25,040
third floor where every tenant that has lived there has

1751
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:26,040
ended up killing themselves.

1752
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:29,040
I've only lived here for three years and the complex isn't

1753
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,040
very old.

1754
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:33,040
I think it's been around, it was built sometime around 2014

1755
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:37,040
and only four tenants or so have lived there.

1756
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,040
So yeah, that's pretty weird.

1757
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:42,040
And now I'm going to give you a bit of context for the next

1758
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,040
story.

1759
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:46,040
I grew up in Mexican and American border cities.

1760
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:50,040
So there's going to be elements of like people crossing the

1761
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:54,040
border to and fro.

1762
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:58,040
In the late 80s, my high school was infamous because there was

1763
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:02,040
this white, rich, all American kid like a senior in high

1764
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:05,040
school that was dating a younger Latino girl.

1765
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,040
And the kid breaks up with her.

1766
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:11,040
But the problem is that like the girl's mom was over the moon

1767
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:14,040
and that her daughter was dating this kid because he was like

1768
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,040
a top 10 of his class.

1769
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:20,040
He was athletic, like his family's rich, more respected in

1770
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:21,040
the community.

1771
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:26,040
And she goes to see a fortune teller to see if she can

1772
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,040
hex the kid.

1773
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:31,040
The fortune teller says no, but then she could arrange to

1774
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,040
kill him.

1775
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,040
What?

1776
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:35,040
Okay.

1777
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,040
All right.

1778
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,040
Spoopy stories too.

1779
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:42,040
I feel like these spoopy stories need like the sound of a

1780
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:44,040
crackling fire in the background.

1781
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,040
They do.

1782
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:46,040
Eleazar.

1783
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,040
No, no, no.

1784
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,040
He has to do it.

1785
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,040
Sort us out.

1786
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:51,040
Okay, or don't.

1787
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,040
I don't care.

1788
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:53,040
Spoopy stories too.

1789
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,040
Here we go.

1790
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:56,040
Three, two, one, go.

1791
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:59,040
So the girl's mom agrees and two hitmen from Mexico crossed

1792
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:03,040
the border to kill a high school kid just because he wanted to

1793
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:05,040
enjoy some college pussy.

1794
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,040
This last story takes place in Mexico again during the late

1795
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:09,040
early 90s.

1796
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,040
That's the end.

1797
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:13,040
My Mexican hometown was known for a cult called narcosatánicos

1798
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,040
or Satanist drug lords.

1799
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:18,040
This cult was led by a Cuban guy that was a drug dealer that

1800
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:21,040
fancied himself as sort of witch doctor and soothsayer.

1801
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:24,040
And the cult believed in Santería, Paloma Llombe, which is

1802
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:27,040
some African Cuban spiritualist shit and plastic shit like

1803
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,040
human sacrifice stuff.

1804
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:32,040
To facilitate the killings, the cult leader recruits a gorgeous

1805
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:35,040
girl who makes who he makes second in command, by the way,

1806
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,040
that lived like three blocks down from my house.

1807
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:40,040
Incidentally, we both lived near a cemetery and she was

1808
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:43,040
supposedly this tough and blonde girl that could easily be

1809
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,040
mistaken as American.

1810
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,040
They kill a bunch of people, but they get busted because

1811
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:50,040
during spring break, kids from all over the neighboring

1812
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,040
U.S. state would come to drink illegally at my hometown,

1813
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:54,040
both at the beach and at the red light district.

1814
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:57,040
The girl seduced some American dude from up north, got him

1815
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:00,040
drunk at a nightclub and took him to a ranch, all while in the

1816
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:01,040
company of cult members.

1817
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:04,040
A chop of his body removed his brain and threw it in a cauldron.

1818
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:07,040
Because the cult leader was a sadistic fuck that killed

1819
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,040
random people, competing drug lords and small animals.

1820
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:12,040
They targeted this kid because he was said to be a doctor and

1821
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:14,040
the cult leader wanted a smart prank for his rituals.

1822
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:17,040
The guy finally reports him missing and I think the U.S.

1823
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:20,040
governmental figures press the Mexican government to

1824
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:21,040
solve the case.

1825
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:24,040
So yeah, that's my hometown.

1826
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:25,040
How about yours?

1827
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:31,040
I feel like your spooky storytelling skills need some

1828
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:34,040
more drama to them.

1829
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:38,040
Yeah, those weren't spooky as much as like...

1830
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:40,040
Like police reports, sort of.

1831
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:41,040
Yeah.

1832
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:44,040
I mean, it's scary to imagine that those things happened.

1833
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:48,040
There's an art to making a story scary, you know?

1834
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:51,040
You got to have a bit of an ambiance, a little bit of

1835
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,040
atmosphere.

1836
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:56,040
The spookiest part was the weight between one and two because

1837
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,040
there was some tension there.

1838
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:01,040
And I thought that the second story was going to continue,

1839
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:04,040
but it ended almost immediately as that voicemail started.

1840
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,040
That one was like...

1841
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:09,040
It's like, oh yeah, the fortune teller says that,

1842
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,040
no, I can't hex him, but I can arrange to kill him.

1843
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,040
And I'm like, what?

1844
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,040
Twist.

1845
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,040
And then I start the next one and it's just like,

1846
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:18,040
so yeah, she got some guys to go kill him.

1847
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:20,040
It's like, oh.

1848
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,040
Tension deflated.

1849
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,040
So did he die?

1850
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,040
I assume he died then, I guess.

1851
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:29,040
I think his question was, do we have any hometown scary stories

1852
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,040
of that nature?

1853
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,040
I don't know.

1854
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,040
Set the bar pretty high.

1855
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:37,040
Well, not literally of that nature, but like scary stories

1856
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:39,040
related to where you live.

1857
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:42,040
There were some ghost stories in my hometown.

1858
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:44,040
Oh, there was one of...

1859
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:45,040
I don't even remember.

1860
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:48,040
It's like some kind of like ghost of like a lumberjack or

1861
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:51,040
something or some like woodsman who like you'll see on the

1862
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,040
highway or something.

1863
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:53,040
I don't know.

1864
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,040
Like that's about it.

1865
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:55,040
I don't even know.

1866
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,040
I don't even know the details.

1867
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,040
I was never quite clear on them.

1868
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:03,040
It's like, yeah, there's a scary woodsman ghost who is on the

1869
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:04,040
road.

1870
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:07,040
Don't get killed.

1871
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:10,040
Yeah, I don't remember anything about it.

1872
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:12,040
There's Jack the Ripper.

1873
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,040
He's in London.

1874
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,040
That's close by.

1875
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:21,040
I think I talked about how the time that when I got to college

1876
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,040
as a freshman, there was like a ghost tour of the

1877
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:26,040
campus because the campus was supposed to be haunted and we

1878
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:30,040
went up to this like room and like the great hall or whatever.

1879
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:34,040
And there was like a camera flash and I thought I saw some ghosts

1880
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:38,040
in the window and I was like, hey, Mr. Ghost Tour, I saw some

1881
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:40,040
ghosts in the window and he was like, what are they?

1882
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:42,040
And I was like, well, it looked like an old man and a young

1883
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,040
boy and the old man was wearing a poncho.

1884
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:46,040
And he's like, no, those aren't the ghosts.

1885
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,040
And I'm like, oh darn.

1886
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,040
Okay.

1887
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:51,040
Those are some other ghosts.

1888
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:54,040
No, it's a woman ghost that lives here.

1889
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:55,040
Those are tourist ghosts.

1890
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,040
Yeah.

1891
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,040
They're just passing through.

1892
02:08:57,040 --> 02:09:00,040
Don't worry about them.

1893
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:02,040
That would actually be pretty scary to hear someone say that.

1894
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,040
It's like, oh, the ghosts are so commonplace and we just have

1895
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:07,040
ones like that just passing through.

1896
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:11,040
There's a fucking hot spot of fucking paranormal activity.

1897
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:14,040
Frankly, there's just too many ghosts to even keep track of.

1898
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:16,040
I wouldn't bother.

1899
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:19,040
You know, you'll get haunted one of these days and you won't even

1900
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:20,040
know who it is.

1901
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:23,040
Don't just accept your fate.

1902
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,040
Next one is called.

1903
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:27,040
Oh, this is going to be so sick.

1904
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:30,040
Mig Tao owns minorities, BTFO.

1905
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:34,040
It's going to be pretty good.

1906
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:37,040
Three, two, one, go.

1907
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:41,040
Isn't it ironic how there's this vocal minority of commenters

1908
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:45,040
who are asking for better days and think this podcast has gone

1909
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:48,040
downhill and is dying because their favorite member won't

1910
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:50,040
show up on the show.

1911
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:52,040
Oh, boo fucking who?

1912
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:54,040
What are you doing complaining about it here?

1913
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:56,040
You know they're all doing their own shit, right?

1914
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:57,040
Meijia has a Twitter.

1915
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,040
She's streaming.

1916
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:00,040
Nate streams twice per week.

1917
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,040
Did you still doing stuff?

1918
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:04,040
And Jesse always posts at the end of the month.

1919
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:06,040
What the fuck are you guys doing here, bitchin'?

1920
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:07,040
Get out of here.

1921
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:08,040
Agreed.

1922
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:10,040
Agreed.

1923
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:14,040
Have we talked about, did we mention Meijia's new puppet?

1924
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:16,040
Oh, yeah.

1925
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:19,040
I haven't seen it in action yet.

1926
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:24,040
She made a 2D one, which looked good,

1927
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:27,040
but I think the rigging was a little glitchy.

1928
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:31,040
But she made another one, a 3D one,

1929
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:35,040
which I tuned into her stream yesterday and it looks great.

1930
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:37,040
It looks great in motion.

1931
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,040
I'm very impressed.

1932
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:43,040
I need to ask her about that then.

1933
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:48,040
I asked her about it and she told me the program she used and stuff.

1934
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:50,040
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1935
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:53,040
Oh God, Jesus fucking Christ!

1936
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:55,040
Oh, did you pull a hamstring?

1937
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:59,040
No, I just, no, I dropped my, I was clipping,

1938
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:05,040
I was idly clipping my cuticle with some nail clippers

1939
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:09,040
and I dropped it directly onto my testicle and it hurt.

1940
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:13,040
So, I mean, I'm wearing shorts, but like, I don't know.

1941
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:17,040
The weight, oh, ah, oh God.

1942
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,040
All right.

1943
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,040
What a strange situation.

1944
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:24,040
Only on the Procrastinators podcast,

1945
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:26,040
you get quality entertainment like this.

1946
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:27,040
No, it's normal.

1947
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,040
It's normal.

1948
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:32,040
Next one is called the RQ,

1949
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:35,040
and this is our last one of the day.

1950
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,040
So three, two, one, go.

1951
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,040
So like, Radcon 3, like, what?

1952
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:43,040
Two, three years, like, without the Radcon,

1953
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:46,040
there's no point in the existing, you know?

1954
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:49,040
Point in what existing?

1955
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,040
Radcon.

1956
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:53,040
Oh, is it the Radcon question?

1957
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,040
Right?

1958
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:55,040
Is that what it's about?

1959
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,040
I think he's saying that like,

1960
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,040
I think, is he saying that like,

1961
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:03,040
if there's no Radcon, there's no point in the PCP existing?

1962
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:06,040
Uh...

1963
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:10,040
I mean, the PCP preceded the idea of Radcon,

1964
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:13,040
and we decided to meet up because the podcast was like,

1965
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:16,040
oh, we want to meet up in person because the podcast is nice,

1966
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:19,040
but it would be better if we were together.

1967
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:22,040
Um, I mean, what do you guys,

1968
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:25,040
what are your guys' thoughts about Radcon 5?

1969
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,040
Uh, it needs to happen.

1970
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:30,040
My thoughts about Radcon 5 is that, um,

1971
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:32,040
I would like it to happen,

1972
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:35,040
but it's, I have no idea.

1973
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:40,040
Like, how or where or when due to COVID and other things.

1974
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:41,040
Yeah.

1975
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:42,040
Mostly COVID.

1976
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:43,040
Yeah.

1977
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:46,040
I mean, yeah, for one thing, COVID.

1978
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,040
For two, uh, I mean,

1979
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:52,040
not even really worth thinking about until all the content from Radcon 4

1980
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:54,040
has been put out there.

1981
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:55,040
Indeed.

1982
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:56,040
It's still working.

1983
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,040
We're still working on it.

1984
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,040
Yeah.

1985
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:59,040
Yeah, true.

1986
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,040
Um, I gotta get,

1987
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:04,040
I actually gotta buckle down and get mine done.

1988
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,040
Yeah.

1989
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:07,040
Yeah.

1990
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:09,040
So for those two reasons,

1991
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:10,040
I haven't really been thinking about it.

1992
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:13,040
I mean, I do think we're probably going to do it at some point.

1993
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:14,040
Right?

1994
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:15,040
Yeah, definitely.

1995
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,040
Yeah.

1996
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:18,040
It would be, I would, I would think so.

1997
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:21,040
I don't, I'm not like, I haven't just, yeah,

1998
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,040
I wouldn't count out a Radcon 5 eventually.

1999
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:24,040
I don't know when.

2000
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:27,040
It really depends when America gets its head out of its ass.

2001
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,040
Maybe sometime next year would be cool if,

2002
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,040
if we could make that happen.

2003
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:31,040
I don't know.

2004
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,040
That's not, you know,

2005
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:36,040
the real question is who would want to turn up.

2006
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:38,040
Would everyone want to come back?

2007
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,040
Or at least Nate and Digi?

2008
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:40,040
I don't know.

2009
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:43,040
Um, I would,

2010
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:44,040
you know,

2011
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:45,040
I mean,

2012
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:48,040
Nate and Digi are,

2013
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:49,040
Nate,

2014
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:52,040
I don't think Nate is like permanently gone or anything.

2015
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:53,040
Nate has,

2016
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:54,040
Nate has not,

2017
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:56,040
Nate has like deliberately not committed to like,

2018
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:59,040
I am leaving the podcast or anything.

2019
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,040
He has not done that.

2020
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:03,040
So I would imagine that, yeah,

2021
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:05,040
he would probably be at a Radcon.

2022
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,040
Digi, I'm sure,

2023
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:08,040
I'm sure Digi would come to a Radcon.

2024
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:10,040
I mean, Jesse fucking showed up to the last one

2025
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:12,040
and Jesse's not on the fucking podcast anymore.

2026
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:13,040
Yeah.

2027
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:14,040
Yeah.

2028
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,040
Radcons are an event.

2029
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:17,040
They are.

2030
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:18,040
And they're always a good time.

2031
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:22,040
And I'm sure Radcon 5 will be just as great as the other ones.

2032
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,040
Yeah.

2033
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:28,040
All we need to do is to not promise to make a fucking anime OVA next time.

2034
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:29,040
Yeah.

2035
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,040
You know what?

2036
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:31,040
You know what?

2037
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:32,040
Hold on.

2038
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:33,040
Hold on.

2039
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,040
I, I mean,

2040
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:37,040
why do you say that?

2041
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,040
Oh, well,

2042
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:43,040
actually I specifically the animated OP for it and all of the other stretch goals

2043
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:46,040
that we didn't really think about adding right at the last minute

2044
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:49,040
that have hung over our heads in an annoying way.

2045
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,040
It's a lot of time,

2046
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:53,040
a lot of labor that we don't,

2047
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:55,040
that we're not directly responsible for.

2048
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:57,040
So it's kind of out of our control,

2049
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:00,040
whether it gets done and stuff like that.

2050
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:01,040
I don't know.

2051
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,040
Like I know it's been a while,

2052
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:08,040
but like do you feel that I don't feel like,

2053
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:12,040
I don't feel like the OVA has been like a weight hanging over my head.

2054
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:16,040
I feel like it's been something that we have like committed resources to getting done

2055
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:18,040
and that is getting done in the background.

2056
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:19,040
You know,

2057
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:25,040
my, my hesitation is not even so much the fact that the task is so massive and scope

2058
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:27,040
and like requires all the stuff to be done.

2059
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,040
I think it's that all of the,

2060
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,040
a lot of the content,

2061
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:37,040
including this stuff for Radcom was kind of centered around the bit of Brad

2062
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,040
and that joke is dead and old.

2063
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,040
And so like it just feels,

2064
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:42,040
the longer this goes on,

2065
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:43,040
the more it's like nobody cares.

2066
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,040
I don't even care anymore.

2067
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:45,040
You know,

2068
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,040
it's, it's dead.

2069
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:47,040
It's a dead meme.

2070
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:50,040
And it's just going to come out like two years from now and everyone's going to be like,

2071
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,040
Oh, right.

2072
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,040
I remember that.

2073
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,040
I mean, I hope, I mean, I hope it won't be that long.

2074
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:55,040
Okay.

2075
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:58,040
To a certain extent, to a certain extent, I agree with you.

2076
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:00,040
I don't think, I mean, in a way,

2077
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:03,040
I think that's funny in and of itself.

2078
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,040
Yeah, that's not my issue.

2079
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:11,040
It's, it's really just like if we're going to do a Kickstarter with rewards and stuff.

2080
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,040
Merch is doable.

2081
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,040
This is, this is known.

2082
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:20,040
It just takes time and not creativity necessarily.

2083
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:21,040
You just need,

2084
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:22,040
we just need the logo.

2085
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:23,040
We need the resources.

2086
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,040
Merch works.

2087
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:29,040
Videos is like,

2088
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,040
I don't know,

2089
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,040
depending on like the,

2090
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,040
the amount of effort put into them,

2091
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:35,040
they take time to film.

2092
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,040
The, the lectures are great.

2093
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,040
Obviously we would do more of those,

2094
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:45,040
but they take so much energy out of everyone and so much time to get ready and then record.

2095
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,040
Like Redcon 4.

2096
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:53,040
Redcon 4 was not long enough of a time to fit all of those things in,

2097
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,040
even though it technically was,

2098
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:58,040
it felt like nothing happened because we were constantly doing things.

2099
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:59,040
Do you mean, you mean,

2100
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,040
yeah, you know, yeah.

2101
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:03,040
Constantly recording and constantly getting ready for lectures

2102
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:06,040
and constantly doing things for the OVA.

2103
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:07,040
And I was like,

2104
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,040
I didn't really have a time to like even think when it was over.

2105
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:12,040
Yeah.

2106
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:13,040
Yeah.

2107
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:16,040
I mean, I think,

2108
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,040
I think,

2109
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:21,040
I mean,

2110
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,040
I have seen how the OVA is coming.

2111
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:25,040
And I think it looks good.

2112
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:27,040
And yeah, I know it's been a while and it's,

2113
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,040
it's a bit of a shame how long it's taken,

2114
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:30,040
but I think that when it comes out,

2115
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:32,040
it will still be pretty cool.

2116
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:38,040
And I don't feel like I am prepared to like regret having done it or anything.

2117
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:39,040
Oh no.

2118
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:41,040
No, I'm really just thinking forward,

2119
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:42,040
Redcon 5,

2120
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:45,040
I'm not going to say I'm going to,

2121
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:50,040
I'm prepared to do something that I have no idea of being able to do.

2122
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:51,040
Yeah.

2123
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:54,040
I'm not going to try and stretch it just because of like a,

2124
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:57,040
the last five minutes of a hype stream,

2125
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:01,040
where we push the Kickstarter way over all of the stretch goals

2126
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,040
and add so many things.

2127
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:04,040
It's like, that's,

2128
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:06,040
I don't want that to happen again.

2129
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,040
Yeah.

2130
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:09,040
No.

2131
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,040
You make a solid argument.

2132
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,040
You make a solid case.

2133
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:20,040
I guess, I guess I agree.

2134
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:22,040
Yeah.

2135
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:23,040
I'm not trying to be a downer about it.

2136
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,040
It was, it was cool that that all got funded

2137
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:29,040
and we will eventually make it as just a,

2138
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:32,040
I can understand the frustrations of people who are waiting

2139
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:34,040
and thinking, God, it's been a while.

2140
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:36,040
And I'm like, yeah, it has, it has.

2141
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:40,040
It has, but it was always going to.

2142
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:46,040
Uh, uh, uh, you know what, it's going to be funny.

2143
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:48,040
In hindsight, we'll look back and be like,

2144
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:52,040
sure is weird that all these things got made.

2145
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:54,040
Yes.

2146
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:57,040
And on, and on this very strange time table,

2147
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,040
but that's what it was.

2148
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:01,040
And I think that,

2149
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,040
I think that when it's all said and done,

2150
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:06,040
in the current state of it,

2151
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:08,040
like mostly being like unfinished,

2152
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,040
a lot of like the bigger stuff,

2153
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,040
I think that it feels bad and sucks to think about,

2154
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:14,040
but I think that once it is all done

2155
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:16,040
and we can look back on the whole thing

2156
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:18,040
and like talk about it as an, as a whole,

2157
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:19,040
it'll be funny.

2158
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,040
Yeah.

2159
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:24,040
I mean, it's already funny how this like happened

2160
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:25,040
just before COVID.

2161
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:28,040
Like that's already a funny aspect to it.

2162
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,040
Like we did a little stupid shit.

2163
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:33,040
It's true.

2164
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:34,040
It's true.

2165
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:35,040
It makes better in a certain way.

2166
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:42,040
I am planning to buckle down soon

2167
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:44,040
and get my fucking lecture out.

2168
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:46,040
That's a thing I should really do

2169
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:47,040
sooner rather than later.

2170
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:49,040
And I'm almost ready.

2171
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,040
I'm almost ready to do it, boys.

2172
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,040
I don't know.

2173
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:56,040
Any final thoughts before we wrap up?

2174
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,040
I'm good.

2175
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:00,040
Yeah.

2176
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:02,040
No, you're...

2177
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:03,040
This was an episode.

2178
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,040
Bad.

2179
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:05,040
It was an episode.

2180
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:06,040
It's true.

2181
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:07,040
This did occur.

2182
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,040
It did.

2183
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,040

Right.

2205
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:11,040
I have COVID shirt for those of you have.

2206
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,040
Sure.

2207
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:13,040
Every day of the week.

2208
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,040
Keep people guessing around you, you know.

2209
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:19,040
What is our store?

2210
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:20,040
Whatever.

2211
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:21,040
Link in the description.

2212
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,040
We got the group piss.

2213
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:24,040
We got all of the epic things.

2214
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:26,040
The group piss.

2215
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:27,040
The group piss.

2216
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:28,040
The classic.

2217
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:29,040
Those were good.

2218
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:32,040
We are the reason people are dying shirt.

2219
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:33,040
I'm just being cool.

2220
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:36,040
You know, there are memes.

2221
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:38,040
A bunch of fresh looks.

2222
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:43,040
Guys, I gotta say I want to eat some activated charcoal

2223
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,040
black ice cream.

2224
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:46,040
Oh, be careful.

2225
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:50,040
Be careful of activated charcoal.

2226
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:54,040
I saw that activated charcoal can flush chemicals

2227
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:57,040
out of your body, including estrogen.

2228
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,040
If you're an HRT, right?

2229
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:00,040
Yeah, I heard that.

2230
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:01,040
I saw that same thing.

2231
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:02,040
Someone on Twitter was like,

2232
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:03,040
guys, watch out.

2233
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,040
They don't warn you about this.

2234
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:06,040
It's like, fuck.

2235
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:08,040
I want it.

2236
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:10,040
I just want it because it looks cool.

2237
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:13,040
Just get Oreo cr- biscuits and crumble them.

2238
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,040
No, those are brown.

2239
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,040
Not black enough.

2240
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:18,040
Get squid ink.

2241
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:20,040
Squid ink the fuck out of that.

2242
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,040
Squid ink ice cream might be pretty good.

2243
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,040
Okay, I would think about that.

2244
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:26,040
Okay, anyway, that was my final thoughts.

2245
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:28,040
I think that's it.

2246
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:29,040
Are we done?

2247
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,040
Have we finished the episode?

2248
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:31,040
I guess we're good.

2249
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:32,040
Yeah, we're good.

2250
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:33,040
We're super good.

2251
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:34,040
We're fucking, we're the fucking best.

2252
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:35,040
We're killing it here.

2253
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:38,040
We're killing it here on the pro-Crossinators podcast

2254
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:41,040
of Vote Arya Demetso for a sheriff

2255
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,040
of Chester County, New Hampshire.

2256
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,040
Bye.

2257
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,040
Goodbye.

2258
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:48,040
Be that.

2259
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:59,040
Bye.
