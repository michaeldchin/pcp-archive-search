00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,400
Gotta make more like I honestly think we should we should we should all be obligated to make like one new t-shirt per month

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
We could churn out fucking shirts, okay?

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm hypocrite that was Ben St. and Nate Bestman the best bangers

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm voting for a t-shirt that says holy shit a t-shirt you should make it make it and put it on the PCV thing

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,880
easy to make um

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,320
Um, they're so easy well kind of if you know how teespring works, which I had to learn through a long and arduous arduous process

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,360
It was a give as well also dealt with some shit there. I mean he's my he's my I'm tutoring him

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm tutoring hippo in the teespring arts. It's the uh, I'm an apprentice to that to that skill

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,680
Because teespring is is like a bucking bronco. It's really yeah, I went to college. I I majored in teespring

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,360
You know engineering and teespring uh usage. I'm pretty good. It's pretty lucrative career

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,080
Yes, it is hippo by the shirts you had to buy the by the shirts

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,680
Uh, they should be uh, I went and connected the youtube so you might by this point when you're listening to this

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,000
You might be able to see shirts down under the video. Oh hell. No hell. Yeah

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Uh, you had a great idea hippo with a we talked about this before the show

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,480
And I'm gonna bring it back up the the where hashtag wears the podcast shirt

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,160
And I said that I said, yeah

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,280
I said I would love that but what I would really love to really solidify that meme is if

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Whoever runs that podcast that pizza party podcast

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
I've heard so much about but haven't been able to locate

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,160
If one of them would acknowledge it if they would like be like why is everyone always saying hashtag?

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,600
Where's the podcast in the comments? What's going on? That would solidify it. That's that's my goal

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,640
They should they should make sure and they should all wear them

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,360
I just want them to acknowledge that no one can find this podcast. Yeah, the problem with that is that um

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
In order to leave a comment on the podcast

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,320
They need to find the podcast and we just can't find the podcast to leave the comments

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,120
I I can't find the podcast

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,520
But if anyone finds it, please leave a comment that says where's the podcast

Let me know what they say because I'm I'm really looking

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,600
We need them to establish some sort of shirt on their end that says here's the podcast

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,800
And then we can wage epic large-scale warfare between the legions of where's the podcast

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Everyone's got to choose a side in the battle of good versus evil. Are you team?

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,200
Where's the podcast or team? Here's the podcast

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,960
It's truly the red and blue shown in a single a single a single w separates heaven from hell. Let's rock

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Uh

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
I speaking of

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Speaking of winning welcome to episode 150 of the procrastinators podcast people because there's a hundred and fifty

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:58,520
Fuckin go back and in in in every podcast you will you'll find if you look hard enough a secret, uh, meme

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,600
A secret code that links to the specific pokemon that the episode is the number of

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,440
I've I've been leaving them all in every episode from the very beginning. I thought this far ahead

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,640
I knew there would be 150 episodes. I knew it wouldn't have been a waste of time

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,200
We'll get I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint of one episode episode one best game ever

60
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,960
What's the most gamer pokemon? You know, you know the answer to that

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,000
It's definitely I was thinking rotom rotom looks like a hardcore game, but he's not number one. Fuck rotom

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,480
It might be it might be bulbous or though. Um, it's up to you to figure out one of those two. It's definitely one of those two

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,360
Um, depends what decks depends what regional decks you're using some regions. It's rotom. Yeah, that's fair

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:52,280
In in gamer in uh in gang weed, uh region, you know the gamer verse, uh, I think rotom is pokemon 001

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Isn't game reverse a real thing

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,680
Um, I hope so make something called the game reverse

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,800
Oh god, he would from game grumps ross. He would make something wait. It might be the game. That sounds like a nostalgia critic

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,360
It might it might be the game over the game, but whatever it is. I think it's a bell, but I don't know what it is

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,240
Uh, it doesn't sound impressive. Let's talk about how much I hate ross

70
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,200
No, okay before we talk about how much we hate ross, let's talk about the thing that we totally

71
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,640
Intentionally, you guys did not talk about on the last pcb episode because this is the pokemon episode 150

72
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Let's talk about pokemon sword and shield and how it was just announced

73
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,800
And how it looks like a real video game. It was completely unmentioned last episode

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Well, you did do a whole other like a stream, but it was on nate's channel. I think well, yeah, that's true

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,680
That's strong

76
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,560
And while you all should go to definitely twitch.tv slash definitely best guy ever and subscribe, um, nonetheless

77
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Some people did not and so they need to up

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,520
We I mean, yeah, it's fair to say just go watch the video. It's on my live stream channel and stuff, but yeah

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
I mean, I

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,240
Think I said everything I had to say about it on this on that stream

81
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,720
Well, I wasn't on the stream and I tweeted about it like all day after the announcement

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,680
Like all that day I was making tweets about sword and shield

83
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I made a few tweets as well

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Yeah, it was all it was all shit pokemon comes out social media is blast and you can see sobel

85
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
You can see groovy. You can see bunny

86
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
And you can see them everywhere

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,520
Uh, cool. Let's let's get into it. Let's get into it new starters all stupid all the all the same round head

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,600
All the same shape. Yeah

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,760
Underwhelming underwhelming. I don't know. I don't care overly homogenous designs. I don't care about the round heads

90
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,320
I don't care that much, but I do think it's a pretty weak badge

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,760
Look, everyone knows they're fine. Levolution is the one that really matters. Yes. That's true. That's true

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,000
No, and in the case of torchic that is not true

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,520
Uh, well, yes, some people really like blaziken. I'm not one of those people. Yeah the digimon fans of the pokemon

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,680
I don't hate him. You like blaziken. I don't hate blaziken. He's fine

95
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,920
I mean, he was the first of his kind right the first of the digimon in pokemon

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,240
Was he before was he before druddigon?

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,240
Yes, probably I forget who that is, but yes

98
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,840
Uh, he looks like a digimon. He's that blue. He's a blue dragon with a red head

99
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,560
Oh, yeah, it was before that. I uh, I remember you guys talking about like, oh, is it england or is it not?

100
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,680
And I guess at this point it's been confirmed. You were you were like it's england. Um and stuff

101
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,200
No, it's great britain not just england. Well, yeah

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh, fair. Oh, very good. I didn't see an island anywhere. The lecture gave about that some more. Why don't you mage?

103
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
You fucking foreigner. Cool

104
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
That's called that's literally cultural appropriation

105
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,520
Knowing things about the United Kingdom. You came over here, you're an imogrant

106
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,520
You get out so you get to the brush the broom and sweep you out the door. Wait. No, you get out

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Uh

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,520
Hippo hippo care is from africa hippo is from africa. So he's an imogrant

109
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,680
Oh new character in the hippo court universe the imogrant. Uh, yeah, he should I don't know

110
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,240
Well, it's it's a side story

111
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,640
It's like it's like after after hippo wasn't allowed to make videos anymore. He like he had to like walk the earth

112
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,400
He's a stranger in every land. It's like it's alt universe. That that is canon hippo hippo is walking the earth right now

113
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Yeah, in search of the purpose

114
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, frankly. I'm not optimistic about his chances. He's a very small boy. So, you know, it's a very very small animal

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,800
Speaking of small boys small animals pokemon, right?

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,120
Uh bunny. Yeah, I like him. Uh the little lizard guy. He's he's funny. I saw I like that

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,680
He's crying all the time. That's funny. Yeah, he's just so like

118
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
That's his cry. That's his cry because he's crying

119
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,840
Uh groovy is just a guy with a thing. He has a he's a farfetched

120
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,560
You know, I've heard a lot of people saying that groovy is gonna evolve into like a

121
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,080
Metal drummer or like some kind of like like drummer. Oh, which sounds pretty cool

122
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,720
And I would be into that if true. Oh, yeah, that that was the thing I was thinking like pokemon based off of things in

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,960
The great britland the u.k.

124
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Mum Keith mum Keith threatened me. He told me I better not pick the monkey and I told him he can have that gremlin

125
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,080
But if he turns into a cool rock drummer, I might regret my words. I might eat. I might eat my words

126
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,480
Yeah, if he turns into a drummer, I'm definitely gonna name him bonzo because that's the perfect name

127
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,080
Why is that the perfect name to everyone who knows the reference?

128
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I don't know the I'm not I'm not in on the reference

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,440
Because you don't know you don't know enough about english rock legends. That's why I know neil pert

130
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
He's english. I think

131
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Wait, is russian american

132
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,360
No, russia's american

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,520
russian russian limbaugh

134
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,640
Yeah, he's american the famous drum, uh, but like, uh

135
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,640
Bunny right that I saw there was a soccer field a football field

136
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,320
So i'm thinking maybe that's a football playing bunnies running real fast. He's got like the color of things

137
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
You know the whiteness

138
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,320
White people play football only white people are allowed. There's a lot of racism in the football community

139
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
So like that fits that works. Hell. Yeah

140
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Yeah, and the little

141
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,520
Crying guy, that's me. So like it all is like very accurate to england

142
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,520
And I and I really want to see if there's like a t-based pokemon or like a

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,680
Oh, yeah, you know like a black pudding pokemon. I want a garden. No, I want a garden. No pokemon

144
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Yeah, I think you're already doing pretty well with like the knights and shields and swords

145
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,840
Garden pokemon sounds pretty funny actually

146
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
It's like ground fairy type

147
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,240
And like it doesn't actually look like a gnome, but it's got like the hat

148
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,760
Shape that's like definitely what I would love. What I would love is like um a pokemon

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,280
That's like a suit of armor and if it comes into contact with an age slash or whatever the sword guy is

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Um, then he then they evolve into like, you know how like um

151
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,240
Sheldre clamps onto a slow poke and they turn into the other guy

152
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,800
It'll be like that sort of thing

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,920
Wait, he just gets a weapon and he wields it. He wields his friend and then he's super powered

154
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,560
That would be really cool. Who's kind of the best pokemon, uh, who reminds me of that? You know, you know gollerc

155
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,200
Gollerc rock flying or no, he's rock ghost. I think he's he's ground ghost

156
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,160
Ground ghost and he can just fly because he's a hero. He can kind of the best goller can fly

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,800
Uh, is he the evolved form or is he the first form? He's the evolved

158
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,360
Okay, the the whole point of that ghost rock golem looking pokemon is that when he evolves where he learns fly

159
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,720
Because his whole thing is that he's a giant golem who can just fly

160
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,880
That's weird. How sick is that that's the coolest thing sick of all time

161
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,440
Yeah, it's kind of funny like the idea of like a rock that has departed

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
From the mortal realm and it's ground. He's made of clay

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So like he can he can like, you know

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,760
If you smash a rock it becomes a rock ghost and then it hits you because it can still it's still a rock

165
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,800
I gotta I gotta put this in the show notes. Um, you gotta behold the image of gollerc in the okay

166
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,160
It's going in the links thing. There it is. Uh, like this is him

167
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,400
He's just like a mech who just flies and it's sick as shit. Uh, is this in gross disgusting audio? Whoa

168
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,040
Oh, he that's that's

169
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,600
Oh, that's cool. I don't know. I've seen that guy before I think that was like an edit

170
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,480
I think the bottom one's like the the the real one if that's it. Okay

171
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,680
Is that a shiny color because if so, it's really cool, but I doubt it. I think so because shiny

172
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm gonna look up shiny. I don't know. I haven't I haven't checked the top one looks like a bend 10 guy

173
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,360
He does. Yeah, he does. He does. You know, I kind of want to go back. It's kind of rfck

174
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,640
I love tyranitar, but I kind of want to put gollerc is my favorite rock type pokemon

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I'm telling you he's ground

176
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,240
Damn it. How many times do I have to say it?

177
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,680
Yeah, okay. Good point. Doesn't he just look like a rock guy though? I guess he's mud though, which is

178
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,080
Yeah, all right. I think he's supposed to be made of clay. I mean, he's a golem and golems are made out of clay

179
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,880
I that's true. That's true. Oh, no, that is. Uh, yeah, that's that's his shiny color

180
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,640
He's got like a green kind of crack in him and he's kind of grayish and bluish dark. Yeah, awesome

181
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,880
There you go. I like the the the aesthetic of him being like, uh

182
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Cracked open but then with a little metal plaster

183
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,200
Yeah, just go yeah, you're super cool

184
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,080
Every single that's just part of the process of making a golerc is like you you fuse him in the in the kiln

185
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,720
And they all crack across the middle and then you put the band-aid on him and then bam you got yourself a golerc

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,880
By the way, I might be wrong about him learning fly by evolving because I'm not seeing it in his

187
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,920
Thing, but whatever. I'm just assuming that's true. He learns flea because he's a fucking coward

188
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Anyway, he's a badass. Uh, he's killer it but it can it can learn fly

189
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,920
Yeah, it can learn fly. So that's confirmed. That's confirmed. Oh, I just remembered. Um, is the bunny called score bunny?

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Like scoring a goal like goal

191
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,000
So I think he's gonna he's gonna evolve to have a football or something

192
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,280
He's gonna have some dumb

193
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,720
Don't you hate those kind of powers like yamcha where he like makes an energy ball and then he like volleyball

194
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,280
Is it it's like just shoot him with the laser gun

195
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,720
No, just my my boy my boy's my boy's spork spork town hero drew something on twitter that just

196
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,640
Is the weirdest thing girl I didn't

197
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
uh, nothing

198
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
I didn't um, I didn't uh

199
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,160
Understand, but it was it was score bunny evolving to

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Into like a wheelchair

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah, yeah, because um, because um, what they probably like broke his leg or something and and like couldn't pursue its career

202
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,640
Like in these like evolves into like a amputee

203
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,440
I thought the joke was that like the first guy has a piece of tape on his nose

204
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,000
And then as he evolves he like has more more wounds and more injuries until he's like in a wheelchair at the end

205
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,600
And he's mad about it

206
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,160
You know what he should be in true soccer player fashion

207
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,720
He should be he should evolve into finally like flop bunny

208
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,920
Or like his main move is that he pretends to be injured to elicit

209
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,600
And and yellow cards on the other opponents that he's fighting

210
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,880
Uh, or he injures himself perhaps to do this

211
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,640
You know, I've just realized what if they have like pokemon football like a sports team where you choose who plays in what?

212
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,200
like uh thing

213
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
And the stats

214
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Determine how cool. Yeah

215
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,320
Like uh, oh, yeah, I'll put like goal lurk in in goal and he's so big

216
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,200
I'll put like whale lord in goal. Nobody would get pasta. Yeah

217
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,840
That that would be like a really good mini game that they could imagine like mega man soccer, but with pokemon

218
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,680
Imagine like ape escape to soccer, but with pokemon

219
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Yeah

220
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,480
Ape escape to soccer is the best thing

221
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
Wait, is that a real thing?

222
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,320
Yeah, and there's a mini game. It's not ape escape soccer. It's ape escape to soccer

223
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Yeah, because in ape escape to

224
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,640
Oh, it's a mini game

225
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,040
Yeah, one of the mini games you can unlock out of three

226
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,240
So the you know, there's only there's not so that many of them

227
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,040
But there's like every ape you can collect in the game

228
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,120
You can they have certain stats the the more powerful monkeys

229
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Have like higher stats and higher later in the game

230
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,880
You can find like really powerful monkeys and special monkeys like the santa claws monkey monkey claws

231
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,720
Uh, they have like really good stats and you you just play football against ai and or a friend

232
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,240
and it's just like the the silliest and best football game ever made because

233
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,440
You the the main thing is that you run around with the left stick and with the right stick you choose which direction to kick

234
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,040
Oh, that's good

235
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,120
So instead of it being like a whole like oh press the x button to shoot if you're in the right position

236
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,720
You you pass with the with the the you know the shape buttons triangle circle

237
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
To to the to you know

238
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,240
A bunch of monkeys who have that over their heads, you know instantly who that is that's that's normal

239
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,880
But then to shoot you just push the direction and if you kick it really hard with a monkey that has really high attack stat

240
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,960
You can just kick the ball

241
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,000
Smash it into the monkey's face that's in front of you and knock him out

242
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,680
And you can just keep doing that and and if the ball goes out of bounds

243
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,480
You know there's a chance that the ball thrown back in could be like a spike ball

244
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,720
Instead of the regular ball and if you kick that that like knocks them out and then that you know half time comes around

245
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,280
They have no energy left. They can't play anymore. You have to swap them out for someone else. It's epic

246
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,480
That reminds me of kind of blitz ball from final messy 10 only

247
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,520
Better everybody loves everybody loves blitz ball

248
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,960
What's the fuck I'm here too. It's me. Hey, what's up?

249
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,360
Is it is it daylight savings time? Is that why I'm late? Is it not my fault? Good. I'm glad I did at everybody

250
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,040
But you know, you know fair it is in fact daylight savings time

251
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,920
Hi jess you recording. Hi. Yes. I am. Okay. We are talking about pokemon mostly and and let's get down to brass tax people

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,120
Because here's the deal. Oh, by the way, jesse. This is episode 150. So, you know pokemon. We did it

256
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,480
The same board's over and over again. Just ommonite slow. I did it. I did it. I made a meme

257
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,800
I pushed it so hard gross that everyone loved it

258
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,920
No, just just just that part of the ninja rap but repeated over and over again

259
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,960
You put like the symbols for like each of them you put like an ommonite shell

260
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,240
Like a pigeon feather or something and you just repeat the what what is the say the say the line one time ben?

261
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,480
Well, now I don't want to say it anymore. You made me feel

262
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,720
I forget what it is got ommonite slow poke mule tool ten mule two tentacle aero dactyl

263
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,080
Okay, there you go. So that five that's the meme put those in a row and make it incredible

264
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,040
Make it short that just does a mule tool and it's like a mule tube

265
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,840
But like he's got like wrenches in his hands and shit. No, but he wait wait hold. He's mute. That's my cool

266
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,560
But he's like a god kid and he's wearing like a tool shirt because he really likes the band

267
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,640
Yeah, yeah, like uh, he's like tim ellen

268
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,640
Much better new tim allen new tim allen new tim allen that's that's all good, but here's hey

269
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,240
Here's a thing. Uh, so new pokemon sword and shield. That's all cool

270
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:55,080
New boy and new girl most importantly. So there's a new pokemon girl. I like her a lot. I can't she looks exactly like the last one

271
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Who gives a no, she's different

272
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,720
No, they do they they look exactly the eyes and the mouth and the face and the hair shape is exactly

273
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,720
Definitely have the same dead eyes

274
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,360
They I don't know what the pokemon company is like the most successful game franchise in history

275
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,920
And all their games look like shit. What's there?

276
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,960
That doesn't look like shit. It's just like they don't need to make it any more than that

277
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,480
Because the kids just they just care about they don't care about I was I was indulging a parent

278
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,560
Character that they are I was indulging want to look at the pokemon in one of my many vices

279
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,360
um watching arlo videos

280
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,680
uh, and I uh

281
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,040
Yeah, I was listening to his thoughts about uh the new pokemon and he's like, yeah, you know, it looks fine

282
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,680
But it doesn't look you know, it doesn't look like a game that makes like

283
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,320
Billions of fucking dollars like no, it doesn't it doesn't it is a disturbing vice. Yeah

284
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,160
You like you can not even go into like a closet in the dark to watch arlo videos

285
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Oh, oh and let people know about that shit. I put on I pull out my puppet and he's the one who watches arlo videos

286
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Not me. I'm not watching

287
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,200
All right guys, uh on the topic of arlo

288
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,480
I've I've had a problem with arlo in the past because I always thought like, you know, the muppet thing

289
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
He doesn't really go very far with it

290
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,960
Indeed indeed. How could he go any further with it?

291
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,400
Well, you know by by no what I mean is like he's not he doesn't use it for comedy necessarily

292
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,640
Or like he's just not very funny with it

293
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,520
But recently I found I found a muppet who is a stand-up comedian and he is he's unbelievably funny

294
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,280
No, uh

295
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:40,040
Both because both because you know the jokes are pretty good and he seems to have a you know a real grasp of reality

296
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
And he's not like a dumb idiot

297
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,200
But also his his his muppet movements are so correct

298
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Like like like

299
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,960
I'm trying to find what it it's called randy his randy the he looks like a grape

300
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,760
Um, I'm looking him up. I'm I'm googling him. I saw he has he has a he has a special

301
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,720
And that I found on youtube called randy writes a novel

302
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,200
And it's a it's a that sounds really good just from the title

303
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,120
Yeah

304
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:16,760
Oh, he's really creepy looking. Oh, no, but he's great and he swears as well because it is like he's he's like uh

305
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,120
Randy writes a novel he does look like he's spooky

306
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,560
He yeah, but he's like an he's an australian, uh, you know vegan crazy man who is a really good muppet

307
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,480
puppeteer

308
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
And he's now sounds like it's really funny

309
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,600
unironically now this is epic

310
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,920
Yeah

311
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,760
Everybody should go look at that

312
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
I'm looking i'm gonna watch more of this later

313
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,400
um, okay, hey to make us a fun happy time

314
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
uncomfortably

315
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,720
Uncomfortable for everyone. Please I want the reason I brought up shield chan

316
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,680
Is because so new pokemon came out new pokemon girl

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,320
Everyone starts making porn of her right? That's just what happens every single time. Oh my god

318
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,800
Amazing. I I I'm sorry. I'm so I'm I'm really hung up that everyone's like oh the new girl's cute

319
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
She looks exactly like the old girl

320
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,200
She's got a new hat. What do you want? Yeah, new new fucking hat

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,720
Her hair only curls in on one side of her face. You can fucking change your hair curled on both sides

322
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,160
You know, you can go to the fucking barber. She's the same girl. I hate it

323
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,720
Every every human-shaped thing is going to be the same if you can customize the appearance

324
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,160
You can just make that's not like whatever. She's the exact same face the exact same body customizable hair

325
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I feel like a lot of a lot of the time

326
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,320
Is exactly the same thing where all the girls are exactly the same person except the hair is different and everyone thinks

327
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,320
Look, I watch anime. That's always been the case. That's always been the case

328
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,080
That's just not surprising real life. Also. Most people are just interchangeable sacks of shit with different hair

329
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,960
Look, I get your point Ben and I actually agree. It's just that I don't know. I'm I'm over it. I guess I've just accepted that this is

330
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I don't if you can customize the appearance then

331
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,120
I don't know. You just make them look however you want exactly. She's not a new girl. She's nobody

332
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,280
Okay, but she has a default design. Look, she's Scottish. This is her biggest personality trait that she people whatever

333
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,280
They never have personality. We infer we we put a personality onto her. She's a rough and tumble Scottish lass

334
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,800
That's what's been projected by the audience. That's a distinct personality

335
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,360
It's exactly the same whatever the girl from black and white looked like like she had a design

336
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,520
Like yeah, this the new girl doesn't have a design all she has is a sweater and a hat

337
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,800
That's literally all you can do the thing the thing that is just the case

338
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,040
Is that the thing is announced and everybody gets hyped when it's announced and they you know, they see her and they're like

339
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh, I can't wait to play pokemon. Oh, and she's a girl. That means I want to have sex with her

340
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,200
So I'm gonna do a porn of her. I'm gonna give her a character and she's like that hat. That's a Scottish hat

341
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,360
She's a Scottish lass and there's that means she's angry and she punches people great

342
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,480
I love this person. The boy is all in their heads and it's it's it's all in our collective heads in the video game

343
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,760
Nothing not even slightly gonna be like that

344
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,240
But we like it we get we get hyped by ourselves

345
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,840
Well, it's the same as toho like toho the characters barely of any personality

346
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,760
They have a little bit and it's the fandom that runs with it at least they say that's just how it is

347
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,960
At least the characters in toho. Yeah, do have dialogue. They do have

348
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,760
Well, like I don't know like the the main character persona. I've been led to believe

349
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,080
It's a it's a player avatar. It has no defined personality. It's how you play it that gives it a personality

350
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,560
So, you know, that's not true in toho. That's not true in toho. That's yeah, you're right. That's not true in toho

351
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,280
I mean, I can't remember when they stopped doing this

352
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:56,040
But isn't it like the character you choose the opposite gender character that you could have been is your rival and they do have a character because they have lines

353
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,160
I think so. Yeah. Yeah, but like uh in the last one was in sun and moon

354
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,520
Yeah, like that they're changing it now. So that's true. That's true. There is no character whatsoever

355
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,920
Wait, it's it's been through some sapphire and ruby and sapphire and ruby that definitely was how it works

356
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,160
Oh, yeah, that's that's the one I remember because that's my favorite. Sometimes it's like that not always

357
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,640
Yeah, that's true. Well, hey, okay. Here's my point. Here's the thing. I want to talk about it's just that

358
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,360
New pokemon comes out. There's a girl whatever

359
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,080
Well, I think in a game with I think in a game with customizable characters. They won't do that

360
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I think they just never gonna get to say I just want to say they it won't be like it's so provocative

361
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
It's so big brain

362
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,280
They won't I'm just saying they won't do that because the characters have no set design

363
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,560
And there's no point making them a rival because they are no one

364
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,720
I guess that makes sense. I get well, I don't know. There was no character

365
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,200
In emerald or sapphire ruby. There there was kind of like there may is a character

366
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,200
Yeah, may and that's only because the show the show gave me her character. She's she's nobody. Well, I've never seen the show

367
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,440
And I know what maze like she has big boobs. That's her character. That's not even accurate. Okay, whatever

368
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Um, uh speaking of big boobs. This is my point. All right. Here it is. This is my point people are complaining

369
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,640
About people making porn about the pokemon girl. This is the point. I want to get you. She literally is her hat

370
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,520
Uh, she's she's she's indiana jones. That's my point though, ben. That's my point. Look, I get it

371
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,600
People come out of the woodwork and they're like, oh my god guys. What are you doing sexualizing like a canonically 12 year old girl?

372
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,840
But this is not a real person and this person is so undefined a personality or an existence

373
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,280
And the porn of her doesn't even necessarily draw her at that age generally doesn't right? I mean, how would you even know?

374
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,440
How would you even I just it brings to my mind? How can anyone

375
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,120
Care about this issue is what comes to my brain?

376
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I don't understand like if people are looking for things to get mad about and find reasons to be it's a it's a it's a combination

377
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,880
Of virtue signaling and also extreme mental retardation

378
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,160
Where they actually believe that lines on a piece of paper is a person. Yes

379
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,400
If you don't believe that then you can't care about this issue

380
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:23,000
You have to be mentally fucking retard the fact of the matter is like you look at pokemon and like characters that are like 12

381
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,920
18 20 30 they all pretty much look the same

382
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,640
Like you can't really even tell until they start to get into like middle age

383
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,680
It's like they expect are like our our vision when we look at an anime character

384
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
We should be able to see past

385
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,800
Like the the physical appearance of the character and be able to deduce like the stat sheet and see uh-oh age

386
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,400
Uh, you know below 18 if that means sexuality switched off

387
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,840
We cannot you know, but that's not it just makes me so mad that I see people and look

388
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,960
I know it's probably like a fringe group, but surprisingly large

389
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,160
Surprising large number of people I'm gonna I'm gonna play the devil's advocate on this one. Okay. Um, I feel like it's not

390
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,520
Play the devil's advocate and advocate against pedophilia

391
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,520
Yeah

392
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,960
indeed

393
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Like I feel like

394
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,680
With anything of this nature where you you know as a person says like oh my god. Oh my god a porn

395
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,320
Yeah, it's just because they're young with a bokeh no hero academia characters. They're like. Oh my god. They're like canonically 14

396
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,880
Stop guys. It's not even that it's unreal age. It's it's that they're just like they they are

397
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,320
um

398
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,640
Young themselves and they're like they maybe not like they've seen some porn and like oh, I don't know whether I like this yet

399
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:49,160
And pokemon is for young people lots of sure ages are gonna be looking at pokemon related things and then uh-oh

400
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,240
You know they stumble across something that is sexualized and they're like oh god damn it again

401
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,760
I you know for them the only other time this has happened is the last time that they noticed

402
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Uh, which is like, I don't know

403
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,200
Some game that came maybe undertale or something or delta room

404
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,320
Like that was the first time it happened for them and they're like what the fuck the second time it's pokemon

405
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,760
And then they're complaining even more when you talk about the first time they became sexually aware while playing undertale

406
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,800
Is that no no, I mean like I mean like the first time that they've seen rule 34 stuff

407
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,520
Of things like they've just become a teenager

408
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,360
In that would understand that that's fucked up maybe

409
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,080
And that they would have a problem dealing with it

410
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
And it's like I

411
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,240
I can't you know

412
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,400
I can't get too mad about the people getting mad about it because I don't know how old they are and I can assume that you know

413
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
They're just kicking up a stink because they're a kid

414
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,880
The way I don't know it seems to me like there's some older people, but here's a question

415
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,920
Let's just say there's like you've got whatever misty, right?

416
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,440
She's she is canonically like 10 or 12 or whatever 12

417
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,200
I draw a sexualized picture of misty and say next to it misty age 25

418
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,360
And now she's got the big the zongas and the big booty like okay, then we're like, oh, this is fine

419
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,320
I guess what if I just erase age 25 next door and it's like, oh my god

420
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,840
You've sexualized this 10 year old as like a big sexy baby

421
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,640
Stick if you if you draw a stick figure and just say oh, that's a five year old then that's

422
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:29,640
Like I'm I'm over this topic. I don't I don't believe I don't believe that anyone actually cares as much as you're saying they care

423
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,160
I also agree with that. I don't believe anyone really cares about anything

424
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,520
I think that everyone in the world is just constantly virtue signaling about everything

425
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,560
I don't believe that anyone actually has any stake in any of these bullshit fucking issues

426
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I hope so like they'd say like oh

427
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,320
This is fucked up right and then like in brackets the inner thoughts

428
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,840
I kind of like it though, but I don't want anybody to know. I don't want my friends to know

429
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,120
And then in smaller brackets inside those brackets

430
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,960
They think but if I see someone else doing this then maybe I can get somebody else publicly shamed and yeah

431
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,680
That's when someone's life. He I'm getting a lot of this from threads on 4chan

432
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,520
Where people like it is the place where you just attempt to like fuck other people up and insult them and make them feel bad about stuff

433
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,120
So maybe not the best sources though. I know there are some real people who feel this way. I know it is a fact, but

434
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:27,480
Uh, maybe they are a small minority who deserve to be shoveled into a fucking hole in the ground and shot with a rifle

435
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,840
Yeah

436
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,520
Okay, well that was the thing I wanted to say about shield chan and you know what?

437
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,160
I'm gonna fucking jack off to shield chan after this podcast

438
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,400
I don't give a fuck if people can suck my dick when you've jack off to shield hero

439
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,520
Yeah, maybe I will when you say shield chan. I think you're talking about someone from shield hero

440
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,760
Reftalia because I don't know anything about shield hero. I'll go jack off to her too

441
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,200
And you know what as the loli as a fucking loli slave because I don't give a shit. That's how I feel people

442
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,360
This is a protest fap. That's what I'm going to do and you can't stop me

443
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
All right

444
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,680
Hell yeah

445
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Hell yeah, um

446
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,680
I've got a

447
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
I've got a gross story

448
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,240
If if if you're all if you're all okay with a bit of gross stories. I'm ready

449
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,240
We've been talking a lot about poop lately. So I feel prepared. Yeah. Well, this involves poop. I'm hopeful. Oh, no

450
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,760
So, all right, so I've been the last few days

451
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,200
Uh, got a cold. Whoops. It's the it's the cold that goes around and everyone's getting it

452
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,760
The family got it. I got it. I was like, okay. Well, I've had a thousand calls at this point

453
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,080
I know how to deal with the cold you drink a lot of water

454
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,880
You don't be stupid and that then it goes away and that's fine

455
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,360
um

456
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,880
This cold caused a different problem which has made me

457
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,240
Bedridden almost almost bedridden and it's really fucked me up

458
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
And here's what happens

459
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,960
So when you have a cold you get dehydrated really quickly you need to drink water because your body is like drying up

460
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,880
I don't know exactly why

461
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,560
But you feel dry all the time your lips get chapped and you're like, oh

462
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
If need a drink so you have a drink

463
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,040
And then you go to bed

464
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,400
I go to bed and then through the night I become crusty and withered and dusty and

465
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,240
Everything's fucked. Yeah, I wake up and I'm like, oh

466
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,280
No, yeah, yeah, and and in my intestine like a beast whale

467
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,760
Yeah, in my in my in my gut things that have been digesting

468
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,280
Have solidified into like a a brick

469
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,880
And this is you know, this is like, ah shit sucks, you know, similar to

470
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,720
You know Nate's problem a while ago, but I knew I shouldn't eat a lot of carrots. That's what I shouldn't do

471
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,240
Yeah

472
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,400
Um, so I was like, okay. Well, I know how to deal with this as well. I've had this happen a lot

473
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,440
Uh, you just you drink a lot of water and you do the the things you eat the right food

474
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,200
I I had some lens sips, uh, because of the cold

475
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,040
Oh, uh, uh, night will probably be the equivalent

476
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Okay, uh medical drink

477
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,520
I had some of those and I was like, that's good hot water

478
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,120
That's good for clearing stuff out and then I was like, I'll have some tea as well

479
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,280
And you know what I'll have some milk in my tea because

480
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,720
Uh milk makes me burp and that that means that it's good for indigestion for digesting things, right? That's good

481
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,840
Yeah, it's incorrect completely incorrect. I had way too much milky teas and caffeine

482
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,800
Because I was trying to work through the sickness and I ended up doing quite a lot of work on the first day

483
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
but then I went to bed again

484
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,000
And uh, this was the worst night of my life

485
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,960
At least in 2019. Are you sure?

486
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,280
uh

487
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,240
So basically every five minutes I would have to get up to take an hour's long shit

488
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,920
And I was I was sitting there in the toilet with my legs up on on the seat

489
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,640
Straining nothing was happening. Oh my god. Yeah. Uh, it was like, okay

490
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,800
This is you know, it's one thing to be constipated. It's another thing to also have a headache and be dehydrated

491
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,880
from a cold that

492
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,240
Your throat is sore and you're sneezing really loudly so so loudly so consistently

493
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,560
That my rib cage started aching because of how much my lungs were expanding and contracting sneezing so loudly

494
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah

495
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So I was like

496
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,400
And so

497
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,200
You know

498
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,680
It sucks and then the milk started to to react with all the stuff that was going on. I was the milk anything

499
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,200
Yeah, I milk I I was you know going back to bed after like not shitting anything out and like

500
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Moving around trying to jostle at it. You know, you know the stuff sure

501
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,480
But then the milk started bubbling and creating a pockets of gas

502
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,160
And I started burping and I started burping a lot and I started farting a lot and I started burping and farting a lot

503
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,000
And it was really it was really satisfying when I got one of those farts out because like my butthole was like there was a brick in the way

504
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,200
Yeah, I know sure. Yeah, I would have killed for a fart during when I was constipated. Yeah, it was like it's like

505
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
It's

506
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,960
Like one of those so I was like, oh well god damn thanks for that, but there's not enough and I keep burping

507
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,640
Um, it's like 2 a.m. I'm still going to the toilet every five minutes. It's agony

508
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm really need sleep and I can't have it

509
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,680
And then I start burping some more and the burps start to taste acidic and I'm like

510
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,200
Well, here it comes here it comes

511
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Well, well well

512
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,760
Look who dropped in and I I I go turn around and I I up chuck fuck spew

513
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,160
All of my last dinner just happened to be fish and chips, which uh, I like it's very delicious

514
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,600
I know which is probably why it was so bad. Uh, I vomited it all out. It was very very loud and fish oil

515
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
It was it was very loud. I was screaming like

516
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Oh

517
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,040
It came out my nose and everything and it was oh my god for real. Holy shit. Yeah, it was one of those big ones

518
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,520
But like Jesus Christ after I know that after

519
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,600
Vomiting you feel a little better, right? Because it's the problem's gone that stuff is out

520
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,800
Not the case because I still had the cold and I was still I was still bunged up down downstairs

521
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,160
And now what a phrase now what I had

522
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,280
Right is I had acid

523
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Going up my throat that was already sore from sneezing and coughing

524
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,560
So now I had double acid burn ouch on my throat

525
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,080
And in my nose because I had so much mucus it caught a lot of the vomit

526
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,440
And for like the last the the next like 30 minutes

527
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,080
I was blowing my nose and bits of fish and chip were like coming out in clumps

528
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
It was terrible

529
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,480
Well, and um and then uh, I still couldn't shit. I I woke up the dog

530
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,600
I think by by vomiting so how I'm really like I'm happy that the dog was cared about me

531
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,680
And he heard me vomiting and he started barking like oh no. Oh no. What's going on?

532
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,840
And that woke up my mom and she came and gave me some water and it was like, okay

533
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,400
Uh, shit

534
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,920
Terrible

535
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,560
And so I it was like 5 a.m. By the time I actually managed to fall asleep

536
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,920
After that it was you know not no more burping

537
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,120
So it was just sort of like pain constantly and I managed to not fall asleep really and then

538
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,520
Today I have been basically doing nothing and staring at my screen and thinking

539
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,640
Maybe maybe I could at least you know play a video game

540
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,640
If I can't work on anything maybe I could play a video game. I can't even play a video game

541
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,520
My head's hurt so much. I can't even watch a youtube video. I was watching a red letter media thing

542
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,560
I was like

543
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,760
Shut up

544
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,120
Shut up

545
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,600
Shut up. I turned it off and then I was sitting around and I was just like god damn it

546
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,440
Fuck

547
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,640
And that's my story

548
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,280
Oh, and then I started being on the podcast

549
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,800
Hooray

550
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm glad you're still alive though

551
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,960
I want to quickly say though like now to prevent all of that that for people who are ill

552
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,320
Don't eat dairy products like the only dairy product you could you could you could eat

553
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:25,800
It's probably like a yogurt, but not like those flavored whatever fake yogurts. It's like a plain Greek yogurt or something

554
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Yeah, yeah, naturally yogurt. Those are good for you

555
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:34,120
It's not like not only was I having like milky tea, but like I do some weed

556
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
I mean that might have worked

557
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:45,720
But like I I accidentally why didn't accidentally I stupidly had a slice of new this new lovely cheesecake that was in the fridge

558
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
It's like ah lovely big slice

559
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,440
It was delicious and I didn't even realize and then I was looking up later like what not to do when you're ill and

560
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,120
Constipated and sneezing and it was like don't don't milk. No, and I was like, oh

561
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,120
Do not let the milk you don't

562
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,160
Cows of the world rest your milk at the old milk mill

563
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,720
It's it's because it's difficult to digest dairy products and like when you're ill and have a fever your

564
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Um stomach just sort of shuts down

565
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,360
Yeah, you know the pH changes in your stomach and you can't digest

566
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,880
This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk about which is ice cream snacks

567
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
All right

568
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,360
Listen, okay, so everyone knows that I'm post food and I hate food

569
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,960
Um, but I make an exception. I'm interested for his tasty ice cream snacks. They're so good. No, no, listen

570
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,920
I make an exception. Uh, I'm I'm intellectually curious about like

571
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
No, shut up. I'm serious

572
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,080
Stop laughing

573
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,800
I'm I'm intellectually curious about like

574
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,080
Weird snack foods that other countries have that I've never heard of and I heard about one

575
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:06,360
From australia. It is okay. Well, first of all, I found out that in australia. They call popsicles icy poles

576
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Which I thought was really funny wrong

577
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,120
Well, that's wrong. Just gotta update that this is not a popsicle

578
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,640
It's it's one of those ice cream on a stick type deals. Uh, and it is called the golden gay time

579
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,400
Oh, I've heard of it. Yeah, and their slogan is

580
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,280
It's hard to have a gay time on your own

581
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,240
True, so contrary. It looks really good

582
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,320
It's like it looks like butterscotch. I mean, I'm guessing it's like butterscotch and vanilla or caramel and vanilla ice cream

583
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,920
It looks like it's ice cream products from other countries and have it survive the trip

584
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,320
Maybe and and it looks like and it looks like it's coated in like crushed heath or butterscotch or something

585
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,720
I don't know, but they got other flavors, right? Let me read you a couple of these other flavors. They got

586
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,080
Um

587
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:00,440
They got unicorn flavor. Nice. That's gay. They got real gay. They got if you like pina colada flavor

588
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,360
And they got choc mint mc mint face

589
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,960
And uh, last one again, australia

590
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:16,280
Is it I okay now like did body mc vote phase get named after it or did it got named after

591
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,320
Body mc vote phase or is it just a coincidence?

592
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,400
I don't know what that is. I think people have always just been putting something mix something face on things

593
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,880
It's like a weird stupid human thing

594
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,960
This compulsion does something mix something face everything they see

595
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:38,600
It's just really weird that you would be like we got to make a new flavor of our of our highly coveted ice cream bar

596
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,800
And we're gonna call it and we're gonna make a chocolate mint flavor. We're gonna call it choc mint mc mint face

597
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,880
Is this like some millennial shit infiltrating the company mc donald's face stupid names? I don't know. I don't know

598
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,640
The new mc donald's burger burger mc burger face. It's just like it's got like five patties this time

599
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:02,200
And then and then they start a twitter account that is burger mc burger face and the burger is tweeting at other burgers

600
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,680
I refuse to let my generation take the fall for stupid names as if we invented them. Okay

601
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,240
I mean, you know older generations caught a bunch of shrimp and called them sea monkeys

602
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,720
That's that's wrong. That's not correct at all. That's incorrect. Yeah, that's fair. They're not they're not monkeys

603
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
They're not even part of the great eight family

604
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,600
Check the genus and file on you dunces. Jesus christ

605
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,520
Yeah, they did it. They did it for the marketing thing so for the lulls

606
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,800
I think I heard I think I saw a video about the sea monkeys guy and I think he was like a nazi or something

607
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,000
I think he was like a real big eugenicist or something really cool

608
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,560
He was a scammer through and through

609
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,560
Yeah

610
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,720
That stuff. I think he was hoping to use those. No, I think he was a kkk. I think he was like a keynote kkk

611
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,560
A key a keto kkk. Is that what kkk is very sensible? No, he was not one of us. Keto kido kido kido kido kido kids club

612
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Yeah, that's what it is

613
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,640
Fuck yeah

614
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,560
You gotta start a brand new shirt the keto kids club

615
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,520
It just says kkk. You know, yeah

616
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:12,360
I have a strong urge a lot of the time to tweet things about being in the cool kid like in a video

617
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,440
I say that I say I say the cool kids club all the time and I want to as a joke write kkk on screen

618
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,960
But then I know like oh Jesus here we go with this guy wanting to kill all minorities and you know

619
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,040
Well, that's yeah, you know classic Nate bestman

620
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,480
You know what I'm annoyed about is that I can't I can't make I mean obviously you can't make racy jokes anymore, but like

621
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,960
It's this

622
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:45,240
You can but like people will not assume that you were joking. They will assume that you're one of those people who actually think it

623
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,800
And you have an argument with them. It was like I'm just I was just being you know

624
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,800
Exaggerated for effect, you know for a comedy thing and then they like reply with oh, I was just pretending to be retarded

625
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:02,760
Well, shut up. Oh, right. They're saying that you are in fact like obfuscating your true intentions now after the fact

626
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,640
You've been criticized or you're like you're normalizing like you're you're normalizing this this hateful language or

627
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,840
Yeah, I mean, I don't mean really that's what they do on 4chan or whatever like it's all memes, but it's not actually

628
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,160
Yeah, I guess like I don't even mind the normalizing thing. It's just like I would like to not have people

629
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Assume things of me based on

630
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,240
Jokes I make so I guess I'll just stop making those jokes

631
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:36,680
I mean you go you go you go to you go to poll you go on poll and it's all you know everyone's like ha ha

632
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,560
So funny to joke about how the jews control everything, but you know, but they kind of actually do though like yeah, but you know

633
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,760
They kind of we kind of actually believe this fine. That's fine. Well, I mean I mean they do but it is a joke

634
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,240
sure

635
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
But like like to me it's

636
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,960
It's funny that the world is so fucked that like secret societies control everything and that we're all complete slaves

637
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,520
And we're all fucking doomed and society is going to collapse and the and the super wealthy

638
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,240
Will stamp their feet on our necks for all time. I mean like you just got to laugh at it

639
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,840
Did you guys see by any chance reminds me about the world going to hell?

640
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,040
Anyone see the the jewellery I mean I'm talking about people being racist like scary racist like

641
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,880
This the real yeah, I know what you mean like I know what you mean though like

642
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,360
Sure, like I don't know means like ha ha aren't aren't black people stupid

643
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,680
But then like also like but it is cool that the cops shoot him a lot

644
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,200
I mean, yeah, I feel I feel like the cultural battle

645
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,680
Look, I'm sure people would disagree and I don't have a ton of life experience in these areas

646
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,800
But like I feel that the whole racism issue

647
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,760
Is is at a point where it's less of a problem for the world than like

648
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,080
I don't know the suppression of global communities and like the control of the population by technocrats

649
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,800
That's what I've done with racism as an issue completely like I'm over it. It's solved as far as I'm concerned

650
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,920
I'm done pretending that racism is a problem. I'm done pretending that it's bad like it's it's funny

651
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,720
Fuck off racism. It's funny. Everybody suck my fucking dick. It's funny

652
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,680
I mean

653
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,920
I get it. I'm not a minority

654
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,560
People get shot out there in the real world

655
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,560
People definitely get shot and it's fucked up and you know what maybe even there's like some racist stuff going on

656
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,480
That makes people more likely to shoot like a black dude who's just walking down the street than a white dude

657
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:36,040
Totally fair. Totally fair. Um, I don't know don't mistake internet for real life. Just please

658
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,480
Because in real life in real life, I'm pretty sure racism is a lot, you know

659
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,080
scarier and and more threatening than someone

660
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,600
I just I just hate I just hate this idea that people have this completely insane

661
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,000
ludicrous notion

662
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,440
Literally a ludicrous notion like the rapper who is a black man

663
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,840
This notion that like if you say something racist, then you're racist. That's not how it works

664
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,200
Like if you oh, yeah, you've made some pretty good points on that in the past

665
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,080
If you believe something racist you're racist if you do something racist you're racist if you say something racist

666
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,400
You're just being cool. Well, it's fucking funny. Okay. I mean, I get you I get you

667
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:25,000
But like say you're you're an outside observer and you hear someone say something racist

668
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,880
Like it's like hippo was saying you're not it's not crazy in this day and age to think that this person making this joke

669
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,160
Actually believes the thing that he's making because people do it all the time

670
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,520
Well, that's how the problem there is just this Trump got elected

671
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,800
Well, yeah, but the problem there is just this epidemic of mass retardation where nobody can decipher context anymore

672
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,920
Or nobody can understand when somebody is clearly obviously not

673
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,840
The context has been deliberately obfuscated

674
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,120
Ben, please clarify what you just meant about that's how Trump got elected because I I don't understand what your point

675
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,680
What I think Trump got okay. I will clarify what I mean by that is that

676
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,840
Fucking everyone thought it was real funny and a real funny meme to be a white nationalist and

677
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,080
That's what happened because it was a real fun. Trump is not a white nationalist

678
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,360
No, but like the people who voted for him. Yeah, I'm confused about

679
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,680
Like I get what you're laying down. We're I we're kind of talking about two different things here, but I get you

680
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,840
Well, I mean, I'm just saying from an outs

681
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,240
Pete people

682
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,560
You know, there's people that make jokes to be funny and there's people that make jokes

683
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,280
So that they can say what they actually believe without having to answer for the consequences of it

684
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,120
I guess so I I mean, I suppose that's totally fair. I'm sure there's people like that. You can't you can't know you can't know

685
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,320
Who's who okay, but but I think the solution there is

686
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,880
I would get what people would disagree with this

687
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,880
But like I think it's very important to give people the benefit of the doubt

688
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,760
Without a substantial case to make your like if you want to insinuate. Okay, let's say, you know

689
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,520
Louis CK has said hard rn words on occasion. Okay. Let's make the case that Louis CK is racist

690
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,320
Um, he said the word. Well, you're saying that you can infer things from what you know about. No, you fool

691
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,920
I'm saying that you can't know. I'm saying that you might suspect. I'm saying that you might have reason to believe

692
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,720
I'm sure you can't. Yeah

693
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,680
You never know you never know that's what I'm saying

694
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,240
I I get your point and I mean, yeah, I get it

695
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,920
Like if all you know about if you know nothing about someone except that, you know, they they called a black guy hard rn word once

696
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,400
Okay, you know starting to make a pretty decent case there. Um, but uh, I don't know like maybe it was in fact a joke

697
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,200
And that was like his best friend like that's you know possible

698
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,760
So you got to you know dig into it more and I just don't like the jumping to conclusions

699
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,800
We see a lot of the time. Why are you fucking take and I'm not this point is no longer rebutting your point

700
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,120
I am now extrapolating my mouth. Okay, fine. Yeah. Yeah. All right

701
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:56,200
Remember how the time Count Dankulous life was absolutely ruined because he made a joke about a pug

702
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,200
See that's what I'm talking about. I actually don't know who Count Dankulous

703
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,840
How is that true?

704
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,880
What do you mean? How is that true? He's a Scottish guy who made a youtube video about his uh,

705
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:14,040
his friends and he is his girlfriend's pug and you know as like a little bit of cheeky revenge

706
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,600
She taught it how to do a nazi salute. Well, no, it's just like racist paw

707
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,440
Like instead of like well, yeah. Yeah, instead of using the word really cute. Yeah, and and like like

708
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,160
He obviously like in the video said

709
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,200
um, I'm not a racist lol

710
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,800
Uh, but this is like the worst thing I can think of to to make this pug say so it's like

711
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,280
Do but people just took it as like you just wanted to make a pug a nazi

712
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
And the thing is like a nazi

713
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:48,760
He only had like four or so subscribers only his friends and it was just for his girlfriend and his friends

714
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:54,520
But it became it started circulating it became way more popular than it ever was meant to be

715
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,760
And yeah, he was convicted of a crime. He was yeah convicted and like and like the the the um

716
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,480
When he went to court they decided in the end just like let's

717
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,680
Not look at the context in which he said the thing and just focus on the fact that he said the thing

718
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,640
And he he got he was guilty and then like this but that's britain. Thank god

719
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,560
You know your hellhole of a home country. So thank god for that. I mean, it's not just britain

720
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,680
I mean not you know

721
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,800
It that the the whole idea is that that kind of retardation could spread and it clears you well, of course, of course

722
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,520
I mean, that's my issue is just that nobody

723
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,240
Is even capable of looking at context anymore people are so fucked in the head

724
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,480
You know, I probably because of social media and the you know words like polarization and whatever the fuck you want

725
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,320
To blame it on but people are just fucking stupid or now. That's the you know, I do agree with that

726
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,320
I think that's definitely like

727
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,760
My annoyance is that with racism is just there seems to be like no

728
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,480
acceptance or no room for the archie bunkers of the world anymore like

729
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
That's true. What do you mean?

730
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,720
And all what's an archie bunker the old 70s sitcom all in the family

731
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,320
It was like a show about this old conservative dad and his family was his

732
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,360
His daughter and his stepson were more progressive and they clashed and his whole thing was that you know, he was low key racist

733
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,640
And he said, you know mean things but he was like a good man. He had a good heart

734
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,720
He was friends with george jefferson who was black, you know, he like grew over the course of the series

735
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,280
He's like, ah george one of the good ones, you know, he was

736
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:31,400
He's a good guy like the whole point is that like you can be sort of low-key backwards and racist and still be a good person

737
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
It's not the end. I'll be all of what makes you

738
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,520
Think a lot of people your words are the human being these days. Yeah, but a lot of people are stupid because like yeah, like

739
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,040
Like like I grew up in like a really small like backwoods fucking hodunk

740
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,920
You know white people town and I grew up

741
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,720
You know poor and I grew up around a lot of like low-key racism, you know

742
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,400
Like people would talk. Ah, you know blacks and mexicans. Ah, you know, you know

743
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:01,400
My grandma would talk about blacks. My you know, my grandma we grew up. I always thought

744
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,600
I I truly believed for most of my life that brazilian nuts were called nigger toes

745
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,840
That's what they that's what they were called when I was a kid. Everyone called them that

746
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,960
So, you know, you you grow up and you go somewhere and you and you go sit down at a bar and you go

747
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,160
Oh, I want some of them nigger toes in my mouth people look at you like you're crazy and you're like

748
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
It's what my grandma called them. I don't know

749
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,760
You know like my grandma used to my grandma used to say that's not even particularly insulting though, obviously

750
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,400
It's you know, there's baggage in like words, of course. It's funny like my grandma used to say stuff like

751
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,600
God made the niggers. He made them in the night. He made them so fast. He forgot to make them white

752
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,680
And like I don't even know what to think about that

753
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,880
Like it's funny laughing at the racism people that's what I'm laughing at just to clarify

754
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:53,960
Like because it's fucking funny. It's just ridiculous to me that you can't even say funny. Shit like that. That doesn't that doesn't hurt anybody

755
00:55:54,040 --> 00:56:00,920
It's fucking funny. Yeah, you know people. It's pretty funny. Oh, it's normalizing views that like God made them wrong

756
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,520
Like no, it's just fucking silly and stupid. It's funny because it's ridiculous

757
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,600
I mean it gets into this thing of like like if you make a joke like that like, okay

758
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,560
percentage-wise, maybe it's like 99 funny joke, but then there's like that one percent. It's like, hey, yeah

759
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,120
Yeah, it do be like it is

760
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,560
You're you're you're normalizing racism like no, I mean, yeah, that's the

761
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,400
But like how can it be normalizing racism when like people are less racist than they were 200 years ago?

762
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,920
Yeah, maybe maybe they're they're a minority. I mean, I think they're a minority

763
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,480
I'm scared of everything

764
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:44,680
Um, but like, you know the the people the people that like really hate minorities or whatever like the way that they

765
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:53,240
The way that like they do want to normalize it and the way that they do is through like seemingly innocuous jokes

766
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,360
Like that and like kind of a conspiracy theory though. Yeah, I mean tell obviously

767
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,600
It's obviously that does happen. Yeah, there's people. I mean, it's mostly like teenagers

768
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,680
I think unfortunate yet who like

769
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,320
Are drawn to the memes and then start believing the memes and like start internalizing that. Yes. I agree. That's fine

770
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,520
That's I get all that it's just that in any specific case

771
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,520
Isn't it true that you need to dig deeper to find out which one it is? Is it just a joke or are they you know

772
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,600
So, I don't I don't know. I guess that's all I have to say on it. Okay. I just I just I just

773
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
You can say the worst things in the world

774
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,720
Okay, whatever you got my point

775
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,680
I grew up with a lot of like, you know low-key racism, but I never saw anyone actually do

776
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,600
Anything racist or hurt anyone or actually like follow through on some racist belief

777
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,400
It was all racism was always just like a funny fucking joke like and that's what it should be

778
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:55,560
That's how you that's how you kill racism. You make it a funny fucking joke. You make it a stupid fucking thing that everybody laughs at

779
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
I mean, I agree with that for the most part

780
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,560
But you have now you could have a guy be like a philanthropist like a

781
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,400
Great man who does great things you could have him like give the charity his whole life

782
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,600
But then like he slips up and one day he gets caught talking about coons, you know, he's he's just says something funny

783
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,080
And there was that there was that guy on the weather

784
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,720
Remember that guy on the weather channel who accidentally said he said like martin luther coon jr

785
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,240
Like he just made a mistake and like they tried to fire him. He had to like, you know, do a bunch of bullshit

786
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:30,520
And it's like well, remember remember pewdiepie. He he said the word while being angry and then he apologized immediately

787
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,320
And then like yeah, everyone just got on his case

788
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,360
Yeah, and all this time on the internet right in like in a whole decade of like uploading almost daily

789
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,520
He messed up once

790
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,120
Yeah, like all it does is is is saying the wrong thing and suddenly all the good you've ever done in your life is washed away

791
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,160
You're just a racist. That's all you are. You're a piece of shit. Go to hell

792
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,400
I don't know like a bad and I get your point, but I feel

793
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,720
No, this whole thing. No, we need to like sense. We need to get fucking

794
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,000
No, shut up. You can't fucking argue with my point because my only point is that x happens

795
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:09,640
And unless you're gonna fucking stand there and tell me no, that doesn't happen. You're not arguing with me

796
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,680
Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true

797
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,640
I just don't think that way I guess

798
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,480
Well, like the the biggest problem is that I don't want to see bad things

799
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:24,120
I want to see good things so I choose to focus on that which maybe is bad and maybe is wrong

800
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,640
um

801
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,240
When you decide collectively as a society that

802
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,600
Saying a racist thing is what makes you a racist or like saying the words the magic fucking words

803
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:40,440
If you say the words you're a racist when when we start deciding that and we start going after people, you know for words

804
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,080
You know people who are actually bad people are smart. They know how to hide

805
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,520
So the people who are not saying the words are going to end up being the ones who are racist because the ones who really have these

806
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,280
Beliefs are going to know how to hide and not say the magic fucking words

807
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,200
And the people who aren't racist are the ones who because they're not racist

808
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,280
They don't think they have to be careful or I don't know and they just fucking slip, you know people fucking

809
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:07,880
So what's going to happen is that the real bad people are going to slip through the cracks and not get called out

810
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,440
While all the regular people are going to get called out for saying funny things and saying the wrong fucking words

811
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,000
I mean, I guess to be fair and eventually there'll be nothing left

812
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,240
But bad people I mean that I suppose like even if we adopted that belief

813
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,800
It's like, okay, then we could just have people running around just like throwing racial slurs willy nilly and like

814
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,760
Okay, then people would just do it out in the open and like that I think we should I think I think everybody should be out

815
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,760
Throwing around racial slurs willy nilly and making a fucking joke about it

816
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:38,520
Everyone should be fucking, you know like like an old when you see like old comedy movies from the 70s like airplane

817
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,640
You know there's like racist humor all over there's you know and everyone's getting along and everyone's fucking laughing

818
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,800
Everyone laughs at those movies, you know

819
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,040
When when when when an airplane when they have the joke about the old lady speaking in ebonics and and it's like it's really exaggerated

820
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:58,200
Super racist ebonics. It's hilarious and everybody understands or like blazing saddles where they say nigger like fucking

821
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,280
11,000 times in that movie and the whole movie is about racism

822
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,760
But like it's funny and because it's funny it brings people together and everyone laughs at it and goes ha ha

823
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,720
Racism sure is ridiculous and stupid. That's what we need

824
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,320
We need more racism out in the open so that we can laugh at it

825
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,320
Instead of having to shove it in the fucking corner and hide it like it's something to be ashamed of and hidden

826
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,000
Or else we get shunned from fucking society if we say the wrong fucking magic word

827
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:27,960
There's my rant for the day word. I'll let I'm not I'm not above laughing at a racist joke. I'm just putting that out there

828
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,160
I know I know one racist joke back from my childhood, but I'm not yeah

829
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:38,600
Let it fly I can I can I can type it out and you guys can read it out, but I don't want to see

830
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,720
Sure go for it. Go for it. That's fine. It's like

831
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,320
I guess it's sort of racist, but at the same time it's like

832
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,000
It's making fun of both sides. I think so. Okay. What's the targeted demographic here of the

833
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,960
I I couldn't say like let me just type it out. I'm sorry for the typing noises. Uh hippo

834
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:01,240
That's fine. Maybe maybe he'll edit it out. He's a good boy. He knows how to do this thing. Yeah, okay

835
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,600
Uh, I guess uh, uh, you know a really good way to to to not be racist

836
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,160
I don't I don't because it because it haunts it's because it's

837
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,960
I know you're looking for this. I know you're walking a tight

838
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,120
You're always you're constantly walking a tightrope

839
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,520
And if you ever slip you ever slip you'll fall into the abyss of racism and you can never get out of it

840
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,240
It's just like being gay with chris chan

841
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,840
Yeah, like if you like it's just it's a constant struggle to avoid being gay

842
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,240
You got it. You got it. You got to you got to really work it

843
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,600
You got to really strain that straightness muscle here's a thought

844
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,480
I do think literally every person in the world is racist

845
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:40,440
Um, because when everyone has like, I don't know you think about a factor

846
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,840
I don't know. How about being italian that brings to mind some things that you mean are italian humans definitely have like

847
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:53,480
Tribalistic instincts. Thank god. I had an italian like me in the media in the form of mario

848
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,560
Thank god. I had mario to relate to someone who looked like me. You know ben

849
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:04,760
I'm offended by mario because not all italians are mustache wearing, you know plumber low blue collar workers

850
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:11,240
My father or my mother was an educated woman and she was italian. God. How dare they

851
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
God rest your soul. Yeah

852
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:20,520
I don't know. It's all we've talked about this a million welcome to the pokemon episode. Yeah, we talk about race relations and racism

853
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,920
mule tool tenacral aerodactyl

854
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,840
mule tool

855
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,200
It's a mule tool put a mule and a tool this episode is going to be called

856
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:34,440
Episode episode 150 pokemon and then in parentheses the n word is used 11 times in this episode

857
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,720
Just like in most pokemon games. We should put a trigger warning on

858
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,200
It's like now that i'm translating it from luffianian to english. This is a very stupid joke

859
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:53,560
Most of them are I think I remember the best kind you told the joke you told like no, it was like it was a gay joke

860
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:01,000
It was oh boy. Oh wait. I'm thinking I think i'm thinking of like you told a lithuanian fairy tale and it like didn't make any sense

861
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,320
Oh with the with the sausage

862
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,760
Yes, yeah

863
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,360
Someone just like became a sausage. No. No. No. Someone was already a sausage. It was a was a sentient sausage. Yes

864
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah, sure

865
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
um

866
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,640
I respect your culture. What can you do? What can you do? A little we just got to oppress the gays?

867
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,320
Um, that's all there is to it really fact true fact a little while ago

868
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:32,360
I heard in my headphones a little beep that signaled that uh ten paces in draw is rendered

869
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,840
It is done. I think I will put it up after this episode

870
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,560
Uh, if anyone would want to like peruse it and see if there anything sucks about it

871
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,720
Okay, I think of the audio mixing or something. I tried really hard to keep the audio mixed as well as I could

872
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Think I did an okay job

873
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,520
It's hype uh the ending the ending of ten paces in draw is fucking hype. It's a yeah, it's a blast

874
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,320
It is a blast and how long is it? It's about an hour long. It's like just under an hour

875
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:06,600
It's like a motion picture. God damn it is it has a it's a you know

876
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:12,200
I mean, I hate it because I've been looking at it for months and months and I'm fucking sick of working on it

877
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,440
uh, but uh

878
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,800
It's got you know, I used um oblivion falls

879
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,840
redo of the of jesse's uh pcp theme song and it's

880
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,720
Really fun and cool

881
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:34,440
Uh, so yeah, watch if watch that I would recommend viewers. It's yeah, this is from this is footage from radcon two

882
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,960
Uh

883
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,720
It was a thing it was like a little side project

884
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,160
We came me and munchie came up with it on the fly and then we all we all just did it

885
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,640
Wait, you mean radcon three, right? Did I say two? I meant three. Yeah. Yeah, it's from radcon three

886
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,280
Yeah, that's dope. So that's finally and it's a pilot. I mean

887
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You're will be looking for feedback to see potentially if more could be made or some fact

888
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:01,640
The idea was that it was a pilot episode that we could do more of I mean, this is a thing that's out like a thing

889
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,880
That's coming out. It's it's it's just I just finished it. So it'll be out soon

890
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,040
um the

891
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,400
Yeah, the idea for it was a pilot. Um, I mean

892
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,920
Obviously because that was done at a radcon and like

893
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,160
I mean

894
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,960
If we did more of them, they would look they would look a little different and they might be formatted a little differently

895
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,960
But yeah, we could definitely like

896
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,320
I mean, I would definitely make some changes to the premise. I would

897
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,880
Fuck I would give more time for each round and we would have more to work with and fucking ballpoint pens. I think

898
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,960
But yeah, yeah, the the concept is definitely something that could be

899
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,400
Expanded upon and made more of

900
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,160
Uh, yeah, well, that's so that's neat in terms of radcon three content

901
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:55,720
Content three. We've got what what's left. Okay. I'm good. I'm gonna read this

902
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:01,000
I'm gonna read this joke out loud without reading it beforehand. So if it's if I say something horrible

903
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,560
It's not my fault. I have no idea what I'm about to say. Okay

904
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,040
Let's see here

905
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,080
A white guy and a black guy. I read a bar the white guy turns to the black guy and says

906
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,040
Do you know why your feet are white? The black guy says nothing just takes a drink of his beer

907
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,240
The white guy continues because you stood on your feet when I painted you he laughed

908
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,880
And then asked again

909
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,880
Know why your palms are white the black guy says nothing the white guy continues

910
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,240
Because you stood on your hands when I painted you he laughed

911
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:39,080
The black guy finishes his drink and stands up speaking. Well, you know why your asshole is dark

912
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:45,400
The white guy looks at him the black guy continues because the paint wasn't dry when I fucked you

913
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,120
He then pays for his drink

914
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,760
Uh, I think I'm getting the gist here. They're painters

915
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,000
And there was like, okay

916
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,080
No, I think the idea is that like they're just skin will like wipe off on other

917
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,040
Did you guys not get it? Are you what's happening? I don't get it. I don't get it

918
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I don't get what the white guy's talking about in the first. I don't know. The white guy is just

919
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,600
It's just two guys in a bar, you know, you know, busting each other's balls

920
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,080
I assume as you do. Yeah, the white guy is you know saying some low-key race to the black guy like hey

921
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,440
Hey, you're black. You know what black people are fucking your feet and hands are white and painted you

922
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,840
And then the black guy turns it around on them and it's like, oh, yeah

923
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,960
Well, your asshole's dark because I fucked in it and the paint wasn't dry. I made it dark. Oh, wait, wait, wait

924
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,760
Oh

925
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,320
Like the souls like talking about like the souls of his oh, yeah, I get it. I get it

926
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,440
I was gonna be like his but his feet aren't white. What do you talk? Okay?

927
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:47,800
All right, you know what? This is my favorite kind of race joke because frankly, none of this is actually like offensive

928
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,560
It simply is pointing out like facts that person

929
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,080
And even in the context of the joke, it's just like a white guy and a black guy who are obviously hanging out together

930
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,160
And they're clearly friends. So

931
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:03,960
There you go. And then there's banter and he gets me hoists his own petard at the end there

932
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,600
Yeah, good

933
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,600
But when did he paint him?

934
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,680
Don't ask me like this hardly analyzing

935
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:20,440
The black guy not know he was being painted by the white guy. This is not this is not an origin of creation story

936
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,440
We didn't literally it's just the guys busting each other's balls and making shit up

937
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:30,760
Hey, hey everypony and welcome back to another episode of thoroughly analyzing mage's racist joke. We got another one here today

938
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,040
This joke's like a strong

939
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,880
Eight

940
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:41,000
No, that's too high. That's too high. I don't know. It's like too dicky. It's like a 1488. I'd say

941
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,040
Got him

942
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,320
um

943
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:51,400
It was told to me by a drunk guy in a family meeting gathering. I think I don't remember who it was my uncle

944
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,320
Maybe my dad. I don't know someone. It's always a drunk uncle. It's always

945
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,600
I mean, that's my whole point. We have to have some sympathy in this country for the drunk uncles who make up

946
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,040
You know a sizable portion of the population and they're getting

947
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:11,160
Marginalized we are marginalizing the drunk uncles by making like I had a friend. I hope this racism considered bad

948
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,280
This is similar to that, but it's just that I once had uh, uh, well

949
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,800
I have a friend and his little brother one time they were at the grocery store

950
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,280
And uh, like it was it was his little brother who was like three and his mom

951
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,000
And they were at the grocery store and you know, they're white or whatever and they just walked by a black guy

952
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,760
And the little kid said mommy. Why is that man blue?

953
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,880
And that because he didn't he just fucked up his color. She just doesn't know what and that was hilarious

954
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:43,160
One of those was it mill smith as from uh from the rabbi's cat when they find the shared ancestors of all blacks and jews

955
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:47,160
And they're like 20 foot and they're like 20 foot tall giant like blue

956
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,040
Jews that like yeah, yeah

957
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:55,080
There's the true uh, they're like so dark that they're blue and they and they all and they have they have uh, they have um

958
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:59,000
Oh, fuck. What's the what's the word when a jewish boy becomes a man?

959
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,480
Ramadan no

960
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Ramadan yeah close enough

961
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,240
Uh, mage. Okay. What's your other joke? Uh, let me type it

962
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,960
Okay, go on go on

963
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,560
Were we

964
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,760
Nate were you were you doing like a round up like a like a radcom three content round up? Did you do that?

965
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,920
Oh, right. I was gonna say yeah, uh, what do you remember? I was like, okay in terms of stuff that's left

966
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,240
I know that gibb has one piece of content left. Uh, ben's finishing 10 bases and draw

967
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,720
I think there's something else that was like, uh, like a reward or something. I can't quite remember

968
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:34,680
I think there's something else too something. I don't I don't it was a reward tier. Yeah, I can't remember

969
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,680
I'll have to go check. I'll have to go check. But I think there's one other as well

970
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,400
So that's maybe something something something nine thousands

971
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,120
And you know, it's almost uh, by the time this comes out

972
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:49,080
It'll be pretty close to the like the one-year anniversary of like the end of radcon three might even be past it

973
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:54,200
Can we march sometime? Can we get it all released within a year of the event?

974
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:00,600
Do you think it could happen? Well, I know for a fact that gibbs thing will not come out, uh, before like the end of the thing

975
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,480
But you know, uh, frankly, that's his business and I don't care. I'm not involved in that. Oh, wait. Yes. I am

976
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,840
I'm literally in it now that I think about it. Um, well, whatever

977
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,560
He should release it. Is this is a secret what it is

978
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:16,120
I just want to say just in case he doesn't want to if you can clarify it if he wants, um

979
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,960
Uh, but yeah, so we're we're getting close to the end

980
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:26,920
And I know I said last time but my god was radcon three such a derailing of like how great things were going for me

981
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,040
In terms of getting my work done on my channel and it's all it's all my fault. I blame no one else

982
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:37,880
Yeah, but you know same. I can't blame radcon three. It's own. It's no one's fault, but mine

983
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:45,400
I just I just I signed up for too much shit and it was great. Uh, we made all the stuff almost it'll all be done soon

984
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,480
But uh, I think

985
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:53,560
I mean, I think I'm done. I think with 10 paces and draw. I'm like done with everything

986
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,080
Technically, I mean you may or may not have a little bit of more work to do on the thing

987
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:00,680
I'm still working on but you know, I think it's very minimal if anything, so

988
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,360
Fuck yeah, that's that's it. Well, I'm very excited to have that monkey off my back

989
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:12,680
I cannot wait. Uh, I've got big plans for things to do with my spare time once that is all gone

990
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,040
It's really loomed over me. It's like it's really been a black cloud. Um, yeah, it's it's a nightmare

991
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,360
Just a burden. So not doing this just a disaster. So radcon four

992
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:29,320
I'm gonna waltz in do a lecture waltz the fuck out and that's all I'll do people can make their vlogs people can

993
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,440
You know other people want to make more complicated content. I want to do

994
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,640
I want to do two lectures at radcon four. Excellent idea. Whenever that happens

995
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,320
I might do like one long one and two short ones

996
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,120
Welcome like mini lectures. Hey Gib. We were just talking about things that remain for radcon three

997
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,080
Uh, I didn't say yours in case you wanted to keep it on the down low

998
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,440
Oh, I mean, I've I've mentioned that it's a thing, but I I don't know whether I'll ever release it

999
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,760
It's the g rpj kingdom hearts two

1000
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,280
Which I have the footage for can can I read this one? Can I read mage's next racist joke?

1001
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:08,680
Yeah, please. Uh, remember, uh, the attitudes expressed in this joke are not mine. They are mages not mine

1002
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
They're just jokes. I remember

1003
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,800
Uh, a white person and a black person are talking the black person is ranting

1004
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:22,040
Tell me this so when you're cold your skin turns blue when you're embarrassed your skin turns pink

1005
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,280
When you're angry your skin turns red when your nauseous your skin turns green

1006
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,600
And when you're tan your skin turns orange and you say, I'm the person of color with you

1007
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,200
Destroyed

1008
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:44,440
You know that's so that's so weirdly wholesome. Yeah, it is. It is extremely wholesome. That is like

1009
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,480
Yeah, that's like something mother goose would tell me

1010
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,800
Something mother goose would say to the black people in the neighborhood. That's like a witty the poo-wism

1011
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,400
Yes

1012
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
Oh god mother goose

1013
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:03,000
I don't know whether I've mentioned this before but I have nightmares of mother goose. What for what reason explain

1014
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:09,560
Because when I was a baby, I had the mother goose thing and the the the packaging that it came in one thing

1015
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:15,080
What thing is like some some brother's grim stuff that's like been repackaged for the waste or something now

1016
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,320
I have no idea what it is. I just know that there's a goose and she wears a little a

1017
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,320
Bloop on it. Yeah, and it's supposed to be for kids and there was this I guess plastic um

1018
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:34,440
You know robot thing mother goose that would sing to you. I think mother goose is public domain character. Okay. Yeah, I'm tempted to say

1019
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,720
So so there was this thing. I don't remember what the product was but I remember the packaging

1020
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:45,000
Um, which was this big cardboard box with a mother goose on it and I always used to see

1021
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,160
Mother goose staring at me on that packaging from the other end of the room

1022
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,400
It was the only thing that had eyes in my room like when you were sleeping from your bed or something

1023
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,600
Yeah, when I was sleeping I was like and then later we moved that up into the loft

1024
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:06,040
Um, and it would be put right at the back and when I was like young and like the loft at the moment is like renovated

1025
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,760
Since been renovated into an upstairs

1026
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,480
Bedroom like it used to be uh, uh, uh, you know a horrible

1027
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,840
A dark scary cold uninsulated

1028
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,640
mess of a broken childish

1029
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:25,080
Broken children's toys and like old photographs and demons and spiders

1030
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:31,080
And so occasionally I would go up there and like there would be mother goose staring at me in the exact same way

1031
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,560
On on that box all the way in the end in the darkest darkest bit

1032
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,080
And she would eat me and I would be scared that she would fucking bite her goose

1033
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,160
Fangs on me. Geese are very aggressive. They are. She's that's true. She's open domain

1034
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:53,080
So welcome new mainstay pcp character mother goose haunting gib in his dreams and nightmares

1035
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,640
Welcome to the family mother goose

1036

Glad to have you you're equally important to the dude. We gotta make a mother. We gotta make a mother goose shirt

1039
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,760
I want one of mother goose is like the masculine like farmer and like the terrified woman to his left

1040
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:25,960
Is gib just being intimidated. Is she terrified? Is that how you read american gothic? No, but i'm reinterpreting it for this particular

1041
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:31,640
I'm like the weirdly hyper realistic goose face, uh of the american gothic. I think would really work

1042
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,240
I think would really work

1043
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:39,960
So please draw that for free ladies and gentlemen, uh and send it to me put some hyper realistic blood on it like my creepypastas

1044
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,760
Hyper realistic blood

1045
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,040
Yeah, you know, you're playing you're playing a haunted video game. You're playing a haunted pokemon cartridge

1046
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:53,400
You're playing a haunted painting. Yeah, and then you get you get stabbed and and your pokemon die

1047
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:58,600
But there's hyper realistic you get that blood dot png just right on the screen there

1048
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,200
It's just from google.com with watermark. There's nothing more realistic

1049
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:09,000
It would be so it would be so much more scary if it was pixel art animated blood because then it would be like wait

1050
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,880
Did they program this in there or is it real? Oh my god?

1051
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:18,120
Do they believe the actual pixel mons to get this pixel blood that's fucked up? It's not it's not scary unless it's a ghost

1052
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,640
It's not scary unless it's a ghost with that on this shirt. It's not scary unless it's a ghost

1053
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,120
God i'm just i'm just full of brilliant ideas. God. I'm this could all be shirts

1054
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:37,960
Uh, okay. Speaking of gold mine. Yeah. Yeah, do I marry emily abigale or lia? Jesus christ

1055
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,120
I'm gonna say lia. I'm

1056
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,400
I'm gonna say

1057
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:48,920
Emily because I like that name the most is from stardew valley by the way people no go for lia lia is obviously the

1058
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,080
The diamond in the rough waifu that you're supposed to go. Emily. Emily was my first pick

1059
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:58,360
Yeah, I mean immediately. I was I honed it on emily, but then I'm like a little bit

1060
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,000
I don't know and now i'm like wavering back and forth between abigale. Well, it's uh, do you want to?

1061
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:09,400
What's what's the word when women marry up? Uh poly no, it's uh, you know what i'm talking about hypergamy

1062
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,160
Hypergamy, yeah

1063
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:15,800
Like because if you marry lia, you're getting nothing you're not getting a single sheep for your dowry. You're getting

1064
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,880
What am I getting from abigale?

1065
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:25,000
Uh, abigale has like a she lives with her family, right? So they can supply a dowry of of pierre pierre doesn't have the kind of

1066
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,160
Money to throw around he's he's always struggling. He's got some gems. I don't know. Let me her throw up

1067
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,040
She's she's uh, she's spike. She's a dragon

1068
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:42,440
Um guys, uh, could that be please a a my little pony risk in of stardew valley where I could choose to marry fluttershy

1069
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:46,440
That'll be good. Thanks. I don't know. That would definitely. I don't know why there isn't one already

1070
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,880
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised. Well, you can already ride a horse. You could just roleplay as that horse

1071
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,080
Um

1072
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,840
Dude, I put a hat on my horse. It was fucking sick. You get hats for your horse

1073
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,200
You can put any hat on your horse. I had no idea

1074
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Yeah, welcome to hats for your horse

1075
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:12,440
Slimefield slime felt has never looked better horses for your hats like a little horse that goes like runs on the inside of the

1076
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,320
Brim. Yeah. Oh, they'll be sick. They'll be sick

1077
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,840
Um, you feed him tiny tiny carrots. I only know two things in this world. That's hats and horses

1078
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,520
You're voting you're voting leonate. Yeah, mostly because emily's mine. So stay away from her. Are you fucking? I?

1079
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,600
I've been leaning more towards leon abigale. I don't know. There you go. There you go. Abigale's trash to pick her

1080
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,160
I think

1081
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,320
Ah god, so difficult. I think

1082
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:45,640
I think leah is probably the most like she's the obvious choice. I think she's she's the one who

1083
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,320
Okay, I like leah because it seems like she probably

1084
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,720
Isn't like an idiot like abigale seems like kind of an idiot and like it's kind of cute

1085
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,680
Wait a minute. I just found

1086
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:05,160
A sexy picture of abigale. Now. She's the top contender. She looks way less fat than she does in her portrait here

1087
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,560
But I kind of hate

1088
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,760
Leah's taste in food. She's got basic bitch taste in food. She's because she's poor as shit

1089
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:17,640
She can't afford the gourmet stuff. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. She likes wine. She likes truffles

1090
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,720
She likes goat cheese. She is totally human core and it's disgusting

1091
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:22,840
Oh

1092
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,240
Abagail is nothing but heel and monster zero

1093
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:31,640
Abigale is practical leah is practical and abigale is kind of like like what the fuck is she thinking?

1094
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,640
What is she doing with her life? She's all so random, but she's not no emily's random. Yeah, I guess you're right

1095
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:43,400
She's the pinky pie of but abigale is post food. Well, no, she likes to eat but at least she's less human

1096
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:48,520
Oh, yeah, she sure does. Oh, I'd love to eat. Oh, I'm gonna be stuffed more food in my face

1097
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,480
I found a I found a secret note from her that says like here's some things

1098
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,560
Here's some of my favorite foods. I love to eat and I'm like

1099
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
Fat confirmed fat confirmed

1100
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,200
But even more damningly human core confirmed and that's

1101
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,960
That's the worst of all leah is the most human core and it's damning. It's the one thing against her

1102
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,520
All right, uh, should we move on to the voicemails? I think it's about how long we've been going an hour and 22 minutes

1103
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,560
Pretty good. I guess I guess wait, um, no

1104
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,000
Nate play play me off play me off for the uh for the

1105
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,280

01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,800
Listen, I called up. I called up my local

1109
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:50,360
I called up my local italian eatery. Yeah, I asked them if they delivered and they said, yeah

1110
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,680
They said it's not deliver is to giorno

1111
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,920
And I said, would you please bring me?

1112
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:01,000
Would you please bring me the pizza party podcast? I've been looking for it everywhere and you're my only hope

1113
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,640
And they hung up on me

1114
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,720
And they swatted me

1115
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,960
The swat team killed my dog

1116
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,640
Had a dog human core anyway, the pizza party podcast for this

1117
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,120
Damn you pizza party podcast

Hashtag where's the podcast?

1119
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:23,000
He just wanted to know where it is. If only it'd been easier to find this wouldn't have happened

1120
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:30,680
Goodbye slime fields. You were a good hound. I uh, I know there is a voicemail that's about the pizza party

1121
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,040
I forget it's the first or the second one. So we'll just have to dive in and we'll we'll get to it

1122
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,360
Either first or second here. Um

1123
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,120
But hey speak pipe people link below send us voicemails. You know the drill

1124
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,800
Let's see if this first one's about pizza party or not. Uh in any case

1125
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,640
This first one is from dining kroger

1126
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,280
Dining kroger, uh go

1127
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:57,000
I met an interesting guy in a brew pub the other day and I actually engaged in a long conversation with him

1128
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,400
First we talked about anime and I thought he must be an anime reviewer of some sort

1129
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,760
Then we talked about video games and I was certain he was a game designer

1130
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Lastly we talked about memes and I was sure he was a four-changer just like myself

1131
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,400
Well, the hour grew late and the next day I inquired about this man the waitress

1132
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:19,080
I'm describing his unkempt appearance and she stops me and says don't you know that was the pcp

1133
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,040
Had no idea

1134
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:27,240
Wait, what that I guess this entity was the pcp

1135
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,120
I thought this was like a joke. I I thought this is I thought this is gonna be to laugh

1136
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:40,360
Like you know, I thought this was like a uh, a um, you know a four-channer a game designer and an anime reviewer walk into a bar

1137
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,760
And it's the pcp and that's and yeah

1138
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,120
That's the end no one laughs. Um, I'd like to apologize for selecting this just like the real podcast

1139
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,680
Oh, no, everyone started everyone started laughing until they all bowed their heads in shame and walked down

1140
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,120
Um, although his name was dining kruger, which I'm wondering is a pun on dunning kruger

1141
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:04,120
You know, maybe it it sounds like could there be a joke here. Could there be a joke?

1142
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,720
Um, we'll never know. I think it's probably just his handle

1143
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:15,560
Okay, anyway, let's go to the next one. Maybe this is the pizza party one. Oh, it is. Okay. This voice smells from where is it?

1144
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:21,960
It's from where is it? I think I'm detecting or is my own heart. Yeah, let's let's see what we've got go

Steel toad boot

Of the non-existent podcast

01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,800
Smashed open smat rent a sunday with the butt of a rifle

My fourth the anniversary of like the fourth or the third year of me watching the procrastinators

1171
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,120
Guys, I'm a big fan and I'm a big zoomer

1172
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
zoom

1173
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,120
Hey, I'm just zooming around on my birthday while I'm playing fortnight

1174
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,720
Uh, and just general multitasking like you do

1175
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,600
Like I'm actually listening to the pcp right now as I record this voicemail

1176
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:50,040
Just because you know, I'm a fucking zoomer who multitasks on everything. That's just what we do

1177
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:56,200
Anyway, great show guys. Keep the show up. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna zoom away right now

1178
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,680
I bet that guy's got so many fucking tabs open right now

1179
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:09,960
Yeah, I think you're right, uh, you know, I'm too intimidated by these kids. I can't handle it. They're pretty high level the five-year-olds

1180
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:16,360
You know, yeah, it's good that we got young blood. You know, it's good that we're educating the next generation

1181
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,960
I agree. I agree. It is it is pretty funny making a better world

1182
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:26,440
Zoomers of the world don't forget to take your adhd medications stop zooming your mother needs to calm down in the evening

1183
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,880
And medicating yourself with two glasses of wine a night just ain't healthy just tone down the zooming

Love you grandma appreciate that. We all agreed it was best not to spend your savings on a nursing home

1204
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:09,800
Yeah, what's the fucking point? We instead spent that money on renting a gun and buying a bullet

1205
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:14,920
That's what we did. That was your retirement savings amounted to grandma. So enjoy that

1206
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:25,160
She's got a way with words grandma. Um, okay next call from arcade nova. He sounds like a real gamer

1212
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Model 8.88 it is iDigie. The prophecy has been foreskid error error three nine eight four

1213
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:08,360
K-e-k-o. No, it seems that I cannot handle your content creation power systems in check restoring energy

1214
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:17,880
Scanning scanning. What's this? You're a filthy fucking fraud. You have only reviewed point zero zero five four three four seven eight

1215
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,960
percentage of the gamecube library

1216
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,520
Bro, where's the gamecube forever unsubscribed?

1217
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:29,640
Got him. We um, I think uh, I think we better alert digi

1218
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:34,040
Yeah, I think I think uh, I think he wants to know I think he wants to know that this

1219
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,800
This ai is is gunning for I think may or may not be his digital sibling

1220
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,840

1221
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,440
Viewers listen again. Let us know in the comments. Who is this creature?

1222
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,360
I uh, I think gamecube chats could come back. I think that's that's a cool name for a thing

1223
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,360
It's not bad. It is

1224
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:01,800
You could review more gamecube games like hey guys were those specifically like reviews or were they like let's play

1225
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,000
No, there was just let's play with his friends. Yeah, like that's a cool name for a thing

1226
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,400
Just like chatting about gamecube games. Hey

01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:12,520
Yeah, we're playing wait. Was that not a thing on im games? No. No, it's way before that

1228
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,640
Hmm was there another game

1229
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,920
This was pretty didgy brony. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know

1230
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:24,440
Arcade novice pissed that there's only zero point whatever percentage of all gamecube games reviewed though

1231
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:30,600
So he better get to it. You don't want to uh, didn't do didn't devoo like I don't know how far he went

1232
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:36,120

1233
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:42,120
Which was a cool idea. I like that idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, keep it up devoo. All right next call. We've got

1234
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:47,720
Let me see gigadonk mcfronk calling back. I think let's uh, cool. Let's let's let's go

1235
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:53,880
Hey guys, sorry if my voice sounds a little gay. I've been listening to the procrastinator's podcast recently

1236
01:32:54,280 --> 01:33:00,360
I just wanted to follow up on my previous voicemail where everyone took it at face value that I was actually asking you for

1237
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:02,440
romantic advice at age 21

1238
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:10,920
Uh, I'm not really a fucking turbo virgin who lives in his basement and thinks that he needs to date someone who

1239
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:19,240
Likes video games to be cool. Okay. Uh, I know I know it sounds like uh, I was just pretending to be retarded kind of scenario

1240
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:24,360
But no legit. I was no cool. I didn't mean it. Uh, the girl broke up with me anyway

1241
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,440
So uh, while I'm here if you guys don't mind, I'd like to seek out

1242
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:35,320
A sexual fulfillment by giving each of you a kiss full on the lips one by one then saint

1243
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,560
You're up first. Come here

1244
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,520
Oh

1245
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,600
Yeah

1246
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,600
I have aids

1247
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,920
Sorry bro. Well

1248
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,080
That's it. You could have told him you had time

1249
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:59,000
Why didn't he kiss the rest of you and get you all and get you all some of that distracted by his recent diagnosis of aids

1250
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:02,440
So, you know, I suppose he'll come back to us. That's no reason. That's no reason

1251
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,640
We all know that aids is like a sudden shock that runs through your body. You know instantly that you have it

1252
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:12,200
I've always been a bug chaser. This is my one chance to get those sweet aids, but maybe next time

1253
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,200
Maybe next time. Well, you just got a kiss bent on the lips

1254
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,880
Um, I mean we are married now. Oh, yeah, you know, that's true. Uh, but I've sworn a vow of celibacy

1255
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,960
But anyway, we'll get you've done all the gay sex

1256
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,760
But you you're gonna get around to the kissing on the lips part in the holding hands that comes last

1257
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:31,720
Yeah, I guess one of these days. Okay next call. Here it is from zack

1258
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,040
go

1259
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:38,120
So last time you guys mentioned that nobody on the pcp actually does much procrastinating

1260
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:43,080
Which brought to my attention that you gormless peons don't even grasp the true genius behind your own name

1261
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:48,680
See when the unifying theme of the pcp is that every member has another creative outlet aside from the podcast

1262
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:54,760
The act of recording the podcast itself is inherent procrastination from said creative outlets

1263
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:01,160
But since the pcp is monetized, you are literally professionally procrastinating. You are pro

1264
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,720
Crastinators

1265
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,560
Yeah

1266
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,800
Oh, I wish it had kept going. Yeah, but uh, that guy is on the money. Yeah. No, that's good

1267
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:17,880
That guy that guy gets us better than we get ourselves update the wiki ladies and gentlemen. That's canon. That's confirmed

1268
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:25,320
He's I already knew that like the professional part of procrastinators was that it was a thing we were getting paid for

1269
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,600
Like the idea that that we are procrastinating on our own stuff

1270
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:35,240
By doing the money thing. That's that's good. I am smart at this very moment

1271
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:41,640
I am filled with anger and piss and bile and shit and come at the fact that I can't be working

1272
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:48,280
On my weaguar right now and as soon as this is done. I'm getting back to it. So it's fair. The fabled we are going to be working

1273
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:53,960
Right now. There you go. Instead. I'm recording this fucking podcast. Nobody likes it

1274
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,000
It's really bad. It's really bad now

1275
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,000
All right, we've learned we've learned a lot today. That was good. We've covered a lot of grounds. I appreciate that Zach

1276
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:10,600
Thanks. Uh, okay next one's from f-frame. F-frame's got some frame. Mm-hmm. Oh

1277
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,000
So I'm big into rfck. I hang out there a lot

1278
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:20,600
And there are so many people there that I can safely call my friend at this point

1279
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,000
In that got me thinking about the whole pcp friendship simulator meme

1280
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,240
And I thought

1281
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,720
Is pcp a friendship simulator at this point? Is it really just a simulator?

1282
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,920
Because with me new moving to new areas for college

1283
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:41,240
Um, I don't have many real life friends and I go to rfck and that's my social circle

1284
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,120
And sure i'm not friends with digi or nate

1285
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,720
But pcp the pcp has probably got had the biggest role in creating

1286
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,840
my new social circle

1287
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:57,640
And I just think that's funny. Um, little food for that. Well, that's nice. You know, I

1288
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:02,360
Thanks for the call of frame. I know that guy. He was at the first. He was the first

1289
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:08,680
He was at rf roddy fuckers con killers one. Um, so he did it. He turned it into real friends. Yeah, I guess so

1290
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,760
He's not he's not all talk

1291
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:15,640
Living the gimmick. I was I was thinking about this. I've been thinking about this recently how like

1292
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,600
the

1293
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,200
I mean I

1294
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,800
How am I gonna say it like to to a certain extent? Yeah, like

1295
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,080
You might you might think that like the point

1296
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:34,840
Of a community, right? Like around the pcp community. Yeah that the point of it is the pc is the pcp

1297
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:40,680
But maybe it's not or it doesn't have to be like the community itself and the people in it

1298
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,840
Can be the the point. I don't know. Maybe that's obvious

1299
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:49,400
Maybe that's really obvious, but I was just thinking about I was like, huh, you know

1300
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:54,040
I mean people don't just people like people don't necessarily just I don't know

1301
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:02,120
Pop into rfck for the game or for me or munchie or whatever. Yeah, they don't come to the pcp discord just to like, you know

1302
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:07,720
See us or whatever or you know and so on with like anyone's community. That's true. They're they're they're they're

1303
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:13,480
You know, it's the other people that are there that they're congregating. I mean really it's it's you know

1304
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:19,240
A like-minded people like everybody likes this thing. So there's a lot to talk about that they know that they can talk about

1305
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,960
Yeah, I guess the discord community and just you know, the communities that have spawned is a

1306
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:30,760
Is more of a benefit than you might think at first. It seems like it's pointless and meaningless, but no, it's actually kind of good to have

1307
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:35,400
Um, well, it's not I mean, it's not just discord, but yeah, for example for example

1308
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:40,440
Discords and and you know, I guess we can as the members ourselves, uh, especially for me

1309
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:46,440
I can be very like member oriented and not thinking about other people and so when I've said friendship simulator

1310
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,600
It's it's like in goodwill hunting

1311
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,600
Like the teacher guy whatever shawn says to will hunting like hey

1312
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:59,800
Uh, who who like who's your buddy who inspires you and the guy's like, you know, uh, nichy lock and he looks Shakespeare, etc

1313
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:03,320
And he's like, yeah, but they can't give back to you. They aren't your soulmates, you know

1314
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:09,800
You can't have dialogue with them and I feel that applies to like the pcp members in the audience specifically

1315
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,000
but

1316
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,920
Beyond that though as as you know a frame and ben are saying the uh, yeah

1317
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:22,120
The community absolutely you can't touch and frankly guys like ben and munchie get pretty deeply involved with their communities as well

1318
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:28,600
Anyway, and meet a ton of them. So it's not even that much of a distance some sometimes don't say that because I've really been well

1319
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,640
Yeah, I've really I've really been neglecting rfck this last like

1320
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,760
But I'll be back

1321
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:40,360
With the people active in my discord. Oh, I recently launched gonna. We're gonna do anime nights on

1322
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:44,600
Fridays and Saturdays and I'm gonna watch a happy funny comedy anime

1323
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:51,000
You know that makes me want to plug. Do you want to plug your discord or something? Is it a patron discord or is it?

1324
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,640
Okay

1325
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,400
Maze elitist lethal aurora hates the common people

1326
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,880
No, I mean you can

1327
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:06,840
Get get through a patron just because I'm lazy to edit it out and I feel like you know, it's fine

1328
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,200
but uh

1329
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:13,320
It was open to the public at some point and a lot of people got in and they're still around and

1330
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,320
There are ways to get in but like I don't want to open it publicly

1331
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,920
I don't want too many people, you know mage that just reminds me of uh

1332
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,320
I can be a real one-man show with a lot of stuff

1333
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:26,280
I'm doing and I kind of hate involving other people in the work

1334
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,360
I'm doing depending on what the project is

1335
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:34,280
But like it reminds me of when I was in college and I was in an anime club that was full of giant spurg lords

1336
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:41,240
But they weren't bad people and frankly just having people around who I could finally talk to about anime for like the first time in my life

1337
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,080
Uh was real special and they introduced me to a lot of anime

1338
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,600
I probably wouldn't have found like gurl a login and shit if it wasn't for that club

1339
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:53,560
And oh, just it's just making me nostalgic. It was it was a pretty good time. It's a pretty good time

1340
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,720
I used to be in an anime club too, but I don't remember much about it. How old were you when you were in it?

1341
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:06,680
Uh, I was I was definitely a teenager in the older years, but uh, I like they were nice people

1342
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:12,600
They weren't like spurgs or whatever you call them. Uh, I just but I use the term endearingly

1343
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:14,920
Yeah, they were they were cool people

1344
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,880
There were just a lot of them and I had a very hard time sort of talking speaking out

1345
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:25,160
My mom was happy that was finally like going out and involving yourself with people, but just like

1346
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:30,120
There wasn't like a tight connection with them. They were nice to me though. Like they they were really people

1347
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,560
So nothing bad is just you know, sometimes people just don't connect

1348
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:38,840
I did meet all my best friends at my anime club or my all my college best friends and uh, uh,

1349
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,840
They only came for like one day though, and I'm the only one who stayed long term

1350
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,400
But thank god they came for that one day because that's what I remember

1351
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:50,200
I remember we watched this this one anime movie and I I don't remember the title

1352
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:55,320
But it was I remember it was weirdly trippy and I can't describe it. It was like a dream, but it wasn't a dream

1353
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,320
so don't worry, uh

1354
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:02,120
It was it was it was it was so weird and I I wish I could find it again

1355
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:06,520
Just so I could rewatch it with like fresh new eyes of like yeah. Yeah

1356
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,560
I don't watch tokyo godfathers

1357
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:13,080
Oh, I still want to watch that as well. Yeah, it's dope. It's totally dope

1358
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:17,560
Oh, and I downloaded perfect blue gotta watch that sometime. Okay. Anyway, we got two more voicemails

1359
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:23,800
Let's let's get to those next voicemail is from center point old fan favorite go

1360
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:34,840
Hey guys at the pcp, uh, this is center point. Uh, just wanted to say that I'm at cancun right now after being a poor boy for

1361
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,800
Up until I came to cancun

1362
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:42,120
Since I'm not actually going to be able to hear this until uh Friday

1363
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:47,480
I wanted to know, uh, what is the best thing I can do on the last day of a cool vacation?

1364
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,160
Appreciate it

1365
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,160
Okay, first of all whores

1366
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:55,560
Find the whores find all the prostitutes and do them all spend all your money

1367
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,160
If you're single if you're single on a tropical vacation

1368
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:04,120
God damn my cursed interrelationship status if I was single and on a tropical vacation

1369
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:08,680
You've got to fuck up like a tropical honey. You've got to do it. How can you not?

1370
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,720
No, no, no, no get it get a good nice rest for a very taxing trip tomorrow

1371
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,160
Well, that's so boring

1372
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,720
Exactly

1373
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,200
Whores I'm going with whores. Yeah

1374
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,920
Just imagine just imagine walking on the beach

1375
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:30,280
Hawaiian or here's what you do. Yeah. Here's what you do. You go. No. Here's what you do

1376
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:38,200
This is this is cool. This is cool. You're in a foreign place. Yeah, you don't you don't have to worry about anything

1377
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,960
You do not have to

1378
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:46,920
Commit crimes my dude. No, I'm saying I'm saying you can go out. You can go to the local watering hole

1379
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,400
You can uh, you can uh

1380
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,280
You can get wasted if you want you can you can um

1381
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,360
You can make advance you can make advances on all the ladies

1382
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:00,840
And you don't have to be embarrassed because you will never see them ever again. That's right

1383
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:06,200
That's a lot of empowerment for the pickup. You should go you should go out and fucking you should go out and fucking

1384
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,560
Get a little loosey-goosey. You should go you should go

1385
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:18,200
Women on vacation want to fuck end of conversation. This is your golden opportunity. You've probably already done it like every day of the week

1386
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:23,000
That's what i'm guessing and maybe you haven't and you feel bad. That's okay. Give it a shot, dude

1387
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,000
Grind your skills

1388
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
He took he took a day off

1389
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:31,880
Fucking the locals to make this voicemail and it was worth it. Yeah, good

1390
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:38,200
Don't don't wait until you're old and married and not allowed to go all over the world fucking every whore in the world

1391
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,840
Because then every day of your life will be torture. I gotta tell you guys

1392
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:47,320
I there probably will anyway, but you can enjoy you can enjoy now

1393
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:53,880
I have come down maybe I have come down with some serious island fever now that I visited hawaii a couple of times

1394
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,000
Every moment that i'm not there is just like

1395
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,760
Why is life just so much worse? Why do I gotta be

1396
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:05,880
In this place and I could be in that place. It's it's pain. It's pain

1397
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,480
I know that I haven't been there. So maybe I can't

1398
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,280
Say I just

1399
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,880
I don't get it

1400
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:19,480
I do maybe maybe I'd get it if I went there, but I don't think I would I think I like my rainy

1401
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,960
I think I like my rainy urban fucking

1402
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,880
Uh

1403
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,360
Well, you know, you know, I mean don't they say they say that like you know seasonal depression is the thing, right?

1404
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,400
Because like it's like it's cold outside. It's winter and stuff. You can't go outside

1405
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:35,560
You gotta bundle up life's just kind of a hassle when you live in a cold and rainy place

1406
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:42,120
In like a in a sunny tropical island. First of all, you can just go outside in nothing and feel perfect and feel great

1407
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:45,080
Second of all the beach is like literally right there

1408
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:51,560
And I've always loved the ocean and I miss it so desperately living in the middle of fucking nowhere out here

1409
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,680
And uh, you know, I want to live there so bad

1410
01:45:54,760 --> 01:46:00,840
I want to live in either like LA near the beach or like destiny islands fucking texas by the beach destiny islands. Yeah

1411
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:07,960
Yeah, why not? That's basically hawaii right there. Oh, I love the fucking ocean. I'm literally saura and I miss it

1412
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,000
I I love the ocean too. That's great, but uh

1413
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:17,080
Yeah, it's all right. I do like to take the ocean. I do like urban grime. Sure

1414
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,240
But it's Stockholm syndrome. Hell yeah, it's Stockholm syndrome though because you know, the only

1415
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:26,280
Yeah, the only brief windows in my life that I've ever even been anywhere close to approaching

1416
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:30,920
Remotely in the vicinity of happiness. I've been on a beach somewhere and you know

1417
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,080
Beach is a great

1418
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:40,200
Same thing with that dreaded interrelationship status, you know, I like it, but it's Stockholm syndrome, you know

1419
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,160
When I was really happy it was completely alone in the world

1420
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:49,400
You know, I feel like the whole like beach thing like most people don't live on beaches

1421
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,640
Yeah, except people in hawaii

1422
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:53,240
um, but like

1423
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:57,240
There's I think most of hawaii isn't on the beach, you know, it's it's it's just that it's no

1424
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:03,400
But what what I'm getting at is like the beach isn't inherently way better than you know any other place

1425
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,760
Um, but when you're on holiday, it's uh one

1426
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:12,760
It's uh an escape from whatever bullshit you have to deal with back home and all the people that you have to deal with back home

1427
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:17,960
I hear you all the people who give you shit were on the same beach. It wouldn't be very good anymore

1428
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:22,840
You know, that's a great point. That's a great point. I don't I mean, I think if I lived on in hawaii or something

1429
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:25,560
Or if I lived in it, I mean, I wouldn't swim in the ocean

1430
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:31,560
All of the see I would just because I just because I lived I would if I lived like let's say a five minute walk from

1431
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:35,560
Damn it. I'd probably be like a five or ten minute walk from the beach at least or maybe a drive

1432
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:37,560
I feel like

1433
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,080
I feel like I'd be there every day

1434
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:42,920
I feel like I'd make time to go there every day if it was if it was a drive

1435
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,280
I would go

1436
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,960
Couple times a year if it was a walk. I would go maybe once a month

1437
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:53,720
You know, because I've got to accept the fact that my lifestyle right now is very much inside on my computer

1438
01:47:53,800 --> 01:48:00,280
You know, I go get up and go to the gym when appropriate, but I'm not like thinking about like yay go do fun things

1439
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:02,360
I'm a worker man. That's how I've

1440
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,440
Configured my body and my brain

1441
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,040
Uh, so like even if I lived straight up in like the best beach in the world

1442
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,840
Would I take advantage of it or would it just go?

1443
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:14,680
You know unused as I'm stressed out with work and stuff in the day-to-day grind

1444
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:19,160
It's definitely possible. Definitely possible. It's yeah, it's possible. But like

1445
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,640
I said that but like I do like the idea. I think it's just

1446
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,800
you have to

1447
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:30,440
To understand that going somewhere forever is a lot different than going somewhere pretty often

1448
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,680
That's very living in hawaii is a lot more different from going to hawaii every year for a whole the good news is

1449
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,840
That michelle did live in hawaii. And so I got her stories now to be fair

1450
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,400
She lived with her parents and didn't have a ton of responsibilities

1451
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:48,040
So, you know, that's different from like my life where I have to do lots of work all the time and stuff

1452
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,920
um get a job michelle, but uh

1453
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,320
um

1454
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,600
You know

1455
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:59,880
That's it. Like I just frankly I watched point break. Okay. I watched point break again recently

1456
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:05,320
It's a movie about surfing. I want to be a surfer so fucking bad. I want to be on the beach

1457
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:10,280
I want to hit the waves. I want to those guys are so tanned and beautiful and fit

1458
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,960
I could be that if I was just by a beach right now with the board

1459
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:22,200
Get me there remember that that episode of pokemon where they have to ride the big wave to hit the the rock with the flag

1460
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:27,480
I think I do remember that actually is that like season one. Is that squirtle like surfing or something?

1461
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,680
No, it's just there was this old man who was just like

1462
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:35,080
Uh, I I used to be able to ride the wave to put the flag at the top

1463
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:40,840
And now I I I failed and I can't do it rings a very vague bell

1464
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,200
I feel the same and then the episode straight after was in the same location

1465
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:48,760
But it was a ghostly house on the cliff. Don't you love when they do that? They do stuff like like they're in the

1466
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:55,960
Building an environment is a really satisfying thing and having like even a like a pokemon show where like they're journeying around

1467
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:01,000
To have a couple of episodes like in the same town doing like different things within the town

1468
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:05,720
Pretty good feel pretty good feel mr. Mime, pidgey, Bulbasaur, Nidoran

1469
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,440
Jinx, Sonic's

1470
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:13,560
God, I am a night slope everybody. Here's your homework. You have to go watch point break

1471
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:17,400
The first one not the remake the remake is good, but the original is way better

1472
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:21,320
God I long for the beach. I long for the sand

1473
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:27,960
I wait, what's what's the moana song? I'm a girl who loves her island. Okay, that's

1474
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,680
That's all I got how

1475
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,840

More like munchy wears tiny hijabs

1484
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:18,840
That's a half of those things half of those things aren't even israeli. No, they're not. Yeah, no really not maybe

1485
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:24,840
In fact a goi they were all they were all explicitly not. Yeah, all those things are wait a minute. Okay

1486
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:32,840
Maybe this person is the pcp israeli shill 2019 of fame of the and he's mad at us for not being israeli

1487
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,720
We're not we're we're not supporting the israeli state. Yeah

1488
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:42,360
He's shilling for israel in this voicemail and try and he's like he works for like the uh the tourism department of israel

1489
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,520
And he's trying to you know bait us

1490
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:52,760
Into coming to israel. Well, damn. I mean, I guess we better do contact our jewish overlords and make sure we're pleasing them properly

1491
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:55,800
Could this be my beach vacation of my dreams?

1492
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:01,240
It could be they do have uh, easton client from h3h3. Yeah

1493
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,720
Isn't it, you know

1494
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:07,160
Not to get too serious or anything, but isn't it just what an what an absolute beach of a man

1495
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:12,360
That's true. They just straight up pay you if you're jewish to come to israel or they'll like pay for the trip

1496
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,720
That's a fucking deal. What a deal the human sandbar

1497
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,600
That's fair. That's accurate

1498
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,800
Is he still shit is the consensus that he's still shit and gay?

1499
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:29,000
You know online or is he been ready yet? I I thought they were both always shit. So I don't know why everyone

1500
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,280
I saw a left-wing commie

1501
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,000
Yeah hero

1502
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Respond to ethan

1503
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:42,680
And I don't know what the controversy is but apparently there was a controversy being responded to

1504
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,120
And this guy was like this guy was basically

1505
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,840
imploring ethan like ethan

1506
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:55,960
You know your fans are mad because you said the wrong thing and you have failed as what they perceived

1507
01:52:56,440 --> 01:53:01,160
You were as their quote-unquote thought leader. You need to not

1508
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:06,520
Do you need you need to stop pandering to these people that hate you now?

1509
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Because they do not you know, they're in it for what the some weird political stance. They thought you represented

1510
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:15,400
You need to get back to your lefty roots

1511
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,760
You need to you need to be you need to be true to yourself

1512
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:24,120
You'll lose some of your fans, but those are the fans. You don't want to have and da-da-da-da, and I was like god

1513
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,360
I hate capitalism. Yeah

1514
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,360
Yeah

1515
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,360
You know, you know what that's the story

1516
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,920
I forget if I talked about this go on jesse go on go on

1517
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:38,840
It seems like from what I've seen of like the backlash or people turning from h3h3

1518
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,840
It all stems from like

1519
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:47,720
When they started doing their podcast and filming it and people saw that like they have absolutely no charisma in real life

1520
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:49,560
but like

1521
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,080
Wasn't that always

1522
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,880
Obvious from their videos like why are people surprised?

1523
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:58,600
I thought I thought the whole gimmick of ethan was that he was a weird gumpy guy with no charisma

1524
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:02,600
I think I think the format social skills being edited. I think is a much better

1525
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:07,160
Like he's able to be funnier and you know do takes over and do stuff. I think that works better for him

1526
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:11,080
They associate the the funny meme edit with his

1527
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:17,000
Ability to make the joke even though that's what you get for following anyone who uses jump cuts ever. Yeah

1528
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,720
Yeah, stay tuned for this week's we Agua everybody jump cut central. Here we come, baby

1529
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:23,800
um

1530
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,120
Shit I was gonna say something. No, whatever. I don't know

1531
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,920
happy pokemon day

1532
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,600
of

1533
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,120
thing

1534
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:36,440
Business. Yeah off of just looking at videos and going what I mean

1535
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:41,080
Yeah, and then and that that's it when he's in on a podcast

1536
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:45,000
He's just he's got a lot less to say which is why it's all guests

1537
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,960
That I mean, that's fair. You know, you got to spice it up. It's yeah

1538
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:53,240
I mean his whole lawyer has been reacting to like other people's shit. Indeed. That's how he got

1539
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:58,360
I don't hate him which I have no respect for in the first place. Yeah fair enough. Um, hey

1540
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,440
Yeah, yeah go on

1541
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:06,040
Nothing, just fuck them. I don't like them. Okay. I I don't hate him. I don't know. I haven't tuned in to where's the podcast

1542
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,040
Ethan I don't hate him, but I don't like him

1543
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:14,440
No, no, we can't dilute that. Okay, you're right. That is a pizza party podcast meme

1544
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:19,880
That's the only podcast that I can't find all right. I I found all the other podcasts

1545
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:22,360
That's the last one that I haven't added to my collection

1546
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,640
But but the the h3 podcast. I don't know when it's when it is so like when's the podcast

1547
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,280
That's that's the meme for them good

1548
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:36,680
Hey, uh, Ben, I just wanted to respond to your thing about hating capitalism. Okay, serious point, but I'm not going to get that into it

1549
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:39,960
It's just that I had a thought. Oh, let's fucking get I may have said this before

1550
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:44,120
But I think I deduced what the issue is and and here it is. Okay. It's that I think

1551
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:50,520
Capitalism has a very specific usage and that's like wealth generation and it seems pretty good at that

1552
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:53,720
Like communism and like other stuff like that socialism, etc

1553
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,360
Seems really good at like taking wealth that has been generated and trying to like, you know

1554
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:04,840
Make society fair make everybody even and all that stuff and like those both make sense in different situations

1555
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,480
It's just a matter of like what your priority is

1556
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,200
Which which of those things you like better and I'm you know to me helping people helping people

1557
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:15,160
That's some pussy shit. That's some pussy shit helping people

1558
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,800
Fuck it. I mean make money

1559
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,200
You know the way you said that is just sort of seems like the perfect solution is to

1560
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,040
Just do both

1561
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:28,200
Do both in like a in a in a rotation like you do kind of yeah to make gains and wealth

1562
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:32,680
I mean, I followed up some of some communism to spread it out and then do a little bit a little bit

1563
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:37,960
I mean, I mean capitalism is is a crime giving a shit about anyone is just an anchor

1564
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:43,160
Human beings are just capitalism is ideal for generating personal wealth. That's well, okay

1565
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:47,400
But I mean, it's totally true that the world has been improved by like the west's

1566
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:52,520
Development of technology and you know, they talk about like the iphone has helped the world

1567
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:58,680
I would say and you know all the technology that's gone in. Well, I mean, yeah, those things did those things did happen under

1568
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:03,800
Capitalism, but I don't think it's fair to deduce that they would not have they could not have happened without it

1569
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:07,640
But but I I mean I 100% think that's fair to say because what what's how would they

1570
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:14,120
They were generated by the profit motive of the people who were working for those companies trying to you know make better

1571
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:17,880
It's not impossible, but like the the reason that works is because

1572
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:22,920
uh each individual comes forward with their own idea and

1573
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:29,560
In the communist society or like where there's less incentive for the people with the good ideas to come forward

1574
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,760
Yeah, um

1575
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:36,360
They would need to be recruited and that just takes a lot of time and a lot of manpower to like find the people who can make

1576
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:38,600
Really good technology. Yeah, I I agree

1577
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:43,000
So like it's just it's just faster to do it capitalist because like people are motivated by the their own

1578
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:45,240
You know the things they can get for themselves

1579
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:50,280
So they will do it and then everybody turns around like oh that guy's doing something cool. Yeah, I agree

1580
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:55,480
Yeah, and I just don't get like but then everyone's poor except the guy who did but that's their problem

1581
01:57:55,560 --> 01:58:00,840
I don't get the argument that people give of like well, you know people can criticize capitalism

1582
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,920
But it's the best we have and nothing else would work and without capitalism

1583
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,640
You know any other system would just devolve into complete and total anarchy and violence and I'm like yeah and your point is

1584
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:15,640
Like is that supposed to be is that supposed to scare me? Is that supposed to be bad?

1585
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:19,000
Jesse I was I was just about to agree with you. I was so close

1586
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:28,280
Uh, like what what what is what is everyone's like what what what is wrong with complete and total anarchy and violence

1587
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:31,480
We haven't tried it in a long time. Maybe it's time to give it a try again

1588
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:35,960
Okay, it's been like thousands and thousands of years since we've had a state of complete and total anarchy

1589
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,200
Maybe it's time to give it another go

1590
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,760
Maybe it'll work

1591
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:47,240
We we have had a lot of practice with a post-apocalyptic media to get used to the idea of a fucked up world

1592
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,720
Where you just have to fight and kill and bite people

1593
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,800
So many things that are issues and problems would not be problems in life

1594
01:58:56,040 --> 01:59:00,920
If just one change one simple change make violence legal. That's it

1595
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:06,360
That's all you have to do if violence in all forms was legalized. There would be no problems in life

1596
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:08,600
Life would be a happy stroll through a field

1597
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:14,280
You gotta move to new los angeles city my friends. Yeah, he's right. He's right. They're your people. They're waiting for you there

1598
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,520
I mean, this is what I am come come join us in the slide. I warm more and more every day to anarcho capitalism

1599
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:26,680
It just seems like it's a real good plan. Uh, I see I think if you ben if you mother fucker

1600
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:34,920
Violate the non-aggression principle on me my privately contracted nuclear device will be headed to your domicile

1601
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:42,680
At you know at the fastest speed that my slave soldiers can make it go, uh, you know indentured servants

1602
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:46,920
I pay them is the appeal is Nate is the appeal tell me honestly

1603
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:52,280
Is the appeal of capitalism that under capitalism under like under anarcho capitalism?

1604
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:56,120
That you get to daydream that you could one day be

1605
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:00,280
At the top. Is that the appeal? I feel like that's the appeal for a lot of people

1606
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:05,400
I think that that there is definitely a strong appeal. Well, it's like protecting the quote unquote american dream

1607
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:09,640
Which is to like make it yourself, uh, you don't have to like rely on other people to help you

1608
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:13,560
And then also that you've acquired, you know a decent amount of wealth

1609
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:17,320
I don't think most even I think it's possible. I could get rich

1610
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:19,000
I think it's pretty unlikely for me

1611
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:25,320
But I do think I could carve out a pretty decent middle-class survival for myself in my life. I don't need to be at the top

1612
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,480
I'll be happy with that. I just want to be Han Solo shooting a guy under the table. That's all I want

1613
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,560
I want all of us to be free to kill each other

1614
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,120
I mean, I didn't

1615
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:38,120
Because you know, it's fair to say if you if you really are into capitalism, you're definitely

1616
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:44,520
De-prioritizing like like fairness because I straight up don't believe in free will and people are born different

1617
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:48,120
And that's not fair. It's not fair that people just are born different

1618
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:52,600
So it makes sense to just even the playing field so everyone has an equally good experience of life

1619
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:59,320
But that is fair. But we but we don't have an equal experience of life because capitalism rewards those with capital

1620
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:03,560
And people are born with differing amounts of capital based on the families. They're born

1621
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:05,960
I couldn't agree more. But what's the solution?

1622
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:10,040
The only way that anything is ever going to be fair. Don't let people inherit wealth

1623
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:15,640
Obviously, don't let people be billionaires. Why would we why would we punish people who raise?

1624
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:20,200
Who like work really hard and acquire money to pass on to their children so they will have an advantage

1625
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:24,360
No, my my children are not inheriting my wealth. No matter what I will be buried with it

1626
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:27,960
I I don't want I want my children to grow up poor

1627
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:33,480
So they have a sense of values instilled in them or a sense of complete mental insanity and fucking mental illness instilled in them

1628
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:35,240
One of the others said for that

1629
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:40,600
Nate, how is it a how is it a punishment? How is it a punishment to mr. Smith?

1630
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:45,960
That smith that mr. Smith jr. Doesn't get to well, I'll tell you how Ben

1631
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:51,240
I think a lot of people uh, the reason why they are trying to amass wealth is so that specifically

1632
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:57,160
They can kind of pass on their wealth to maybe it's about protecting their legacy and it's wrong and it's wrong

1633
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,280
And it's literally the the the argument for you know

1634
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,760
Passing on wealth depends on what you mean by wrong

1635
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:06,440
If if my father was wealthy then it's my birthright to inherit that wealth

1636
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:13,240
But then isn't it all of our birthright to be born free with the freedom of killing each other and beating each other up

1637
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:15,080
And doing whatever we want

1638
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:21,480
Nate, I don't understand how you can sit stand there and be like oh under cap capitalism is the best system because

1639
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:25,640
Everyone has the saint everyone has a fair shot at making it at making it big

1640
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:30,840
Yeah, and then turn around and be like yeah, but people should be able to inherit wealth from their parents

1641
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:36,680
They didn't earn I'll tell you I'll tell you exactly how bad because one of the one of the big components here is just freedom

1642
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,560
And if we're gonna say that it's people aren't allowed to do with their money what they want

1643
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:45,720
Which includes giving it to their kids or helping them or whatever then I mean

1644
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:49,240
That's a huge invasion of like their personal freedoms

1645
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:52,520
And maybe you think it's best to just do away with it, but you know

1646
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:58,280
I just think these two ideas are completely at all. I agree. There are conflicts for sure. Listen. Listen. Listen. Okay

1647
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,280
Human beings need motivation to do a good job

1648
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:07,880
My grandma told me like back in her day back in the world wars and back when communism was the thing in the thin air

1649
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,200
A lot of people you know had to do a job because they were told to do a job

1650
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:18,360
But like a lot of the jobs were done poorly and a lot of like let's say construction work and bricklaying stuff like that

1651
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:23,240
Was sloppy and the nation suffered because no one wanted to do the job

1652
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:28,040
And they would still got paid the same amount whether or not they did a good job or they just did the job

1653
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:33,400
So I'm gonna jump with them in the end no motivation. No need to do a good job

1654
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:40,360
So and everyone suffered for it for it. Yeah, that's you know, that reminds me of mine

1655
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:44,600
I don't see how that's different when when when there's like life currently like that's how

1656
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:51,720
Like how many how many people like do office workers now do like nobody fucking cares about their job. No one's motivated

1657
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:59,400
People will hate their jobs. I mean most people will hate their jobs

1658
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:03,320
But the thing is like there is still a sliver of a chance that like they'll get a raise

1659
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:08,760
They'll be promoted. They'll do something better. They might they might get a different job at some point

1660
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:13,640
Like maybe maybe it's a stepping stone in their career. There are options. There are possibilities

1661
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:17,720
But when when when you're stuck in one job and no matter what you do

1662
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:21,480
You're still gonna have the job in the end of the day because someone has to do the job

1663
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,480
You're not motivated to do shit. So long as you're there and you're punching the hours

1664
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,320
Is

1665
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:32,920
There was the the bad guy that's life for most people listen the bad guy in the movie the musical

1666
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,400
1776 who is the bad guy said this and he's a he's a conservative

1667
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:39,800
You know like right wing guy and he is the bad guy

1668
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:44,440
Nonetheless, I think his point gets to the heart of the matter here and he just says

1669
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:51,560
Uh something like most people would rather die like whatever. He's he's lecturing john adams and why john adams is wrong

1670
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:53,720
and what he says is um

1671
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,800
Like most people would rather die

1672
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,400
Uh fighting against like being

1673
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:06,280
God damn it. I forget what the point is he said like people poor people don't want to they want to protect the possibility

1674
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:13,960
Of becoming rich rather than face the reality of being poor or something like that and that like that's why they support like whatever

1675
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,480
Property rights and stuff like that. Okay

1676
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:22,680
Um, so so like what it talks about is people want hope and people want to feel

1677
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:26,280
Autonomous and when you do something like you institute a top-down

1678
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:29,000
System where you've like slotted everyone into a thing

1679
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:35,240
I think goes to mages point of like it just makes people unhopeful and unmotivated and that's why it slows down

1680
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:41,240
Productivity and that makes the whole world worse. It definitely does less to exacerbate

1681
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:46,680
Disparities but at the cost of dragging the entire like gdp if you want to think of it that way down

1682
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:50,120
And you know, it's just a question if you think that's better or worse

1683
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:55,480
Uh, and what problem you're trying to solve at that time? I think I just think that you

1684
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:56,920
I don't know about any of that

1685
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:04,520
You shouldn't you shouldn't extol the virtues of freedom at all if your idea of freedom comes with any caveats whatsoever

1686
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:08,280
Well, that's silly because no, it's all or nothing every

1687
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:11,960
Either you're allowed to do everything or else you believe not real

1688
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:15,960
You don't really believe in freedom if you believe that i'm not allowed to kill you and take all your money

1689
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:21,400
I mean, you're correct. I don't believe that that should be allowed. So I don't believe in absolute freedom

1690
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:30,040
Um, ah, you're all coddled by modern society. Yeah, we're gonna see it for the facade that it truly is

1691
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,520
I'm the only fucking forward thinking

1692
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:38,120
Like who will be motivated to do anything if you if you know that you're just gonna die around are you kidding?

1693
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:41,720
Anarchy is nothing but motivation. You're motivated to survive by any means necessary

1694
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:45,640
Someone has something that you need to live you kill that person and you can't fear though

1695
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:48,680
Exactly. I'm gonna I do I live in constant fear anyways

1696
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:53,480
Everybody is living in constant fear anyways fear of having their shit taken away by by people above them

1697
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:58,520
You know, everybody is afraid of getting like uh, you know, like kicked out of their houses or losing their jobs

1698
02:06:58,600 --> 02:06:59,560
That's the same fear

1699
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:04,920
Just why not take that fear that you have for the people above you and just make it fair so that you're afraid of everyone around you at all

1700
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,520
times

1701
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:11,400
We still have like, you know the trust in the system that like maybe if someone screws us over that there's still

1702
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:14,760
A way of making it right but like there's not though

1703
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:19,400
Do you know how expensive lawyers are to fight for what's right if somebody that's with you in the current system

1704
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:23,800
If somebody breaks a law and like hurts you in some way and you try to seek legal help

1705
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:27,640
You're fucked it costs thousands and thousands of dollars if you're poor

1706
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,840
You have no rights as it is if you're poor you already live in anarchy

1707
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:33,400
But with all the rules of fascism it's the worst of both worlds

1708
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:39,240
So you might as well just make everything fair for everybody and destroy all law and destroy all order and have violence be legalized

1709
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,720
Once and for all and fix the fucking world once and for all

1710
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:48,760
I'm like 90 there with you. Jesse. I'm I'm pretty I'm almost there with you. There's okay. Well, let listen

1711
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:54,520
I did not grow up poor, uh, but the the larger factor is I have had very very few

1712
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:59,560
Interactions with the law period you can't go to the fucking cops if you're poor and someone commits a crime against you

1713
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:04,360
If somebody fucks you over and you go to the cops you get fucking singled out and like profiled as a criminal somehow

1714
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,800
I just don't know if that's true. You can't trust the law. It's absolutely true

1715
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:15,240
That sounds it's all bad. It's all the whole system is poison. It needs to be fucking destroyed. That's the difference

1716
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:18,280
I have not lost all faith in the system

1717
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:24,040
And furthermore, I feel strongly that whatever challenges are placed before me by the world

1718
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:29,480
I have the tools and resources to overcome them. I feel that that's how I feel day to day

1719
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:34,520
So that's why I feel resources to overcome them because you were born into those tools and resources

1720
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:39,000
I mean, I mean I've I've been stolen from I've had my house broken into and robbed and I've

1721
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:42,760
And I've gone to the police before to help and the police didn't do fucking jack shit for me

1722
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:46,040
The police have never done shit to help me anytime that I've been the victim of a crime

1723
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,240
A lawyer has never done anything to help me anytime that I've been the victim of a crime without just

1724
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:52,120
Siphoning my money and doing nothing doing jack shit in return

1725
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:55,000
No one has ever helped me legally when I've been the victim of something

1726
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:59,720
So why shouldn't I then also be allowed to go rob someone and get back what was taken for me myself?

1727
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:01,960
Why shouldn't there just be no laws?

1728
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:08,200
Since the laws only apply since justice only applies to people who can afford it or people in higher social strata

1729
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:13,320
Why shouldn't it just did all be destroyed? I mean, what do you want the system ain't perfect? I agree

1730
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:18,440
But I mean, it's been real shit for you. It's been pretty great for me. So who's right? Uh, I don't know

1731
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:24,120
Jesus christ, uh, well, how about this? How about this?

1732
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:26,840
Uh, no more billionaires

1733
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:32,600
Ben, this is the number one fucking thing. I hate about all you fucking make make nobody poor

1734
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:38,520
No more billionaires and nobody has to be poor. What's his name that's skull with the glasses on his face, you know, uh,

1735
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,840
Sean, yeah, Sean. I bet you retweeted this you fat motherfucker

1736
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:52,520
Uh, it says it says, uh, he he's imagine being a billionaire and never once thinking about using your money to help poor people

1737
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:56,760
Oh my god, you're right. How could elon musk have like never thought about that?

1738
02:09:57,080 --> 02:10:01,640
I don't know. Maybe he's thinking about like first of all, that's not hard liquid assets

1739
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:06,200
That's investment in the companies that are currently generating wealth and helping the world

1740
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:12,520
So I I think if you're a billionaire and you're not doing something charitable or philanthropic, you're obviously

1741
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:18,040
How about making the world better by converting gasoline cars into electric cars that's going to help the planet

1742
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:23,000
So there you go. I'm not against elon musk as a person. We're not we're not talking about your corporate assets

1743
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:29,080
We're talking about your personal wealth people have personally owned billions of dollars. Well, that's fucked up

1744
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:34,040
What are they doing with whatever the fuck they want to do with it? That's what they're doing with it. Yeah, they earned it

1745
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:38,920
Yeah, they did fucking earn it ben donald donald donald trump earned that all I hear

1746
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:42,440
All I hear when I hear people doing this is I hear a bunch of fucking losers

1747
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:48,600
Who can't make a buck and then they're crying about people who are better at using the system to generate wealth

1748
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:51,240
That's what I hear and it's embarrassing and pathetic

1749
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:54,920
But what what if you're in a system where the thing that you're good at is no longer viable?

1750
02:10:55,080 --> 02:11:00,040
Maybe the thing I'm good at is killing people and robbing them. Am I supposed to be singled out like that's not viable

1751
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:04,920
That's my talent. Maybe I don't know. I haven't tried it yet. I'd like to see

1752
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:11,720
Well, for many reasons we don't want to do that. I can't believe I cannot I can't believe

1753
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:16,760
You think it's fair that people can have that. Okay, but please understand

1754
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:22,200
I cannot believe that you guys think it's not fair. So we're at an impulse. I don't think it's not fair

1755
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:25,960
I think it's I think it's totally fair that people should be able to have all the wealth in the world

1756
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:29,560
I just also think I should be allowed to throw a mile to have in their corporate windows

1757
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,480
Kill a bunch of people cut their heads off go up to the top floor kill them take their money

1758
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:37,560
Take their gold plated toilet seat take their fucking wife and their fucking jewelry and just

1759
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:43,560
Think about this and a big burlap sack with a dollar sign on it and a fucking hamburger mask and a and a striped

1760
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:47,720
Chail suit and run off and fucking go into a cave in my hideout camp

1761
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:51,800
Like the fucking red dead cowboys and start my own society, baby. Hell. Yeah

1762
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:55,400
Okay, please respond to this however you want to what do you think it?

1763
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:59,240
What do you think is the proportion of people who are currently fabulously rich?

1764
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:04,360
What do you think the proportion of them is that we're born into wealth versus came from nothing?

1765
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:06,840
What do you think I don't know. That's probably quite a few

1766
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:10,520
I don't know probably the majority I would say you think it's probably pretty skewed

1767
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:14,600
You think you think maybe there's a lot more people who are rich now who are born that way

1768
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:19,880
But ben while your focus is on the injustice that some people were just born into these systems

1769
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:26,680
My thought is no one's entitled to anything these children were not entitled to the wealth that they now have and the people who don't have it

1770
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,920
They you know, they're not being there's nothing being taken from them that they should have

1771
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:33,240
It's just that the the rich parents here

1772
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:39,960
Choose what to do with their money in this case support their kids or give them their billions of trillions of whatever dollars

1773
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:45,400
And that's their right. Yeah, which leads to a society that is inherently unfair

1774
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:51,400
But well look tons of societies across the world are terribly unfair. America's pretty great. America's pretty good

1775
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:55,000
What can I do about Saudi Arabia? I can't do anything about Saudi Arabia

1776
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:59,480
What I can do is try to make the world around me a little bit better. I'm I'm I'm here

1777
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:03,080
I'm pointing out a thing like this is unfair and you're like, yeah

1778
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:08,920
What and and what do you want? What do you want? I I would like it to be less

1779
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:14,280
I would like it to be less unfair. I agree. So how about they adopt the american model because it's pretty great

1780
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,640
I'm put I'm taught. I'm pointing at america, Nate. I'm pointing at america that we live in

1781
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:26,200
Your focus is the best country in the world. That's your biggest problem not like the terrible totalitarian nations

1782
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:31,720
The best country in the world. That's correct. The best country in the world. No, no fucking no fucking subsidized health care

1783
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:35,800
No universal health care best country in the world earn earn money pay for health care. It shouldn't be free

1784
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:40,680
All this like how much does college cost in america too much? Don't go get a trade

1785
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:45,400
Best country that's great. Shut up. Yeah, you're an idiot. You're going off on a

1786
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:50,040
harshly defending america being the best country in the world when you don't actually

1787
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:53,320
Like you're just it's not really about that

1788
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:58,840
You're just angry at this. You know what? I really think I'm explaining my point. Am I?

1789
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:05,640
I'm a little I'm a little angry. I mean, I think you're very wrong. I mean, I I have uh, I'm not I think you're very wrong

1790
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:12,360
There you go. I'm not I'm not like the rest of you weak masses adopting other people's philosophies. I've created my own philosophy

1791
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,720
That I call uh anarcho fascism

1792
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:18,040
Where that doesn't make sense

1793
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:23,000
Basically the the way I see it is that the only way that anything will ever be fair for all of us

1794
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:29,240
The only way that human society will ever advance and prosper is if we decide once and for all as a species

1795
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:31,960
Whether we want complete anarchy or complete fascism

1796
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:37,080
One or the other because both of those systems are fair in their own way and everything in between is just a middle man

1797
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:42,280
Is just a compromise a worthless half measure that isn't fair and is never I mean to be fair

1798
02:14:42,280 --> 02:14:44,280
You could just say that you know like

1799
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:50,280
Every system of government that we've ever tried has been some worthless

1800
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:54,920
You know half measure between fascism and anarchy and we just need to decide once and for all

1801
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:58,760
Which one of those fair systems we want to adopt and when we do everything will be fine

1802
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:04,840
Because when when you have anarchy you have perfect freedom and when you have fascism in theory if it's like you don't have

1803
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:08,840
Perfect fascism and anarchism it like if you're talking about gun to your head

1804
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:14,280
Well, Nate you want you want parents to be able to give their kids their wealth like that's you know

1805
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:17,560
We don't want to regulate that so we should unregulate everything

1806
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:22,600
Anarchy because it would be it would be unfair to it would be unfair to tell people what they can do with their money

1807
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:27,960
That's correct. That's correct. Jess. You should you should focus on bringing about like um

1808
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:30,680
Zombie apocalypse, then you'll have anarchy

1809
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:37,800
Well, like I mean, yeah, I mean because like for example in in the judge dread universe one of judge dreads famous catch phrases

1810
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:41,560
Uh is the the price of justice is freedom

1811
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:46,280
Meaning that you know, we sacrifice a little freedom for a little bit of justice and that's how judge dread

1812
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:52,360
Justifies the fascist state that he operates in which I think is a you know a logical justification

1813
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:54,360
if not a totally perfectly sound one

1814
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:55,880
but

1815
02:15:55,880 --> 02:16:01,400
The the basic just you know with anarchy you get freedom and with fascism in theory you get justice and comfort

1816
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:06,600
So we have to decide once and for all whether we want all the comfort and all the justice or all the freedom

1817
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:10,760
We just have to decide one or the other because both I mean, I just would be better than anything we have now

1818
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:15,480
I think that forever people will just debate the nuances of trying to balance those two things and that's where I mean

1819
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,160
This is all hypothetical

1820
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:22,600
Obviously because no one is ever going to adopt my policies because the world is stupid and no one understands how correct I am

1821
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:28,200
But you know, I'm just saying if people were smart then we would decide one way or the other

1822
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:33,640
But we never will so it's all fucking it's all hypothetical and pointless. It's all worthless. Nothing matters

1823
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:35,640
Fair enough

1824
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:42,120
Fair enough, you know when in in Minecraft when I get my house griefed on a server and it feels unfair

1825
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:46,200
They steal my stuff. They steal my diamond pick. That's true anarchy

1826
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:53,160
And so I don't like that. Like, uh, I like to have a locked chest. I like to have a chest I can lock in a

1827
02:16:53,960 --> 02:17:00,360
But then it again, you know, sometimes it's fun to go into someone's house and steal their shit. So, you know, I guess I'm I'm

1828
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:03,960
Uh, I'm I'm politically fluid

1829
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:08,760
I I I I swish to and fro between all all of the things

1830
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:15,160
I don't even necessarily think that you can just arrive on one political philosophy that will just work forever

1831
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:22,280
Like I was saying before I think that like capitalism is good at wealth generation and things like like being more socialist is about

1832
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:26,520
You know, like fairness if like you have to probably cycle between the two

1833
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:28,600
I don't think there's even like a perfect thing you can do

1834
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:34,520
It's just we give up more and more freedoms for the sake of supposed justice because we want to believe that if someone

1835
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:39,400
Wrongs us or commits a crime against us that the system will sort them out and they will face justice

1836
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:44,360
But so many times so often that completely fails us, especially people in lower social strata

1837
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:47,960
That that sense of justice fails you completely and doesn't actually work

1838
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:52,680
So if it doesn't actually work, we need to either make sure that it completely works by taking away all freedom

1839
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:56,120
Or we need to just get rid of it all together by taking away all law

1840
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:59,400
And and having people sort it for themselves letting people kill each other

1841
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:04,680
It can work. It can work to an extent though, right? Like it can work some of the time. I think if it works

1842
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:11,720
I think I think working to an extent isn't good enough. I think it has to either completely work or not be there at all

1843
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:16,280
Yeah, I I feel like that's work for everyone or for people should be free

1844
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:24,280
It's it's it's a ridiculous statement, but it is kind of true that we need like it would be the most fair

1845
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:30,120
The only thing is at the moment why there's like always conflict about it is because

1846
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:35,400
The anarchy is good for the people who have nothing the poor people. Oh, yeah

1847
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:39,000
And the justice the justice is good for the people who have the money. Yeah, that's true

1848
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,080
Anarchy is not anarchy is not good in anarchy. You'll just develop like the very least you'll develop stratified societies

1849
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:48,680
In it like because people will just you know ally and then they'll be able to win

1850
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:50,760
So they'll just do that anyway the way they do now

1851
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,000
You'll you'll just you'll just have I mean you'll just have exactly what we have now

1852
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:58,920
Which is you know people hoarding all the wealth and becoming like, you know forming

1853
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:04,920
Protective societies around themselves and probing themselves up only worse because it'll be unregulated

1854
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:10,680
I uh, I said something a while ago in another. I think it may have been a bonus episode, but I like um

1855
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:12,840
the idea that

1856
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:13,880
humans

1857
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:19,000
As a species have just not evolved to the point where we can deal with the amount of connectivity

1858
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:25,880
We have with one another like we're still pretty tribal and we stay we like to stay in a small amount of you know

1859
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:32,440
Small amount of people we know and we would be happier and easy and better able to deal with life

1860
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,920
If we are all in villages still

1861
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:37,160
but because we're all connected

1862
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:44,840
It's it's you know, we're always fighting because we're always exposed to every other type of person the internet must be destroyed

1863
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:46,920
I definitely believe

1864
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:49,960
That's 10 at one of my philosophy room for a glorious new age

1865
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:52,120
Step one destroy the internet

1866
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:56,520
They say for example and I agree with this that communism works really well for like five people

1867
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:00,680
Because you know them and like you don't mind like helping them out like the people who like need help

1868
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,880
It's like I don't give a fuck about just some dude across the world. Sorry. I don't know you dude

1869
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:09,000
I don't want to give you my money if I knew that guy. I probably wouldn't mind

1870
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:14,120
Um, that's just I I blame my human genetics for that. Um that I you know

1871
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:17,480
We we either need to evolve to be like a strange

1872
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:21,960
Insect hive mind where we're all okay with the amount of people

1873
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:28,200
And we we all like work together inherently or we all need to turn into you know to

1874
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:35,240
Post apocalyptic go in small tribes and small villages again and eat saber tooth uh slime tigers

1875
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:41,320
I just want to set my position right now, which is just that I'm I am not a rich man, but I'm doing fine

1876
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:44,040
I'm surviving and doing okay, but if I

1877
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:49,720
Succeed at my quest in life and become more and more wealthy to the point of you know, like I'm doing very well

1878
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:56,200
Um, and then the people come out and are like, oh now we want to take your money and give it to the people who really need it

1879
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:59,400
I'm gonna be like listen. I earned this. I did this all on my own

1880
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:04,440
I had many advantages growing up that other people didn't have absolutely true, but why should I

1881
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:09,240
Give up what I've earned. Why because I didn't deserve it. I think it would that's fair

1882
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:14,520
What what what what what about that part? What about that part about how you had advantages that other people didn't have?

1883
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:18,600
Well, see there's what about you okay? Here's the thing free will doesn't exist

1884
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:22,760
So it's a matter of what do we do to make the world the best place it can be

1885
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:28,520
But we have to factor in that people need a motivation to do stuff

1886
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:33,160
My motivation is I want to make myself financially real secure

1887
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:39,000
So you so you deserve what you got because you had a head start over other people because

1888
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:40,840
You wouldn't have done it

1889
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:44,280
You wouldn't have done the word deserve is you should not use the word deserve

1890
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:48,680
Deserve is the wrong word because I'm not talking about what anyone deserves. I'm talking about motivation

1891
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:53,560
I'm talking about motivation to do things because if you just if you tell me now that Nate, uh, listen

1892
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:57,640
We're gonna implement hardcore socialism in 10 years all the money you earned by that point

1893
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:00,600
We're just gonna take it then I'll be like, oh great now. I know not to do that now

1894
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:04,360
I know to just relax and play video games. Thank you for letting me know that I shouldn't do this

1895
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:08,440
But if I get cheated well, I don't think you should make well, I don't think you should get nothing

1896
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:14,200
I don't think you shouldn't make money from your hard work. I'm just looking at these

1897
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:20,520
I mean you look at someone who's got 170 billion dollars and like that's wrong

1898
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:27,640
Like yeah, you should you should you should be rewarded for your hard work and for your good ideas and ingenuity

1899
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:34,520
And all and your skills and all this good shit, but like nobody should be rewarded that much. That's an accident

1900
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:36,440
That's the system failing

1901
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:37,240
um

1902
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:44,520
I mean Jeff Bezos hit gold and he developed a system that was disproportionately better than what everybody else was doing

1903
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,400
and

1904
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:49,000
Yeah, and now he commands enough wealth to house like

1905
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:55,480
Half the fucking pop homeless population of america. Ben. It's not like he's not stolen this wealth from anyone

1906
02:22:55,560 --> 02:23:02,840
He just generated it through sales. Yeah, he is not taking anything from anyone. These are willing transactions people are making

1907
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:07,240
He what do you mean? He's not taking it from anyone. It's a zero-sum gain. He has it

1908
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:10,600
That's not how wealth generation works ben

1909
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:17,480
It is it is how wealth generation works as a matter of fact. Okay, so so what so ben you're telling there's only so

1910
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:20,760
Why did the people choose to buy the products available on amazon?

1911
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:25,480
Because they would just want to give their money to jeff bezos or maybe because he was providing value through the service

1912
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:27,320
Maybe that was part of it

1913
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:32,200
You think jeff bezos is like do you do you think he's there like in amazon headquarters?

1914
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:37,560
Like making all these sales and no he built like a system that he deserves to profit off of

1915
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:43,480
No, he doesn't deserve to profit that much. Nobody. Well, I I'm with both of you

1916
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:49,080
I think you're both right and I don't think that you're really that your ideas really contradict each other as much as you think

1917
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:50,440
Because I think

1918
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:53,080
Like you can have a system of capitalism that

1919
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:59,880
Creates itself naturally without being backed up by stupid laws and regulations and bullshit. Like that's my main problem

1920
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:01,880
Like here's my reason number

1921
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:07,400
1517 million why the system has failed and must be destroyed every year

1922
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:12,440
I have to sit down and do my stupid taxes and I have to you know, give the government money

1923
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:18,520
Taxes and amongst people do your taxes. Don't forget. Yeah, and like but like it's complicated and it's annoying

1924
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:23,880
It's a fucking process that I have to go through like fucking homework that the government gives me and if I do it wrong

1925
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:28,120
If I make a mistake they can audit me and destroy my entire life. Why is that fair?

1926
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:33,960
I think like I'm totally fine with the government saying we have the guns. We're going to steal your money every year

1927
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:40,040
That's fine. I understand that I respect that but the fact that I have to do fucking homework and do this complicated

1928
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:44,120
Bullshit and pay a service like turbo tax, you know, like like if I had the money

1929
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:48,040
I wouldn't have to think about it because I could pay someone to do my taxes for me completely

1930
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:51,800
And that's like another reason why like if you just have money then the system works for you

1931
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:56,840
And if you don't have money then you have to do all the annoying fucking grunt work bullshit and homework that they give you

1932
02:24:56,920 --> 02:25:02,760
I would be fine with capitalism if it was natural and made sense if if you have the will to make a billion dollars

1933
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:04,120
Whether by hook or by crook

1934
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:08,920
Even if you have if you just hire a bunch of guys with guns and take over a small village and take everybody's money

1935
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,120
I respect that that's fine. You could be a warlord for all I care

1936
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:13,960
That's fine. You can come and take my money

1937
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:18,040
But if you want to take my taxes every year then have it be like fucking disney's robin hood

1938
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:23,240
Where the fucking cop comes knocks on my door and takes my coins in a coin purse and that's fine with me

1939
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:28,520
Don't make me sit here at my computer and do this stupid fucking homework every year because it's fucking annoying

1940
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:36,040
I I want to say I just want to say I have a consolation but go ahead. I'll say what if what if jeff bezos

1941
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:42,040
We're only allowed to keep we're only allowed to have a hundred million dollars from his amazon mp

1942
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:47,960
From his you know from his his master mining behind the servers that lots of people use and benefit benefit from

1943
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:54,200
What if he were only allowed to have more money than any person could ever possibly need?

1944
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:56,440
What a tragedy that would be. Well, listen

1945
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:02,200
So you you have to acknowledge that you are taking the money that he otherwise would have gotten and so what do you call that?

1946
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:05,080
Is that just distribution? I would call it theft

1947
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:07,800
Uh, but you know, I'm totally fine with capitalism

1948
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:12,040
It's just all the bullshit that comes with it the regulations and laws that I think need to be destroyed

1949
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:14,040
It's just decided that I hate and people that I hate

1950
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:18,840
It's it's theft if it's illegal. So you just make it legal. I hear you and you know what ben

1951
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:21,160
I will give you my grand conciliation on this point

1952
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:23,800
Just as I think it's fair and I think people

1953
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:28,040
Must admit that the the people have inherent

1954
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:33,240
Generally selfish motivations because we're built that way you have to bake that into your system

1955
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:35,800
Which is why I think something like communism like mage was talking about

1956
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:37,880
I just don't think it's gonna work for like

1957
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:42,840
Compelling people like do stuff. You're just just as but as a person who is not rich

1958
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:48,840
Well, I don't understand how you can have empathy or go to bat for people that have

1959
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:53,560
A hundred or a thousand or a million times as much wealth as you do. Why are you?

1960
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:57,480
Why do you want to defend because ben? I have principles. That's why like

1961
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:03,960
Oh, that's right. If you're I don't I don't I don't if your stance is if your stance is capital

1962
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:09,800
Slimes don't bother me be the richer for what it has nothing to do with me. I don't know

1963
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:15,640
I mean, if you can prove that Jeff Bezos is using his money to like ruin the world or you know influence elections

1964
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:18,840
It doesn't matter how he's using it. He doesn't deserve to have that

1965
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:21,880
The word deserve is so loaded with like

1966
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:28,680
Assumptions about you know the way the world shouldn't shouldn't be and I mean, I just don't agree here on wealth

1967
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:32,360
Then we wouldn't have Batman. I mean, he's obviously using his money for good. That's fair

1968
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:36,840
You know what? Let me let me just say this on this point. Okay on this point

1969
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:42,120
Just as I have to I have to accept I think other people should that human beings

1970
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:47,160
Need the proper motivation generally selfish to work and create and do things

1971
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:50,680
I must also even though I don't want to I must accept that

1972
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:52,200
tiny

1973
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,640
P-brained

1974
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:59,560
Baby unprincipled individuals like ben will just get mad and rise up

1975
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:02,680
When they see people with too much wealth, that is a fact

1976
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:07,000
You can't have things too out of balance or people will just get mad

1977
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:09,000
Unfairly they will get mad

1978
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,720
That's the natural order people who have the will collect all the wealth and hoard it until the people at the bottom get fed up

1979
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:17,400
With it and rise up that seems to be the case. Yeah, but the but the problem with the current system

1980
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:21,000
Is that the regulations and the technology and all the fucking surveillance and shit that we have

1981
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:25,400
Is making it harder and harder for the lower class to rise up so that's destroying the natural order

1982
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:28,440
Which is anarchy and violence when necessary

1983
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:31,320
Capitalism only works in anarchy

1984
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:38,680
Nape capitalism, baby. We fucking we outlaw monopolies. We bust trusts. We don't allow like corporate collusion

1985
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:41,080
We like we we don't allow

1986
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:45,400
Power to accumulate in that way. How is any of that any good?

1987
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:51,960
Are you are you saying we shouldn't outlaw monopolies because I don't see a difference in principle between saying between saying

1988
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:58,360
What wait no no no between what's what's the difference in principle between saying one company can't own an entire industry

1989
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:04,520
Versus saying one person can't own like lots of money absurd. Well, I'll tell you Ben. That's very simple

1990
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:09,560
Because you yourself I mean we all acknowledge the roles that monopolies have on the market

1991
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:14,920
It makes a real difference, but you yourself said it doesn't matter how jeff bezos uses his money

1992
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:19,000
Therefore influences the market you said all that matters is that he has

1993
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:24,600
It doesn't matter and it doesn't matter in the sense that him having it is immoral no matter what he does with it

1994
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:31,720
Well, I mean well fine then i'll just finish the point. It's that it matters how like if he does something bad with his acquired wealth

1995
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:35,240
That's bad and we should stop that if he does nothing bad

1996
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:41,960
Then there is no problem. So detect a problem. Well, you're wrong. I think I think it is a problem that he is allowed to have that much

1997
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:47,880
There's nothing you've made no I just think it's self-evident. It's that that's your problem right there. That's your problem

1998
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:52,120
I've been making a case this entire time. You have made no case that just having money is a problem

1999
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:54,600
You've just asserted that you you've made well

2000
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:58,600
I could just as easily say you've made no case that people being allowed to have all the money

2001
02:29:58,600 --> 02:30:03,160
They can they can they can my position does not impose on anyone there for I have no burden of proof

2002
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:06,920
You have to show why is your your position imposes on society as a whole

2003
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:13,080
You allow this incredible wealth disparity. You have to fucking prove it. Fuck you. I think you're wrong. I have to prove

2004
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:16,920
I have to prove and you're saying something is a problem. I make no assumptions

2005
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,840
I just say it's fine as it is. Don't worry about it

2006
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:22,840
That doesn't that doesn't mean anything the fact you're you're saying something's good and I'm saying

2007
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:26,920
No, I'm not. I'm saying it's neutral. I'm saying don't interfere with it. That's my point. That's

2008
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:33,080
That's not what I'm saying. That's not a defense. I have to personally think that it's working well

2009
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:38,680
That doesn't the fact that you're defending the status quo doesn't exempt you for making a case for it

2010
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,400
I mean

2011
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:43,400
What is exactly?

2012
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:48,600
Where'd everyone go? Am I alone there? No. No. No. Okay. I feel like everyone cut out for a second sounded like it

2013
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:52,360
Like what is exactly the status quo because capitalists?

2014
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:56,360
I guess that's your stance Nate as a capitalist. I mean capitalists

2015
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:57,880
like

2016
02:30:57,880 --> 02:31:01,720
Will rat will rally against the idea of socialism

2017
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:09,080
But isn't that already? Well, are we already socialist if we're paying taxes? Yes, that's correct. Yeah, and so you're obviously right

2018
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:13,640
Is the point the point it's about the balance and I you know we can all get carried away here

2019
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:19,400
And as I was saying before I've tried to make it clear that I don't even think that socialist type programs are all bad

2020
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:23,400
Or all need to go away and we need to swing like either 100 socialist capitalists

2021
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:28,600
We should be 100 capitalist that doesn't make sense because there's going to be problems and it's going to cause issues

2022
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:34,360
So I guess I just you know when I see someone saying that we need to be you know way on the other side

2023
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:38,200
Maybe a hundred percent or maybe less. I think well hang on. I don't think that will work

2024
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:42,040
I think I see issues with the way that'll be and I can point out my specific problems

2025
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:44,200
Like you know I have with Ben here

2026
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:48,920
So, you know, I guess that's my point. I just don't want to have to do any more fucking homework

2027
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,840
That's my point. I guess well, I don't think I don't think we should uh, I don't think we should just

2028
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:57,960
Level the playing field and say everyone everyone

2029
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:01,000
No, no no ownership no private ownership

2030
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,760
Everyone gets a fucking

2031
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:09,640
Everyone gets their their canteen of victory gin and victory cigarettes rations and that's and that's and that's what you own

2032
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:14,840
I mean, uh, but I think we should definitely be more socialist than we currently are. How about you?

2033
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:17,880
How about universal health care? How about some fucking?

2034
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:20,680
better fucking

2035
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,280
subsidized

2036
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:23,640
public education

2037
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:27,480
Sounds pretty sounds pretty cool. My opinion. It's to me

2038
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:30,920
It looks like the fact that the government is involved with both of those industries

2039
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:37,480
It's what's drive what's driven prices up so high that they've become unsustainable and sort like that's right

2040
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:43,080
That's ridiculous. Why the college school school doesn't cost what it costs in america in europe

2041
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:45,160
Exactly the problem with the school price in america

2042
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:51,160
The reason that it's gone up so much is because of the dedicated confirmed federal student loans that every student can get

2043
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:55,560
So every college knows there was a huge cash of money guaranteed by the government

2044
02:32:55,720 --> 02:33:00,600
They can then afford to raise excuse me raise their prices and the government will subsidize it

2045
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:03,960
That's what allowed the prices to spike so much since like the 70s

2046
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:09,800
That's been the source of the problem the government intervention. Uh, I mean, that's what I've deducted anyway

2047
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:14,760
I think that's correct. I don't know about how and they don't have that in europe, which is why it's not a problem

2048
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:18,520
But we we do get loans. Well, so like

2049
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:22,120
I mean, it's about the degree I would I would argue

2050
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:23,720
I don't really know about it in europe

2051
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:29,720
But like so so you could say that the problem we could just quote and quote solve it by just paying for these loans

2052
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:33,960
But the prices have already gone up when the real solution is to step backward and say

2053
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:38,040
Whoa, it's these loans that inflated the prices so much that have caused the problem

2054
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:41,400
And caused so much like administrative bloat in colleges across the us

2055
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:46,680
I think the real solution is to step backward and say this doesn't make sense from the start

2056
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:52,680
We should, you know, find a better solution that doesn't cause these kind of effects on the market. Well, well, well, here's a solution

2057
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:56,280
Don't give loans. Just pay people to go to college

2058
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:59,960
Well, we've got to deal with the fact that prices currently have been massively spiked

2059
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:05,080
I don't I don't know what to do about that. Somebody smarter than me needs to weigh in and like how to fix it short-term

2060
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:09,720
My favorite pokemon is bulbasaur. Have we talked about that yet? Have we talked about

2061
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:12,120
We did mention bulbasaur

2062
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:16,760
My first my first mon my first love charmander. I picked charmander

2063
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:20,840
You know the squirtle guy now the war toils my favorite pokemon or he's one of them

2064
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:25,880
You know, I started out as a kid when I was in third grade when pokemon first became a thing

2065
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:30,840
You know back back in the day my my guy was charmander. I was a big charmander boy

2066
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,800
But as I grew as I matured

2067
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:39,240
I uh, I slowly came around to being a bulbasaur boy

2068
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:43,080
Yeah, and I think what what what ultimately changed me

2069
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:46,600
Is even though I was a charmander boy at that time

2070
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:52,840
They had the the jelly jars that had pokemon on them a little jelly and I had as a kid

2071
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:57,480
A bulbasaur jelly jar and you know once the jelly is out you wash them they become glasses

2072
02:34:57,480 --> 02:35:04,120
So all my life did it what flavor what flavor jelly probably strawberry or fucking purple or whatever the fuck

2073
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:10,920
Okay, I was hoping for something green. All right like mint jelly. Whoa. Whoa mint jelly. That's green

2074
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:16,520
Uh, that sounds icky. That sounds like toothpaste basically. But anyways, I had the fucking it does sound gross doesn't you know

2075
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:21,160
I had this I had this little glass that I would drink out of this little bulbasaur glass my whole life

2076
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:23,720
Oh, you know and you know, I guess over time

2077
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:27,080
Me drinking out of that bulbasaur glass every day in my life

2078
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:33,080
It must have gotten into my brain and gotten it wormed its way down my spinal column into my fluids and into my heart

2079
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:35,000
And uh, you know

2080
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,400
That eventually I just said ah, fuck it. I guess I like bulbous or the best because I like my glass

2081
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:41,160
If something happened to that glass

2082
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:44,600
And with all the glass that breaks in my life all the glasses that tip over and shatter

2083
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:49,400
If anything ever happened to that bulbasaur glass that would be it for me. I would be done. You'd never see me again

2084
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:51,960
I'd kill myself. Mm-hmm

2085
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:58,680
I like I like how I left for like a split second because the discord was fucking up and we went from whatever

2086
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:02,680
We were talking about about bulbous or glass. I'm really happy. That makes me happy. Yeah

2087
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:07,400
That's good. It's it's good to be back. And you know ben ben. I felt to be back

2088
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:10,840
I did I did a cheap tactic there, which I shouldn't have done which is just

2089
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:15,960
It was a little I said the thing when I said that I have principles what I should the the real answer there is

2090
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:19,960
We have different ideological priorities. I think is the real

2091
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:26,440
Issue there and I totally get and frankly we're different people. We definitely do. We definitely do and uh

2092
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:29,240
I don't think uh

2093
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:33,640
I don't think you're completely wrong about everything. You're wrong about everything. So there's

2094
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:37,640
I think it's yeah, all right. Our priorities. I think I think we'd agree

2095
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:41,400
Look if somebody laid out like true god-given facts on the matter

2096
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:47,000
I think even just given who we are we'd probably just like maybe get different stuff out of them

2097
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Because that's what people seem to do

2098
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,960
Um, I mean at some point it becomes hard to argue about these things because I mean, I don't know

2099
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:58,840
I don't have like, you know, big fucking national brain

2100
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:02,040
budget

2101
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,960
I mean, there's a lot of there's there's a lot of data you could potentially consult

2102
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:14,440
Yes, to uh to make these decisions and I you know, neither of us have it all in front of us. Maybe I've been straight out like

2103
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:19,800
Oh, yeah, go on. Like oh, look, here's how here's here's what here's what happened to college prices

2104
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:23,080
You know, here's here's what the here's what's what's going on with that

2105
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:27,160
That's just what I've heard from seemingly reliable sources, but I have no data. So, you know

2106
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:30,680
Yeah, I don't I don't know. I don't know why they're

2107
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:37,480
We I mean, it's yeah. Anyway, I mean, I guess that's it. So see people we can we can end this on congenial terms

2108
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:45,320
Obviously, I mean, I guess if we were like politicians and like needed to like make hard decisions on like how to operate the world

2109
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:51,720
I like I guess what I would do is I would like commission studies and try to get like real data that would actually tell me

2110
02:37:52,040 --> 02:37:55,080
What would work best because I just want to know that. Yeah, you know

2111
02:37:55,720 --> 02:38:00,600
You know, it seems it seems like a fool's errand though to like like so much

2112
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:04,360
There's so many people so many bits of data to collect

2113
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
you would never really know

2114
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:11,080
That much about anything ever. I mean people are collecting data

2115
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:18,600
Uh, you know, I mean a lot of a lot of a lot of the people a lot of the people collecting data are doing it with an agenda

2116
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:21,160
Um, and you got to watch out for that

2117
02:38:21,720 --> 02:38:24,280
For sure on both sides on every side

2118
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:33,640
Um, and it's really hard to fucking navigate the maze of uh information and misinformation

2119
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:36,360
That is our modern

2120
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:38,600
And it's so easy to have confirmation bias

2121
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:42,280
Uh, when you just go looking for stuff like, you know, I log into the pcp

2122
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:46,680
I see ben watching all these lefty tuber guys and I want to throw up a little bit

2123
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:49,640
I want to puke but I was I was on a real lefty kick

2124
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:54,360
Uh, for a while a couple maybe like a maybe a month and a half ago or two

2125
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:59,560
I was on it. Yeah fair enough. I just like, you know got real and just got real and got real into shawn for a bit

2126
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:01,880
I tried to I I tried to play

2127
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:04,920
I don't know if it worked. He's okay

2128
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:11,720
Uh, what I was logged into the procrastiners account for like two weeks and all I did was click on like zit popping videos

2129
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:18,200
In the hopes in the hopes that one of you would log on and have to see it too and you'd be like, eww

2130
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:20,920
I'm always seeing

2131
02:39:21,400 --> 02:39:25,240
I'm always seeing Nate's weird asmr. There's just for that animal. Yeah

2132
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:29,480
I log into pcp and I see Nate's weird asmr. You got charar

2133
02:39:30,280 --> 02:39:33,640
Lobster boy mob boss asmr. That's my dude. Yep

2134
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:41,800
And I and then I log off. He's been on a real meat kick lately. He did like level one crook into level 100 boss asmr

2135
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:44,040
Um, what the fuck?

2136
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:50,360
It's a meme. It's the thing that was happening and like I mean year this was a year ago. I guess I I guess I know the meme

2137
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:52,440
I guess I I I'm I mean you might be

2138
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:57,400
But what the fuck does that sound but what the fuck does that sound like I mean

2139
02:39:58,040 --> 02:40:01,160
Question which I guess I could be answered if I went and I watched the video

2140
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:03,160
But I don't know if I want to do more fame

2141
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:09,480
He did pickle rick asmr where he dressed up as pickle rick and was featured on a beauty pies show

2142
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:15,400
Um, because like what the fuck? Um, you know, so you know, he's getting around

2143
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:20,840
That is epic. That is that he's been doing lots of memes. We can all we can all agree on that

2144
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:25,560
Whenever I log on to the procrastinators channel, I try my best to never click on a video

2145
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:29,160
So as to not because I don't want anyone to know. I you know, I feel yeah

2146
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:33,640
I feel yeah, even though it's nothing even though it's like the things I watch aren't even that weird

2147
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:38,440
Oh god. Oh god. I hope I didn't wasn't logged into the pcp when I was watching all those arlo videos

2148
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:42,520
Everyone's gonna see all my arlo videos. This is the history. We'll be out of the closet
