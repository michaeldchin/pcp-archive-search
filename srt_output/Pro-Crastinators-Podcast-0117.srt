00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint, introing for the first time and I got it's such a rush. It's such an adrenaline rush. I can't believe it. I've made it. I made it dad. I'm here and I'm queer and get used to it. And I'm here with Digibro is also here.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh man, I just like moved my beer and it made my mic fall over and I didn't realize it was resting on my beer.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh yeah, and I'm here with Nate Best Guy Ever Bestman.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh man, I just moved my tea and it slightly jostled my microphone arm. What a conundrum this is.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Whoa boy, and there's also The Davoo here. The Davoo from Saturn goes to Saturn.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And whoa, we got fucking Hippocrit here. He's a fucking Hippo boy. He's on the show.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's an honor to finally be on the show.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, all right. We're here and we're talking about, hey, let's talk about how we all just went to the fucking movies together.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Like a bunch of cool, oh wait, nobody else is here. Nobody else is here.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Did you go with you? I'm here. I was there.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, it's only Digi.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can speak for Tom because I know the entire experience he had as I drove him as he now lives with me.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let me quickly look up the Urban Dictionary definition of going to the movies.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, sure. Urban Dictionary of going, Urban Dictionary of two, and Urban Dictionary of the.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just add a plus between those and you got it.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I've just returned back from the harrowing adventure of riding the fucking bus. What a shit show.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Tell us about your bus woes.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ben, I didn't even think you lived that far out of like the center of Boston that it would take like an hour and a half, almost two hours.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I should have probably just gone with my normal route, but I decided to look up the fastest route on my phone,

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which had me jump three different buses, which would have gotten me home fast because I wouldn't have had to like wait hardly at all.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Only one of those buses ran late and missed its connection, so I ended up having to wait around.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So yeah, normally to get into the city, I just have to take the red line and then a quick bus ride to Harvard or Davis Square,

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
which is pretty, it's pretty convenient, but I didn't do that.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How long would that normally take though?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If I, if I time it so I leave like it exactly when I need to be like, like, like so that I'm not waiting for the bus,

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
like half an hour, 35, 40 minutes tops.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Public transportation, ladies and gentlemen.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What the hell are you going to do?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I love public transportation. I am so, I am so overjoyed every day of my life.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Every day of my life, I look up at the stars and I say, thank you, God, that you didn't curse me,

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that you didn't curse me with the modern leprosy that is automobile ownership.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ben, do you remember, do you remember when we were young and we missed the bus?

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There's no public transportation. What we would have to do to get to school, we would have to call a taxi service to dispatch a taxi to us.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I mean, our dad did it so that we'd like learn a lesson.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We could have driven us, but like he wanted us to learn.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Our parents made us do it mostly out of spite.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, it was not spite, it was just so we'd learn, dammit, and I learned, dammit.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Tomato tomato.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I remember one time, one time I missed the bus.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Expensive too.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, and this was the worst, but also it was a little heartwarming at the end.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, shit, spoilers.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So yeah, I missed the bus and I think dad was like, I think I had missed the bus like not long before and dad was pissed that I had missed it like twice in a row.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So he was like, you know, get a fucking taxi.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was like, okay.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So I call the taxi service and I get in and the thing is I, at this point in my life, I was not driving.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So I did not really know the way to the school like by car.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So I get in the taxi and the guy starts driving me and he asks me where the school is and I tell him I'm not sure,

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but I try to give him directions as best I can and I fail and we take multiple wrong turns and we end up driving for like an hour.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
School is like, what, 20 minutes away?

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, something like that.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, so we drive for like an hour and the bill is like $40 at the end.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's like way more than it should have been.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He could have just looked it up.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He could have just looked it up and I don't even have $40 on me.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So we get to the school and he's, he even got mad at me one point.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's like, where's this fucking school, dude?

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Cause like, I don't know why he was mad though because his plan was then to charge me for the whole ride, which he did.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We get to the school and he's like, okay, that'll be like 40 bucks.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I'm like, well, shit, I don't have 40 bucks on me.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It wasn't supposed to be that much.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And he's like, all right, listen, I'll take what you got on you right now and then I'll come to your house when you're out of school.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll come to your house after school and collect the rest.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I'm like, uh, okay.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Little baby Ben's first experience with debt.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, we'll come in and break your legs.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Probably like 16, 17, I'm going to say 17.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So, but anyway, long story short, I get home and it turns out that he did come to our house, but he met our parents and apparently our parents told him to fuck off because, uh,

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Excellent.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, so I did not.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I was, so in the end, I got that's the heartwarming.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He deserves to get told to get some money.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This was before Uber, by the way, for anyone that doesn't know what a taxi is.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was recently in other countries known as Europe and I was, I usually loved public transportation because it's like, you know,

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That from my house, I can walk to the train station.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can go anywhere in London.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I want at all through the trains.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And that's, that's cool.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Um, but I was in like Switzerland, I think, and I had to like, I was going to this film festival on short notice.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was, it was a secret, secret project.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't, don't worry about it.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Um, so I was going to your folks.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Damn.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Um, I talk about it on my Patreon podcast.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, subscribe.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, I'm behind.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm behind on the, on the pay, on the pay podcast for the Hippocrates.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Me too.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So we all Hippo patrons?

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Not me.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Never.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Bitch.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Anyway, um, I mean, I'm in Switzerland and I'm freaking out because I'm scared of different people to me.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And so, and I don't know the language and they don't care about me and it's really late.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And so I'm like, okay, I need to get from Switzerland to France.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Um, because the only airport that's close by is in Switzerland.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's like, you've got to go over the border, uh, through a coach.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And I'm like, how do I, how do I do this?

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't have enough time to like research it beforehand.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I was fumbling around in Switzerland looking at like the train like things and there was no people around.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I had to like smash on, on, on the like little ticket, uh, you know, dispensers.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And it wouldn't go to the place I wanted to go.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So I couldn't get the train.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Was it in English?

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Was it in English?

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
There was an English option, but it just wouldn't go to the place I wanted to go to.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Dude, this is literally like watching someone go through Valley of the Drinks with two flasks.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Like, oh my God.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, it was like the most unprepared I'd ever been.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And at this, in this moment, I was like, public transport is the worst thing of all time.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It doesn't, it doesn't cater to me.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A weirdo foreigner who had not looked up where to go and how to get there beforehand.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Anyway, I, I ended up having to get a taxi, which was like a 45 minute taxi.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
To France from Switzerland?

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, just, just across the border.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's like near the Alps, like little, little border thing there.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I get the, I think...

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Countries are really small over there.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Those are pretty decent size.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I get the, I get the taxi and he's like, yeah, yeah, just, just get in there.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It was really funny having him like fail at trying to like use his like Google voice recognition to input the town that I wanted.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's just funny to see that French people, Swiss people, they have, they have funny problems just like us, just like real people.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hard to believe.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's like being British and then describing going to Europe.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I guess ever since Brexit, we can, and Yuri Hirasawa's opinion, I guess that basically passes now.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, it's like, it's like being Chinese, it's like being Japanese and going to the mainland.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, I guess that's true. I guess that's true.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can only relate to things through Japanese.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The scary ending of public transport and the fact that I had to get a taxi is that it was like 200 euros.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And the guy turned around to me when he got there.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's like $10,000.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah. And he, and he's like, you know, 200 or something.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I was like, okay, here's my car.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And he said, oh, we don't, don't take car.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm a taxi.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I didn't have Europe money.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I didn't expect to be using Europe money.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was expecting to be using a train.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I was expecting to be using my funny car to, to, to beep on like, like public transport.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You, you beep your card. It works everywhere.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was very stressful.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So how'd you get out of that predicament?

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I ran. No, I, he took my card and he did some weird thing.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then I got an email saying money has been taken.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And I was like, oh, okay.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, all right.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So you still had to pay 200?

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think it was like, he doesn't like, this is a thing in Europe that I've noticed a lot of times when I didn't have cash.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They really don't like, like using cards because they can't, you know, if it's cash, then, you know, you can't, the government doesn't know that you have the money.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, sneaky, sneaky is not on record.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So they can do something with it.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They can be sneaky taxes.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because when you, when you run a credit card, there is a charge.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's why like most small businesses will have like a three or $5 minimum and all that.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But like specifically in Europe, people are very, very cash only please all the time.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
To fill your hands with coins during the smallest of exchanges.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Like that, like, like in, like in David Lynch cooking quinoa.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, David Lynch cooking quinoa.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not uncommon for that to happen in America, but only if it's like places run by foreigners.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's true.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There's a burger place, it's run by fucking Americans, but it's small and it's frustrating.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's fucking small business quirks are kind of infuriating.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Wait, wait, you're talking about Burger King small business quirks?

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, I said Burger King.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hippo's memes became reality.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But Yovoo, I don't even work at Burger King.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There it is, there it is.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, memes, meme count one.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can we get an air horn?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can we get a fucking soundboard?

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's all fucking quaint and quirky that they have like fucking like dish towels hung up on the side.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That they have like these weird names like the farm hand, which is a hamburger with ranch on it.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's all nice and quirky.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And that you're in a building that's from the 50s until like you're sitting down waiting for your order

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and then the lady goes, oh yeah, by the way, cash only.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And it's like, goodbye.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't understand how they don't just put that on the fucking door of the place.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I believe they like...

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, I know they post it somewhere, but never prominently enough.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There should be a picture of like an old family from the 1800s saying this must be you.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And so, and like, you know, the fucking, you know, Cole brought me over there because she was so excited about it.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And she didn't even remember that part, packed.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, that's confirmation bias because you're only remembering the times that you failed to notice it.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So those times they failed to post it prominently.

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We show up like a month later, this time with Cash Ready, and you know, we got the food just barely in time.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We got there just before closing at 5.30.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a fucking restaurant that closes at 6.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
On which day of the week was this?

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think it was just a weekday.

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I mean, if it's a lunch place, that's probably reasonable.

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Maybe on a Sunday where things like close early.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Fucking Kevin's Doghouse.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
As much as I love Kevin's Doghouse, and I promoted it so much online,

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that place had the shittest hours in the universe because they were like closed on two days of the week, I think,

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and they opened at like 11 a.m. and closed at 3 p.m.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But then if they didn't have enough customers, they would just close like an entire hour early just because they're like,

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
ah, well, nobody's showing up.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And then me and Victor would get there at like 2.30 and be like, mother fucker!

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's like a 15 minute drive, so it would be frustrating.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
One of the least appealing...

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, sorry, you can go.

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This was really funny.

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was really cathartic.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No, not cathartic.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It was hilarious.

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know what the fuck it was.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
To be sitting there, we sat outside the store because they closed,

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
so it's like, okay, shit, we gotta stand outside at the benches that are outside.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Eating our hamburgers, 6 o'clock happens, the store closes,

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and we watch like half a dozen vehicles pull into the drive-thru,

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and the lady who's like cleaning up like gives them the no signal,

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and they have to like drive away and being like, yeah,

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
maybe don't fucking open a restaurant and close at 6 on a weekday, you morons.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like what?

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
One of the least appealing cities I've ever been to was Richmond, Virginia.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I would only be there for a little bit, like I would stop there between buses and trains and shit,

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and sometimes I would walk around.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Incidentally, the worst place I've ever lived, Richmond, Virginia.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, cool.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Home of the Confederacy, right?

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Right?

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
One of several, probably.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's around there.

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's one point in its favor.

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So, I mean, first of all, the whole thing is a rusted, concrete nightmare,

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
like the downtown area.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's hideous.

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And second of all, I walked around for like an hour on a Saturday,

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and I went into like, you know, stores that normally sold food,

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and like all the restaurants were closed on Saturday,

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
like in the middle of the day on Saturday.

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's a lot of Jews around there.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I doubt it.

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Frankly, I doubt it.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But yeah, everything was closed in the middle of the day on Saturday,

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
like convenience stores, like they were that normally would cook food,

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
their grills were off, they were no longer, they were not cooking,

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
because like there's just nobody around, nobody, no business on Saturdays.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No business on Saturdays.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Which is the opposite of what you would think.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, like if you think one day they were going to operate, it would be then.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Is there some sort of siesta going on, like across town?

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No, I asked the guy, because I was like, hey, are you cooking food?

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And they're like, no, the grill's off.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I was like, why is everything closed?

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And he's like, there's just no business on Saturdays.

259
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I was like, well, this city must be in a bad way.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Must be in a bad way.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Must be the internet.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Everyone's ordering their burgers online now.

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I guess so.

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Ben, I'm gonna ask, what was the total cost of your travel

265
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
to and from the theater today?

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It would have been less if I had taken the normal route.

267
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It was maybe like $7 or $8?

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay, so next time, I think as of you saying that just now,

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I am never driving into Boston again.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Did you have to pay to park?

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I always have to pay to park.

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, that's where the, yeah, no.

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I never think about it.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't do it.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because what happens is I look up the amount of time it will take,

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and I think, oh, well, I have a car, so I can just drive in.

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It'll only be half an hour, as opposed to 45 minutes to an hour.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then I never, until I get there, do I remember, oh yeah,

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm gonna have to pay for parking if this is anywhere exciting.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And the way they structure the hours everywhere in Boston is fucked,

281
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
because it's basically like zero, it'll be like 15 minutes is the lowest amount,

282
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and that'll be like $10, and then it'll be like 15 to 30 minutes,

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
30 to an hour, an hour to an hour and a half,

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
an hour and a half to two, two to two and a half,

285
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and then if it's after two and a half, it's just like some astronomical amount.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Who's gonna park for 15 minutes?

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I know, I know.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Who's got the kind of business to be done?

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And a parking lot that's built into a movie theater.

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So we had all said that we were gonna show up at the theater,

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the movie was at $12.55, so we were like, let's all show up at $12.30.

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I get there at $12.34, and it's like, if you're under two hours,

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
the maximum that they charge you is $14,

295
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
but as soon as you're over two and a half hours,

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it's just a flat $28 for the rest of the day, or $24 or something like that.

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So of course, I'm like, well, we've showed up 30 minutes early,

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and it's a two hour, like, you know, two hour, 10 minute movie,

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
so yeah, I had to pay.

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's why the PCP is recording quite late today,

301
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
because once I had cleared that two and a half hours,

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I was like, well, we're in town, I'm not gonna fucking leave

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and spend $28 without getting some food with my friends here,

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
so yeah, that was the logic.

305
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I guess this is like, it's a fucking,

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I've never done a lot of city living myself,

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
but you're really just paying for the convenience of having a car

308
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and being able to drive it around the city,

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
they're trying to discourage that, it almost seems like.

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not even, yeah, and it's not worth it,

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
because part of why we got our house where we did

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
is that it is within reach of public transit.

313
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We deliberately didn't refuse to get a place

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that was too far away to make it into the city.

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's just that I've never used public transit in my life,

316
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
because this is the first time I've lived anywhere that has

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
even remotely reasonable public transit,

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
so I'm not used to it.

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's nothing better than living on the red line.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You live on the red line, you're all set.

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, we live on the red line.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
While we're on this public transportation,

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the only experiences I'd ever had with public transportation,

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
because Ben and I grew up in a rural area

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
where there was nothing there,

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and then when I moved, when I went to college in New Jersey,

327
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
there were trains and buses,

328
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but I would only use them when absolutely necessary,

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and it seemed extremely poorly optimized,

330
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and there weren't the kind of apps that there are today

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that let you track buses, locations, and times and stuff,

332
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
which are a godsend for this kind of stuff,

333
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
because there have been so many times,

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I've been just fucked by buses, just not showing up

335
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
when I was in college.

336
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But when I was in Tokyo, it was just the end of my college days.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It was just a hard left turn

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
to just the greatest train system in the world,

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and it was unbelievably great,

340
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and Boston is also not too shabby at all.

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Boston's amazing because it stops everywhere.

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Every fucking 10 feet, there's another T stop,

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and the thing is that in order to get to the T from my place,

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I would have to drive two minutes to the place,

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and so to me, it's like,

346
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
well, if I'm going to be using my car anyways,

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
why don't I just drive into the city?

348
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And then, of course, I always forget how expensive parking is

349
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
until I get there.

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And now, today, I am cutting that off.

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm excising this cancer from my life.

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
All right.

353
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, yes.

354
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm definitely addicted to the autonomy that my car gives me,

355
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but I've also just got no other option.

356
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I am too, but I use the car constantly in town,

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and that's fine.

358
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Like, where I live, which nobody please say,

359
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but where I live is very dense and interconnected,

360
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and using the car is like using the T in Boston.

361
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's so easy to get around with a car here that it's like,

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it's fucking mega convenient.

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But yeah, if you're going into Boston,

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the thing is, even if you take public transit,

365
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
yeah, that takes longer,

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but the traffic is always so fucked that even if you drive,

367
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
it's going to take just as long anyways,

368
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
because it's definitely going to take longer than it says it is.

369
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
One downside is that Boston closes kind of early,

370
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and I think on most days, the T stops running around like one.

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like, I think of the last trains are like one, one, eight.

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, well, I'm not going to probably do much

373
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
that would keep me in Boston.

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I wish they went later, but you know what, it's all right.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I mean, that just means like everything just closes at one,

376
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
because that's when the trains stop running.

377
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
As amazing as public transit is in Japan,

378
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think at like midnight, they fucking stop.

379
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, they shut down at midnight and restarted 5 a.m.,

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
which is okay.

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But you know what, speaking of public transit,

382
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I just wanted to say my last thought on this

383
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
is that there's been some interesting developments

384
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in Slime City.

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Looks like some kind of transit system.

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee.

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, some kind of transit system.

388
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Some kind of transit system has become back online,

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and I'm really all interested.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Serving all your public transportation needs,

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
now you can go from West Glockesbury to Assault Beach,

392
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
or Assault Flats Beach Resort,

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Lickety Split.

394
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This has been a message from the

395
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
New Los Angeles City Board of Tourism.

396
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Join my fucking Discord, assholes.

397
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't wrap my little head around it.

398
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's too much.

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There's too many chats,

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and I don't know what to do.

401
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, for you there are,

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
because if you're a mod,

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
if you have mod, then you see like all like 30 different,

404
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
all like 35 different zones.

405
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But otherwise, you just see the one you're in,

406
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and it's a little more manageable.

407
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sorry about that.

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Whoever's editing this, could you edit out

409
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
that I said I'm the mayor?

410
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm hypocrite.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm not the mayor of that place.

412
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's just a hearsay.

413
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's just a little dream of mine, actually.

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There you go.

415
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is the mayor the same thing as the Lord of Ghosts?

416
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, the Lord of Ghosts was elected mayor.

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In a Democratic election that overturned the status quo,

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and threw New Los Angeles City into a dark age

419
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the likes of which have never been seen before.

420
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's true.

421
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He got upgraded to the Lord Mayor of Ghosts.

422
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, yes.

423
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, that was cooler than being a Lord Mayor.

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Much to all of our detriment.

425
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Except for being a fewer president king.

426
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
A fewer president king, yeah.

427
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Which is...

428
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Ben, have you seen Full Metal Alchemist?

429
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you remember that the guy...

431
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The fewer king Bradley.

432
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, but no, fewer president king Bradley,

433
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
except that King is just his first name.

434
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Which is very confusing.

435
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I thought his title was Fear of King the whole time.

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, I knew his name was King.

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I didn't know that he was...

439
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
How can you be a fewer and a president?

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Those things are not the same.

441
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
His name is Fear of President King Bradley.

442
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't remember him being president.

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
His name is King Bradley.

444
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I remember him being Fear.

445
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I remember him calling him Fear of King Bradley.

446
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well, this is in the Japanese version of Brotherhood, at least.

447
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Okay, well, I watched the English dub of Not Brotherhood

448
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
of the original animated series.

449
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And in that one, they just say Fear of King Bradley.

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And I just thought his title was Fear of King,

451
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
which made perfect sense.

452
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Frankly, I think you're fully shit, Digi.

453
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think that he's just Fear of King Bradley.

454
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, I fucking remember the subtitles

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and I was laughing every single time

456
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I saw Fear of President King Bradley.

457
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Ben, remember that boot?

458
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay, way back in the day, Ben and I acquired

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
an illicit copy, an illicit copy

460
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
before all of FMA had come out in America.

461
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I bought a DVD of...

462
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It was like translated to Chinese

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and then translated from Chinese to English

464
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
by a non-native English speaker.

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It was incredible.

466
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It was incredible.

467
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No, you know what it is.

468
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Those were always Babelfish.

469
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, sure, sure.

470
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Winry.

471
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Somehow, the way that they transliterated Winry's name

472
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
had a fucking X in it.

473
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay, that's true, but that wasn't even just it.

474
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
In every single episode,

475
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Gluttony was Blatney.

476
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's how they translated that.

477
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And Winry's name was different every episode.

478
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It was a different name.

479
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
There's some mix of stuff going on here.

480
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay, did it have the phrase Ohio State

481
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
in there randomly a whole bunch?

482
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I don't remember.

483
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
When you translate the English word O, like OH,

484
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
through Babelfish back and forth,

485
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
it becomes Ohio State.

486
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And one time I watched an illicit copy

487
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
of the Death Note Live Action movie,

488
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and that kept popping up,

489
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and that's how I knew it was Babelfish

490
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
that they used to translate it.

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
This was before I knew anything about computers and shit,

492
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
but I'm sure that it was what we're talking about.

493
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
There were online translations were done or something,

494
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
because there was all kinds of characters

495
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
stuck in there in weird places and stuff.

496
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Did you buy this DVDs from one of these

497
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
random Chinatown stores?

498
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This one was actually straight up from eBay.

499
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This was from eBay, I remember buying it.

500
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Did I guys ever tell you guys about

501
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
illegal and really weirdly fucked up DVDs

502
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
me and my family bought and watched

503
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
when we were in Africa?

504
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Ooh, that sounds interesting,

505
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but no, I don't think so.

506
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Well, we drove into the city one time,

507
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
the city of Kampala in Uganda,

508
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and fuck, the idea of really slow traffic,

509
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
really gassy air, went to a grocery store,

510
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and when we get back to our car,

511
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
we're sort of like behind the store,

512
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and there's a guy on a motorcycle

513
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
with a big like duffel bag type of thing

514
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
filled with those little paper sleeve DVDs.

515
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Filled with them.

516
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
As far as I can tell, this is like 80%

517
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
of what the third world is.

518
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's just guys selling bootleg DVDs

519
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
behind stores.

520
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Go on, go on.

521
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The collection was comparable

522
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
to those Walmart $5 DVD bins,

523
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
where it's like, wow, it's a giant bin,

524
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but the giantness of the bin is just to obfuscate

525
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
the fact that it's the same movies over and over again,

526
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
but there's more variety.

527
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But what we started noticing, and again,

528
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
they were all in those like paper sleeves,

529
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
is that some of them had errors on the printing.

530
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not like they were hand drawn.

531
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They were actually like professionally printed.

532
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They were just, okay, so, okay,

533
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
it had the mid-90s live action version

534
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
of Disney's 101 malations.

535
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And it was the right font, malations.

536
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Everything was correct.

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The font was exactly as the actual poster is,

538
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but it was just 101 malations.

539
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Something hit on wrong.

540
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We just assumed, okay, so every time there's a printing error,

541
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
they ship it to the third world, makes sense, right?

542
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, okay.

543
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How do you get that printing error?

544
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
How do you get an error where it's just the wrong letter?

545
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean, one way is that you just have like foreigners,

546
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
people who don't speak English,

547
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
like hastily typing out these things

548
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and just resell them quickly

549
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
on the black market in one day.

550
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I imagine that these printings happen in like factories, right?

551
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Don't they just mass produce the DVDs?

552
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Like how the fuck are you...

553
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's a hell of a typo to me.

554
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's a shame that I didn't...

555
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's a hell of a thing not to spell check.

556
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I never got on a podcast sooner

557
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
because I did, I know I've forgotten

558
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
about plenty of the typos that I saw,

559
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but there's a lot of various things

560
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
about these disks that I remember.

561
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So like we went home and started watching them

562
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and I don't remember what movie it was

563
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
where we first saw this, but halfway through the movie,

564
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
like we just started seeing like black orbs

565
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
appear at the bottom of the screen,

566
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
like the movie was being eaten away.

567
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Is this a creepypasta?

568
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
No, no, it's just it's people's heads in the theater.

569
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah, does Ben drown in this story?

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
There was live filmings of...

571
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah.

572
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Were the black orbs hyper realistic?

573
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It was just the shape of people's heads

574
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
because it was people's heads.

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So that's the issue right there.

576
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What had been done is these people had filmed theaters

577
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
with people, you know, these were secondhand filmings

578
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and then they printed these sleeves

579
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and put them on DVDs and sold them on mass.

580
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Not all of them were like that.

581
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Some of them were, some of them weren't.

582
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It was really weird how that works.

583
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm quite familiar with these because of the fact that

584
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
my dad, for whatever reason,

585
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
in spite of the fact that my dad was very

586
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
against us torrenting movies

587
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
because of it being illegal,

588
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
he nonetheless would buy

589
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
the vast majority of his movies from

590
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
a guy who would sell bootleg

591
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
movies out of the back of his car

592
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and also bootleg suits.

593
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This dude would just come to the dealership

594
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
my dad works at and just sell suits

595
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and DVDs and just random stolen

596
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and or bootleg shit.

597
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And he would sell these for $3 a pop

598
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and I'm like, Dad,

599
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
if you want to buy an illegal movie,

600
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
you can get it for free through torrenting

601
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
as opposed to paying $3 for it.

602
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Is your dad just like, feels better

603
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
spending some amount of money as opposed to nothing?

604
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well, I just don't see it as untraceable.

605
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Well, I just don't see it as untraceable.

606
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So, it's interesting that

607
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
because like,

608
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I mean, Dad's buying

609
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
illegal stuff but like

610
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
not having a problem with it because my dad

611
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
occasionally he would come

612
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
with like a hard drive

613
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and he says he knows a guy

614
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
who I also know who he is.

615
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He's not like a secret guy.

616
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He's not even like a criminal.

617
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
He's just like a normal person and he's like

618
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
he'll just like have a

619
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
huge amount of like

620
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
newly released films

621
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
on a hard drive

622
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
or like a big lot of music.

623
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You know, just give it to my dad

624
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and you know, dad would be like, yeah,

625
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
got all these movies now.

626
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
He had a Plex account that he just has

627
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
like he had his own server and he would upload

628
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
like insane amounts of movies

629
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and shows and shit to his

630
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Plex server and then just give the

631
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
information to all of his friends

632
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
so we could all just access the server and watch

633
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
whatever. That's fascinating. It's pretty cool.

634
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
When I went to college, they had

635
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
like the thing in place where like we're on campus.

636
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
They shut it down so you can't torrent.

637
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
They like close that down. But what we did

638
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
have, I forget the name of it, there was

639
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
an in-house torrent or operation

640
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
running where on the local network

641
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
of the school, the College of New Jersey

642
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
FYI, it's been shut down

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
tragically now, but there was something

644
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and I knew the people who were running it.

645
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Wait, the college has or the network has?

646
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Select students at the school

647
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
ran a network

648
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
on the school network.

649
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There was a border set up so that you couldn't

650
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
torrent outside of

651
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
within the school, but what you could do

652
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
is someone could set up a server within that network

653
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
on the campus and then

654
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
people, if they had access to that thing

655
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
you could download from those people

656
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and it always struck me similar to

657
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
the scan-lating crowd, it's like

658
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
who are these heroes

659
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
who just make it their hobby or their job

660
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to make these things

661
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
accessible to the rest of us.

662
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I was in a scan-lating group for a while.

663
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Scan-lating is one thing.

664
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
People can't read that, you got to translate it.

665
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But even beyond that, just these people

666
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
who want to just get movies

667
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and just hold them on a hard drive

668
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
what's in it for them?

669
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Being able to talk for my friend

670
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Donsan being able to talk about the stuff.

671
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Could I literally get pussy

672
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
by doing this? Is that what I want?

673
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I think I could.

674
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You easily could if that's what you're going for.

675
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
My friend Donsan was really into pussy.

676
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
He just wanted to talk about these movies

677
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
with his friends.

678
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If you're in a community of

679
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
piraters or scan-laters or what have you

680
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
it's a thing.

681
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's the same reason people do the coordinate harassment online.

682
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You accrue social capital

683
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
in whatever context

684
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
you're working in.

685
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It gives you a fucking vain and cheap sense of purpose.

686
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's the same reason that people send death threats.

687
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's pretty comparable I'd say.

688
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What?

689
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm saying it's a pastime

690
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
like any other.

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You spend your time in it with people

692
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and you form bonds of camaraderie

693
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and you build social capital and everyone

694
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
it's great.

695
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's just a way to

696
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
not just that but also for me

697
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
when I got into scan-lation

698
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and I was just doing proof reading so like

699
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
basically

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't know what that was about.

701
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What he's trying to say is that

702
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
that same kind of social capital

703
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
is why people form hate groups online.

704
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
People on the internet

705
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
are bored and have no sense of purpose.

706
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
They'll do fucking anything that gives them affirmation.

707
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You won't get any pussy at all

708
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
from just telling someone to kill themselves online.

709
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Unless you've got a girl

710
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
sitting right next to you

711
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and it's like a rape group

712
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
well

713
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
you know?

714
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Do you mean a rape list

715
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
like on Dick's website?

716
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah.

717
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Just maintain a rape list.

718
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah. That's true.

719
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Turn my rape list guys. Here's the link.

720
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
By the way I did have more things to say about

721
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Ugandan bootleg DVDs

722
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
but I don't know if it's that funny

723
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
but I don't know.

724
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Go for it dude.

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Just go for it.

726
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What does that mean?

727
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Well I guess

728
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
if you have a word document that at the top says

729
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
women to rape

730
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is it too rape?

731
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Is it have been raped?

732
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What metrics

733
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
are we tracking?

734
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I believe that the

735
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
8chan threading question literally just said

736
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
rape list and then just was pictures of women.

737
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Well there you go.

738
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
There you go.

739
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't know what a rape list exactly is

740
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
but we're going to find out

741
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
in this episode of the Procrastin's podcast.

742
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh boy.

743
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're tackling the hard questions.

744
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
This one video game you

745
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
should not 100%

746
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Incidentally

747
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
that guy who made the rape list eventually found

748
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
out about what it had caused and apologized to Dick.

749
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah I heard about that.

750
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I heard about that.

751
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Davoo tell us more about Ugandan Knuckles please.

752
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah.

753
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Well

754
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
okay there is

755
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
for whatever reason

756
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
even though I've never actually seen all of

757
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
the Lion King from start to finish

758
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I just never got the ground to it

759
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
more of I've seen the Lion King 2

760
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
for some reason we just decided to buy from this little

761
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
double bag the Lion King 3.

762
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh okay.

763
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Speaking of the Lion King

764
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Speaking of the Lion King

765
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
today we were watching Princess Mononoke

766
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and Kaze leans over to me and she's like

767
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
this song is exactly like that song from

768
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
the Lion King and I'm like

769
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
which song from the Lion King

770
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and she's like

771
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
you know the Lion King

772
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
song and I'm like

773
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
so I don't know what she's talking about

774
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
so I say

775
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm not that familiar with Lion King

776
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
it was my least favorite Disney movie as a kid

777
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
because I don't like animals

778
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and she just stares at me and goes

779
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
fuck you

780
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Wait what song was she talking about?

781
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I don't know

782
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I was thinking about

783
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I was thinking about all the songs and Princess Mononoke

784
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
it was some background music

785
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
it was some background music

786
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
there might have been some background noise

787
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm not sure

788
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
remember when Mufasa's ghost

789
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
comes and gives Simba guidance and shit

790
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and there's all that mysterious

791
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ambiance music and he's like I am your father

792
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
yeah there might be something there

793
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
same voice actor actually

794
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Jamesville Jones that's right

795
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I didn't even intend that

796
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I was just saying that

797
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
so if you ever want to know

798
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
how the third movie after Princess Mononoke

799
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Lion King 3 Return of Simba

800
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
we're in Africa

801
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
we're super bored we'll never find a way

802
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
we'll just watch some DVDs

803
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
this movie takes place in Africa

804
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
so it was probably pretty appropriate

805
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
you'll never find a Dway

806
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
here's what happened

807
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
we put in the movie

808
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Memes Counter 2 Airhorn

809
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
we did it first

810
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the Lion King 3 Return of Simba

811
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
uh oh

812
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's The Flower of Oz

813
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
which is a 2D animated movie

814
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
about the lion

815
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
the cowardly lion and his

816
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
side story before he found the yellow brick road

817
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
funnily enough I had actually seen that

818
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
movie before but it was well I guess I'm watching it again

819
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
so after I watched it

820
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I can confirm that the Lion King 3 is not

821
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
a movie that exists

822
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
whoa that's fascinating

823
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
they had one and a half

824
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
there's Lion King 2 Simba's Pride

825
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and then there's Lion King 1 and a half

826
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I was going to say where did Simba go

827
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
that he needed to come back

828
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
apparently outside of North America

829
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
it is known as the Lion King 3 Hakuna Matata

830
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
oh okay

831
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
this was not called Hakuna Matata

832
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
it was advertised with like

833
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you know um I think it was actually just

834
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
the uh the stuff that was

835
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
the Lion King 2 where it's like scars like

836
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
sun or whatever the fuck like that

837
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
so it's just the Lion King 2 that's what it was advertising

838
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
by the way just FYI that is

839
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
canonically not Scar's son

840
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
you know the guy who looks exactly like Scar

841
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
in every way and clearly should just be his son

842
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
canonically he is just another lion

843
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
no relation

844
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
don't worry it'll be tough when I tell you what happened

845
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
when we looked at the you know at the sleeve

846
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
so we're like okay so

847
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
the logo clearly says the Lion King 3

848
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
but then I look at it for like

849
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
more than a second and I realize

850
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I mean I would have noticed this as an adult

851
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
probably but as a kid I didn't notice it

852
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
the actual cover art

853
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
is the Lion of Oz

854
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
it has the Cowardly Lion in 2D animation

855
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and like the girl that he meets

856
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and I'm like oh so it's

857
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
the Lion of Oz cover art but with the Lion King 3

858
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
logo

859
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and then I flip it back right I look at the back

860
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
of the sleeve and it's got

861
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
um it's got like the new

862
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Lion King 2 characters with that

863
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
okay I typed Lion of Oz

864
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
into Google and I completely

865
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
appreciate why this would be

866
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
mistaken for the Lion King

867
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it looks like Simba he looks like Simba I can see him here

868
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean he looks like Simba but also

869
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
kind of looks like the art style for that one

870
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
fucking animation that inspired the E meme

871
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
yeah I mean

872
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
the white lion or whatever his name is

873
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I mean this is like

874
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I mean yeah the fonts and the character design

875
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
this is like the equivalent of like

876
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
you know what's that company

877
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
that does all the like

878
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the rib off what it is

879
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
rat a toying in little panda fighter

880
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
what do you mean like

881
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I can't remember the name of that company

882
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
they did snakes on a train

883
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
oh god

884
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and they also made Sharknado but like it's not

885
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the asylum

886
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that's a great people

887
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but dude on the back of the sleeve

888
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
it shows like the new

889
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the new young hipster

890
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
snake on a train

891
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and the other

892
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
the other Lion King characters right

893
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
the back of the sleeve shows Lion King art

894
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
and it has a back of the blurb

895
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
right has like a blurb on the back

896
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
for the Lion King 3 right blurb says

897
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
what

898
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
happened to the cowardly lion

899
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
before he found the yellow brick road

900
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and I was like oh

901
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
they just somehow

902
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
like

903
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
mashed up two different movies like completely

904
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
in every possible way

905
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
we also had this

906
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
we also had like a DVD this was like a DVD

907
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
in a plastic case for Cheaper by the Dozen

908
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
if you know that movie

909
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
is that the one with Steve Martin

910
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
yeah it was funny though

911
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
is that you know how like the back of DVDs

912
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
will have lots of symbols like the rating symbol

913
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
or like the MPAA symbol

914
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
this DVD just had like all the symbols on it

915
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
which row after row

916
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
after row after row of like every possible

917
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
symbol and it even had multiple

918
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ratings it had an R rating

919
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
a PG rating and a G rating

920
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and it was really weird

921
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
it depends on which subtitle track you chose

922
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
man there was lots of weird things

923
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I probably could have like just made a whole podcast

924
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
just recounting these memories but

925
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
we also thought like these

926
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
hang on, hang on

927
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
did you just post an image and I have a problem

928
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
with it

929
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
we're not an image podcast you guys

930
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Kermit is a frog

931
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and then Fuzzy Bear is a bear

932
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
none of the three in the middle at the bottom there

933
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
they're not mouses

934
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
show notes link I guess

935
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
please

936
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
this reminds me of

937
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
a phenomenon that I don't know

938
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
if any of you will be familiar with

939
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
but are any of you familiar with a

940
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
genre I guess called

941
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Pooh's Adventures of

942
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
what?

943
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
a genre of Pooh's Adventures

944
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
it is called Pooh's Adventures of

945
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
or Pooh's Adventures of X

946
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and it is a

947
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
okay I think it was popular maybe

948
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
a decade ago or a little less

949
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
like it enjoyed a brief surge

950
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
like a weird surge in popularity of lots

951
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
of people doing it and like a little community

952
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
kind of like the fucking

953
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
pony analysis community it was like

954
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
this little niche community of people all doing

955
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
the same thing and what they were doing

956
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
was taking footage

957
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
from Winnie the Pooh

958
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
movies and splicing

959
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
them into other Disney movies

960
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
or games or like

961
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
footage from Disney World Rides or just anything

962
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
or

963
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
they didn't have to just be Pooh but mostly it was Pooh

964
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
whatever they would take these other characters

965
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
or Pooh characters and splice them into

966
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
other movies and make it a movie

967
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
about Pooh experiencing

968
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
the story of the Lion King

969
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
or Snow White

970
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
or like some fucking

971
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
point and click Disney CD-ROM adventure

972
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
or something

973
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I want to see one of these

974
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I will

975
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
how long would one of these be

976
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
like how long would this be

977
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
like the length of the full movie

978
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
but longer because there's Winnie the Pooh footage

979
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
who is in there

980
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
it's like a

981
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Pooh character reacting to

982
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
anything

983
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that happens

984
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
yeah

985
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and it's like the idea is just

986
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
making it

987
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
yeah

988
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
this

989
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
no look this is a really deep

990
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
rabbit hole actually

991
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and like it bears more

992
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
explaining

993
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I can't do it justice on a podcast

994
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
there's a

995
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
there's more to it

996
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
there's more to it

997
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
there's wikis or there were wikis

998
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
where people where there would be

999
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
there were character lists

1000
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and people would have to basically

1001
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
people would jockey for the

1002
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
rights to use certain sets of

1003
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
character and like two groups were not

1004
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
allowed to use the same character like one

1005
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
character would be claimed by one group

1006
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
who is enforcing

1007
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
the claims here

1008
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
it's just a zeitgeist I guess

1009
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I googled Pooh's Adventures of

1010
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
what I'm finding is like all these movie

1011
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
covers and then like it's like a

1012
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Toy Story 3 cover and then just like

1013
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it is filled with like characters

1014
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
from like other cartoon properties

1015
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
like Pooh and I don't know

1016
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
the fucking Looney Tunes and

1017
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Gronk you know

1018
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't

1019
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm pulling up the Pooh's Adventures wiki

1020
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
oh my god there's like a hundred of them

1021
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
oh no there's more

1022
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
there's more like

1023
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I love me some way of the Pooh

1024
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
how convincingly made are they

1025
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
they're not like okay

1026
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
like the Pooh

1027
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
segments will just have no sound and just

1028
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
have like some

1029
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
badly fonted some badly

1030
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
typeset text over it

1031
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
are there any good ones

1032
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
no it's sincere like

1033
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
they'll take the silent Pooh footage

1034
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and put it in and put

1035
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
some text at the bottom

1036
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
giving them a new line as though

1037
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Pooh is saying like wow

1038
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Maleficent sure is a scary witch or something

1039
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
you cannot be understated

1040
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
when Nate said that it's like

1041
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
movie posters with a shitload of characters

1042
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it's like a hundred characters every poster

1043
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm seeing Pooh's Adventures of Freddy

1044
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
got fingered with like some

1045
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
like Dr. Phil, Barney, Panty and Stockings

1046
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
some of them are probably tongue and cheek

1047
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
some of them are probably tongue and cheek

1048
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
like especially the later ones

1049
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
but many of them are sincere

1050
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
this is fascinating

1051
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
my question is Ben

1052
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
are there any good ones

1053
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
was anything good ever made

1054
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I will

1055
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
there is this little cabal

1056
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
or there was this little

1057
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
cabal of four dudes

1058
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
they were headed by this guy

1059
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
called Benny the Beast

1060
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and there were a couple other ones

1061
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
whose names escaped me

1062
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
it doesn't matter

1063
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
but they were called Lion King Heart Fantasy Films

1064
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and they evolved the format

1065
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
much like

1066
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
much like all of us evolved and grew

1067
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
outside of the bounds of Pony Analysis

1068
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
they too

1069
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
these

1070
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
sort of

1071
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
these guys

1072
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
they were doing Pooh's Adventures

1073
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and they would do other adventures

1074
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
they did like a snow whatever

1075
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
eventually they started inserting their OCs

1076
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
into it as well

1077
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and then eventually

1078
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
they started making movies that were just

1079
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
about their OCs in other movies

1080
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
are those good

1081
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
no but they are more

1082
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
interesting because these are like

1083
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
these are like specific people

1084
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and I mean

1085
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
okay I dug into this a while

1086
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
back

1087
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and I had

1088
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
okay

1089
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
the saga of Lion King Heart

1090
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Fantasy Films is kind of

1091
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
okay

1092
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I want to talk more

1093
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I want to talk more about it in the future

1094
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I feel like I'm not prepared to

1095
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
a lot of info about it

1096
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Ben stop doing comics

1097
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
stop doing physics

1098
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
stop doing anything just become a full time

1099
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
internet level six bottom of the iceberg

1100
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
researcher and make of

1101
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
lectures please

1102
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I would be happy with that

1103
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
there are plenty of people who do that already

1104
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
this is gonna

1105
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
this will have to be in the show notes

1106
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
this image I just shared because

1107
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I can't stop staring at it

1108
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
it's blowing my fucking mind

1109
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
so this is

1110
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Mintchi33's

1111
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Anti-Poo's Adventures

1112
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
team

1113
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and it's just an image of

1114
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
like 12 characters this person likes

1115
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
but what's really fascinating about it

1116
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
is that it's the most girl internet

1117
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
thing I've ever seen

1118
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
it's like all either

1119
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
really obscure old western cartoons

1120
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
or

1121
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
some of it's like Winx Club and shit

1122
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
and then there's like a bunch of pre-care characters

1123
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and a common writer character mixed in

1124
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and like

1125
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I just

1126
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm trying to picture

1127
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
someone who even knows

1128
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
this is exactly like that scene

1129
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
in Tales gets trolled where they do the group pose

1130
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and they all get like the

1131
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
the title like you shadow the awesome

1132
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
the emo the annoying etc etc

1133
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
that's what this is

1134
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm just really

1135
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I read that as the brain

1136
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
that some one person has this set

1137
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
of characters they like because it's so

1138
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
weird and diverse

1139
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I mean this is just everything

1140
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
from everything they've seen

1141
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
this is a kid and this is all of their shows

1142
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I haven't even seen some of this stuff like what the hell is the damn

1143
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
elephant thing from

1144
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Mumfy

1145
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I'm not familiar with Mumfy

1146
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Im not familiar with Pam

1147
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
so in the middle

1148
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
of the video

1149
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
is this

1150
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
one like

1151
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Akari Sakura

1152
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
is apparently from JullBett

1153
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
he's a long running

1154
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
running little girls show that not a whole lot of people

1155
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
know

1156
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,880
Doesn't look like it's along the lines of like pre-cure and shit like it airs in that kind of time slot

1157
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,040
So you oh wait no, I'm looking at common. You really should look

1158
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Right or I'm really curious

1159
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,140
The common writer would probably be like she has a brother and she's seen common writer

1160
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,920
I mean common writer wizard is yes, it's it's an entire series

1161
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:57,480
He is the main character of common writer wizard, which was the the 2012 common writer show Wow

1162
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,600
I wonder if this person

1163
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,520
Like actually lives in ship because like common writer airs again in the same block as pre-cure

1164
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,160
And I think Jullepet might be there too

1165
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,040
So it's possible that she just like watches this whole block every morning. Also. Do you like that?

1166
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,480
Do you like the fucking Cinderella is the stealth expert?

1167
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Appropriate at all

1168
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,600
That like transformation is that the logic? I don't understand

1169
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,880
Well, she has tiny feet. Oh for sneak in right?

1170
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,320
No, she has tiny feet dude

1171
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,560
That's why she wears tiny slippers that don't fit any of the other maidens and the king make sense make sense

1172
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,200
Still and she's got her fairy godmother that can like turn vegetables into things for her. Yeah, that's good

1173
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,800
Um, I don't have enough information about Vivian to figure out where she's from

1174
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,640
I don't

1175
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Guys we're going down a rabbit hole here

1176
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,880
I mean this talking about I mean I could we could probably go on a talk

1177
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,160
We could probably go on to discuss poofs adventures of indefinitely. There's there's no shortage. That's true

1178
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,160
There's just they're just they just never end

1179
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,960
They just get better and better. Well speaking of crazy funny things that are very makes me laugh a lot

1180
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,400
I have a topic to bring forth

1181
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,600
I have just very recently

1182
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,480
I would have said like within ten minutes of record the starting to record this episode

1183
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,080
We had to wait a while as there's more like 40 minutes

1184
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,720
But I just finished watching the very last episode of Tim and Eric's awesome show. Oh hell. Yes hell

1185
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,600
Yes, even I haven't watched every episode. That's awesome. I

1186
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,160
Enjoy Tim and Eric. It's good. They make me laugh. Have you seen the billion dollar movie? Oh

1187
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,680
I haven't yet. Oh, that's the billion dollar movie. They're like to

1188
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,440
Horses

1189
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Running in the way

1190
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,640
Always thought about keg and phantom when I heard two horses. There's still time. There's still time horses

1191
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,400
The thing I haven't actually got yeah, we got to work that in soon soon work that into the max revive agreed

1192
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:12,320
But like I was I was watching it and it's like some parts aren't that funny some parts don't really land

1193
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,040
That's like all of it really gives me a lot of funny ideas

1194
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:22,960
Like I I really want to crank it like put a staple my green screen to the wall and just do silly faces

1195
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:30,040
I just I just really want to do that and I have the ability. Yeah, this is sort of like inspiration

1196
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,960
comedy like because I've always loved like

1197
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,400
You know the goofy the goofy stuff. I sometimes get bogged down when writing scripts

1198
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,840
That I have to like make the jokes be smart or have something to do with something and I

1199
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,720
I'm watching Tim and Eric. I realize I don't have to I can go back to my roots

1200
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,680
I can go back to my YouTube poop days and see and see all of this this

1201
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,220
It's it, you know, it's it's based on some sort of observation

1202
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,600
So it sort of makes sense, but it is like

1203
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,780
It's just really creative and I love it

1204
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:10,020
But I feel I feel so like into making film

1205
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:16,260
Right now. Yeah having having finished, you know, what I what I love about Tim and Eric is that even though I?

1206
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,020
Didn't really watch it at all growing up because it was like too much for me

1207
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,500
Every show they did

1208
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:30,860
The stuff in it is just so fucking out there that something will just like get into your subconscious at some point like I can remember

1209
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,140
Like I only ever saw a few episodes of Tom goes to the mayor and a few episodes of Tim and Eric

1210
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,180
But from each of them I have like it like vivid memories of like one line

1211
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Like in the first episode of Tom goes to the mayor

1212
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,060
I just remember good Tom Brady got his kiosk

1213
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,540
Things were finally looking up for him and that's it

1214
00:51:53,540 --> 00:52:00,100
I never I never really liked Tom goes to the mayor and so I didn't check it. I didn't really get into

1215
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,060
A awesome show when it aired but then at some point someone showed me billion dollar movie

1216
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,500
And I really liked it and I was like, hmm. Maybe I maybe I wrote Tim and Tim and Eric style off too soon

1217
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,220
I wonder it. Sorry. It's just it's okay. Whoever just linked to this

1218
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,460
Davoo linked part of this comment doesn't need to be in the show nose

1219
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,140
This is like a like we I think we've talked about this before

1220
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:28,740
But it reminded me of the new storyteller and I'm wondering what a lecture could be done on the new storyteller

1221
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,740
If there is enough that would be

1222
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:38,060
The great that would be like the biggest fucking research dump ever though. So, okay, what I linked though

1223
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,380
You'd have to watch a lot. Yeah, so

1224
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,620
Do we have to talk about more images? I mean, that's just not the whole time you guys were talked about all this giant

1225
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:53,740
Collision I was not do don't look at me scrolling through my deep my Twitter to find this this old gem

1226
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,860
I found I'll just read you one pass. Okay. I'm gonna read one of the panels

1227
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,660
Here is the panel. I'm gonna read it in the way. It's lined up

1228
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:08,660
Sunset shimmer says any ideas Brock. Why don't we could split up and look for the green genie that way

1229
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,580
Thomas as in the tank engine point taking Brock

1230
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,380
Sunset shimmer do Susie and autumn ride with swindle Ellie you Amanda Mindy and Sally search the parks

1231
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,300
We'll meet back at Pioneer Square Square Ellie says, okay

1232
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,100
So it's a bunch of Thomas the tank engine characters some magical girl characters

1233
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:34,940
I don't recognize MS paint modified some transformers Brock from Pokemon Sunset shimmer and the fucking

1234
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:41,500
The fucking parrot from a lab. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The magical girls are all from ojimaja Dora me

1235
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:47,460
Okay, heavily modified their mermaids right now. Oh, there's also Jackie from fucking cyber chase in there

1236
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,500
Yeah, I wish I was like I allowed myself to

1237
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:59,020
Express myself this freely, you know, this this thing. I know what you mean. This is this is Chris Chan

1238
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,060
I look at this and I think this looks like solitude to me. It's with the same

1239
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,220
I feel that same that same like

1240
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:11,460
yearning for like just doing something on this level without worrying about myself image, but I

1241
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,460
Yeah, the thing is I think that if any of us tried this, it would actually be amazing. Yeah

1242
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,460
I

1243
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,460
This is competence. I mean like we all thought that when the only rise tails gets trolled

1244
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,260
It sounded like the greatest story ever told. Yeah

1245
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
the

1246
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:37,580
Yeah, no like hippo if you just fucking took all these fucking magical girls and transformers and Thomas the tank engines

1247
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,940
Combine them into a into a gripping narrative. I mean hell

1248
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:45,940
Well, remember that comic that fucking Gibb did with like twilight and you know remember that thing

1249
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,340
Oh

1250
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:56,220
Yeah, that was like one of the first deviant art things in my in my my little pony drawing of ponies career

1251
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,940
Which lasted like a year or something a really funny interesting fascinating and also ultimately tragic

1252
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:10,940
Case of one of these kinds of creators who's actually good at their medium is elvin earthworm with his creation of Super Mario Bros

1253
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:17,100
It was a Z. Oh, he was back. Is he how are things going? Oh, no, this is the problem. So yeah, wow

1254
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:24,940
Dude who didn't he yeah, yeah, dude who yeah made one of the it was in the height of the sprite animation on Newgrounds phase

1255
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,940
And he was the best one

1256
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:33,620
He just took Mario and Luigi super star saga sprites sonic advanced sprites and DBC sound effects and a million people were doing that

1257
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:39,580
But what was unique about elvin earthworm is that he's actually like he got really good at animation

1258
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:45,660
Yep, it had a really it has a great cinematic a style a lot of punch and it's just just as a quick aside

1259
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,660
Just a quick aside. I have a rant about like

1260
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,220
This and also various other things like Minecraft animations that I've seen in a similar in a similar way

1261
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:00,140
It's my problem with the the thing the reason I never liked it was because it's sprites

1262
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,860
But it's animated in flash and the sprites don't

1263
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,140
conform to a grid they they move

1264
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:13,400
Diagonally and it looks terrible and I hate it. Oh, yeah, it's cute. It's quaint. I

1265
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,520
Agree, I agree. I mean that does bother me, but like

1266
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:23,660
Considering the kind of like this is this is like Newgrounds like early naughty. I mean, yeah

1267
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:29,620
So it's just like as a kid. I see stuff like that and I it was just you know it

1268
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,900
Well with Minecraft animations, there's a similar thing where instead of like animating pixel

1269
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,700
Movements they have like a jut like a mouth jutting out like in the in the Minecraft model

1270
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,700
Like it's supposed to be his fate his head is supposed to be a square, but of course

1271
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,340
They don't do that

1272
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:54,740
They they made models so that they could have movable lips and teeth and stuff and it juts out in a way that would not work

1273
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,580
I mean, you know does not conform to the size of the pixels in the game

1274
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,220
And it just sort of annoys me because it's like you're breaking the rules

1275
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,740
It's not mine when I'm watching Minecraft porn

1276
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:09,180
It really pulls me out of the experience when she's got like clearly defined triangle exists and shit like that's really that's not

1277
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,340
Come on that doesn't exist that's not a real thing. No, well, they have they have cuboid somebody

1278
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,100
Has to be cubes I agree

1279
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,900
Hey, Tim and I continue unless DeVue is gonna finish this. Oh, yeah

1280
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:35,980
The tragedy of Alvin earthworm is that because he takes his shit seriously, right?

1281
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,700
Which is great because it gives it gives super marabrosi and in sincerity you couldn't you couldn't imitate the problem

1282
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,140
Is that he's worried about it's like quality consistent consistency?

1283
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:52,980
So he finally came back after like a three-year hiatus his plan was to remake the show rather than just continue it

1284
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,980
And his plan was also to have like a total of 45 episodes each out of 15 like 350

1285
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,620
episodes yeah

1286
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,500
Considering it was taking him a year to make each one

1287
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,620
It's like you're not gonna finish it obviously and like even 10 years ago

1288
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,220
I even PMed him saying like I think that's too many episodes

1289
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:14,940
You should stop at 15 because 15 was gonna be end of this one arc and like sure the point is that every episode is more

1290
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,780
Bombastic and fast in at 15 that'll be the perfect level

1291
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:24,140
He really should have come back and made episode 9 and just made five more episodes after that that would have been done

1292
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:28,020
He would have been finished, but he wanted to go back and remake episode one

1293
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,940
That's a mistake. Yeah

1294
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:39,140
Stuff makes me really sad like he really they have such such like talent, but they overdo it instead of instead of well

1295
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,860
It's not even like that

1296
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:46,020
You know the man spend their time making something that isn't like their own original IP

1297
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:51,940
Yeah, like to to not have like I don't know. Yeah, just the fucking

1298
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,580
Trapped in f**king giga-paws

1299
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:03,340
Look dude, this is not your magnum opus. Yeah, it's not yeah

1300
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,740
Yeah, and then like he did the remake of episode one

1301
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,820
I believe three years ago, and he hasn't continued it since so I mean

1302
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:16,940
Yeah, I just think a good really like never you don't redo stuff like don't redo anything

1303
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,220
Why would you ever waste your time finish it and then do it better next time?

1304
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,820
This is my whole remake things

1305
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:30,100
Why would you ever waste your fucking time remaking something that already exists when you just make something new and the reason is so that you can

1306
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,340
Sell things with like that same name, but Alvin ain't making no fucking money on this shit

1307
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,460
So just finish your goddamn series and move on

1308
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:42,700
So like you can just make the same like you can just make a different version of the same thing like

1309
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,460
some people I

1310
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,220
read this review of

1311
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:53,580
Princess Mononoke that was in like an old magazine where this guy was accusing it of just like being the same thing as

1312
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,580
Naska but like but with less heart or something

1313
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:04,620
To me that's just like that be a meme of like heart and no heart anyone know this okay nevermind sorry

1314
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:11,060
To me it was like well the thing about Naska is that it is not a functional film

1315
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,780
Like the original manga is is amazing and I mean the movies still holds up and is really entertaining

1316
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:22,180
But like as telling the story that the that the manga was trying to tell it falls entirely

1317
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:28,620
Flat of doing that whereas Princess Mononoke was just like let's take all those themes and all the stuff that I care about

1318
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:34,380
Me being Hayao Miyazaki and be like let's make a movie out of that

1319
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,180
You know so like something that functions completely and coherently as a film

1320
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,420
And then he hasn't had to tackle those themes again because he he did it you know he just

1321
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,820
Made it something that made more sense in film form

1322
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,380
Yeah, and it's as a film it is way better than the Naska movie

1323
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,900
You know and I granted I would you know the Naska manga is also great

1324
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,020
I would even say Mononoke just by being tight and

1325
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,660
Perfectly crafted is in many ways better than the Naska manga even if it's not as broad sure but like

1326
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,580
It's just like yeah

1327
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,940
You could just take these concepts and do something better considered instead of literally

1328
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,300
Recreating the same thing with better graphics because that doesn't add anything to the meaning

1329
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,780
Graphics if you're fucking modern alphadream

1330
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,620
It would that yeah, that's true

1331
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,100
Significantly worse graphics

1332
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:29,540
You know like the the conundrum of the author or of the of the creator of any medium

1333
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,540
Who's just like you know you're making your thing you look back like you're an Andrew Hussie or whoever and you're like man

1334
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:39,140
My early stuff man like I'm writing that I'm doing the same series for so long

1335
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,780
Oh, I don't really like that beginning. I gotta fix that. I gotta fix that

1336
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:49,900
What what a terrible ends like we just have to fight against that it's it's a and I know what that feels like too

1337
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:56,540
I know what that feels like to I've always hated that which is why like I have made a point aside from like one or two

1338
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:04,220
Yeah, but very clearly. Yeah, I should get rid of I always try to keep every video. I have live

1339
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:08,740
So the people can see like where I came from and I trust that they have

1340
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:15,100
You know the mental capacity to understand that it's an old video and if they do get upset then I don't have to worry about it

1341
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,900
Because there's hopefully with regard. I mean about for me

1342
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,780
I feel like maybe I don't get that as much like with my comics

1343
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:28,500
I'm thinking of because like when I finish a comic I feel I look at it and I think oh my god

1344
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,820
What a disaster it sucks sure. I hate it

1345
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:38,780
I want to be done with it and never think about it again. So I actually feel very I don't I don't feel the urge to read

1346
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:44,340
I think that it sucks, but I don't feel the urge to redo it. I feel the urge to to throw it away and

1347
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,860
Never come and then get it as far away from me as possible

1348
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,420
I feel the same way you know

1349
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:54,020
It's like when you take a shit and it's like wow that smells really bad. I want to like be far away from it

1350
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,020
Like that's me with art. Yeah

1351
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:03,540
Like any time an artist like looks at their own work at things like wow my technical abilities are so much greater

1352
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,580
I could recreate this with better technical ability. It's like dude. How much of what you like

1353
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,580
Do you like for its technical?

1354
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,820
Like you know quality like yeah much of what all of us like stuff that is like for me

1355
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:22,900
The answer together in an hour almost yeah, just I think most people are probably I think most people are probably the same

1356
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,700
Even if they don't know did somebody say John Tron I

1357
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,700
I think I think

1358
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,300
Probably more I think a lot of people probably

1359
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,140
Think that like technical ability matters

1360
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:43,100
More than it actually does them. I think they probably are affected less affected by technical ability of a work

1361
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:48,540
Then they maybe think I don't know if you work if your work is not successful

1362
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,300
It's for one of two reasons either at its core

1363
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:59,420
It is not good or you didn't market it enough like I think that if something is good and it fails

1364
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:05,460
It's not because the work wasn't wasn't of a high enough like technical quality

1365
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,980
It's because just the right people didn't find out about it and you just got

1366
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,820
That's kind of part of what I talked about in this how they market it series

1367
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,900
It's something I've fucked up on throughout my whole career is that like I've made stuff

1368
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:25,460
That I just thought like oh nobody's gonna watch it because the lighting is not good

1369
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:31,700
And it's like meanwhile like paranormal activity is like one of the most successful movies of all time the production

1370
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:37,220
It was made on like $2,000 and it looks like shit and most of it is still images of something in the dark

1371
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:42,820
But like it was successful because they put like a well an investor who you know

1372
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,940
So like it was it was made on the shoestring budget and sold to an investor who decided to put it in

1373
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:54,620
Test theaters continually of increasing size and when it got good responses from those test theaters

1374
01:04:54,620 --> 01:05:01,220
He released it wide and eventually made a thousand sequels because like if you can find something profitable that takes no money to make

1375
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:05,820
You were talking about looking at your old stuff and like being afraid of it trying to destroy it

1376
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,740
What one thing I had to go and looked us up to confirm it still true one thing I respect

1377
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:19,300
deeply is that the game theorist's channel still has fully listed and available at the bottom the like

1378
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:25,380
Three or so dozen like clips of young matpat in like high school plays that were

1379
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,740
That were uploaded on the channel before game theory started those are still listed

1380
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:38,500
I don't have the courage to have my videos from 2008 listed the digi brony videos are unlisted

1381
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,520
70% of everything Jesse's ever created has been deleted, but in matpat

1382
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,140
He the king is the spirit of you

1383
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,260
Interrupt his searching at all like

1384
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:58,780
The reason I hid all my pony stuff was that like it was like I had like 10 anime videos

1385
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:03,820
And then an endless sea of pony videos and I was like this is not gonna help me market myself as an anime channel

1386
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:04,700
You know

1387
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,340
Like yeah, and and also YouTube is really weird about like when you

1388
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,420
Relist I don't think this happens necessarily with unlisted videos

1389
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:19,580
But sometimes I've had videos that I originally had unlisted and then I published them and it made them publish as new videos

1390
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,580
Oh, I'm afraid of that happening

1391
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:27,580
And that's why you say those were you say those were originally have they been unlisted the whole time and then you made them public

1392
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:34,460
The the the ones I've seen that happen with yes because I actually take the risk to the public service

1393
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,700
For everybody April Fool's a public service for everybody

1394
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,780
I do you guys watch the creators studio channel on YouTube?

1395
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:46,340
Because it is the thing that we've always wanted of where YouTube directly tells us what they're doing

1396
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:51,540
And I feel like they're oddly unknown among lots of YouTube people, but anyway, they actually just

1397
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:58,060
Yeah, by MKBHD sometimes will mention they just talked about this very issue where yes

1398
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:02,140
If you've had a video unlisted for a long time if you are making it public for the first time

1399
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,820
It will treat it as a new video and then it'll you know do all the things yeah

1400
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:11,820
I mean my pony videos were originally listed so assumably. Yeah, those that have that problem. Yeah. Yeah, but

1401
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,860
Yeah, yeah, I would kind of want to feud with those guys TBH

1402
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,680
I want to feud with them with creative studio

1403
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:25,740
Beef now if you're a PCP fan go leave shitty comments

1404
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:32,200
No, no, no, I don't encourage that at all. No, no, no one's gonna do that. I hope not

1405
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,700
I want to start

1406
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,220
Yeah, yeah, they're all they're all to do it. Here's my here's my

1407
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,500
We tried to start beef with the pizza party podcast like six months ago

1408
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,940
I didn't even we didn't we did not try nearly hard

1409
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,780
Look, this is a real complaint with the with the with this with this channel the creator studio

1410
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,340
I haven't mentioned this up to this point, but here's here's what it is

1411
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:57,020
My complaint is this these people on the channel act as if they have earned the like something like

1412
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:05,260
70,000 subscribers they currently have through like some sort of like skill or like resilience or or where with all of their

1413
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:08,140
Own when these people are the first party

1414
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,900
Publishers of YouTube news

1415
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,860
They are the sole source of what the hell YouTube is doing it like I am contractually

1416
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,020
Obligated as a youtuber to be subscribed to you

1417
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,780
So the fact that these people take joy from like yeah, we're doing so well as a channel. No, fuck you. You didn't earn shit

1418
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:28,780
You are you by the way these gems of information by fucking

1419
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:36,860
It is they think if they think like they've accomplished exact somebody should be legally download them and then reupload them

1420
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,860
And then that should get a

1421
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:44,020
Call to harass their comment sections and like it's farce on this

1422
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:50,220
I think you at some point are going to experience this paradigm shift when you hit a certain level of popularity

1423
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:56,660
And a certain level of fan base because as it is your fan base is pretty well curated of only people who kind of get it

1424
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,760
But if you intend to get like one

1425
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:05,760
Like degree more popular where like what would you call an order of magnitude more successful?

1426
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:12,880
You're gonna have several ghettos full of morons who support you and now you know how I can avoid that

1427
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:19,320
What I have a I have a lot more patience for interacting with people now because

1428
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,480
It used to be that all of it frustrated me

1429
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,520
But now I realized that like

1430
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:33,520
Almost everyone who like comes at anybody online. There's only two reasons. They would do it either. They're ignorant

1431
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:40,920
They either they either don't actually know what you're doing or they are just like dumb and like they think what you're doing is bad

1432
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,960
But if you explained it to them, they'll realize well, hang on Digi

1433
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,840
That's assuming that you could never do anything wrong on your own

1434
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,960
You didn't point out that you might legitimately be doing something wrong that is

1435
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,760
Something wrong. That's fine. You can attack me for it. I would deserve that

1436
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,320
But like what I'm saying is that like I used to just see people who were

1437
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:08,720
Misunderstanding me or something or or talking shit and my thing was to just complain about it, but not respond

1438
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:13,240
And now my policy is if someone like shits on me on Twitter

1439
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,160
always respond because

1440
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,800
Nine times out of ten they just misunderstood something

1441
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:27,000
That's also kind of why Digi bro versus everybody exists because like right right most of the arguments are like someone comes on and like tries to argue

1442
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,560
With me and I'm like, oh, well, that's not actually my stance. This is my stance and they go

1443
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,120
Oh, well, then we agree and I go. Yeah, you would have known that if you knew my stance

1444
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,160
But because you had assumed something else

1445
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,480
You didn't know that

1446
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:46,760
So like and they always end amicably like I haven't had a single argument on there that like ended in a shit fit, you know

1447
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,360
So I just think it's a better way to resolve things

1448
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:56,600
So when people have their fan base that gets out of control, it's because they don't respond to it

1449
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:02,080
They don't interact with it. Yeah, like, you know, I mean, I just generally agree with that

1450
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:08,560
And that's why I think that the format on your Digi bro versus everybody is is like a smart way because when you get someone in the call

1451
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,320
To actually make their arguments about whatever it is

1452
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,240
They really have to like present something of substance or else they look like right

1453
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,480
But the problem is that happen like people come in and I say like what's your argument?

1454
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,360
They're like this and then I'm like, well, why do you think that and then they're like, oh shit

1455
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,200
I didn't realize that I don't even know like the last episode. I did someone was like talking about

1456
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:38,160
Oh, your content has changed blah blah blah and I was like, what about my content has changed and the dude had like no real answer

1457
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,680
And I was like, well, I mean if anything's changed

1458
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,600
I mean, I've changed as a person so it might be that he was like, oh, I didn't think about it that way

1459
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,440
I mean, the only thing about this I think is that this can't possibly like compensate for like all viewers

1460
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,320
Like I'm not sure how much it could sway like public opinion

1461
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,640
Did you like I was saying like like yeah, you're saying oh, I'll have to interact with the community when it's like it's big enough

1462
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:06,120
That's basically what I'm saying the paradigm shift is going to be there's gonna be a moment where there's like more things

1463
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:14,080
You have to watch yourself before you say I remember the last time this happened was when it was your most boring taste in anime

1464
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,480
Vlog which wouldn't have been a problem to anyone at all

1465
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:23,080
except for the fact that you name dropped a fucking anime every day and

1466
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,920
There was this sudden reaction see what I what I should have done is after he made his video

1467
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,920
I should have like

1468
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,720
Called him up. I was deeply frustrated

1469
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,280
You didn't just like address it directly and you just let the narrative sort of die there

1470
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:44,000
That's the thing like I I used to get so frustrated that people were not understanding my point

1471
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,720
And I'd be like that's their fault and now I'm just a lot more patient to just like not stop the argument until they get it

1472
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,520
And I think it's just I'm a big believer. I'm a big believer in the idea that like

1473
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,800
The I'm a bit I guess I'm a big death of the author guy

1474
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:07,600
And I think that whatever whatever a viewer takes away from a work of art is is the meaning to them and like can the conveyance of meaning is

1475
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:13,040
The author's responsibility and if something other than what was intended is is conveyed to the reader

1476
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,840
Yeah, it's not the reader's fault. I don't think it's ever the reader's fault for misunderstanding

1477
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,120
I kind of under I kind of agree, but I also feel like

1478
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,240
I feel as though it's easy enough for you to just follow up

1479
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:32,280
Like if the reader doesn't get it then just tell them what you meant and a lot of the times they'll go

1480
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,360
Oh now I get it. Yeah, I see it happens to me every day

1481
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:42,760
No, I'm arguing with what I've been doing lately is just like dropping these super spicy hot takes on Twitter

1482
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:48,480
And then getting like shitloads of responses and then I just argue with all of them until they

1483
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:54,280
Acquiesce basically like or get it. I I have been away from Twitter not because of that

1484
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,640
But every time I come to you know, see what's going on see my notifications

1485
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,540
See if anybody said anything and I see you with like a huge big thing and I'm like

1486
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,560
Well, yeah, but like I just it just reminds me of things that have happened in in you know

1487
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,880
Like the the sort of people that I have had arguments with and then I looked at my last notifications

1488
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:29,640
I I redesigned survivor the Pokemon right thought he looked bad and like every reply was like fuck you

1489
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,560
Yeah, and I was

1490
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,800
Why would I stay here if if everyone's annoying I've been off Twitter for a couple weeks now

1491
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,600
I just fucking I didn't know I I didn't know how terminal that cancer was until I got rid of it

1492
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,720
Holy shit every day. I don't log into Twitter. It's like a victory

1493
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,360
It's it's it's it's sort of

1494
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:58,120
Dazzling when you when like I've awakened from a from a you know an eternal nightmare

1495
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:01,960
And I just look back at like the the the fire that is like

1496
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,600
Wow, I was in that I was there all the time guys about a magical phrase

1497
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,480
I've found to so so part of the problem with arguing on Twitter is that like

1498
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:20,680
Some the way I've always handled it is like the people who have a kind of reasonable or like they have an argument

1499
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:25,320
I'll argue with them and those are the people that are easiest because you could eventually reach a point

1500
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:30,840
But then there's the people who just say you're a fucking moron and like I never knew how to deal with those people

1501
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:38,200
But now I figured it out. I just respond explain yourself and like it works because they they either have to now

1502
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:44,560
Explain themselves or not and like so now they have to formulate an argument the only people it doesn't work on to the ones who say

1503
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:51,560
You explain your point first, and I'm like I already did that was the original tweet was an explanation about what are you fucking talking about?

1504
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,160
You know like and

1505
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,160
Even the people who are really obstinate

1506
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,000
They're often obstinate because they're in the heat of the moment

1507
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,560
But those people will sometimes come back the next day and be like, yeah, I thought about it and like realize that was stupid

1508
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,200
You know my tactic used to be for like for like

1509
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,200
You know no argument insults

1510
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,400
Tweets or like comments would just be to reply with no

1511
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,200
And if they reply it again, I would just reply no

1512
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Fingers around my dick when the guy says no

1513
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:29,400
You know, maybe I'm cynical, but I consider responding to most of these things a huge waste of time

1514
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:37,360
No, it's really not because I convert people every day like every time I do this every time I hot take on Twitter

1515
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:42,000
I change a bunch of people's fucking minds about shit, and that's what I want like that's my

1516
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,040
Full argument it's that would the time spent okay?

1517
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,600
I'm just talking about for my personal life with the time spent doing this

1518
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,240
Possibly be better used on just making and I know I can't get like a full video out in the time spent

1519
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,400
We'll make working on something that would just like

1520
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:06,200
Isn't it you can reach you can reach 50,000 people kind of sure, but you can reach one person all the way

1521
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:12,600
Yeah, did you explain? I mean, that's good. That's what like community outreach. Did you this is working for you?

1522
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,480
There's definitely a place for engaging in like a one-on-one doing doing all this

1523
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,080
Did you has worked for you because it's after

1524
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:28,520
Three years of you letting stupid misunderstandings and bad communication fester. Why are you telling did why are you telling digi?

1525
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:34,320
His situation that I've been there for a lot of it. I've been following it very closely for years

1526
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:42,560
It's like I always knew why people were misunderstanding his shit or like not getting his content and

1527
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:49,560
Oh, you always knew to do you had the answers all along is that is that it's not complicated did you's explaining it now?

1528
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,400
It's not that hard. It's easy to get people to get it and

1529
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,840
It's just a matter of you have to be willing to not give up on a person until they get it because if you

1530
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:07,560
But what the reason that I've taken this stance is that what I realized is these people never go away

1531
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,960
Yeah, they never disappear like but the

1532
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,960
I mean you'll never convert them all you'll know

1533
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:20,440
But if you can convert enough people that the people who who disagree are in the minority those people will eventually

1534
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,600
Look like chumps and they will okay

1535
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,040
Other than they won't want to be that way. Yeah, you know

1536
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,880
I hear what you're saying, but like on my part of me is just thinking that like I think the best way to handle like

1537
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,280
There's no way I can convert the numbers of people. I mean, I don't really have a lot of haters

1538
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,640
But you know, that's exactly why it isn't really as relevant to you Nate

1539
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,400
You just like make good videos you haven't like gotten that these made opinion shit fit things that it's not universal

1540
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,880
I remember I remember in the t-bap days

1541
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,480
Yeah, had kind of we had kind of a policy of like don't respond to comments basically. Yeah, that's right

1542
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:00,900
And you know, I think I don't think that was wrong or the wrong way to do it or a bad idea

1543
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:08,120
Like I think the idea was that like responding to comments like kind of puts you down in the muck like with the commoners

1544
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:13,880
So this is a disagree between you and I I very much was of the opinion that like I don't want to engage with the people who are criticizing

1545
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:19,160
The comments because that nothing good will come of it. Yeah was my thinking. I think I

1546
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
don't know I

1547
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,400
I

1548
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:29,480
You know, I don't know. It's calm. I mean, I think okay here. Let me give the most milk toast boring answer

1549
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,820
I think I see the validity of both sides of the argument. Okay

1550
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:40,760
We're all winners here. I feel like I'm coming across like a big anti respond to people think it's like if people want to do that

1551
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,480
That's fine. I like my my thought is like I could take the time to respond to everybody

1552
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:51,920
But I think that I'm better use of my time is to like work and like lots of people will email me or send me a message

1553
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:57,600
With like I don't know I get a lot of sincere comments on things or like personal messages that people don't want other people to say

1554
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,320
I respond like people on my on my on my patron on my discord, you know in Twitter

1555
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,560
Like I respond to everything that is clearly sincere that I've ever gotten and if those numbers inflate it

1556
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,540
I might not be able to so you know, I miss you in the future take it easy

1557
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,880
That's how I want to respond to comments. You have to decide first

1558
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,720
We have to decide what is the goal and did you describe his goal pretty clearly? Yeah, basically shift

1559
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:24,180
Where the consensus is to be in my favor, right?

1560
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:30,840
That's been the goal of my all my content basically is like right convince people that

1561
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:39,200
The whatever the consensus idea is if it does not jive with what I think then let me move people over to my side

1562
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:46,200
It's not taking every hill. It's about winning the war net balance, but yeah, but that's that's how I think to and this is my approach

1563
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,400
I'm trying to crowdsource the conversion. I'm not trying to do it all myself

1564
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,280
I'm trying to get that ourselves here

1565
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,680
That's I'm kind of

1566
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,320
Kind of that's part of my goal, too

1567
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:01,880
It's just that like and I think with your content you have such a very clear stance that it's easier

1568
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,680
To have people who totally get you on your side like I think so for you you you have like

1569
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:14,680
several key points that I think are broadly understood by your whole audience and I have a few of those like

1570
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:21,800
Objectivity doesn't exist like that's something that I don't have to make that argument because literally if someone

1571
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,520
Attacks me by saying like your reviews aren't very objective a swarm of my guys will just like jump on that dude

1572
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:33,320
Right, and that's the kind of thing that would probably happen with you if someone was attacking like the core principles of what you do

1573
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,440
But yours are just so well-defined and mine are so chaotic

1574
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:44,600
And then also it's very contextual talking about okay does responding to comments put you down in the muck in the

1575
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:50,480
Mire because like there's a pretty clear I think this is I just think it's inefficient. That's all I think there's a pretty

1576
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:55,920
Yeah, unwritten unspoken set of rules and paradigms as to like what is proper conduct, right?

1577
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:02,080
We always have this there's a pretty well your unchallenged consensus that's implicit in a lot of people's ideologies about

1578
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,040
Punching up versus punching down

1579
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:13,940
Hence why people suddenly found it controversial that did you would call out other content creators only once his sub count rose

1580
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:18,460
Significantly before that he could call out anyone and no one gave a shit

1581
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,620
But once did you was perceived as popular suddenly?

1582
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:29,020
Oh, yeah wrong before that sure not fucking all and and also so it depends on how you respond to individual comments

1583
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,660
And what kind of comments you respond to oh so for okay? Okay? No

1584
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:37,300
Sorry, I'm sorry. No, no continue. I have a thing. I really want to say good

1585
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,020
But this is my thing. I'm gonna say and then yes

1586
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:47,220
So I had been witnessing a certain a certain like cultural mindset around to me that I wasn't into

1587
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,380
This whole idea and I believe it was yeah

1588
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:55,320
I I saw it starting a couple of years ago or a year ago or so this idea that oh

1589
01:22:55,820 --> 01:23:02,180
Davoo, you know, he doesn't make his own videos. He edits someone else's videos and this is a problem

1590
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:09,060
He could get held back. He's not doing he's not like trudging out analysis videos like everyone else

1591
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:14,580
He's not writing. This is a problem. He could end up cold and alone any day now

1592
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:22,860
And so step one is to not just dismiss the argument dismiss the idea as just stupid

1593
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,300
it comes from a place of logic and I get it and

1594
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:30,820
I saw there was a person who confronted me on it like on a comment section and

1595
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,460
Being a huge

1596
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:40,620
Huge condescending prick about it saying shit like oh, this is going to stunt your growth. It's like okay, dude

1597
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:46,820
Fuck off. I get that the internet has made people like he's making a lot of assumptions about your goals in life

1598
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:51,860
Yes, I think people have gotten really used to things the internet the idea of people who make

1599
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:58,380
Things all by themselves, but sure even on the internet. It's actually not that common for things that are actually really popular

1600
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:05,260
Yeah, so but I knew that there's not that many people who are saying this yet, right?

1601
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,020
It's not like I'm being inundated with it

1602
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:11,700
And so I can't just make I can't just mount a giant like rebuttal to this

1603
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,980
I have to wait for the right time

1604
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:17,860
I mean all that really matters here is like like if he's saying this like all this is an entire argument hinges on

1605
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:22,420
What are your goals if your goals are to become an independent video game analysis channel?

1606
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:26,260
You are fucking up massively, but that's not I mean, I don't think that's a plan

1607
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:29,140
So so on this

1608
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:34,380
This is basically this was basically my tactical decisions. I made right?

1609
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:38,300
Yeah, I was sensing hey some people are murmuring about this

1610
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,180
And so I bet there's a lot of people who aren't saying it but they're on the fence about it, right?

1611
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,540
People who would love to hear what I have to say my response to it, right?

1612
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:53,380
And so I just have to be tactical there if I immediately jump out like being really defensive about it or really being

1613
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,620
Argumentative about it. It'd make people think oh why you've been so defensive about it

1614
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,980
There's only like a couple of people who've said this so far

1615
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:05,740
So I just laid and wait and I remember specifically thinking if anyone else comments this to me

1616
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:10,260
I'll I'll fucking I'll do that shit like that's when I'll like that's when I'll strike

1617
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:17,740
So what happened was this one super ultra turbo shit posty troll guy who like is the worst troll of all?

1618
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:22,620
Like commented the perfect model of this ideology, right?

1619
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:28,580
He posted a comment on me, and he was a huge dick about it, and I'm like perfect

1620
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:33,900
I will read this comment in a vlog and then very very

1621
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,060
cordially and politely respond to it and

1622
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:44,980
Like provide my case right and I'll look amazing and this whole ideology will look fucking

1623
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:48,380
Retarded because this guy was being hugely like dickish about it, right?

1624
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:51,060
And now I have the video the video is called

1625
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:59,180
Response to everyone who thinks that working with another youtuber is bad something like that and now I just have that vlog in which

1626
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:06,300
I perfectly make my case and I can just link that forever, and that's how I've pitch-shifted the fucking narrative

1627
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:13,900
The subject of like responding personally to things okay, so so

1628
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:18,940
There's this idea, and I think it's pretty obviously true that like you know

1629
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:23,100
You if you've got a fan base if you're if you're popular on the internet or in anything

1630
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,100
You know you've got your your body of fans

1631
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,820
You know you have people that know you and follow you and maybe like what you're doing

1632
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:35,860
But then there's the subgroup that is like your real fan like the people that will like the people that will actually

1633
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:41,740
Support you in what you do like the people that that care enough to like you know, you know buy your book or or

1634
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:45,180
You know yeah, patreon you or whatever it is

1635
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:52,020
The people that would probably support you no matter what you were doing like that's like a small that's like the bottom

1636
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:57,260
That's like the top ten percent of the top one percent of like the people and like a lot of those

1637
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:02,180
Like those people a lot of them like sometimes you just reach someone on a real deep level with your stuff

1638
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:08,620
But other times that kind of thing comes from like you know you had like you connected with someone on a personal level and you like

1639
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:17,020
You know have like a real human connection due to whether it's just a fucking reply to a Twitter a tweet or I don't know

1640
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:23,700
Maybe the conversation and on discord or anything that could happen. Yeah, and like so

1641
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,300
That's

1642
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:32,300
You know like you might grow you might grow your audience you might grow your audience numbers by like putting out like broad

1643
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,300
Stuff and like big projects that get seen by a lot of eyes

1644
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:40,380
But like getting that like you know getting like real support

1645
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:47,940
I think to a certain extent it requires or or it's aided and abetted and bolstered by like making a personal connection and doing what I

1646
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:52,580
Guess you might cut through as community outreach or you know just engaging with your fans

1647
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:59,560
You feel that way and I also feel that for everyone. It's a matter of different strata of what you need because I

1648
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:07,920
Ultimately like all of us has a world view and we're hoping to get as many people as much on our side as possible

1649
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:12,680
And so like if you're but there's three different concerns really

1650
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:17,840
There's like how many people can I reach how deeply can I reach those people and also?

1651
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,200
Can I live my life while doing this?

1652
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:28,960
You know not just monetarily, but like do the things I want to do in a case like Nate's I think it's healthy for Nate to not be

1653
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:34,120
Like you know answering comments all the time and shit because Nate's got a regular-ass fucking job

1654
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:40,040
He has to do on top of making videos and I think that freed up of that extra seven hours every day

1655
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:45,240
Maybe you would have more time to talk to individuals and stuff because probably I

1656
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:50,880
Don't know. I think you would probably get bored if all you were doing all day was nothing but working on videos

1657
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,840
So but like in your situation

1658
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,640
It's like there are other things and for me for a long time. It was a combination of I

1659
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,600
first of all

1660
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,800
If you're not feeling as though your basic need of like being

1661
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:12,680
Understood by people and like fitting into society and like having a concrete purpose is met

1662
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,440
It's a lot harder to then go and like

1663
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,920
Communicate with others and and for me

1664
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:24,600
I always felt like the outsider even when I was getting big because of the fact that like the anime YouTube

1665
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,640
community never really accepted me and the fact that like

1666
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,520
You know, even though I had all these subs

1667
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:34,120
I was always like a weird odd man out like I was always the the last guy

1668
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,680
Invited or informed kind of thing but like in the time once I you know got a relationship

1669
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,680
And I feel like may

1670
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:48,080
Understands me completely. There's nothing. There's no disconnect. You know, even with like some of my closest fans

1671
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:53,840
There's always a disconnect because they know me as the guy who I am portraying myself as on the internet

1672
01:29:54,320 --> 01:30:00,520
And even with you guys, there's some level of like macho posturing that has to go on with a bunch of dudes in a group

1673
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,080
You know, you know, but like if I have somebody

1674
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,600
By having somebody who gets me all the way it's like that need for acceptance

1675
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,840
I've I've got that and I don't need to fight for that now

1676
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:21,680
So it's not it's not about like oh, I have to make ever make sure everybody understand on the internet gets me and accepts me

1677
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:27,160
Now it's more like all right. Well, that's fine. I've been accepted now. I'm worried about it for their sake

1678
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:32,880
It's no longer about like I want everyone to understand me because that will make me feel good

1679
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:40,760
Now it's like I want everybody to understand me so that they get my message clearly and because my message is ultimately trying to help people to

1680
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:48,360
You know to do the things that that have worked for me, you know, like it's it's I guess it's just less ego driven

1681
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:52,000
It's less of like I've been right all along and you all should listen to me now

1682
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,520
It's more of like hey guys if you listen to me, this would actually help you with your life and you'd be less depressed

1683
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,240
Yeah, you know, so like let me help you with that

1684
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:05,720
That's how I feel to about my content but on the subject of people understanding you I take it a couple steps further

1685
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:12,260
Then then what you're saying because I believe that literally no one will ever fully understand me

1686
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:17,480
Who is outside me and also I myself will never fully understand me either

1687
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:23,600
And I can't predict what my response is going to be and so I've just accepted the the darkness of my existence

1688
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,840
And I've made some degree of peace with it and it feels pretty okay as long as you're at peace with it

1689
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,600
That's all that really matters. I agree. It reminds me of my brother Victor when

1690
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,240
You know, he had long-standing depression and thoughts of suicide

1691
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,920
But he he tried therapy he tried medication and none of it worked

1692
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:47,440
And he just kind of came to terms with the idea that he just was depressed and that's who he is and once he accepted

1693
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:54,920
It was no longer scary, I guess and I mean eventually he got into a loving relationship and now he's like happy

1694
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:00,120
He's no longer like considering suicide, but like it was just like once he was

1695
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:07,880
What if that crumbles for whatever reason, you know, you need a foundation. Yeah, well, I mean he found the foundation

1696
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,280
Yeah, so far as realizing that like

1697
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,320
This was just not something to be like the only thing that makes it scary

1698
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:22,760
You know sure I think that I think the takeaway here is that he made he made peace with it like before he finding this

1699
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:31,000
Yeah, yeah, okay. That's less. Yeah, like it was that he decided that he needed the relationship to save him from the depression

1700
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,240
Yeah, it's that he realized that like this is not something curable

1701
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:39,440
So if I'm gonna have to live with it anyways, then let's not get hung up on it

1702
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,480
Like let's not spend all our time wallowing in the fact that I'm depressed and suicidal

1703
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,200
Like I have to just live my life and just like let that be a part of my life

1704
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:55,560
Yeah, I was able over the course of like five seven years just turn all of my mental disorders into my job

1705
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:02,440
Very conveniently how that worked out. I don't I mean I've never been diagnosed with with clinical depression or anything

1706
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,440
but I mean I thought

1707
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,920
Yeah

1708
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:13,440
I've had the same like you know leave the world really sucks and and even even if you're healthy and even if you don't have

1709
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:19,480
Mental illnesses per se like you know the world's a dark place and things are gonna suck some time and you just you know

1710
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,920
You got it. You gotta no matter who you are. You got to make peace with that and once you do it's not as bad

1711
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,360
That's the one way to make it better is you got you got to make peace with that it sucks

1712
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,760
That's something I kind of I touched on this a little bit in my land of the luster's video that like I think

1713
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:42,760
One of the biggest problems with with people is that we all try to run away from trauma or like view it as something to be

1714
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:49,400
Healed and it's like trauma is going to happen to you because like if you love anyone

1715
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:55,800
You're gonna watch someone you love die. That's gonna happen to you and like so you unless you're lucky enough to die soon

1716
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:01,520
That's yeah, I almost said that in the video, but I cut that line out cuz I thought I would scare too many people

1717
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:10,880
But like yeah if if you if you know if you live you will experience trauma and like there is nothing that makes

1718
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:16,280
The past not happen. There's nothing or even if something happens now

1719
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,280
You have some yes

1720
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:25,240
But the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it. Hey cause a I like Lion King

1721
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,440
I like Lion King. It's fine. Don't don't hate me

1722
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,640
Yeah, that's Rafiki ah good old nigga Rafiki

1723
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,240
Damn it. That was my best Rafiki impression

1724
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,140
Is that the first nigga word that has been said

1725
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,920
No, since we since we we implemented the nigga jar

1726
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,440
That's two from hippo

1727
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:00,040
If I referenced the job, but then you could get away with like hey just look at that nigga jar over there

1728
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:03,400
He's gonna steal my wallet. I better walk on the other side of the street. You know, that's that's no good

1729
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,440
That's no good. I can read between

1730
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:13,800
Yeah, exactly none of you are pure I had I had a thing as to say about the comments

1731
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:24,440
Comments that make me confront harsh truths about myself and make me sad and it sucks such as

1732
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:29,320
That wasn't very funny. That's the comment that really gets me

1733
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:34,360
When I know something wasn't good and I put it up anyway, and I was like no

1734
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:39,760
They found out. They know they see it. It's when you kind of believe it

1735
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:44,240
Yeah, it's when someone points out something that you believe to one degree or another

1736
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,560
Believe it and like my reaction is always to try to explain it away

1737
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,680
And at that point it becomes kind of a battle of wills of like that's true

1738
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,480
Because a lot of the times I'll like someone will criticize me for something and then I'll like

1739
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,000
Justify it and they'll go. Oh, well, I guess it's fine

1740
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,200
But then like because I am smart enough to then run the rest of the scenario of like how the argument would have gone if they had

1741
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,200
Been strong enough to fight me then I'll then get depressed

1742
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,120
Realizing that they were right. They were just

1743
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,240
What I have like

1744
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,400
You know gone beyond that whole like

1745
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,980
Reactionary like well, no, no, it's not it's not true

1746
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:29,620
Like when I see a comment that is like tells me the truth and I'm like, yeah, man

1747
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:35,380
I want to like I don't want to respond because I just don't care to involve myself with

1748
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:41,820
Things like that but the way they phrase them like it's just a normal thing like these comments

1749
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:44,900
Whether then like putting me down easy or not

1750
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,220
There's this sense of like

1751
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:54,580
They expect me to if I read it to respond in a defensive manner and to have an argument against them

1752
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:58,820
And they're sort of preparing for that in the original sort of statement

1753
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:04,140
And if I don't respond it like in reality, I'm humble and I'm like, yeah

1754
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:07,340
I agree, but I don't care to say that but I feel like I have to say that

1755
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:13,460
So that I can appear humble because that's the truth and they they they they like if it's just left

1756
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:18,580
Responded to that makes me look publicly like I

1757
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
disagree

1758
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:23,300
Let me give an example

1759
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:27,580
Let me give you I just had a great example of this the other day confirms everything you're saying and it was um

1760
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:33,580
This is on the on the pod D cast there was a commenter who just respond like I there's been a little controversy lately about a little bit

1761
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:39,100
Of convenience happening in one piece. We won't get into it, but someone just said simply something along the lines of

1762
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:45,460
Nate like you're fucking wrong. You noodled armed fat faggot and I thought

1763
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:50,020
You know, I just thought to myself, yeah, I guess I could hit the gym a little more

1764
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:04,740
Better if I just admit to it and cop to it like if it's something I agree with and I

1765
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:10,700
Because for me it it helps to put like it's like if I don't respond

1766
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:15,060
It's because I'm afraid of having to change to confront it

1767
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:19,540
But that's absolutely what it is. You know what? I want them to be respond though

1768
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:24,580
Sometimes if I like actually say like you're right, I will then go change it because like

1769
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:33,700
100% 100% of the internet is people being afraid to say man that makes me sad. You're right

1770
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:37,380
Yeah, that's true. That's true. What happened. Okay, so recently I ended up

1771
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:45,060
We're turning the comments on my roller coaster Tekken one versus three video back on again thinking, you know a year after that

1772
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:48,780
Stupid undertale video I made happened

1773
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:54,380
I like close the comments on that and then un reopen the comments a year later and fucking no one commented

1774
01:38:54,380 --> 01:39:01,620
So clearly that's a safe bet reopens comments and RCT video the comments just continue as they always had

1775
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:07,740
Today what I fucking cursed myself with the algorithmic eternity

1776
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:12,180
I don't are they as shit as ever are they yeah, they're they're just as bad as ever

1777
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:17,900
They're it's literally like 2015 and we'll never stop fucking happening. I god damn

1778
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:22,620
Interesting I still get I mean this makes sense because it's not out

1779
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:28,700
But my I'm happy to say that my final five seven. Why does it why does it bother you so much that you keep getting comments?

1780
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:30,940
Maybe they're just never stop

1781
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:39,420
Why does it bother you that they don't so much that's bothering so much that it baffles me that they're still

1782
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,540
Consistently coming out at the same speed. It's really funny to me

1783
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:49,780
But here's what I've done decided to do differently with my approach because I mm-hmm like like looking at the video now

1784
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:56,260
With a lot more experience. I mean, I haven't even rewatched it. I'm just like remembering it now with better critical thought

1785
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:02,900
It's pretty obvious why people walk away with that video with the exact misunderstandings that they do

1786
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:07,740
So I took one comment that says by mr. Star it's a comment that says

1787
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:12,220
I have never seen a video more deserving of dislikes than this one

1788
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:19,140
I took that comment pinned to that comment and then replied to it with about three or four paragraphs of me

1789
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
criticizing the video on

1790
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:26,020
My terms and that is how I think I'm fine

1791
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:32,020
I just I just feel like you've already lost by taking the effort to do that like this is already a lost battle

1792
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,820
I mean, it's

1793
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:39,860
Because you're fighting the tide you are fighting the tide my friend and there's no

1794
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,820
Winning when you're fighting

1795
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:47,700
It's it's not necessarily like a waste of time if you're not changing someone's mind because you might be changing

1796
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:51,420
His mind somebody's gonna be right behind him by being okay

1797
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,220
Billion you can't change billion. I mean, I obviously

1798
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:06,860
There's only 300 million in America. Okay. All right. I can work through 300 million. I

1799
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,700
Well, I mean frankly, I don't want to so I guess that's where I'm approaching

1800
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:14,780
Hey, I think I want to I have done a thing. We hang on. Well. What was gives it?

1801
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:22,620
I am I have done a thing where I have gone through like all of my hypocrite videos because uh, you know, I have like troubles

1802
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,780
knowing where to take

1803
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:31,420
New videos and I just like I just have troubles. I just have troubles. I well, I you know, then don't we all

1804
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:36,460
But uh, I've I went through them and I made a little

1805
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,980
Spreadsheet and I put the name of the episode or the video and I did a little like

1806
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:46,180
Review of it. Like what I thought when I was rewatching it

1807
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,580
What problems I found and what things I actually really liked and then I gave it a little like

1808
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:52,660
like

1809
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:58,100
Word school like good bad great a little iffy like stuff like that and

1810
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:05,100
Then I put that on my on my discord for people to look at and I feel like that's basically the same as like criticizing

1811
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:11,100
Like what DeVoo did with criticizing. It's not about like changing other people's minds. It's just like a helpful introspective

1812
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:18,620
Way to like think about what you have done and how you can grow from it here using that using people's like

1813
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:25,340
This taste as like a catalyst. There's a difference between what I think you think I want

1814
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:32,140
Emotionally psychologically and what I actually do want which is okay not an admittance of wrongs from anyone

1815
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:33,740
I mean that'd be nice

1816
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:38,900
Sometimes when someone gets real heated and like keeps responding like five times over the course of two days

1817
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,300
I'm thinking it's time for you fucking admittance

1818
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:43,980
But even then if two days go by they don't say anything

1819
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:49,560
That's what I want the feeling that I made a good case that satisfies me

1820
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:57,060
Automatically regardless of how they actually respond, right? Okay, so like around like when the video was new my my approach was just

1821
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:01,140
Asked them to elaborate like what the fuck do you mean by bias? What do you mean by nitpicking?

1822
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:05,500
You know, which was satisfying enough, but now I just say I have a copy pasted

1823
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,060
Please go look at the verse

1824
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:12,340
I have a pinned comment a reply to a pinned comment where I analyze what I think is wrong with this video

1825
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:15,300
Go check that out if you're curious what was wrong with this video

1826
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:20,940
Uh, I even got one person explicitly saying no, uh, it wasn't because of the writing structure

1827
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,220
It was because you're biased

1828
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:28,500
It's because you're biased and so then I just went back to the old technique explain what bias is hasn't responded and

1829
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:35,340
That to me is satisfying because I that's the thing about what people don't get about angry mobs on the internet

1830
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,740
They're often right, but in the wrong way

1831
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:41,260
Yeah, they're or they're wrong for the right reasons. They don't know

1832
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:46,500
Econ is always saying yeah when I talked to him about this stuff is that like

1833
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:53,820
That you know, even the dumbest shittiest commenter like they have a point. They're just bad

1834
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:57,260
They're just like they don't understand language well enough to explain it

1835
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:04,020
So if you are good at language, then you can kind of work on sussing out what they actually think, right?

1836
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:07,580
But unfortunately with people like that at the same time

1837
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:13,220
They're too easily swayed like if they're bad at language and you're charismatic and good at language

1838
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,540
It's easy enough for you to kind of trick them into not

1839
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:22,180
Unders like you know into like just agreeing with you without actually addressing

1840
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,020
What was their original point?

1841
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:30,060
Not that that's necessarily bad because it just means that now they have moved past this whatever they were ignorant about it

1842
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:32,060
Just doesn't like you didn't have to like

1843
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:38,700
Let me respond to that too because here's my here's my hardcore anime analysis response to that

1844
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:46,460
The reason why I think my approach is better is because what I'm doing is I am showing and not telling the audience that I am correct by

1845
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:49,780
Not responding directly with the long word exercise

1846
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:53,780
But just by living a great life and achieving things and working hard

1847
01:44:53,780 --> 01:45:00,040
I'm showing them that I'm right in just in a general sense of in life as opposed to in the whatever particular argument

1848
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:06,500
Is that going on? I think that like mounting a a strategic rebuttal to anything is only something you should do like

1849
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:13,060
Empirically, it's not something that everyone should do clearly your whole like your whole brand works on it like works itself

1850
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,500
It doesn't need to be self-justified. It like it just works, right?

1851
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:20,860
Meanwhile, there's definitely a too much. There's definitely you can definitely

1852
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:23,660
Respond to absolutely

1853
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:29,620
I would say someone who really should have done something to respond was the irate gamer who

1854
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:32,980
In 2012 made this like whole like big

1855
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:38,660
Confessional vlog about how like oh the AVG was actually ripping him off not vice versa or something

1856
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:44,940
And I remember reading like blog posts like like rebutting irate gamer saying that like no he's still wrong

1857
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:48,480
I read gamers like full of shit. I don't know if irate gamer was full of shit

1858
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:54,180
But it was basically him talking about his perspective of this huge fucking YouTube career

1859
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:56,680
He had of being this in like infamous pariah

1860
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,760
That like people didn't under like like like that that was just en masse

1861
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:06,960
Disregarded and shamed for being a blatant APG and ripoff with lots of those okay, whatever never mind go on

1862
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,840
There were there were a lot of people trying to be AVG in from the beginning

1863
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,960
It's just that irate gamer was a really shitty one

1864
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:19,040
sure he would like steal individual jokes and what really incited the the criticism was that this was back when YouTube had to

1865
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,240
specifically authorially ordain

1866
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:26,480
Monetization upon people and would also personally get involved in who gets promoted

1867
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:32,120
AVG in was totally snubbed despite being one of the top 20 channels and irate gamer was like black like

1868
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:38,320
Air blasted up his ass for no particular reason why no one knows your situation

1869
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:42,880
All right good the algorithms or at least you know or at least chaotic evil rather than

1870
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:46,360
Orderly evil so

1871
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:54,880
The problem with irate gamer trying to tell his story is that he told it in 2012 when his YouTube career began in

1872
01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:02,160
2006 your six fucking years too late if there's a real problem out there

1873
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:06,280
There's a real misunderstanding and their misunderstanding has some intellectual merit

1874
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:10,280
Even if it's being made by morons and troll faggots. Mm-hmm. Do we need a faggots jar?

1875
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:14,560
You you are not above that stupidity

1876
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:22,000
I think there is an extent to which people are overly egotistical to think that they are so above it all that a valid

1877
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:26,400
Or at least seemingly valid criticism is beneath them

1878
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:31,280
I'm on the record is very much pro comments, and I retain that now

1879
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,680
I'm all for reading comments in a way that just doesn't waste your time

1880
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:37,320
That's what you need to remember is also there is you might think oh

1881
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:43,840
Like you're never gonna change the opinions of the of the angry mob battering down your doors not by responding to individual comments

1882
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:49,240
Yes, that's my position even if that's the case what we don't ever give credit to is the 90% population

1883
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:55,680
They actually legitimately silent majority don't write comments who don't need to be responding to and read the comments well

1884
01:47:55,680 --> 01:48:00,720
But they yeah, yeah, yeah, they they want to they want to support you they want to be on I mean we're right

1885
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,200
You're not just respond. I mean if it's in a public place like Twitter

1886
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:10,640
You're not just responding to this one person when these okay to to a sentiment that is shared by a silent group

1887
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,640
And this one person is just

1888
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,240
This idea

1889
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:32,440
People who are most inclined to share their opinion are outliers the people who are most inclined to speak out are people

1890
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:36,640
Who think that their stance is not normal or that it's not held by the majority

1891
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:44,320
But but how often are they gonna be the only one not only will they be the only one but to look at those people as

1892
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:51,720
Like a huge group. It's like more likely. They are the smallest group, and that's why they feel so in-sense to say

1893
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:59,100
That you will sway the majority by responding, but you will doubt you're definitely influencing more than just

1894
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,680
I'm talking about the majority that does like you

1895
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,840
I'm talking about the people who are like are your subscribers

1896
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:13,320
But not the people whose names you know right and these are people who want to be on your side who by default are on your side

1897
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,480
but

1898
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:22,560
They might be concerned by the criticisms and they might want you to respond for their sake

1899
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,400
You know what you know, that's true. I mean I want to hear you out

1900
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:32,200
They do want to agree with you, but they can't agree with you if you do not make a case for them to agree

1901
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:35,920
I'm all for I am all for addressing concerns of

1902
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:41,240
Like any serious issues that are brought up if it's like you got a fact wrong is like sorry, whatever

1903
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,800
I mean, you know that there's a like if someone's like your content's going to shit

1904
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:51,280
These are my arguments why and also I hate you then like there is things of value in there to be to be addressed in some way

1905
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:56,600
Now is the right way to directly respond with comment? I could see that is the right way to I don't know write a blog post

1906
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,000
maybe or

1907
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:04,480
Possibly is the right way to just take that advisement on board and try to adjust your content to address that

1908
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:09,400
I don't know that I know you were just like like grab bagging for like an extreme example

1909
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:15,720
Yeah, I would say that's an example that is so extreme that it doesn't really need to be said because it's just like if someone thinks this content is all shit

1910
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,720
Oh, well

1911
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:19,720
It can be far more specific. It can be a way better example

1912
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:26,120
Yeah, I think you need to have like stratification of your level of responses where like right again because of the fact that we're

1913
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,520
measuring these these different factors like

1914
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:38,160
Like your your own time, you know like if if you that's a big one for me if I read a comment that is in any way

1915
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:45,720
Reasonable then I'm fairly confident I can reach this person without too much effort if I read a comment

1916
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:50,840
That's totally unreasonable. I might it depends on how dumb the person

1917
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,320
Seems because if they seem really dumb but like in a kind of innocent way

1918
01:50:55,440 --> 01:51:03,120
Then I'll be like I bet I can convert this person because they're just dumb and they'll just listen to me because I sound smart if it's somebody who's like

1919
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:10,800
Malicious and like act like the only people who I block on Twitter are the ones who just come at me like fuck you

1920
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:17,800
You're a pedophile and I'm like I I could argue with these people about like Lolly or whatever

1921
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:23,240
But like they're they obviously don't care they obviously do not care about arguing

1922
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:28,880
They are just determined towards hatred and like those are the only people where I look at them

1923
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:33,720
And I'm like this will not like there's no way I'm gonna be able to do this via social media

1924
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:37,480
Maybe if I met this person face-to-face and talk to them. There's a chance

1925
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:39,720
but like

1926
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:46,800
Like if this person is just someone who views the internet as a place to spew bile at people with no consequence

1927
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,520
Then it's better to just excise them because eventually

1928
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:58,120
Everyone will excise them like people who are like that people who are just like who are just toxic like

1929
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:04,640
The thing is everyone's on the commute on the internet for a sense of community people come to the internet because they feel that they are

1930
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,360
They don't fit in enough with the people around them immediately in their personal life

1931
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:13,880
So they need to find a group they need to find a tribe and they come on the internet to do that

1932
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:18,360
But the thing is most people your tribe is either

1933
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:24,320
It probably has to directly interact with other tribes on the internet and that's where all this conflict comes from

1934
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:30,840
But I'm glad for that. I'm glad that all these people are being challenged and constantly being asked to to reassess their opinions

1935
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:38,200
But if you approach it like sociopathically if you're somebody who comes in and you are not interested in conversation

1936
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,960
You're not interested in like, you know

1937
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:47,440
In in forming an argument if you're just trying to spew bile eventually you will piss off

1938
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,440
Everyone like one by one people who are on your side will eventually be like fuck man

1939
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:58,080
Like you really like you're really gonna go that you really gonna go there

1940
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:02,320
You know and eventually you'll get you'll slowly be cut from everybody. I agree

1941
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:08,520
And so yeah, so I think it I think there is a power in just like blocking people and just being like fucks you

1942
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:14,160
Go go in the corner and think about what you've done and eventually at like when enough people block that person

1943
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:17,700
They have to finally at some point ask. Hey, am I a piece of shit?

1944
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:22,420
I'm a piece of shit, you know, you know, you don't there's no responsibility

1945
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:27,940
There's no responsibility to engage with everyone and some people are definitely not worth engaging with you

1946
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:34,060
There's no shame in deciding this person's not worth my time. There's nothing. I don't think there's anything like

1947
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:37,060
Yeah, I don't think you should feel bad about blocking it

1948
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:42,740
It's interesting like if if you don't want to engage with someone you don't have the kind of thing you're talking about

1949
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:47,140
It was slightly different what I was gonna say, which is like just non malicious people

1950
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:50,620
But just people whose opinion of you is that your shit, right?

1951
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:56,620
And no matter what like lead in or rationales I have for why your shit whoever you are

1952
01:53:56,980 --> 01:54:03,580
The thing is if they just think outright your videos are bad and you think your videos aren't bad

1953
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:09,140
Then it may not necessarily be worth talking to them or trying to change their mind because like there's a clearly

1954
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:12,020
Fundamental difference in opinion here, right?

1955
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:18,460
So I mean it kind of depends on if there's somebody who wants to like your stuff or not because like yeah

1956
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:25,900
Suggests that like like most people who just don't like something aren't gonna go out of their way to say so

1957
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:31,420
So like if they're going out of their way to make their stance apparent either they're a huge douchebag or

1958
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,740
There's more to it than that like that dude mr.

1959
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:43,100
Cynical who came on did you brothers is everybody and like both times his argument was basically like you're not doing the type of content

1960
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:49,140
I want you to do right dude's been watching me for like five fucking years. So that's clearly not entirely true

1961
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:54,360
It's just that like is that are you I mean couldn't he have just liked your early stuff and just obviously he's still

1962
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,180
No, he like he comments on like every video I make

1963
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:05,460
Possible that he there is a sense of dissatisfaction despite still being heavily there's definitely a sense of dissatisfaction

1964
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:07,620
it's just that like

1965
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:13,500
the to to boil it down to like we just are looking for something different out of videos like I

1966
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:17,980
Don't know if it's that simple so much as it's that we are both

1967
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:25,540
Understanding what the videos are or like what the goal of them is differently and that could potentially be reconciled like yeah

1968
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:32,940
I haven't I have not given up on this guy changing his stance or me changing my stance and like for what it's worth like

1969
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,540
his

1970
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:41,580
His idea that like my videos were too personal like my response was like well in my opinion all

1971
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:47,900
Criticism is inherently extremely personal like because you can't you're not writing it from someone else's perspective

1972
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:51,020
You're writing it from your perspective, and that's always going to be affecting it

1973
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:57,100
So like whatever is unique about you is the thing that you should fixate on but at the same time I

1974
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:05,220
Have found ways that I can write about shows that are extremely personal, but aren't like flag-waving about it

1975
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:13,140
Yeah, you know and like I think that's really what he means is like not so much that he wants me to divorce myself from

1976
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,340
the analysis but that like

1977
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:19,180
To remove the ego from the analysis

1978
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:25,580
You know something like like my gurren login review is just like like that is a late in

1979
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:29,540
100% like with my personality the why like I've interpreted things this way

1980
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:35,900
But then like I get away with that and nobody accuses me of ego because I just slip in the like me relevant thing at the very end

1981
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:38,820
Like that's just one little it's just a little and yeah

1982
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:43,220
I mean and that you know I can get away with that but like on the subject of of like how we

1983
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:50,860
Like personal like what I wanted to say about that was I think we have a fun a slightly different just world view as to like how to

1984
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:57,220
Change people or if people can change I think I do think that I will be less successful

1985
01:56:57,220 --> 01:57:02,380
I have a little bit less faith in the earnestness of commenters and like their willingness to change and also

1986
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:07,020
I think it is harder for people to change with with some of this stuff, but like I just view it that I

1987
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:10,980
I'm not necessarily concerned with their willingness to change. I will force them to change

1988
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:16,100
Okay, okay, but I think that is a world around people they have to change to fit into that world

1989
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:19,500
That's true, but like I mean and I so we're kind of on the same pager

1990
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:25,580
But like I see it that just like I will just I will just front load myself with like the kind of like

1991
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:31,940
Positive vibe that I want them to have with me initially and maybe that makes me more like milk toast or less provocative or whatever

1992
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,340
but like

1993
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:37,940
You know that like like Ben was saying before like I don't want people to walk away from my content

1994
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:39,180
And I don't really think about this a lot

1995
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,420
It kind of just just happens

1996
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:45,020
But I don't want them to walk away with even really much of a chance of like a bad impression

1997
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:49,820
That I then have to correct later. So like, you know to at least some degree

1998
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:56,220
I think about like how what I say will be interpreted and so like like I think like my first impression is the is the best chance

1999
01:57:56,260 --> 01:58:03,340
To like hit these people and make them, you know, not think that I'm totally retarded. So, you know, I guess that's just where my

2000
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:10,420
Though that's why I say before I do think that your content is just a lot clearer than mine about like what your intentions are

2001
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:14,620
Who you are what you want the audience to take away like that's all very

2002
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:22,860
Evident and with me there's always been an unsureness even within myself about what my content is why it exists or what I want

2003
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:29,700
People to take away from it. So like that's why I haven't been able to like communicate as clearly as you have

2004
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:33,740
But I hope to fix that. You know, sure. I mean, I'm not trying to suck my own dick or anything

2005
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:38,060
I'm just you know, just just pointing out. I think that the the difference of worldview that I think you agree with

2006
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:40,180
At least to a degree

2007
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:45,300
Well, we're two hours into this should we get into I think it's time. I think it's time to switch gears a little bit

2008
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:51,820
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's uh, okay guys. We got a couple more PCP themes on deck for our listening pleasure

2009
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:58,020
Next week will be the last time we actually let me bring stuff

2010
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:03,260
So so I'm looking at the dates. We said that the 31st is like the last day that people can submit

2011
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:06,260
We've got today's recording the 29th recording and then there's two days

2012
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:10,700
I think technically speaking what we should do is say that the fifth is the last day

2013
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:17,780
We listen to anything but it's only going to be submissions that were in on the 31st or earlier sound good sound fair reasonable

2014
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:22,700
Yeah, okay, so there'll be two more segments after this one though. They'll probably be shorter and shorter, okay?

2015
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:26,940
So here we go first one. So if you're listening to this, this is probably your last chance

2016
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:31,860
Yeah, yeah, you've got like two days if you're listening to this to get it in or something

2017
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:34,780
Let me double. Yeah. No, you got one two three

2018
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:37,540
You've got four days you got four days to get it in if you're listening to this

2019
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:47,780
Buddy, I'm sorry. So anyway, yeah, here's our first PCP theme of the day

2020
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:52,980
This is from oblivion fall who comments. Uh, this is the first out of two PCB themes

2021
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:59,220
I'm submitting to the procrastinators his second more serious entry, which is going to be called PCP dream theme

2022
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:04,620
It's currently in production and will feature real musicians ETA one week

2023
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:08,940
He's I have I have real musicians unlike all these fucking acts that have been submitting

2024
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:17,420
Means live musicians probably in fall makes me think of what your name is trying to be you should just take it all the way and just call it

2025
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:20,060
More oblivious fall room

2026
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:27,320
Probably he has a dragon after also is at his at Oblivion. I mean he probably only likes those two games that he's referenced

2027
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:35,860
Like two and four that's like the most weirdly specific elder scrolls opinion I've ever heard. All right, but let's get to it. This song is

2028
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:43,300
It is called this is the PCP meme theme is the meme theme meme theme

2029
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:45,660
Call aka horse tranquilizer

2030
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,900
Here we go one two three

2031
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,300
Bam

2032
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:01,660
Oh god, that is sharp

2033
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:08,780
Yes, I think this is

2034
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:22,060
Make Starfleet

2035
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:39,420
I think of my first time

2036
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:52,060
Oh

2037
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:18,020
I thought that was actually fucking awesome. There's more. There's more. Oh

2038
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:24,860
I think I was just you crying at the end Ben weird that creep me out a little bit aside

2039
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:31,180
Oh, I felt like if you took out the quotes and the random sharp spikes of it was a meme theme

2040
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:33,740
It was a meme theme by the way. Yeah, but it was like it was

2041
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:38,180
Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's awesome. It was like a it was like a

2042
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,260
Demon version of like dragon

2043
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:48,180
So that should be no, yeah, I think that just needs to be a video

2044
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:50,580
Someone just needs to make a video

2045
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:57,580
Video is this video right now. I guess we animated somebody animate the whole thing

2046
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:00,380
I'm a little disappointed with my quotes

2047
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:08,780
I guess I gotta work on I like I don't remember the the line where you said I'm pretty sure I didn't come my first time with that

2048
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:14,540
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's from the virginity because that's a strange line to pick

2049
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:20,660
Funny I appreciate the going back through the episodes. Yeah, he clearly worked hard on this one

2050
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:22,660
That's to be saluted for sure

2051
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:27,220
Now remember this guys. This is one of two and this was his meme of version

2052
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:30,420
What is his real submission going to be like dude?

2053
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:36,620
Maybe maybe if there's any topping this I don't know if there's any topping I mean

2054
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:42,500
I really like I don't even like hate that as like a real pick possibly that was really good

2055
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:46,060
Really want the first like 10 seconds. Yeah, for sure

2056
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:51,020
But like imagine if someone animated like a procrastiners opening like with this

2057
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:56,900
I think it's a little too intense. Oh sure. It's the opening because like if someone clicks on this podcast

2058
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:58,900
Who's never heard of it. It's just gonna open with

2059
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:05,660
Yeah, blast beats, you know, that's fair. That's fair. I mean man. That was a great fucking we should use that for something

2060
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:10,540
We should we got to use all these for something we should literally put together an album at the end of like we should creme

2061
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:16,980
Yeah, oh dude, we should put together an album and then we can get the guy who did the gorillas animation

2062
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:23,860
We will sell the album and reap all the profits and pay nothing to the well

2063
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:25,860
They did

2064
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:29,940
Pay them an exposure. Yeah, that's what we do. That's what we do you Vee explain

2065
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:35,060
Well, that was fucking great our oblivion fall. You're killing it, dude. I'm super excited to see the next one get that in

2066
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:39,340
Just to be clear. I love that. That was also. I'm eating beef

2067
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:45,580
I'm eating slow slim chips. Well, there you are ladies and gentlemen. Next up is oh, what's what's his Twitter thing?

2068
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:47,580
This is from

2069
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:55,300
How damn it Ken at fit what the fuck at Ken Crayley Ken Crayley this is Crayley. This dude's an actual musician

2070
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:58,620
Oh shit really. I'm like all these other have been submitting

2071
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:03,900
Sent me an album. He made one. So wait a minute. Okay. All right. Let me read this thing here

2072
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:06,660
He says here's a short rock instrumental called explosion

2073
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:12,220
5,000 that my band Casino's made a while back that we never end up expanding into a full song

2074
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:14,220
I thought it might be theme worthy

2075
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:18,700
Maybe you'll dig it. Well, I mean, let's just let's find out. This is a

2076
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:22,300
Explosion 5,000 by the casinos here we go

2077
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:24,300
Oh

2078
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,340
It sounds like an 80s anime theme. Yeah

2079
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:47,460
I'm just waiting to hear a Japanese man singing about Gundams pretty much

2080
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:49,780
Oh

2081
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:56,540
That was really good sounding. I mean I like I like that. It's you know, it's short and punch. Yeah, it's very triumphant

2082
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:01,180
I feel like it's uh, it's it's almost too hopeful for this this

2083
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:07,700
Yeah, I'm with I suppose that I am approaching the the theme concept from the same way

2084
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:12,220
I did with the me and math of the theme which is use a short segment for like opening of the things

2085
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:17,660
But I do want there to be like a big epic version that can be played during our anime final battle

2086
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:19,860
You know, that's that's how I'm thinking about

2087
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:25,300
More to that song that maybe he just said no

2088
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:30,940
He said that this is just like they made just this little instrumental that they never expanded into a full song

2089
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:36,660
So I guess that's this is what there is. I mean anyway, it was well was really good. Yeah, I mean

2090
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:38,660
It's not as it I mean, I can't

2091
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:42,140
Actually made for the show

2092
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:47,340
It doesn't feel like it was written for the PCP because it was which is indeed indeed

2093
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:54,380
All right next one. It's a good it like if I ever made a show that I felt I needed an intro with that tone for it

2094
02:06:54,380 --> 02:07:00,140
It would be fine for that. Yeah, like if I was doing like a Conan barbarian review show like I'd use something like that

2095
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:05,900
All right, send that to Razor fist let that be his new oh, yeah, he'd be down for that

2096
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:10,980
That's kind of like it. All right. Here's at zero alias 394 submits

2097
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:18,260
It's called love stuff and each other PCP theme attempt number one. Okay. Here we go

2098
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,740
Go

2099
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:33,140
Shit

2100
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:37,020
Yeah, all right

2101
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:46,780
I like this it's got a it's got a yeah, it does really like melody

2102
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:53,900
Oh

2103
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,900
Oh

2104
02:07:58,620 --> 02:08:06,500
You know what would make this great, but also just an oniguchi song what if they did the oniguchi like Blast beat drums in there

2105
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:10,580
I I love I really like that one. Yeah

2106
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:16,060
Yeah, I really like the beginning when it just sounded like a fucking acid trip. That was I it was yeah

2107
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:21,660
I like the beginning. It was interesting, but then when the the actual like tune came in. Yeah, it was great

2108
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:28,340
I was way into that melody. Yeah, and I think it's not a bad fit tonally that that would be like

2109
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:33,460
I'm imagining like quotes being laid over the top of that or like somebody speaking over the top of that

2110
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:37,700
That would be like a good. I don't like the idea of using quotes from the show so much

2111
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:43,020
But like well someone speaking over it to like explain the basic, you know

2112
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:49,620
I want someone I want to not one of us person being like I don't know in the midst of time

2113
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:54,260
There was a podcast where a bunch of gay homo boys got together

2114
02:08:55,380 --> 02:09:01,140
Sleepy cast and so I I would like to point out that there is I have seen some sentiment

2115
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:08,920
I have seen some sentiment floating around that my musical intro to Steven Steven universe episode 2 was the best

2116
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,740
PCP intro

2117
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:17,180
And I agree it was yeah, that was that was very good. This is like an original. I haven't seen this. Yeah

2118
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:24,340
Well, I sang over I sang over a piece from the ruby the ruby writer song, but I changed the lyrics

2119
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:26,260
Yeah, I just made like two lines

2120
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:29,420
It's like I mean it had a lot of charm and I really liked it

2121
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:29,980
It was really good

2122
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:36,940
I just was humming that song in my head and I thought about the PCP and then much like Christian

2123
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:39,460
Weston Chandler thinking about Sonic and

2124
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:42,300
Pokemon and wanting to make an album cover with

2125
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:45,140
Combine the two together

2126
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:49,620
Perfect melody to represent the PCP. What's that? All right, it's gonna go like

2127
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:10,980
Yeah, we've got one more over here from actually two more all right, this one's from a Sasuke zero pro

2128
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:16,980
And it's called a PCP theme boy. Wait hang on the fucking go over here and

2129
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:20,820
Go

2130
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:30,860
I'm listening to the PCP

2131
02:10:41,980 --> 02:10:47,180
I don't even care if we keep the guitar part. Yeah, ten out of ten. Oh my god

2132
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:53,660
Guys click on the Robo Nazi techno state chat and look at the album art cover for this

2133
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:56,780
Um, I mean obviously they just did a little thing here

2134
02:10:56,780 --> 02:11:00,580
But I I love the aesthetic of like husband comes home

2135
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:06,220
But oh actually wait no the wife is apparently the breadwinner here and this is say at home dad

2136
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:08,220
And she came home

2137
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:13,620
The British she did not pick up the groceries because she was distracted listening to the PCP

2138
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:18,860
Oh, man, this one is by far my favorite. I want it on record. This is the best one. I said so

2139
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:23,060
Well, you got the just vote. I don't know if I get a vote, but this one is my favorite

2140
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:28,420
This one is I think for once. Oh my god

2141
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:33,340
Oh great way has been lifted and suddenly for the first time for the first time in my young life

2142
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:38,940
I feel like I finally could actually see this at the beginning of a fucking PCP episode

2143
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:42,660
The first one and I mean it uses the existence

2144
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:48,180
To sound like an intro. Yeah, this is the first one that I unambiguously feel like

2145
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:53,820
This would just and who else would bring it to us, but Sasuke Uchiha himself

2146
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:58,860
The competition is over. Okay. Goodbye

2147
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:05,940
Later, dude. Well, I mean that was fucking awesome, but we got to give I guess we'll give the next guy his affair shake

2148
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:11,660
This is

2149
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:18,620
Eric C base at Eric C base with a crazy X. This is apparently his third submission. Oh, I recognize this guy

2150
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:22,060
Okay. Yeah, let's let's play this and there it goes

2151
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:24,060
I

2152
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:29,100
Like this hard-thriving beat. It's good

2153
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:32,460
Bass

2154
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:38,100
Good walking down the street with the pace a pay at my back back back back back

2155
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:43,060
Yeah, I mean and then we were like fade out now I

2156
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:47,020
Want to hear like a new wave

2157
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:54,860
This is third version of this

2158
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:02,500
I still like yeah, he got the

2159
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:08,740
Yeah, that's pretty good. That was the best version of that for sure. We had we had yeah

2160
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:13,660
Yeah, this is I'm sorry that this is we had a version to this one. Well, yes, we did like two versions

2161
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:19,220
Yeah, I I mean I don't remember them well enough to be able to say which version I like the best

2162
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:24,740
But you know, I still like yeah, I like that song with some like like

2163
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:33,100
Interpol style vocals, you know like some I went to the store and I was procrastinating like that kind of

2164
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:36,460
I mean that'd be cool. I

2165
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:42,020
Mean I liked it. I did I mean we're starting to get a bunch of like good things in here

2166
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:46,260
That's a good. That's a good. That's a good tune and it would and it's a good and we got oh

2167
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:52,020
I just remembered digi you said you were gonna enter. Yeah, I sure did say that

2168
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:56,380
Well, you got to 31st buddy

2169
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:59,260
All right. Well, that that's all the

2170
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:04,340
Because I actually am satisfied enough with an entry at this point

2171
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:09,420
Yeah, there you go even even a couple of options, but I mean, you know just think about that aesthetic

2172
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:14,860
You got us the stay-at-home dad is just he's like oh when's honey get so sad and lonely

2173
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:21,420
She came home like shit faced out of her mind did not get the groceries did not pick up the kids from from daycare

2174
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:26,780
Because she was listening to the goddamn PCP. It blasts her mind. It blitzed her chakras

2175
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:33,740
She didn't have time to think about other shit. I I love this aesthetic. I'm way into it. I'm way into that

2176
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:35,980
Hell yeah

2177
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:42,740
There's there's no argument Lord of this one Lord of this one. Yeah. Oh, it's that's good shit. It's strong

2178
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:45,820
You know, it's it is really strong contender oblivion buddy

2179
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:52,220
You got your real submission you got you got a serious contender here to fight with but I'm sure we're forgetting like currently some like the old

2180
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:57,260
You know dope ones that we said we're like this is the best one. I got to go through all of them and yeah

2181
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:59,260
Yeah, all those suck now

2182
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:04,220
I'm gonna I'm gonna put together like a playlist like the best ones and listen to for a while to figure out

2183
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:05,740
Which is actually the best

2184
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:12,220
Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to read you haven't done. Yeah, good. Good. I definitely want to re-listen before I cast

2185
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:16,220
So, I mean, okay, so we're done with that shit. All we got left is our is our little question thing

2186
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:18,220
We've got to throw a bone to the old page

2187
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:20,220
I got one right now. All right

2188
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:24,580
Cicero asks and I'd be shocked if we've never answered this before but I don't remember if we did

2189
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:30,100
How do you all deal with writer's block or other blocks when trying to be creative for me?

2190
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:35,980
Switch mediums like I I've you know, it's which genders. That's what I do

2191
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:39,660
Like if I can't think of any YouTube videos

2192
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:47,060
I will then go and work on like a song or write something or just do something else creative because like, you know

2193
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:50,740
There's no sense beating your head against the wall

2194
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:54,100
Like if you don't have an idea you don't have an idea

2195
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:59,940
So like it's time to do something else and I granted you could just as easily go, you know do something in your

2196
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:05,420
Like something that's just totally unrelated to creativity, but for me. It's just like, you know, I'm I'm

2197
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:11,300
Proficient in multiple fields. So I just go and do a different thing my answer is that there is no simple answer

2198
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:15,180
And I think it's something I've said on this on this podcast before, you know

2199
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:17,180
There's lots of competent artists out there

2200
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:21,940
And then there's lots of competent artists out there whose job it is to do that art

2201
02:16:21,940 --> 02:16:29,100
And I think that my stance is that the real dividing line between a professional artist and just someone who does art

2202
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:32,020
Sometimes because it's fun the amateur is

2203
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:40,580
Their ability to stay motivated and inspired because like you can be like a pro artist in any medium and be really successful

2204
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:47,020
But a lot of people in the peanut gallery could think a lot of people could do that a lot of people with the same level of skill

2205
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:52,260
Basically what I'm saying is that anyone with a with a minor amount of skill can make something really great

2206
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:56,100
sometimes when the inspiration happens to strike and

2207
02:16:56,220 --> 02:17:02,180
I think that is what artists who get paid really get paid for is to learn it's like 50% of the job is learning how to

2208
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:04,220
Control your own inspiration, right?

2209
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:07,980
So I don't think there's anything simple that will work in all purposes

2210
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:11,980
And I think that as the years go on I get more and more attuned to how to

2211
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:19,140
Modulate inspiration like oh and you just reminded me what what the most common advice that writers give is read

2212
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:26,060
like yeah, I mean for me if I go if I consume almost anything and I'm thinking about

2213
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:30,580
It at all. I'm probably gonna get some kind of idea, you know, especially if it's something good

2214
02:17:30,580 --> 02:17:34,740
And I mean for an adult just mean that in terms of like oh if I watch enough anime

2215
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:37,980
I'll find something to analyze like if I watch enough anime

2216
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:41,900
I might see an idea that sparks something within me

2217
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:48,500
You know or if I if I go read a book that is from a favorite author and I try to like imitate a technique of theirs

2218
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:50,300
You know like yeah

2219
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:52,900
There's just just constantly have your eyes open

2220
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:57,700
I would say if you go out of your way to hone the skill of inspiration and motivation

2221
02:17:58,100 --> 02:18:02,780
Modulation it can get pretty easy to control basically before this podcast started

2222
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:07,100
I was looking at my empty Photoshop document thinking okay. I need to draw a level right now

2223
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:12,660
Not feeling it and I knew I knew that if I go wash dishes

2224
02:18:13,140 --> 02:18:18,940
While specifically listening to mr. B tongues video about the great infinity engine do over

2225
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:23,020
I know for a fact that I will walk back to this screen

2226
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:26,340
Totally motivated to do it and I was right

2227
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:32,980
I would say that um a lot of the time I

2228
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:35,900
The way I get through

2229
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:41,260
You know a problem like the reason I don't work is because I'm not sure what to do next

2230
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:46,500
It's not usually because I have no ideas. It's like I have my idea of I'm like how do I do that?

2231
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:53,460
Usually with drawing or with like a video edit like how do I convey that how do I write this next part of the script and

2232
02:18:54,540 --> 02:19:00,980
The best way to get through that is to ask like the very basic of questions get to the very base root of

2233
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:06,140
What you're trying to do and the reasons why it's not working, but it's hard to do that normally

2234
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:10,540
So I like to take a long shower and just like okay. What am I trying to do right now?

2235
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:15,420
Why am I not doing it? Is it because I just want to watch more Tim and Eric probably

2236
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:19,620
Okay, stop doing that. We didn't talk about Tim and Eric. God damn it. All right next time

2237
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:22,780
We didn't next we talked about Tim and Eric every day

2238
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:29,580
Like yeah long showers and like just asking yourself asking yourself simple like questions

2239
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:32,580
Methodically going through until you're like, okay

2240
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:36,460
I think I know the solution to my problem and it's to go

2241
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:42,580
You know either research something or look into something or just you you get inspiration

2242
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:47,940
Maybe because you weren't your mind was muddled with other things and if you if you ask the questions

2243
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:51,420
You'll you'll get to something you'll you'll have a direction

2244
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:56,140
Logically your way through it like oh what texture do I put on these walls?

2245
02:19:56,820 --> 02:19:58,820
Well, hold on. What was the last wall?

2246
02:19:58,820 --> 02:20:01,620
Well, the last wall was polka dots and the wall before that was stripes

2247
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:03,220
So I guess zig-zag

2248
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:06,580
I think it's just a lack of a loss of focus and when you really focus back

2249
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:10,820
I'm glad sometimes it takes like you can go to like the very

2250
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:19,140
Like like logic your way into like a really very specific very core thing like why do I want a texture on the wall?

2251
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:23,380
You know like what is the purpose? What is the purpose of drawing it like this?

2252
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:26,460
What's the purpose of this paragraph? Do I even need it?

2253
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:33,740
And if I do need it then I have a better understanding of what I'm doing. Yeah, I'm glad we're talking about writer's block because I'm currently

2254
02:20:33,820 --> 02:20:37,860
I know that in one sense it's not real kind of but at the same time

2255
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:44,820
It's very real in another sense and in that fake sense. I am dealing with it right now with regards to into a very specific thing

2256
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:46,820
I got asked to write

2257
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:54,900
This is kind of interesting. So I'll say I got asked to write um a comic for the official zone tan like

2258
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,300
comedy

2259
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:59,300
comedy strip thing and

2260
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:06,100
It's hard. Do they like give you specific parameters or like what Mary Mary?

2261
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:12,340
This is this was Mary weather who invited me to do this and he showed me some of the he showed me like the first strip and

2262
02:21:12,660 --> 02:21:16,420
Which is not which has a totally different format than the one I was asked to write

2263
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:22,260
So it's not much help and then he showed me the script for the second strip, which also has a totally different format

2264
02:21:22,660 --> 02:21:28,740
Like it's supposed to be a comedy, but it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't know I I don't

2265
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:35,700
I don't I don't get it. I feel like maybe needed more and kind of hash it out the project

2266
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:41,540
Maybe I do sounds like yeah, I'm I'm it's okay to ask questions if if if the if the only like

2267
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:46,820
Way to understand it is to ask them what the deal is then I would say it would be

2268
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:50,100
Unreasonable of them to ask you to do something and then

2269
02:21:50,820 --> 02:21:54,820
For you like and then not allow you to ask for further clarification

2270
02:21:55,300 --> 02:22:01,140
I don't think there's any more information to be gained like I don't think there's more that they could show me

2271
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:07,060
If if the first two are so fundamentally different does it not stand a reason you could just do what you want?

2272
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:12,660
But what do I want what do I want to zone tan getting

2273
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:17,620
Or something all got him joke and then write a comic about that joke

2274
02:22:18,980 --> 02:22:20,980
Oh, I never thought about

2275
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:23,780
That's something I've been like

2276
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:28,420
Developing around okay in the last several months. Well ever since reading Homestuck, okay

2277
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:32,900
People have this idea this this writing principle called the rule of cool

2278
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,300
Which is in a lot of dumb action movies

2279
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:40,820
Is it like does it always work logically? No, but if it's cool, then yes

2280
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:46,260
It does work logically because the rules of this universe is what is cool and from reading Homestuck

2281
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:51,700
I learned the rule of fool, which is that if you can make a joke out of it. It works

2282
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:57,460
Any problem you have if you can that's just the rule of funny. Yeah, there's already a word

2283
02:22:57,700 --> 02:23:04,500
Is that well, I hear by recall it the rule as a former as a former hardcore troper as a former hardcore troper

2284
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:06,660
I'll tell you that yes

2285
02:23:06,980 --> 02:23:11,540
This troper would like to add that there are actually many variations of the term the rule of funny

2286
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:15,540
There's there's no way I just remembered another way I deal with writer's block

2287
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:20,020
This one doesn't make as much sense to most people but it somehow always works for me

2288
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:26,100
Which is I'll go on twitter and just ask something like what should I make a video about?

2289
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:30,820
And then I'll get like a hundred responses. None of them will be good at all

2290
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:36,580
But like the frustration I feel towards that fact will inspire me to come up with something

2291
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:38,980
It reminds me why you're the one with the youtube job

2292
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:44,740
Yeah, it's I do it probably like once every month or two and it always works

2293
02:23:45,220 --> 02:23:47,540
Hey, here's a here's a quick tip just on the on the thing

2294
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:50,660
What would gib said about breaking down the the problem?

2295
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:54,980
We've got writer's block and busting through it by breaking down the components and figure out exactly what you're trying to do

2296
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:59,140
That helps for me. I get stuck more at the like I know what I got to do

2297
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:01,620
I just like oh god, I have to do it now

2298
02:24:02,020 --> 02:24:06,420
And the way I fix that is I I I do what gib said break it down to the smallest bits

2299
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:14,020
I do step one whatever it is. I'm just like I'll just do step one once. I'm doing step one way easier to like

2300
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:19,860
Only guess that is by far the most important step. I was yep. Yep. I will say definitely

2301
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:27,780
Opening the program is never step one. Do not trick yourself into thinking that is step one because you will just have the program open all day

2302
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:31,140
And then you will not do it. I don't think the program tends to work for me

2303
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:32,900
Although I tend to just not close my programs

2304
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:38,900
I mean sometimes it works, but like I I have fallen into the trap of thinking that opening the program is enough

2305
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:44,260
How many times how many times you guys open the program? You've got it open and you're looking at you haven't touched it

2306
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:48,500
And you're like, well, I've been doing this for hours and nothing's changed. What the hell

2307
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,500
I

2308
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:53,860
Once I put pin to paper that is step one and then I'm good

2309
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:56,420
for me when I when I like uh

2310
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:59,540
When I lay in the first clip usually I'm shocked by

2311
02:25:00,260 --> 02:25:04,260
How much like it take like how much I've already done

2312
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:06,820
Yeah, let's say you have a five minute video and

2313
02:25:07,460 --> 02:25:11,780
Like you lay in the first clip and it's 10 seconds and you're like, oh

2314
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:16,420
That's already like that's like 10 of the video or whatever it is. You know, yeah, exactly

2315
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:20,900
And you see it in one sixth of one fifth. So that's one thirtieth of the video

2316
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:25,620
Which is not so bad because that means like if it only took me like five seconds to lay this clip in

2317
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:31,060
That just means, you know, what's 30 times five? No one knows we speculate to this day

2318
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:44,580
I also edit like preposterously fast. So for me, it's like as soon as I have

2319
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:48,020
Done like sometimes I'll say something like okay

2320
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:54,740
I just need to do like the first two minutes within this hour and then I'll do those first two minutes in like 20 minutes

2321
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:57,460
That's the way to do it. Well now I can edit the rest of this

2322
02:25:57,620 --> 02:26:03,140
I totally edit by percentages like my encouragement level my heart meter is definitely

2323
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:07,460
Keeps up with like I go by like I do the zoom out and I say, okay

2324
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:12,740
I've edited this much of the total audio that's laid out. That's 20% done. I got 5% done just now

2325
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:14,820
I'm on track. There's another 10%

2326
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:18,580
That's uh, it really helps me like see that I'm making progress as I'm doing right now

2327
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:23,300
Doing youtube and you know while also balancing another job at the same time

2328
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:29,700
I pushed my bed my bed, which doesn't have a frame. So it stands up about two feet

2329
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:32,020
into my desk

2330
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,220
fell asleep

2331
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:40,100
And now the technique is that beginning to work on the next video is literally the first thing I do when I wake up

2332
02:26:40,100 --> 02:26:43,780
That's what wait. Wait. Did you interesting that that that works so well for me?

2333
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:48,180
That that is so great and such a great feeling when you do it when you follow through with it

2334
02:26:48,180 --> 02:26:52,260
But I know I don't have it. That's healthy. You should only do that when you're like, no, no, no

2335
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:54,980
And it doesn't matter

2336
02:26:55,780 --> 02:27:00,420
And I got to talk about it because uh while maize mom was staying at our house for a while

2337
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:04,500
Which she was uh like to help her like acclimate back to being human

2338
02:27:04,980 --> 02:27:09,700
Uh and being in society, right? Uh she kept talking about this speech

2339
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:14,820
To make your bed speech. Have you guys heard of this? I know. Oh, is that a jordan peterson thing? No, that that's no

2340
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:17,860
It's it's it's all that's clean the room. Sorry. My mistake

2341
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:23,300
It's a super super famous speech that was given at a college by I think like a military guy or something

2342
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:28,180
But yeah, the the premise of it is that if you make your bed first thing in the morning

2343
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:33,300
Then you will already have this sense of having done something. Yes. Yes. Yes

2344
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:37,860
And not only that but like if you were to go out and have like a bad day

2345
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:43,860
You'll come home and you'll see your made bed and be like, yeah, I did that and like it's you know

2346
02:27:43,940 --> 02:27:48,740
So I think that as someone who who doesn't give a fuck about making your bed

2347
02:27:48,820 --> 02:27:51,940
Probably at the very least you're you're doing the same principle

2348
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:57,620
You're getting the ball rolling so early that like throughout the entire day. You'll always know I already did something

2349
02:27:57,620 --> 02:28:00,420
That's exactly why I need to get myself into a place of life

2350
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:05,380
Yeah, I always make a point to do something satisfying as soon as possible. I was just saying specifically rolling

2351
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:08,500
The monitor is like an unhealthy practice because it's literally

2352
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:14,660
Your screen I'm sure this applies to everyone but artists specifically always say like, you know, you got to do like a war

2353
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:15,940
You had to do warm-up sketches

2354
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:20,260
You spend like a couple minutes you do warm-up sketches and then and then you start drawing the real shit

2355
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:25,300
What that's how you do it you do a warm-up sketches and then like I've done something today and I'm ready to go

2356
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:29,860
That's fine and all but what may and I have to do is in like we've been waking up and just

2357
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:35,140
Immediately going to the gym like that's exactly what I was gonna say. That's do not collect

2358
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:40,660
Straight to the gym and the reason is like not only do you have that sense of accomplishment?

2359
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:47,060
But like when you hit the gym so early that you forget about it like your whole day is a blessed day

2360
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:52,260
It is a blessed day when you've done it crazy. You've already got your blood moving. You're already like circulated

2361
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:53,860
It's easier to eat healthy

2362
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:56,980
You know because you get home and you want to just smack down some protein

2363
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:59,380
It's like you like if you go to the gym

2364
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:03,700
I've discovered this the hard way if you go to the gym first thing in the morning

2365
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:08,420
And then the first thing you consume is mountain dew. It will feel like poison

2366
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:13,940
Like it hurts to have consumed because your body is so desperate for nutrients after that workout that it's like

2367
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:19,780
You have to put something good in there or else it's gonna hurt. So like it's trained me to

2368
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:25,300
Be in a mindset of just like living healthier and doing more every day. I've been seriously considering

2369
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:31,620
I've always loved um like doing an early morning walk

2370
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:34,260
Even before pokemon go if you can believe that

2371
02:29:34,660 --> 02:29:36,660
People walk before pokemon go

2372
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:40,580
Yeah, but like uh, I would get up and I would go and I would go

2373
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:44,660
With the purpose of like seeing the sun in a way in like

2374
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:48,980
Custing shadows in a way that I don't usually see it's like that's that's cool

2375
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:51,540
And then I come home and I'm like hungry the whole time

2376
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:56,500
I'm like I'm really hungry and then that motivates me to cook my own breakfast because no one else is up

2377
02:29:56,820 --> 02:30:00,980
And I I need a big something or other. So like it's it's two things

2378
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:06,180
It's like I get some exercise in and I also make my own breakfast and it feels great

2379
02:30:06,580 --> 02:30:10,580
Yeah, uh, do we do we want to do uh, how how much longer do we want to go?

2380
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:12,580
My eyes are starting to really hurt fair enough

2381
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:17,300
I've got I've got one question the pity question over on the on the twitter here that won't take long

2382
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:19,540
Um, this is from uh lex paradox

2383
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:24,660
I just gotta say it's such a shame because we actually have like a decent handful of good questions this time

2384
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:26,740
But it's like the show that ran so long

2385
02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:30,740
That's true. I don't even want to bother with them, but maybe we'll get to some of these next week or something

2386
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:34,660
I mean that they're all still there if you had a good question restate it next time. Yeah, that's a good idea

2387
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:38,180
um, uh, uh, so at lex paradox asks um

2388
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:43,940
Um, was there a defining moment nat when you turned into the chat you are today and for the rest

2389
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:48,340
Would you say when would you say you turn into the beta virgins you are now?

2390
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:50,340
Wow

2391
02:30:50,820 --> 02:30:56,020
I'm sensing a fight. I'll tell you this there was no moment. I was born this way perfect walking

2392
02:30:56,100 --> 02:31:00,740
I fucked the bitch on my way out the vagina and i'm fucking one going back

2393
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:04,260
Aka the vagina of the earth, which is my grave. Uh, that's

2394
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:10,660
Yes, that's what I fucking I got lost. Yeah, all right. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Um

2395
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:17,060
How am I supposed to answer this question? I any answer you give is a question

2396
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:22,020
Uh, uh, uh, when did you become the beta virgin you are now?

2397
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:28,980
Please comment. Oh, I was it was 40 years ago today. I remember it like I signed that illicit contract with the devil

2398
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:33,060
Damn it. I got this lustrous mane of hair, but dammit a perma virgin for life

2399
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:39,460
I I I signed I signed the the the the beta thing and then and then vhs one in the end

2400
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:46,180
Oh, yeah, same tbh

2401
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:51,060
I mean I've got I didn't even look at any other questions. So should we just wrap it up here?

2402
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:57,620
Hey, I I see a question blue blue nimbus asks can we get another speedrun race and the answer is

2403
02:31:58,020 --> 02:32:03,140
Yeah, we we have had one that we were gonna do for a while, but we all fell off the wagon and

2404
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:09,300
Uh, I'm still interested in doing which one so I'm uh, I'm not gonna say it, but we'll talk about

2405
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:19,220
It is I mean, I think it's in I just put in the main chat. I just oh you mean we're gonna play

2406
02:32:19,220 --> 02:32:21,220
Hey

2407
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:26,020
Actually that would make sense

2408
02:32:26,260 --> 02:32:30,340
Undertale would make sense. Yeah, I mean it's not that long to be real. It would be well

2409
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:37,220
There are things in that game that it would make sense to try to race to do first

2410
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:39,700
Snail race. I mean, yeah, you're right. You're right

2411
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:42,420
Um, who can seduce story?

2412
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:47,700
Or or is it? Well, yeah, the point is we do want to do more. Uh, I yeah, yeah

2413
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:52,900
This was like a couple months ago. It got brought up the next one got brought up and we all agreed that year ago

2414
02:32:52,980 --> 02:32:55,940
I feel yeah, I suggested no suggested this game

2415
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:59,540
I mean, when was the curvy race? Yeah, when you first suggested it

2416
02:32:59,700 --> 02:33:03,940
But like it was yeah shortly after a little after the curvy race maybe a month after the curvy race

2417
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:07,540
We were like guys what race we're gonna do and then this one came up and we all agreed on it

2418
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:12,820
And then nobody we'd not I distinctly said I was too busy. So I was just put myself out of the curvy race

2419
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:16,340
Was literally a year ago. There you go. There you go

2420
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:21,780
I mean, I'm counting there. They are difficult to organize because

2421
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:27,780
Rules and such it takes work. Yeah, Nate and it's like do you

2422
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:34,180
Run the game a million times and then submit your best time or do we do it the first time?

2423
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:35,460
That's not even a question

2424
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:43,620
I know but like how long should there be like and how it's it's not as simple because people have different approaches

2425
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:48,260
I mean, I would prefer it to be everyone on the level playing field i.e.

2426
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:51,460
Just do it like a like snap your fingers and there you go

2427
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:56,180
Someone should just say and I'll I'll say right now. Here's what it should be this game

2428
02:33:56,580 --> 02:33:58,580
Someone should design some

2429
02:33:58,820 --> 02:34:05,300
Reasonable point that is like the the the end goal like what you have to do and just say what you want the rules to be

2430
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:07,620
and like like, you know

2431
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:09,620
You want it to be such that

2432
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:14,580
You are allowed to do it like five times only and you can like get better and then that's it

2433
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:18,180
Who can beat the dancer first? Oh, man, that'd be

2434
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:23,700
That wouldn't take that long. I don't want to get dark souls three. I'm done. I'm done with souls

2435
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:24,900
embarrassing

2436
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:27,940
All right, whatever the point is that we want to do more we'll talk about I just wanted to

2437
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:34,100
Ask that question to reignite to reignite that extinguished spark of speedrun races because I really like them

2438
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:38,660
And I want us to do that one. Yeah, the only reason I like haven't been gung-ho is because of

2439
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:45,780
The autistic amount of time. I mean I've worked really hard on the dark souls and I just know that I suck at this particular game

2440
02:34:46,180 --> 02:34:50,740
That it will be hard as shit. I suck at this game too. This is not my kind of game

2441
02:34:50,740 --> 02:34:54,980
But I think it'd be fun though, right? I can probably I think I think it would be fun and I think with

2442
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:58,820
Effort like think about it this way whatever game it is. I've been thinking about it this way

2443
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:03,380
like my computer now can handle it's like that's a plus and like uh, uh

2444
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:08,740
To to do a speedrun of any game and to like figure out like what the things you need to do

2445
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:13,460
Like you will when you play a game for the first time you like everything you're doing is blind

2446
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:18,820
And you have no fucking idea what you're doing to play a speedrun is you like you learn the mechanics inside and out

2447
02:35:18,980 --> 02:35:23,380
You have to know. Yeah, you know everything. You know everything. Yeah, so, uh, I mean, I mean

2448
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:28,900
Yeah, the the the reason I don't like necessarily to do that's not bad

2449
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:35,940
I would just see to do a race when I don't know the game and I have to play it over and over and learn everything

2450
02:35:36,020 --> 02:35:37,060
It's like

2451
02:35:37,060 --> 02:35:43,860
I I'm not as invested and therefore I am at a disadvantage against you and then so I don't even want to try

2452
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:48,740
Or I mean this this game has a certain member who is a particularly bit of an expert on the subject

2453
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:53,140
So, uh, I gotta say that does have a somewhat diminishing spark in me for like well

2454
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:57,220
I mean I couldn't try really hard. Yeah, but that person will also put less effort into practice

2455
02:35:57,380 --> 02:35:59,380
No, no, no, no possibly true. I

2456
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:04,740
It's not like it doesn't matter if you're good at this game because the speedrunning is like a totally different. I guess you're right

2457
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:09,140
I don't I don't I don't see that as being like an issue. Well, whatever. Let's talk more about it

2458
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:13,620
I want to kind of get into specifics just for fun, but uh, you know, whatever. Yeah, all right. I think all right

2459
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:16,500
I think that's that. Yeah. All right, everybody. Thanks for listening to this

2460
02:36:19,460 --> 02:36:21,460

My dick. I'm jerking

Myself. I'm sucking

2467
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:09,700
I am an asshole. I am a stupid

2468
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:12,420
I've got a deadline

2469
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:15,140
Don't want to do it

2470
02:37:21,460 --> 02:37:23,460
What the hell
