1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good-bye-o-gizai-mas.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Rowdy.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fucker.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Cot.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Killer.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In. Minecraft.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Minecraft.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You know, I understand that this game is banned in schools across the country because of its seditious remarks against certain ethnicities and its pivotal role in leading to World War II, but I think that Minecraft,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
may have some relevance to our current economic and political situation, so we're reviving it for this let's play, if you get what I'm trying to say.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't, I don't, oh wait, reviving it.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, right.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What the fuck is happening right now? I've not played Minecraft in like years, so I have no idea what I'm in for. This is a nightmare though.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I was building the world.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I guess so, I guess so.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This should have fucking figured it out. Hey, great. You started the video game.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's spectacular.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Ben.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, what happened to the fucking, what happened to RFCK Texture Paki, dummy?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We were just talking about it. I don't have it installed.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I want to call attention to the fact that you should have it.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know where it is. I haven't, my long story to history with Minecraft is I played it when I was a kid, and my, eventually they had to update all of their stuff.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They had to update all of their servers, right? So they had to consolidate power because they were about my Microsoft.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So my old, ooh, ravine, my old Minecraft Gmail was unfortunately got corrupted and I was no able to log in.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So just for like a couple years there, I wasn't able to play Minecraft, even though I had rightfully bought it to their acquisition by Minecraft, or by Microsoft and their evil, evil, corrupt policy.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I'm playing again, or making the Minecraft come back.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ben.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Naturally.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Two years of Rowdy fuckers cop killers. I guess not. I mean, we've been going for that for like four years or something, I think.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But now, two years of Endless War.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Two years of Endless War.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When was the first, ooh, I wonder when the first Rowdy fucker, not Endless War, but Rowdy fuckers was.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I remember off the top of my head, it was like very, very close to two years before the start of Endless War.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Like within the span of a week, I believe.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hmm.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's find out.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, let's do it.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's uh...

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, I see.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, the first one, Nuclear Throne was April 11th, 2016.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, almost four years ago.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Time flies, doesn't it?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Where does it all go?

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
At that point, that was like, I'm trying to think about the timeline here, because that was before Radcon 2, right?

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That was before I think, I think that was just after Bronycon, right? Because it was definitely, I think it was before the first Radcon, actually.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Was I?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, was that before I moved in with Digi?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think it might have been, yeah, because the first Radcon's when you moved in with Digi, and I'm pretty sure the first RSC is before the first Radcon.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, um, I don't remember, like, in my mind, our FCK started, but I don't remember doing it before Radcon 1, but I think, but I guess we did, I don't know, okay.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I mean, it was a very, like, me and you and Davoo all just played Nuclear Throne, and we decided to do a podcast together, because we had all played Nuclear Throne.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like, no, like, we were not deciding to make a whole new series or a whole new show, it was just like, you want to talk about Nuclear Throne and play it, and it turned into a clusterfuck.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, got it. Dude, look at all these people.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Me and Tom just did something like that today, guess what we fucking recorded today?

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The Bustercast, I saw.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Bustercast.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's very sad.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's going up, it's going live in a matter of seconds.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For a while there, I thought that racial tensions were starting to ease and that we were starting to enter into a new realm of, you know, social awareness of the issues facing minorities, but I guess that-

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's because you're stupid is why you thought that.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I guess Ben St. came back and made racism legal again, that's unfortunate.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hell yeah, dude.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh my god, Munn, epic.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Someone just died here, and I have no idea how or why. It's epic.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We just got back from a Radcon.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think that you guys probably recorded an episode about it, but I was not there.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I want to talk about Radcon 4, because it felt strange.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It was a very surreal experience doing a Radcon again after not doing it for so long.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then the weird fact that it just flew by and it felt like it didn't even happen.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It felt so insubstantial.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, it felt like-

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It was like a puff of air.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Even though it was so fucking long.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And it was agonizing. It was like cruel. It was cruel and unusual.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I mean it was fine, it was good, it was fun, but it was over in like a second.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There were a lot of like, you know, big recordings where we had to break out the Victor camera

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and we had to, you know, film scenes over and over and over again.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh my god, what's happening? Where am I?

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, is this poison ivy?

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Sweet berries. What the fuck?

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have no idea.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, it kills me. I don't understand why.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I didn't realize that Tom Oliver's channel is like 128 subscribers.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's like, he has a personal channel that's like, never uses.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I guess his over on like Rebel, is it Rebel Pixel or Polystation 2?

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That would be it, right?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why are you getting the stats?

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I just want to fucking put it on the fucking, I just want to get it on the fucking, in the description, in the end card.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There, that's it, that's it, that's it.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Epic.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, okay.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But yeah, it was weirdly like, it wasn't even really hyped up because I forget what the initial impetus for it was,

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but like Radcaud Ford just kind of like, it felt like the planning for it just kind of like happened in one meeting.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I feel like we were talking about the future of the show in one meeting and they were like, well, you know what we got to do is we got to do a Radcon.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And everyone was like, oh yeah, I guess so, huh?

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And then we just started looking for houses and then the bull just started rolling like out of the blue really.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And then we planned it for like two months in advance and then it snuck up on us and then I was like, oh shit, I didn't prepare at all.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And so I spent all of Radcon preparing for my lecture.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then we did those recordings.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It felt like it was just like, oh, a couple days and then it was over.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It felt weird because like a lot of the other Radcons, right?

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It felt like they were like super long in a weird way where there was a lot of time just to like hang out and just like talk.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, well, like I think a part of it may be that like a lot of the stuff involved all of us, right?

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So there was not a lot of time for like some guys to be recording while other people were doing nothing.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There was a lot of like, we all have to be here or like none of us have to be here because they're saying it for another thing where we all have to be there, right?

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I mean, a lot of us, more of us did lectures and the lectures went really long.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like all, like more than most of the lectures were like four hours long or more.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is that, is that, it felt like that? I don't know if that's true though, I think.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, it is true, yours was fucking long, Nate's was fucking long, Tom's was fucking long.

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Nate's felt like longer than it was. I was surprised that it was only like four hours.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I mean, I had to go and like lie down. It was too long for me, I couldn't handle it.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Nate's was the longest, but yours was not much, yours and Tom's were not much shorter.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Tom's is epic though, Tom's was so cool.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tom's was epic, Tom's was too good.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I just want everyone, well, I mean, mine's my favorite, but Tom's, Tom's the second, Tom's the second place.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Right.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, you know, I think Radcon 3 was like very unstructured.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We spend a lot of time at Radcon 3 like thinking of like, what should we do now?

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Radcon 4, there was like never a moment where we were like, what should we do?

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It was always like, here's what we're doing.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's either here's what we have to do or here's like what we have been like planning to do,

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
AKA just like the lectures.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you think that that was, I mean, I guess, you know, there's no reason to fret really.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't think it's good or bad, but I do think it's why the time flew by so much.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hmm.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I had to leave like a day earlier.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Did anything happen on that final day?

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Um, I don't, well, I mean, you missed, um, you missed Hippo's lecture, right?

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right, I did.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Other than, I mean, that, yeah, that and probably we did a stream.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So not really.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It sucks though, because I didn't actually have to go.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The reason I went back home early is because I was going to go back to school,

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but fucking, you know, coronavirus happened and no one was allowed back at school.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I didn't even have to come back.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sad, sadly.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you getting, um, so you're doing online classes now, right?

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, I'm doing online classes.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Please tell me.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please tell me you don't have to pay full tuition to do online classes.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There is a refund for housing, but the tuition itself is not being refunded.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, that's bullshit.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, it's complete bullshit and like everyone is mad and there's, I mean, it's, I wouldn't say it's up in the air,

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but like the pressure from what I can understand is immense to the point where things may change due to the backlash,

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but I'm, I'm unsure.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's almost like college is a big grift.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is almost like that, isn't it?

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You almost suspect.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But yeah, it's a nightmare.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Your life is, is your life changing at all?

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, I mean, functionally, no.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, the only thing that's different is that my roommates are around more and I'm playing board games with them sometimes.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's pretty much it.

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's pretty cool.

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's a pretty positive social change.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I guess it's fine.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You would think so, but actually I feel bad.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I just, I don't know.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Something about, something about the enforced quarantine, even though I didn't leave my house much before,

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
not being able to like makes me upset.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, totally.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, I mean, you know.

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I feel mad all the time.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
At the government or at the situation before the world.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I just feel, no, it's not, I don't feel mad.

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I just feel, I despair.

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's like, I don't know, up until now, I've been like a homebody.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't go out very much.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And it's been like, okay, okay, but I could if I ever wanted to.

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And now I can't.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And it's like a puncture.

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's like an exclamation point at the end of a sentence.

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or at the beginning of a text to man to be worn out.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's like, yeah, yeah.

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If you get what I'm trying to say, yeah.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And it's like, it's like, well now, you know, hey, you've been doing this anyway, right?

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's like, well here, now you got to do it.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And I'm like, oh, this makes me feel bad.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I would, I get what you're saying.

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's almost.

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Now that the privilege has been taken away from me, I suddenly want it back.

187
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's, it was weirdly, it's, it's strange.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It feels like coronavirus really snuck up on me.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Like with Radcon 4 where it was like, I knew about it, obviously.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Everyone knew about it for a long time.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But then like during Radcon, it went from far away issue to like, you know, oh, now we have to stay inside forever.

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like, you know, we don't get to go outside.

193
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It just is like a new thing.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it's weird because it's like, I would wager like maybe me the most, maybe not the most.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's somewhat bold, but like I am one of the more shut in PCP members.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I, I, before college specifically, like I did not leave the house because I was in like a suburb of California,

197
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
which is like AKA a prison in all but name.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And there was no way for me to go anywhere.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So I just stayed in the house the entire time, like all of my days.

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And so it would, you would think that it was like, I don't know, I'm just going back to the way things were.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm just going back to like pre-college munchie.

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But now it's like, I've become so accustomed to going outside every single day where it feels like,

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't believe anyone lives like this.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I can't believe that this is how I used to be.

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's insane.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Um.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mm.

210
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Mm.

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah.

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It makes you like, it's upsetting and it makes me mad.

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's all I have to say.

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I feel bad constantly.

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's it.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's not a good scenario.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It makes you like, for me at least, it makes me cherish all the excuses I can give myself where it's like,

220
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
oh, well, I have to go outside because I have to eat food, right?

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Like this, you know, that's valid.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But it's like, you know, it's weird that I have to like play this game with myself where it's like,

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I cherish all the opportunities where normally they would be chores where it's like,

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
you know, before going to the grocery store, it's like, oh God, just fucking kill me.

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't want to leave the house.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But now it's like, I'm leaping at every opportunity.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, we're alone on bananas?

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Dude, don't fucking worry.

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dude, I got bananas.

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We got bananas at the grocery store.

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll be right fucking back.

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't worry, dude.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I got you.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I went to Whole Foods yesterday and I like fucking geared myself up like a wasteland warrior.

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Like I was wearing like my mask and my bandana and like, you know, wearing gloves and shit.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I look like I was looking very post-apocalyptic.

237
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm looking like an Antifa super soldier.

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
People are saying like, you know, oh, you live in interesting times like apocalypse.

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, well, you know, how, how interesting you should mind this for creative pieces.

240
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But like, it's most boring apocalypse humanly imagined.

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's the most boring interesting times I can easily imagine.

242
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's not like, you know, people are out there in the streets.

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's like a revolution happening or anything.

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's not like there's anything really happening.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's the lack of anything.

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's just boring.

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's the most boring interesting times that I can imagine.

248
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is probably how history feels most of the time.

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I guess.

250
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's like bad.

251
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You know, I guess that's a very privileged thing to say.

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You know, nobody likes.

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Huh? What?

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was just going to say it's a very privileged thing to say like what I was saying that it's like, you know,

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I could be like, oh, it's very boring, but you know, people are fucking dying.

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But from my perspective, I assume most of the people watching this show, it's probably going to feel the same.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Um, I think, um, probably like wars probably feel mostly like super boring too.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You know, like it's not like when there's a war on, it's like constant action.

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's like, you know, probably a long time of like nothing happening and you're afraid.

260
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then maybe if you're unlucky, something happens really fast and then you're dead.

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you're lucky.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I said unlucky.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Um.

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hmm.

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hmm.

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How long do you think this is going to last?

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This podcast?

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, I can't be over fast enough.

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know.

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The coronavirus.

273
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Um.

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Couple months.

275
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I really wanted to do another rfckcon and I was planning to do it like this summer around

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
like when I got out of school, maybe even around this time because you know, anniversary

278
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and stuff.

279
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But you know, this obviously.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hmm.

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
How does it travel?

282
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ski?

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We kawai you to coin an oriental phrase from my long times in the Ottoman Empire.

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Um.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Those are like the coolest things about endless war is the meetups.

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The Ottoman Empire?

287
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, not that one.

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Are you fucking free?

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, not.

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, that, you know, that's a big part of it too, honestly.

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Um.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The meat.

293
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I mean, the meetups feel very different from like what the game actually is.

294
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You know what I mean?

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, yeah.

296
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay.

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We're not shooting each other.

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, we are.

300
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

301
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know.

302
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Whatever.

303
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Maybe this is dumb, but like they feel very, they feel disconnected from the game itself.

304
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,760
They kind of feel just like a separate thing.

305
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,260
I have no idea like what that's supposed to mean.

306
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,760
Like of course they're separate things like.

307
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Yeah, of course they're separate things, but I mean they.

308
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I don't know.

309
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I mean they're.

310
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
I don't know.

311
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Yeah.

312
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Yeah.

313
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Shut up.

314
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Epic.

315
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Um.

316
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I'm stupid.

317
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,260
Don't worry about it.

318
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,960
It was really cool.

319
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,480
The last one where we were just inside this old grandma's house and we were able to just

320
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,760
like chip, like, you know, kick back and hang in this weird sort of like goofy, silly old

321
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,280
Boston house and just screaming about slime and rave and do the lecture, which was epic

322
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,560
and has a bunch of new people playing the game again for this game system for the first

323
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,400
time in like a billion years is really breathed some life into the game.

324
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
It's pretty epic.

325
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,040
Pretty, pretty down for it.

326
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Pretty into it.

327
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Oh God.

328
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Jesus Christ.

329
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Um.

330
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
It's some lava.

331
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Look at this.

332
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
How many, how many people like joined?

333
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Diamonds.

334
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Did a lot of people join after like the lecture?

335
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Did that do anything?

336
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
A lot of people joined after the lecture.

337
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,040
That's what I was just saying is that there's like a ton of new people, a ton of new faces

338
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
and they're all pretty epic.

339
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
If you ask me.

340
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Well, you say it.

341
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Well, how many, how many is a lot?

342
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Do we have numbers?

343
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Well, it depends on how like what you want to know by how many people because like technically

344
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
I think like now it's keeping track.

345
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I think there was like something like over a hundred new people joined the game.

346
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,040
But as in they entered the server, but there's a decent, I would say, I would say like upwards

347
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,040
of like 40 new like faces who have talked and interacted.

348
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I actually did.

349
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
That's a lot.

350
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
It is quite a few.

351
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
I know.

352
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Exactly.

353
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,640
Um, I hosted a tour of the city.

354
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,040
I went on speed Levich and I did a tour of Lakhakan where I just like add every new guy.

355
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Meet me in downtown.

356
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,340
We're going to go to every district and tell you what happened in each district and what

357
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
the deal is with it.

358
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,740
And it was really cool to see so many people like, you know, the game has been up for two

359
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
years.

360
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,840
You think this is as big as it's ever going to get.

361
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,340
This is all the people who are ever going to play this game.

362
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
This is it.

363
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,840
Uh, and then you have all these people being surprised when I tell them about like how

364
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
the food core works.

365
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,040
And dude like, dude, talk about in case you're in this game, like what?

366
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I know.

367
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Yeah.

368
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Yeah.

369
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Okay.

370
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I see.

371
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Maybe there's some life to this thing yet.

372
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Maybe.

373
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Maybe we've did.

374
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Maybe it wasn't all for nothing.

375
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Um, I always think about.

376
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Yeah.

377
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I am at.

378
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Okay.

379
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Sorry.

380
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,680
But as I just released the Buster cast and right now I am trying, I planned it out very

381
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
specifically.

382
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,880
I have like two very specific places where I want to put ad breaks.

383
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,920
So I got, I got to scrub through and find like, exactly, exactly the place for perfect

384
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,680
for maximum artistic, artistic merit.

385
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Okay.

386
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Any, what were you saying?

387
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Uh, I was going to say something about RFCK new players.

388
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Oh, oh, I was going to say, I always think about how like I have this sort of weird.

389
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,680
I would say it's probably influenced by the fact that I, you know, we're a part of this

390
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,680
greater sort of analysis film critique YouTuber regurgitation sphere.

391
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,680
But I always think about zooming out and viewing our shows in the context of like, I wonder

392
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,680
what people are going to say when this shit eventually ends because everything has to

393
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
end.

394
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,680
And I'm wondering about, I always think about, it's probably not helpful, but I think about

395
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,680
like where we are on the timeline of like, I wonder how long this is going to last.

396
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I wonder how long RFCK is going to be a thing, not just like me and you, but I wonder how

397
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,680
long like the server will exist as like endless war people are playing.

398
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,680
I mean, I guess it's the sort of thing where theoretically could go forever, right?

399
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
There's no natural end point.

400
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:40,680
So, I mean, I imagine it will end when like, Discord is no longer widely used.

401
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,680
I don't see why it would end before that.

402
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Skype 2 comes out and everyone flocks back.

403
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Yeah, basically.

404
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:58,680
I mean, that or like, like if Discord stops being, and I mean, even then we might, we

405
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
might just like port it somehow.

406
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I don't know.

407
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
There would probably be like a big initiative.

408
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I mean, unless like interest is completely like fall into zero, we would, I imagine there

409
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,680
would be an effort to, you know, yeah, port it to the new, to a new platform or whatever,

410
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,680
which I'm sure could be done with enough dedication and elbow grease.

411
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I just wonder if it'll, I don't know.

412
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I feel very, I think it's part of the fact that we're inside all the time again.

413
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,680
I feel very reflective nowadays.

414
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
I do too.

415
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I feel, I think about death all the time now.

416
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Yeah.

417
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,680
You think it's tied to Rona, Bra?

418
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
No.

419
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Okay.

420
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
No.

421
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
It's not like I'm afraid to die.

422
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,680
I mean, there is that I am afraid to die of the Rona, but it's not like that's what I'm

423
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
thinking about.

424
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I just think about death in general.

425
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Recently?

426
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Yeah.

427
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
How come?

428
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
What do you think?

429
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Well, I mean, it's not like I never did before.

430
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Yeah.

431
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,680
That seemed to be lurking under the surface of a lot of insane discussion.

432
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
It's just the sort of like, huh, I'm also scared of dying guys, lol.

433
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
You think so?

434
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Yeah.

435
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
I feel like I've gotten that vibe from you before.

436
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,680
I'm super scared of dying.

437
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I guess what could be worse?

438
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Yeah.

439
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,680
I mean, true, but everyone is though, right?

440
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
It's not like that's unique to me.

441
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
It's not, it's not unique to you.

442
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
I don't know.

443
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I have no frame of reference for exactly how much you think about it.

444
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
A whole bunch.

445
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Yeah?

446
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
What do you, Ben, you die right now.

447
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
What do people say?

448
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
What do they say?

449
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Yeah, what do they say?

450
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Are they happy?

451
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Are they sad?

452
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
I mean, I imagine they'd probably be more or less sad.

453
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,680
They would probably say, you know, at least you don't have to hear that guy talking about

454
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
communes on the PCP.

455
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,680
America will never be a socialist country.

456
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Fuck that guy.

457
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I don't know, they'll probably say that I was a guy who had, I don't know, I imagine

458
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,680
people would, I imagine people would miss me a little bit.

459
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,680
People would say that I could have realized more potential if I hadn't died early, you

460
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,680
know, normal shit.

461
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,680
So, you know, I guess, I guess that's all fine.

462
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I would hope that like, I would hope that people would say like, boy, I sure was glad,

463
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,680
you know, Ben might be gone, but I sure am glad that he was around.

464
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
You know, I made a difference.

465
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm better for having him had been here.

466
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,680
That's would be pretty good.

467
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,680
I think it's probably the most you can ask for out of anything.

468
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,680
It's just people being happy that you existed at some point.

469
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Where's the cave entrance?

471
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Where is it?

472
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Here it is, epic.

473
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,680
I was going to say, oh, okay, this is kind of a left turn, but I was going back to like,

474
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,680
RFCK new people, and this is sort of one of the things I wanted to talk about.

475
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,680
So there's a weird sort of, I'm going to describe it.

476
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,680
I guess culture of, dude, the PCP sucks.

477
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,680
I hate the PCP, not as in like all of us individually, but like the show.

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
The show.

479
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Yeah, yeah, especially in the RFCK audience.

480
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,680
And I feel like I've sort of like played into it in a way that maybe I shouldn't have.

481
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Oh, definitely we have.

482
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Yeah, we definitely have.

483
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,680
We talk all the times about how much we hate Nate heads and Digi heads.

484
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Well, that's part of it.

485
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I think, I mean, like a lot of people are like, well, no, yeah, that is part of it.

486
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Yes, agree.

487
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Period.

488
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:09,680
And it made me think about, if you remember, then all those times were recorded like old

489
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,680
RFCKs, like back like Atlanta bin RFCKs way back in the day.

490
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,680
And they would all be like prefaced and then like ended after we stopped recording with

491
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,680
like a big long like time of shit talking.

492
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,680
And in my life, since then, I do remember that I've continually like, you know, grappled

493
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,680
with the fact that I like, I am really unhappy with the fact.

494
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,680
And I find it like a very literally what is happening right now?

495
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
How do I get this to stop being what's happening right now?

496
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,680
I don't want this to be on screen right now.

497
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,680
I don't know what you're referring to the side box of all of these things.

498
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Can you not see it?

499
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Oh, okay.

500
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Yeah.

501
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Yeah.

502
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
The like recipe.

503
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Yeah.

504
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
This is a nightmare.

505
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
I hate it.

506
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,680
But I grappled with the fact that I just I like gossip too much and it's a nightmare.

507
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,680
And I was wondering because it feels very like I feel like the PCP something about it as

508
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,680
like an institution attracts shit talking for like no real reason because I know there's

509
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,680
a lot of people who like it's like a joke, you know, it's a big joke in the RFCK community

510
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
how the PCP sucks.

511
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,680
But I get the sense from some people in there and in the PCP comments that like there's

512
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,680
something about the PCP that legitimately has attracted a lot of like scorn.

513
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,680
And I would almost say something to the effect of like betrayal in a strange sort of way.

514
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,680
There's a lot of like ire in some people's voices when they talk about something where

515
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,680
I can feel that too where there's sometimes where I feel like fucking PCP.

516
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I feel so fucking betrayed for no reason and there's no real source of like why I should

517
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
feel that way.

518
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,680
But there's something about it that makes me feel so angry sometimes.

519
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Do you ever feel that way where it's like there's no real reason to feel that way about

520
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
the PCP.

521
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,680
But do you ever feel like it's like do I ever feel scornful?

522
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Yeah.

523
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Yeah.

524
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
At like the PCP.

525
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Yeah.

526
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Constantly.

527
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
But like there's no reason.

528
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Right.

529
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
I mean do you think.

530
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
I am.

531
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,680
I am like I'm going to make an embarrassing admission on here.

532
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Right.

533
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
That's what RFCK is for.

534
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
So don't worry.

535
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Sure.

536
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
I mean it's not about the PCP.

537
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,680
I mean about the PCP like I've been I've had reasons to be annoyed at it before but

538
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,680
like these days I'm like I'm like really preoccupied and I think all the time about how mad I am.

539
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
That Nate is like a shithead.

540
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Yeah.

541
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Like politically.

542
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Like yes.

543
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,680
It's like it's like very much on my mind and like upsets me.

544
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Like on a regular basis.

545
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Do you ever.

546
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,680
I feel like we might have talked about this before but what like I think like the biggest

547
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,680
flaw of my like character as a human being is in the shower I will fake argue with people

548
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
that I know.

549
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I will like I will I will have been thinking about something and then I will thank you.

550
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Do you do like do you do like do you have you have the perfect comeback.

551
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Yeah.

552
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Well I have it's a combination of like oh my like it's either I was talking to someone

553
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,680
and they said something that I fucking thought was so stupid but I didn't have the words

554
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,680
for it at the time or like I'll have been thinking of something else and then I would

555
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,680
think this person would probably have this to say about this and it would be so fucking

556
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,680
stupid for them to think that because that's such a stupid thing to say and it's so

557
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
in character for them to say it.

558
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
I know.

559
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Yeah.

560
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Yeah.

561
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Yeah.

562
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Yeah.

563
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
I did it.

564
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
I know what you're talking about.

565
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
It's so like it's weird.

566
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Okay.

567
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
My like friend circle.

568
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,680
You imagine you imagine like a sort of straw man who is making like this like a very like

569
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,680
obviously like an easily like counterable argue like argument.

570
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Yeah.

571
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,180
Then you imagine like what you would say to that person to destroy to utterly just destroy

572
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
their ass with facts and logic.

573
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Yeah.

574
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Exactly.

575
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,180
And there's something about it that feels so like good.

576
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,180
I mean I guess it's obvious you know you feel good for being a smart person and this

577
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,180
is way for you role play being smart without actually having to be smart in the moment.

578
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,180
Hell yeah.

579
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
It's pretty epic.

580
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,680
There's something about it where it's like my piece of my like friend group right is the

581
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,180
PCP basically.

582
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,680
It expands a little bit beyond the PCP borders but it's basically the PCP and then fans of

583
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,680
PCP and so it feels like that sort of totem billion in your head of oh I fucking hate

584
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,680
this guy and oh I'm gonna talk about how shit the PCP is.

585
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,520
It feels like weird jockeying for power in like a weird sort of political way where it's

586
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:52,680
like it's fun to talk about the PCP being shit because in a way it shows that well I'm

587
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,180
the PCP but I'm talking about how shit it is so therefore I'm not the bad ones it's

588
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
other people.

589
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,680
Hey listen you should like me still no matter what right?

590
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,780
That's where I think it's probably like coming from the deep recesses of my psyche where it's

591
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,680
like I wanna like shift off blame for something that doesn't really matter like a podcast

592
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,680
going downhill in a nebulous way that doesn't really matter.

593
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,380
I don't really understand the line of thinking that like the podcast has gone downhill.

594
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,680
The podcast is as it ever was.

595
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Yeah.

596
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:34,480
Some people are weirdly attached to the idea of topics and like I think that's dumb.

597
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,300
This is what every time this comes up this and this comes up like constantly and I constantly

598
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:43,740
have to repeat myself that the PCP is what it is and it will never be anything more and

599
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,020
like it is not the thing it is not it is for people who already know us and like know our

600
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,500
channel and know who we are and want to hear us talk but like nobody nobody's going to

601
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:00,320
like find us listen to the PCP and be like oh you know it's not discoverable it's for

602
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,000
people that already know us.

603
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Right.

604
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,920
It's not like the cornerstone.

605
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,920
That like I have to these I don't feel this way about any other thing and maybe just because

606
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,200
I am a part of the PCP maybe it's because I like am you know closer to it than I am

607
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,120
any oh god I thought the problem is what it called me then I am any other like art piece

608
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,540
or like podcast or show anything like that.

609
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:30,340
There's something about it that it just feels very cathartic to want to try and like distance

610
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,620
myself from any responsibility of its you know quote unquote quality where it's like

611
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,020
you're right the PCP is always been just a thing for us to talk like there's never been

612
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,940
any greater ambition than us just talking.

613
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:52,840
You know like I think my version of that is like I would I would not like for people

614
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I would not like for people to know me as the guy on the PCP I have like my own stuff that

615
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,480
would rather be known for so it's so it's it's I think that might be one reason why I'm

616
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:15,860
sometimes inclined to be like oh PCP's PCP sucks PCP's dumb I'm the only good one I'm

617
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,460
I'm different yeah if I were in charge things would be different around here.

618
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,380
Meanwhile it's like a collective collectivized group where any of us have the power to make

619
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,740
the change if we truly are dedicated to it and but like I get that where it's like you

620
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,420
know if I were to care the PCP then yaya yaya but like we're all kind of are the the PCP

621
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,480
if we really want something to happen then it would have happened yeah like I mean at the end

622
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,240
of the day like I probably am like like probably like behind maybe Nate I am probably like one

623
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,640
of the most powerful like driving forces of the of the PCP as an entity I'm like one of

624
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,960
the most involved which is kind of embarrassing yeah why is it embarrassing because like I

625
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:12,580
said like I mean I don't want to be nobody wants to be just the guy from that podcast you want to

626
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:19,900
be your own guy with your own identity which I mean I think I am but I'm but like there are

627
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,980
definitely people there are definitely some people I don't think they're a majority or

628
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,780
anything but there must be some people out there who only know me as one of the guys on the PCP

629
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,320
and probably the same with you same with like Tom hippo yeah probably even like Nate probably

630
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,440
probably like most people probably found us through found us through Digi so and then most

631
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,640
some people you know but you know what I mean like if any if there's anyone who doesn't know

632
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:56,040
your other stuff but does know the PCP to that person you are just some guy on a podcast and

633
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,100
that is the end that is the beginning and end of your existence do you think we take I agree with

634
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,700
the there but do you think that that's partly our fault for not having I mean I think it's

635
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,260
inevitable yeah like inevitably there will be people who are not familiar with Europe with you

636
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:22,180
outside of the show and it's okay it's not a big deal but you know the less the less it's the

637
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:31,240
case the better hence me oh fuck the PCP it's dumb yeah that's I that's just the thing I do but

638
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,760
like I actually it sucks you know but actually it's it's not good at all and I don't like at all

639
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,520
yeah that's right I don't know how to prep segue into this but there's something that I think I

640
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,920
appreciate about Digi a lot and it's the sort of thing where like Digi can like enrage me a lot

641
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:54,020
with the things that he says there's I really do feel like if there is if the chips are ever down

642
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:04,420
in a certain way then I feel like did you would probably support me do you like I yeah in most

643
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,980
in most cases I think that's probably true it's something I appreciate where it's like again we

644
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,700
were just talking about how like you know it's so easy to like exist in this backbiting sort of

645
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:22,120
gossipy scenario with the PCP I think because it's so small and there's like so like there's

646
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,080
personality on the line and it feels so pathetic because there's so little to be gained from like

647
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,600
you know shit talking where it's like at most you maneuver politically in such a way where you

648
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,240
have now secured some more fans for you that are more loyal to you than they would have been

649
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,960
otherwise because you have voiced concerns like that doesn't matter fucking at all you know it's

650
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:49,300
you know yeah like I'll say I'll say some I'll be pretty critical of like Nate or Digi and those

651
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,780
two in particular Lamal but you know it like at the end like I'll still fucking like you know I'm

652
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,860
like I have a pretty limited audience compared to those two so I don't have that much to offer but

653
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,820
at the end of it like I still fucking like retweet them when they like announce projects and stuff

654
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:12,840
and you know I like I want their endeavors to succeed and all that shit there's something so good

655
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,080
about like I don't know this this is sort of weird and I don't know if they'll agree with this but

656
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,760
there's something I've been really thinking about a lot about like blind loyalty where you will go

657
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,760
down with the ship if you're the captain or I guess if you're one of the crew members in the

658
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:35,060
scenario where it's like like it's so easy for me to want to like leave in a weird way but I would

659
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,100
never want to do that because like I don't know there's something about it where I want to stick

660
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:45,420
around even if it's a nightmare or you know as the people may be saying or you know the podcast

661
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,660
going down to Hill or something but like I feel like it's bad for me to always feel them the need

662
00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:00,400
to gossip and be like fuck the PCP is so bad now where it's like there's no reason there's no

663
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,920
reason and I meant I like the guys that was completely incomprehensible point the point is

664
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,400
that I like all of the people and I shouldn't gossip with them so much because I just want to be

665
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,800
their friend and I don't want to do this anymore I don't like being a podcast person where I have

666
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:22,580
to jog jockey to be a roman senator um I don't you know for a while I think I saw like being on

667
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:29,260
the PCP as sort of my like venue for like being in the public eye I don't really feel that way

668
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:35,620
anymore I kind of just show up to the shit I mean you know I kind of just show up to episodes now

669
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:41,140
just because it's the thing to do and also because there's money but like I like even if there

670
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:48,000
weren't money I would probably just keep coming just because like I don't know it's tradition it's

671
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,040
just but I don't think I'm I don't I don't really feel like I need the like exposure it offers or

672
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,240
anything I don't I mean there is no exposure ever like everyone already knows you like the PCP is

673
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,040
not growing like you know it's just is like the same audience well I mean it's grown up it's it's

674
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,580
grown a little bit now it's grown more since the like animorphs lecture came out then like it had

675
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:22,620
in like months before that's cool then yeah pretty pretty good right pretty good right I there's

676
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:29,020
there's a while I was talking with DeVu for a while at like I don't I don't even remember why but

677
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,140
just like after he left out of the blue I think I just like linked up something and we started

678
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:39,200
talking and we had a few conversations about like the PCP and about how like shit it was and it was

679
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,360
kind of cool but and you know DeVu is one of the members who decided to leave like publicly and

680
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,400
that's the sort of you know I was thinking maybe maybe I want to do that just because again it's

681
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:58,000
the sort of thing where it feels like there it maybe I don't know if you feel this way there's

682
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,620
something about it where when the podcast doesn't go exactly your way or when something in the group

683
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:08,180
or one of the members acts a certain way that you don't condone there's something about that feels

684
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,300
very like oh I guess the only word I can come up with is betrayal like it feels like something has

685
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,300
changed and you don't like it and you feel like oh I was it should have been like this I should have

686
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,420
been the one or you know I should have been the main driver here I should have been able to lead

687
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,120
this I should things were better can you give me an example I'm trying to think I'm trying to think

688
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:35,920
like I guess it's just hmm okay this is a very small example this isn't really I guess the most

689
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,880
iconic or the best example of it but something about like I know it wasn't on the topics episode

690
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,360
but there is I know there I know I knew it was happening and I knew that I did you listen to it

691
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,400
I did not listen to it okay I talk a bunch of shit about you oh did you oh yeah okay

692
00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:00,380
well I complain about you and I express confusion at you like so like never wanting to be on

693
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,740
episodes anymore um I mean do you want to talk about it you want to I mean we can if you want

694
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:12,980
but like not to interrupt your point or anything um oh I was like I like I knew Nate wanted well

695
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,940
I knew Nate would say what I think that he'd expressed before where it's like topics bring

696
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,960
you know structure and stuff like that and at rad con he specifically says something in the effect of

697
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,960
like like we were going to do a topic episode I think we were discussing doing the buster cast and

698
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,200
he was like you know we're doing topics episode and it at some point he said it feels like we

699
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,280
can't do those anymore like it feels as though because we haven't done something like that so

700
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,560
long it feels as though that's the sort of thing that we can't do and that's I was gonna come in

701
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,820
and I had notes and stuff and I was gonna be like ah but if you remember I wouldn't when we were

702
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,020
talking about doing topics list I said that we could do those whenever we wanted to and I was

703
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,460
gonna be a big pillar big pillar of it and if only I was here I was I would be able to drive in a

704
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,940
way where it's like yes we would be able to do those very frequently and very suddenly and you

705
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:10,060
know we would have more buster cast and stuff like that if I were the one leading the helm but I

706
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,040
wasn't and I'm doing it I'm not you know there's no one to blame it blames even the right word

707
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,760
for something like that other than myself that's the sort of thing where it's like I feel as though

708
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,480
it like you know if I were to do things would be different even though the only person stopping

709
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,120
me from doing yaya yada is myself and even if I did there would probably be no real meaningful

710
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:39,240
difference you want to talk about why I'm not on the show anymore oh if you want everyone said

711
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,780
like you just I think I think Kazi said the other day it's like you just like don't feel like coming

712
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,820
on which like I mean fair enough original like okay there's a few things going on in this in the

713
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:01,180
thing where this this this may you know given the conversation it may feel more like a like I like

714
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:07,060
I dislike the PCP than I do and that's sort of why I don't want to ever like leave in the same way

715
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,400
that any of the others in pursuit just because I think there's no point to that at all there's no

716
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,120
point in saying I am leaving the podcast you know hard line this is a capital T thing I'm doing

717
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:24,240
I'm not going to be on the PCP anymore no I agree yeah I would only consider doing something like

718
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,400
that if there was like a big like problem that it was like a big problem and something that I felt

719
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,920
I needed to make like a serious like statement about yeah and be like it I would only do it in

720
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,500
like protests of something yeah I agree with that but yeah there's just no point I mean you know I

721
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:50,540
just have not decided to be on episodes for a while and a few things one is I don't really like I

722
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:56,260
guess I just don't really like it he's the main thing and I and I mean that in both I don't like

723
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,860
being on the show but more so I don't like being a host on the PCP like that being a character

724
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,600
trade of me like you were saying earlier like this is what people think of me as and that sort of ties

725
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,440
in the fact I don't really want to be a YouTube personality and I know I wasn't really trying that

726
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,760
hard to be one you know I was not trying to game the algorithm before but even the limited like

727
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:24,560
exposure I had to that world of having to always be on and to do that sort of showmanship for like

728
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,480
you know a living really because you know we got money from it and it was a big part of my income

729
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:35,100
for a while I really didn't like it I really thought it was like a gay and like shit and fake

730
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:41,500
and so I didn't want to do it because I didn't like the way you have to or why do you have to be fake

731
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:53,620
um well hmm I don't mean that when I'm on the PCP like I do I do kind of um I do kind of like ramp

732
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,300
up the energy a little bit more than I might in like a casual conversation so I guess in

733
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:04,960
a way it's like a little fake that way but like I don't know I don't mean I'm my genuine self and I

734
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,640
express my genuine opinions about things the reason I said that is because I said gay before and I

735
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,520
wanted to do the fake and gay YouTube comment joke I don't actually it being fake is not a big

736
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:26,440
part of stupid stupid okay I I don't like a part okay a part of it is that like the PCP isn't the

737
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:34,020
sort of show I want to do because I've really gotten into I think through being in college and

738
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,220
just like kind of like I don't know talking to more people outside of the realm like I've really

739
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:46,180
gotten into my head that I really don't want to have the things that I make solely be like don't

740
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:52,260
you like munchy munch is cool right dude munchy right come come consume this piece of art which

741
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:59,120
is simply munchy is here for a little while because I think it's destined to become boring and

742
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,720
stupid after a while and I am I'm so I mean this is gonna sound pretty pretentious I think this whole

743
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,480
podcast probably will and I think that I'm probably becoming more and more pretentious by the day

744
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:16,920
and it's gay but I feel like I'm really concerned with like quality almost my detriment and sort of

745
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:24,100
downfall in a way where I get like what's what's the term for when you don't want to go out on

746
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:30,100
stage at the school talent show stage fright yeah yeah yeah stage fright I get stage fright a lot

747
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:36,900
now in a weird way that I hadn't before like whenever I like sit down to record something after

748
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,460
like taking a long break from the PCP and after not really doing a whole lot of stuff like this

749
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,060
before and after consuming a lot of like other podcasts and shows and still more things that

750
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,200
like I really enjoy but that like are very very very different from what the PCP is I sort of have

751
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:59,640
like a weird sort of anxiousness when I record in a weird bizarre sort of twisted way and so

752
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,000
that's part of the reason why I don't like being on I get that I get that with streaming I don't

753
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,120
really get that with the PCP I guess it's because like if I'm on the PCP I can like there's no

754
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:19,460
there's not that much pressure because like if I wanted to I couldn't just go silent and like

755
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:27,580
everyone else will just talk when I'm streaming or something especially if I'm by myself it's just

756
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:34,380
like I have to carry this yeah I have to like and if anyone like finds me annoying or boring like

757
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,900
it's all on me well I think it's precisely because of what we were talking about the shit talking

758
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:49,760
where it's like when I go on the PCP after having you know talked in the lunch table about how shit

759
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,720
the PCP is in about haha fuck those guys right and then I go on well then I better be a fucking good

760
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:02,080
edition that show right like I better be the savior at that point otherwise I've just you know I've

761
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,880
revealed myself to only be saying those things so that I can get one up on my opponents which

762
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,620
aren't my opponents they're just my friends but I feel the weird need to distance myself for the

763
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:20,860
aforementioned pride yeah so it's like it's part of that it's also that like I don't know I've got

764
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:30,500
I've gotten really autistic that was the scariest moment in my entire fucking life that's that's

765
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,300
what's like recording the PCP is that moment right there oh my god by the way the game's so

766
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,560
choppy by the way I don't know if you can tell how choppy it is it's really funny it feels

767
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:45,480
kind of recording I assume that was just screen share that was like no no that's the game it's

768
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:53,000
ever um it's gonna say something oh like I have I have like weird autistic ideas about how I would

769
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,480
like want a show to happen but I know that PCP will never be like that and not like the PCP is

770
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,360
shit and like it's bad it's just one of those things where it's like if I were at the helm yeah

771
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,340
I gotta again I'm I am at the helm indeed and things could be different if I put in the work

772
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:13,380
but it's like I don't want to because the PCP is not something I even want to do in concept as a

773
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,340
personality driven show which is something I'm not want to move away from so that's why I'm not

774
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,500
on the show anymore is because I don't like doing it because it makes me feel weird recording it and

775
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:29,980
I think it like sucks and I'm not good on it and I don't want to do shit that's bad yeah I don't

776
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:39,920
want to do shit it's bad and I am bad is the reasoning so there's no it just I just I don't I

777
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:48,160
don't really relate I mean yeah and you're on so yeah I mean there's no it'll like I don't think

778
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:55,480
like it's bad like I think I think I think part of what people may think is that like when you're

779
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,340
on the PCP it feels like you're showing up for like a paycheck which like could be true I mean I

780
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,580
think is true to a certain extent which I don't think there's any problem I mean it is part of my

781
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:11,980
motivation yeah which I don't think it's like a huge big deal and it's like like I don't blame

782
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,460
anyone for being on the PCP nor I think it's like a problem or like any issue and like again like

783
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,980
there's no like I don't think the show has gone downhill at the point where it's like embarrassing

784
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:29,040
or anything or even yeah whatever anyone says the show is at the show is at worse as the same as

785
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:37,200
it's ever been yeah it will I feel the same way so it's like I feel no sense of fuck the PCP I'm

786
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,240
like I'm not protesting by not being on I think it's basically just what I want to do is not the

787
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,680
PCP like I don't want to do it for all the reasons I was just describing but I wish no ill will

788
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:56,620
towards anyone on it or you specifically or you know is there a reason I have ill will towards you

789
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:05,100
though yeah now I know specifically specifically I'm typing I'm tweeting I'm tweeting the buster

790
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,540
cast you can't say this is gonna be my big break this is gonna be the my moment it is gonna be

791
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,620
the bus the buster cast is gonna break me into the spotlight it's you're gonna we're gonna get more

792
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:22,480
views in the in-morphs lecture we're gonna beat away every all the competition can be easy I can't

793
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:33,480
wait for Canton to take us over how genuine how how much do you think that Nate's actual goal

794
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:40,800
and maybe the Nate and Digi's actual goal with Canton is to just supplant the PCP but be in charge

795
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:48,060
now and own it well like again it like the I guess they already own the PCP to an extent

796
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:55,860
well just well we all own it all yeah we all own it that's what I'm saying is that like you know

797
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,980
them being in charge I don't know if that would make any meaningful difference also Digi was

798
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:06,140
definitely like like I don't know if he was joking and since he doesn't mean that he wants

799
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,240
Canton to be the new thing that people do but he does like the word takeover was just Digi being

800
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,280
autistic and not being able to communicate clearly ever but that's just part of him like he

801
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:21,000
definitely meant no malice or like the like the word takeover implies like a hostile like against

802
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,720
people's wills it implies like you know an army marching over a city like he doesn't mean like

803
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:32,480
that he just means that he hopes that Canton will be the new thing of the PCP is which is to say

804
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,340
shit low-level content that people just do so that they can make money and then make cool

805
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:43,340
art on the side and they it'll just be like a like an engine for funding their actual art is what

806
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:51,820
I imagine that he is saying by that um I don't know I don't see the appeal of it I don't really see

807
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:58,660
I don't really see it succeeding well the appeal of it is just that it is easy content to do and

808
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,520
then people will eat it up and they will give you money and then you can spend more time doing

809
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,600
the vapors because you won't have to do all the other jockeying they have to do it's for political

810
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:14,560
and social clout like screaming and why would it make more money than the PCP because I guess

811
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,560
they're more dedicated to it I guess they have more of a drive to do it I don't know why I don't

812
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:30,660
know why they think it would me either maybe well maybe because it's it's um it's art it's content

813
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:36,300
that is about popular shows whereas the PCP is just about us so it's it's automatically limited to

814
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:44,180
a slow trickle up burn of new viewers maybe they think that because it's you know more algorithm

815
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:55,400
me I guess it will have more success maybe that's the idea I guess I guess why do you feel such

816
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:04,480
an apprehension to the idea of canton being the new thing that is done because because what I would

817
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,800
imagine is that basically nothing would really change I would imagine they would they would like

818
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,560
I mean there's no reason why the PCP as a podcast could still exist but I think I mean I think you

819
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:22,120
I think you said earlier where it's like the PCP as a podcast doesn't need to exist in the sense

820
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,660
that it's like that's epic like we love recording the PCP podcast specifically it's just like a

821
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,740
means to an end of keeping everyone you know relevant and doing a weekly show and stuff like

822
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:37,060
that but if something can supplant that like a canton if there's like a weekly canton you know

823
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:44,520
what's what's the harm like what's the what's the problem well it is just feel weird that like

824
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,520
now digi and Nate are like actually the the head for real this is just feel strange yeah well I

825
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:57,160
think that's yeah if we can argue about whether it was like a genuine sentiment but like if the

826
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,760
content were to like become like basically the new PCP it would just be the same but Nate and

827
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:11,540
digi would be in charge of it they would just they would just control it and I don't know that

828
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:20,300
sucks it's yucky I'm trying to think I guess I do feel like it's it's yucky in the sense that I

829
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:26,900
would feel like like a coup almost but I definitely I really feel like if did you were here he would

830
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:32,500
be like arguing against this like I don't know the phrase you know I don't know he is the one

831
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,360
that said take over the PCP but I think I really think that he just can't communicate at all and

832
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,720
that's his problem and that when you get to explain things then it they sound less retired than

833
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:48,240
they did you might you might be right and did you would backpedal on that yeah I think Nate

834
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,360
genuinely just wants to do that but he over he already has like the admin bonus like he he does

835
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,120
all the real work for the PCP he does all the hard part which is making the show like happen

836
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,860
each week like I like he I'm sure he doesn't even he doesn't own it what would that change like I

837
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:09,620
guess he gets a bigger cut I guess I mean he would just be in charge of deciding like where the

838
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,020
money goes okay I guess he would just be able to reallocate that in ways he thinks are more

839
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:20,020
productive to making a business I guess and that may then become the expensive making good

840
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:29,400
quality podcast in as you this is a zombie I don't know I didn't I didn't think it that far

841
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:35,480
through I decided that I was mad and then I stopped there I will know I just like why that's I

842
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,840
don't want him to own it I don't want anyone to own it we should I like that we all own it it's all

843
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:48,120
of our thing I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe that's not what Canton is supposed to be but they

844
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:54,660
sure made it seem like that's what it's supposed to be is just like an all a PCP alternative that is

845
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:03,740
like in somebody other than it like they own instead of now which they don't okay well here I'm

846
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:09,260
gonna try and phrase it like I how I this is my best okay I'm gonna steel man did you I'm gonna

847
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,620
pretend to be digging steel man is argument I think that in his mind this is what's happening he is

848
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:21,720
going to make and really push Canton as a new money-making venture and it will get Maddash I

849
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,480
don't know how he's gonna do it but I think that this is his plan to make a maddash doing Canton

850
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,720
and so his idea is okay we will have this more successful I I would say almost more normie show

851
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,840
than the PCP because you know you can link it to anyone you can say hey you like so are online

852
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,240
here's a canton bet sort of online it's opposed to hey do you know like my little pony whether

853
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,080
these guys do the reviews yeah yeah yeah it'll be easier to link people it'll be bigger and more

854
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,980
normie so there'll be this bigger money-making show and then he thinks well why would anyone

855
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,940
want to do the PCP because no one really thinks it's the main thing that they do well they just

856
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,780
come over and do canton because it's way more successful and then everyone will be happy and

857
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,980
everyone will make a lot of money will be epic and it will be straight up so are you so you're

858
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:06,540
are you saying that the goal of canton is just to make like basically what like buster cast just

859
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:12,700
like highly specific pieces of like content discussing media well yeah that's what bust that's

860
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,240
what buster that's what I'm what's the name of the fucking show that was just canton that's

861
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,120
what canton already is on the channel I don't you think I fucking watch canton you think I know

862
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:31,240
what they do over there well if you were so concerned then why didn't you check oh I just know

863
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:39,440
I don't like it yeah they do like media reviews and stuff like that so so I guess I guess it's

864
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:43,820
just there it's just the same thing they do on their own channel but now there are two of them

865
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:52,540
and it's like a lower production so it's easier to create cool canton is it canton is a it's not

866
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:58,020
a good name it's not a good name for a channel it's not searchable I I don't like it because it

867
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:02,820
feels okay this is very pretentious again it feels like I don't like the idea of can't content I

868
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,740
don't like it just I wish I wish we all pretended what we did was art still even though we know

869
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,640
it's not I mean I I think that's supposed to be like the joke it's like hey you want like

870
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:23,160
mindless like you know disposable content here's some is lol but also like it just is yeah is

871
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:31,760
that yeah it's not like really a joke at all um but it's like self-aware about what it is at

872
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,000
least I guess I think that's the point of it that's fine I don't know if people want to make

873
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:43,740
people want to make you know that kind of stuff that's fine I mean I don't have anything against it I

874
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,540
just think the name is bad the name is not searchable and it's like an inside joke that like you

875
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,820
wouldn't get if you weren't already familiar with them um that did it I don't even know the

876
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:58,660
origin of the name did you just come up in some podcast on the side let's I think it's just how

877
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:09,120
did he says the word when he's being silly um but like you know I don't know it's not searchable

878
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:15,280
what I imagine is that they have to do how would you hear about canton and be like oh if I heard

879
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:24,720
that I would go and say oh C A N T E N T no okay give up they're gonna have to put all the variation

880
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:30,180
of spellings in the um the description and the tags so that no matter what they search they'll

881
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,180
get it now let's have to put in normal content too because some people will just hear the person

882
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:39,020
will just say that they think that they're saying content weirdly because it's funny which I guess

883
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:50,740
is the case yeah true um yeah name is not good but I don't know I think I mean as a weirdly sort

884
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:57,400
of outside perspective like I have no intention to do a canton especially to move to Virginia Beach

885
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,960
to do a canton for like a live-in that's not what I want to do never never never never never

886
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,840
never never never never never never but it seems like it seems like it just is the pcp2 and it

887
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,000
feels like what's the harm I guess other than the did you know what you say it feels like it's the

888
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:21,620
pcp2 what's the harm I say it's the if it's the pcp2 what's the point okay I'm just a skeleton

889
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:29,420
man oh I'm gonna die right now cool no dude I don't want to die dude I don't like that yeah I know

890
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:40,460
right it's real bummer it makes you makes you sad it does make me sad just makes me sad like you

891
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:47,120
know a hundred a hundred years hence it won't matter what happens it won't matter what I thought

892
01:01:47,120 --> 01:02:01,840
about anything you know but at least I will have been mad at digi bro for a while yeah my standing

893
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:11,020
monument oh god yeah pretty much epic anyway the pcp2 like sucks dude like they don't even have

894
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:19,940
they don't even read for Urban Dictionary anymore that's true sad but true you hate to see it happen

895
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:27,780
you hate to not see Urban Dictionary either oh no I fucked up the tweet I fucked up the tweet how

896
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,760
the fuck could you convince yourself to make the pcb danielson how did that happen literally how

897
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:39,120
could that have happened I mean it's epic but like why like how could you have maintained sandy

898
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:47,640
while making it I mean I imagine that probably the guys making it just like like each other and like

899
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,280
had a good time working on it with each other I think that's probably what propelled it to be

900
01:02:52,280 --> 01:03:00,860
finished mm-hmm it had it had to be that shit okay okay I was in production for like a year right

901
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:11,100
what like a year and a half yeah damn cray I got to go to the nether bra it's gonna be crazy how

902
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:18,060
are you already nethering because I play the game efficiently like a gamer that's awful

903
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:26,240
games are meant to be played poorly yeah that's right your speed running I'm a speed

904
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,340
running speed running is antithetical to the true gamer spirit well let's go build a house

905
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:38,920
been let's go build a nice nice little house I would have to are you in like a server could

906
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:44,800
I like jump in if I wanted no I I guess I could set one up but that would be a long time and it

907
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:52,900
would be stupid and take like a year to port forward a survey whatever I don't feel like

908
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:59,260
fucking playing Minecraft you know they have been playing what animal crossing your roommate

909
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:07,140
has a switch right yeah Caleb Caleb has a switch I jumped I jumped on his island I'm doing pretty

910
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:13,140
good I'm almost ready to upgrade my house I played New Leaf for a little while and I liked it so

911
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:18,160
I might want to get it I do have a switch I like got a switch for a smash played smash for like

912
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,000
two weeks and then like have never played anything else in my switch like since it was

913
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,680
pretty dangerous so I should I should probably get a game to play on my Nintendo switch for once

914
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,840
it's weird I like never played video games it was like a weird thing where as a kid I would game

915
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,360
nonstop and there was a big part of my dinner where it's like I like Nintendo games that's a

916
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:44,140
personality point put that on my Tinder profile I like Nintendo games and then for a long while

917
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:50,540
there like I did not interact with an interactive piece of software for like years like it like I

918
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,940
just basically never played I would occasionally boot up civ 5 play like around and then quit

919
01:04:54,940 --> 01:05:00,380
no way through as a kid I wanted to be playing video games like constantly like all the time

920
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:06,420
and then like now I'm like I don't know all occasionally like distract myself with Pokemon

921
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:13,720
showdown or something yeah like very rarely do I'm like time for me to play a video game yeah

922
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:20,480
no I agree but quarantine has made me way like I've been playing video games like constantly

923
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:26,040
with Kazzie snap here Kazzie snap you want to cameo yeah but yeah what's going on I wasn't

924
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,920
listening we're playing video games yeah yeah I never played Minecraft maybe we should play

925
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:42,340
yeah okay well we'll play Minecraft after this no I just wanted you to say hi hi we're playing

926
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:49,820
through the Paper Mario's and it's epic you've played those before right yes well I've I played

927
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:56,340
didn't she like only play Super Paper Mario yeah that yeah that she only played Super and I had

928
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,320
played Super but only like half of that I did not finish it people hate on Super I think Super

929
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:10,280
is epic Super is like it's like yeah same like JRPG style that everyone loves about the other

930
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:18,120
ones no yeah awesome the Mario RPGs are like by far like the best RPGs because action commands are

931
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:27,740
just like they make the game like playable I mean I mean those are fine that's like a pretty minor

932
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:33,300
it's like a pretty minor point in the grand scheme of things what no so they're just like charming I

933
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:39,820
like love the mother games and like Mother 3 has a sort of action command system with music but like

934
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:45,660
I like cannot stomach play in RPGs where there aren't action commands I like I like hate them

935
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:51,600
viscerally I cannot play them for any longer than like a minute really yeah like I can't do it I

936
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:58,520
hate I hate I mean I grew up playing like Final Fantasy 7 and stuff a Final Fantasy 8 did kind of

937
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:04,720
have action commands a bit seven years awesome that's why Undertale is epic is because they have

938
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:12,400
like a weird battle system that's awesome no like no one like cares about that part of Undertale

939
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,700
that's like a shoot them up sort of weird dodging system but that's like the coolest part of

940
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:24,220
Undertale to me I only care about action commands and RPGs I mean you know it didn't invent the

941
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:32,060
idea well sure I mean obviously but I'm saying like it like if that's cool it's cool I like it cool

942
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:36,660
it kind of like fades into the background as the game goes on it does it doesn't really get

943
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:42,240
it's only at like certain like really like it's like boss battles that like you like remember

944
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:49,640
that it's a thing and are like invested in it you know well I guess that's fine because like it

945
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:55,560
mostly fades into the background unless it like suddenly becomes important and then it's you

946
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:02,280
notice it which is I guess is how a mechanic should work lol yeah good game it's a good video game

947
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:07,860
I thought you hated Toby Fox did I say that yeah I thought you like hated it and you thought that

948
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:15,460
you didn't deserve it it being anything um no when did I ever say that I'm pretty sure that I mean

949
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:22,540
I do I do think Undertale is overrated but like that's not to say that it's not good like it's

950
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:31,820
it would be hard to not be overrated when you're as appreciated as Undertale is right although have

951
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:37,000
we have we like come around on that has like has culture sort of like swung has the pendulum

952
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,600
swung the other way and like people are kind of like lost enthusiasm for Undertale now I think

953
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,640
it like Undertale has become one of the things where it's like it's so me meified where it's like

954
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:55,800
people think about like dude Law of Sands more than they think about like the actual game yeah yeah

955
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:01,940
sure so so in that way they probably don't really like Undertale but do people not but people

956
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:08,460
not think it's as good as they used to hmm but do they just not care about the actual product

957
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,100
itself I think mine just not actually care about the project itself I think I think people like

958
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:22,100
don't think about Undertale anymore they think about like Sands are people still um I don't know

959
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:28,800
is is Delta Room like still relevant they're like people make like Yaoi fan art of Delta Room

960
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:36,320
but that's basically it like Delta Room was Delta Room was just like like a like a a defibrillator

961
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:45,200
for the Undertale porn community that's that's all it was a stimulus package yeah hmm oh man I

962
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:55,140
have been having a lot of fun recently trying to like fill out forms and like obtain facts pertaining

963
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:00,260
to how I can squeeze as much money out of the government as I possibly can you know what I mean

964
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:05,100
no I know exactly I mean you and Tom have been going crazy in the PCP chat I mean I've been doing

965
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,780
a lot more of it then like I did talk to him and like explain to him like all the stuff that I had

966
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:16,320
found and like possible possible venues for that kind of thing but like you know I've been like

967
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,000
checking like websites and stuff like waiting for updates to try and be okay like when do I make my

968
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:31,080
move it's great it seemed for a while like I might be able to just get ten thousand dollars for

969
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,320
nothing I don't think I don't think that's gonna work out I might get something for being like a

970
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,820
sole proprietor of what might loosely be described as a business I might be able to get

971
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,980
something for that just as like a forward that doesn't need to be paid back which would be so

972
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:50,380
fucking cool I might be able to get us like a loan that I would not have to pay back provided I

973
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:58,900
spent it on like it's fun I would have to spend it on like rent mortgage and payroll but like by

974
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:05,200
payroll I could literally just give myself the money and call that payroll yeah it just be like

975
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:13,440
yep I paid myself with it it's forgivable now so you know trying trying to maximize all that it's

976
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:20,560
it's fun it's actually like kind of a an engaging puzzle that is exciting because of like you know

977
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,960
material benefit that I stand to obtain by like doing a good job at it do I love material benefit

978
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:33,180
I do don't you would you not love material benefit I certainly do I do quite like material

979
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:40,060
benefit it's good you know all things considered you know one's material circumstances are I would

980
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:48,740
say fairly relevant well I wouldn't go that far I don't know if you would have thought of this as

981
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:53,420
a person but I always wondered how like people and like did you who are like way more like you

982
01:11:53,420 --> 01:12:01,880
know I guess big time fuck you small fry do an air net you know stuff like what do you have

983
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:07,320
planned for like when you're like too old to make poobah videos or not poobah but poobah

984
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,760
videos how what do you plan to do like are you gonna like die like how's retirement gonna look like

985
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:28,340
gonna like die well I guess I guess the plan is like maybe publish books and like maybe just like

986
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,940
try and live off royalties in the future like I don't have any like I don't have any books in

987
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:39,100
like stores right now that are so I like I would need to like I think I think like cheese like

988
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:45,720
memoirs I didn't realize comic books like like oh like my life been the alternative my my

989
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:53,560
alternative life by been saying shut up no no I mean just like get shit printed and try and live

990
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:00,400
off royalties from silly you know just get published through a distributor is like I think

991
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:06,800
that's the long-term goal in terms of like how to actually make money from from like comics I don't

992
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:11,060
know if I have enough that would be like publishable in that way right now I don't know if it would

993
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:20,500
make any money but like the hope is that maybe someday it could the I mean I could do other

994
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:25,780
things like I've talked here and there about how like one thing that I'd be really interested in

995
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:33,020
getting a like sort of a real job doing is doing like doing like art for like an indie game studio

996
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:41,240
or something every every now and then I like look on like local Craigslist or something for like

997
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:49,200
hey anyone like any like fucking dev studios like looking for an artist or anything like how serious

998
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,160
are the looks it's always it's always how serious are the looks would you describe yourself as pounding

999
01:13:54,160 --> 01:14:02,480
the pavement in any way I mean in a purely digital sense perhaps so your dad wouldn't prove no

1000
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:15,580
no you're taking a lot that so I don't know I guess that's the plan that'd be cool been saying

1001
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:25,220
in it like indie game pixel artist I guess it's a great I think I could do it it's a great question

1002
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:33,560
because yeah like I guess I don't know how I plan to like make money when I'm like old or whatever

1003
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:43,320
it's weird since I don't have like since I don't since I don't have like a real job I don't well I

1004
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:49,320
mean I guess I do pay into Social Security like with my like self-employment taxes and I guess that

1005
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:59,060
I yeah so I guess I would be have something like a pension in the future I mean I'm saving up I'm

1006
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:05,540
saving money in like a Fidelity account I have like a fucking I have a I have a small like 401k

1007
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:13,260
or no a Roth IRA I have a small Roth IRA Raphael from the new teenage mutant ninja yeah that's

1008
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:21,000
right he's really small he's not that big and a really big Michael and I don't know but you don't

1009
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,960
get like if you don't have a real job you don't get like a pension or anything but like on the other

1010
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:31,080
hand in the these days of the gig economy it's not like there's any guarantee that your employer

1011
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,480
won't just like screw you over and fire you for no reason at any given time anyway I don't feel

1012
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:43,120
like that's something that I would necessarily have anyway if I had just like you know gotten a real

1013
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:49,300
job instead of doing internet shit so that that's sort of like it's weird like my I don't know I don't

1014
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,740
think a generational thing I don't know if it's like a new phenomenon but like the idea of like job

1015
01:15:54,740 --> 01:16:00,980
benefits never really like occurred to me as like a consideration until like a couple years ago

1016
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:06,540
like it was never like you know I want to get a job with good benefits like that was never even like

1017
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:10,980
I don't think I even knew what it was until like I don't like five years ago or something like it was

1018
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,720
never I guess was like oh like high salary right like you want a high monthly salary that's what you

1019
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:21,040
wish they aim for right but like I mean you do well sure yeah here in America you also want your

1020
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,400
fucking you want to make sure that your boss decides to promise you that you'll have like health

1021
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,160
insurance and dental and stuff and then like a like a retirement and then and then they'll probably

1022
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,960
take it away later on yeah you know they don't they're not really obligated to do anything that

1023
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,380
they said they would do which is good that is that is actually good because that's the free market

1024
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:51,820
and the free market is good yeah what were you talking about how you're gonna not die when you're

1025
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:57,020
old and you're trying to make the vapors but you have the child's sold shaky hand and you can't do

1026
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:15,840
it I'm a downward spiral yeah I know you're gonna be down a little down health trajectory

1027
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,440
pair paradoxes 9-11 to your new Charles Schultz to it's gonna be even worse than anyone could have

1028
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:32,620
imagined we only needed one Charles Schultz just has not been up for the two of us I bet Charles

1029
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:37,180
Schultz doesn't have his shit the fucking a millionaire picnic he doesn't know shit he's

1030
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:43,020
no shit about shit no he's fucking dead dude yeah he's fucking he fucking died so that makes

1031
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:56,960
him on his tombstone at least I hate did you bro for a little while I sort of feel like being

1032
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,800
cooped up in my in my room here just kind of having to deal with the fact that I look at a

1033
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,480
screen all day I think there's something that's been fried in my brain because I just am constantly

1034
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:15,100
like mad or sad always like I'm like that's just the soul like emotion that I feel as a human

1035
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:23,900
being is I'm like yeah no definitely no I definitely agree that's absolutely the case for me I you

1036
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:29,420
know you would think you would think that it would be like I'd have time to like work on stuff but

1037
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:35,740
like I haven't been working on stuff like I have a little bit but like I wouldn't say the quarantine

1038
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:42,240
definitely not made me more productive I find it like really hard to focus nowadays I would say

1039
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:48,320
it's made me more productive I feel like somewhat happy that I'm able to like I don't know it like

1040
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,280
it's two sides of the same coin where it's like I really hate the fact I can't go outside and it's

1041
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:57,520
like it really feels like really terrible and like like my mind is melting but also like I'm

1042
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:10,220
forced to feel like it's sort of an excuse yeah there's nothing more magical than that feeling

1043
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:15,820
when you start a new thing or just you know whenever when a fascination fascination just

1044
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:20,260
catches you and you just spend all night working on something because you just want to do it so

1045
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,580
fucking badly there's nothing better than that and I've been I've been getting a few of those

1046
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:28,400
lately with them with stuff relating to in those words birthday which is today we said at the

1047
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,520
beginning but we didn't really talk about it since this was birthday haha click the link and donate

1048
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,520
to our Kickstarter so you can buy pens oh yeah today today's the day today will be the day that the

1049
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:43,320
Kickstarter goes live yeah that's exciting that's very exciting we just kind of like did it it's

1050
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,840
kind of just like made it happen I've been thinking about it for a long time I know you know when

1051
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:56,780
you said like oh we're gonna do I don't remember who I don't know it was me I well the thing is

1052
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:01,020
is I just I was like we should do some sort of fundraiser I don't know what it was yeah because

1053
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:05,820
people donated money on the last birthday you're like we should do like a fundraiser yeah it was

1054
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:11,100
like okay but like what would it be the fundraiser for making pins like yeah we could do that but I

1055
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:20,720
think it would be more successful as a Kickstarter yeah so yeah you know you will also be able to

1056
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:25,560
buy more merch which you haven't even seen all the merch I've made you can get a mega slime shirt a

1057
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:31,440
slime skull shirt a slime heart shirt a slime splatter shirt and reduxes of the two gang pride

1058
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,160
shirts so go buy those if you don't want to donate to the pins for whatever reason but you really

1059
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,160
want to give us money specifically because we aren't making that much profit on the pins it's

1060
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:47,980
epic we gotta like we gotta fix the storefronts oh yeah no they're gonna be consolidated no yeah I

1061
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:52,460
don't know why they were separated into three different things I mean I did it I did it like

1062
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:56,980
that I thought it would be thematic but like actually it's just a night there's too many items

1063
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:02,500
okay there's like I wish I wish you could set it up so you could like go to the storefront and

1064
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:09,880
like just sort by like design like sort by tag or something and maybe you could maybe you could

1065
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,580
just like tag like show me all rowdy merch like show me all killer merch show me all slime

1066
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:22,860
court merch you know yeah I don't think you can do that it sucks um it's pretty bad I like hate

1067
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:29,500
teespring I like a hate they're like editor it's like so fucking bad it's not it's not great

1068
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:38,620
especially for the all over print yeah I did make I did make the um the like the neck gator the

1069
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:46,260
face cover that's my like my like slime teeth on it that is epic I think that's pretty epic I

1070
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:51,260
actually really am looking forward to that getting here are you the one purchase that by the way

1071
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:59,420
of course I am yeah okay good yeah I bought it for um yeah I did the thing like it's like

1072
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:04,700
buy a sample and it charges you like the minimum price that doesn't make any profit yeah epic yeah

1073
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:11,980
hell yeah I'm gonna go to the nether guys it's gonna be epic level 17 let's go boys

1074
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:23,540
dude I cannot believe how much money we got for madcon 4 I cannot believe it 34 thousand

1075
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:30,540
dollars yeah it's pretty wild yeah I never would have suspected it I didn't think we'd hit 20k

1076
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:37,380
no not at all I was afraid that we would like I don't know it would be just I guess I feel like

1077
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:42,740
I'm in like a worry-a-worry with these sorts of things I was afraid I think you are you always you

1078
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:47,380
you don't you didn't seem to think that the pins would make a lot of me I think the pins will make

1079
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:53,620
here's my prediction I suspect that the pin I'll be embarrassed if I'm wrong what are you gonna do

1080
01:22:53,620 --> 01:23:00,740
my prediction is that the pink starter will make at least three thousand dollars I here's my prediction

1081
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:09,380
I think it will get in the ballpark between 800 and 15 thousand dollars or not 15 thousand 1500

1082
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:16,820
I think there's no way that it does not crack a thousand I think I think you're probably right

1083
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:23,700
I feel extremely confident it'll be it'll break two thousand I know I would say pretty good chance

1084
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:32,340
of 3000 well okay as long as it's not embarrassing then that's fine it's just as long as it's not

1085
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:38,740
like we make two dollars and also we're robbed no there were people in my like birthday stream

1086
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:45,300
yesterday that were like Bevan was like no pins are stupid but everyone else was like no I love

1087
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:53,380
fans pins are like probably one of the coolest things that a person can have I hadn't even

1088
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:59,380
considered making patches but you know thinking about it I would definitely put like patches on

1089
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:05,060
stuff dude on my jacket like a rowdy pin that would be sorry a rowdy patch that would be like

1090
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:09,540
awesome I could be like Scott Pilgrim and you know how he was like the X-men hoodie and it looks

1091
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:18,340
really cool I could be like that but it would be like a rowdy thing yeah yeah uh we should um I

1092
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:24,420
was saying like um when we when we run the polls for like what should we make next I guess I guess

1093
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:31,620
there'd be like here like this pin that pin the other pin this patch that patch the other patch

1094
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,460
yeah and they because pins the pins and patches we could make for like basically the same

1095
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:41,780
amount so if they could just like be basically interchangeable with each other right I was oh

1096
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:47,700
do you think okay do you think it's worth like kind of changing the verbiage on the like um

1097
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:57,940
on the um the Kickstarter to be like the reward is not one pin the reward is like one slime credit

1098
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:04,340
and you can like trade in a slime credit for a pin or a patch or like two for a challenge coin

1099
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,980
like you get like money I think it's pretty fucking weird to confuse I mean we could easily do the

1100
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:16,500
idea of if you want instead of having one pin you can save this pen design and you can just

1101
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,620
with two pen designs saved up with two stretch goals if we do if we do the challenge coin I think

1102
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:27,940
that's how we should do it yeah that's the only thing I think wouldn't just cost one I guess the

1103
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:34,420
only thing is that like um if you want a patch but like the the reward is a pin and it's like okay

1104
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:39,780
we have to say like okay like one patch equals one pin we could call it we could call the reward one

1105
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:44,980
pin slash patch or something or but like what if we don't end up making any patches like what if

1106
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:50,340
they just don't end up being like very widely voted for yeah we might not actually make any yeah um

1107
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:56,500
I mean it doesn't matter I just thought like hey what if it was like a like slime corp like currency

1108
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:04,580
scam I don't know your specialty Ben is coming in with like the absolutely like most autistic

1109
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:10,820
minute changes in graphic design and spending five weeks doing it and it's awesome thank you

1110
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:17,620
yeah pleasure happy to be of service it's awesome I'm glad I offer something

1111
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,580
I really really bring a son to the table on that one

1112
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:31,140
man we finally did the buster cast and nobody nobody showed up Nate who was like I can't believe

1113
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:35,300
Nate didn't want to show up it's so strange to me it's me yeah Nate was like uh I don't know if I

1114
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,220
could find the time did you was like uh I don't have the time it was like you don't have like

1115
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:47,380
six hours in two days I don't understand this like weak shit of like oh yeah I just didn't have

1116
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:52,820
time you know they've made I know has seen it multiple times he could have probably just shown

1117
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:58,740
up without even watching it ahead of time I have no idea why I almost feel like it was some sort of

1118
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:05,220
weird like making a point kind of thing what like they didn't want to be on it because like he said

1119
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:10,820
we weren't going to do it unless he like uh I don't know I could be totally off base but like

1120
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:14,980
what if Nate didn't want to be on it because he said we weren't going to be able to

1121
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:20,180
organize it without him and then we did I don't know that might be wrong he said that you wouldn't

1122
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:25,380
be able to organize it without him he said on the bonus episode that like guys you know you won't

1123
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:33,940
do it if I don't like set it up what that's yeah okay and I was like no I'll just say when we do it

1124
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:40,580
and then we do it and then I did that and then we did LeMau I don't know but I do not know I do

1125
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:47,460
understand why they thought it would be so difficult to come on considering I know that I know they're

1126
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:53,460
both fans but whatever that's fine just me and Tom just me and Tom just having a little me and Tom

1127
01:27:53,460 --> 01:28:00,180
solo double double solo duet cast you know it's new it's a new new character dynamic

1128
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:06,980
chemistry my little pony it's it's like that's that's such a weird dynamic it's like apple jack and

1129
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:12,820
yeah it's like apple jack and twilight like what do they even talk about yeah you're apple jack

1130
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:18,580
could they fuck like I don't know let's find out if the answer yes but you'll have to buy the episode

1131
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:24,260
so you can see all that steamy episode action ah you gotta buy the uncensored version to take the

1132
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:30,420
like light beams oh god like they're like utter they're like down below the legs like utter tits

1133
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:38,100
disgusting yeah I I I can't wait till the OVA comes out it's gonna be awesome

1134
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:46,500
it is gonna be awesome but um we haven't like I feel like we have we haven't really made any

1135
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,620
progress on finding an animator uh yes we have I don't know if we want to talk about it but hippo

1136
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:58,820
has made progress he's he's been talking about in chat um I'm shit I haven't I must have missed it

1137
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:04,580
yeah we're getting like yeah yeah I mean do you want to keep a secret or something because uh

1138
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:10,340
well well I'll say in a very vague way that it implies nothing specifically but as everyone in

1139
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:15,700
the audience knows hippo is you know working with like a studio so I don't think that they're gonna

1140
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:20,740
do it but I he knows of people who could ask other people and he and that has been what has happened

1141
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:27,300
as he has asked other people and have they and have they given him leads yes interesting

1142
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:32,660
interesting but who knows if that's what how it will be or not but that's that's where we are

1143
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:38,340
right now there there is there there there are things happening on that front that's good I'm glad

1144
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:48,980
Ben you got so mad I have no fucking clue why I have no idea I don't really know exactly why either

1145
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:58,100
I I think I just could hear I just I could hear in people's voices that they were like prioritizing

1146
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:04,100
something that I thought was like be up beside the point and it really frustrated me and maybe

1147
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:11,060
that's like stupid but that's how I felt you see here's the biggest problem with PCP is that we have

1148
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:17,300
Nate you know uh what's his uh he has like self-defined no low-information voter and it's epic

1149
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:22,820
and funny but max charisma can get anyone to like agree with him because he says things in such a

1150
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:27,540
great way that everyone wants to agree with him because he says it in a great way and then Ben

1151
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:32,020
you try to come on with the with the facts and the logics we have like an anti-charisma that

1152
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:37,060
makes everyone hate you and it's infuriating that you always lose when you shouldn't lose

1153
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:49,780
this thanks no well I didn't mean as in you're retarded I mean that you like you should by all

1154
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:55,940
accounts you've done the reading you've done you know you you're on bread tube like you know

1155
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:00,660
shit but there's just something about like people are just more excited to hear about like

1156
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:06,020
something that sounds right more than something that is right you know do you want me by that

1157
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:10,260
are we still talking about the animator or no no we're not talking about that at all no

1158
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:16,020
no I'm talking about I'm talking about political things on the PCP um see I don't know if I agree

1159
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:21,700
with that uh Nate Nate is not Nate's not convincing like I don't think anyone has been

1160
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:28,580
like convinced of anything by Nate like saying he believes it capitalism just sounds so right though

1161
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:38,340
it's sad it's not it doesn't I think I think a big okay I think a big big draw in the appeal

1162
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:45,860
of capitalism is that it sounds so like something about that feels so like well it's just human

1163
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:50,980
nature it's just human nature to want things and so why wouldn't we allow the obvious scenario to

1164
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:56,340
allow a system where people who want things to remind their own self-interest to acquire them

1165
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,980
like that sounds like so like oh of course of course of course I know well I don't know

1166
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:08,100
I don't know if I agree with you that it sounds like obviously true I think the appeal of it

1167
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:15,620
is that if true it require it means that like no action is required and like everything is by

1168
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:21,620
default working as it should and like we definitely don't have to think about it anymore

1169
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,500
I think that's the appeal of it

1170
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:31,060
um no I think a lot of like I think oh okay I think this is true of literally everyone like

1171
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:36,340
on on both sides but I think that like everyone wants like everyone like thinks that their side

1172
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:40,980
sounds the most reasonable like and like it's almost obvious in a way which I it thinks makes

1173
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:46,740
sense and I think a big part of what people cherish in these words debates is like when someone is

1174
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:51,940
able to explain something in such a way where I think there's like a socialist term for this but

1175
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:57,460
it's like it makes it seem where it's the only option not so that it's like the best option but

1176
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:02,740
it's like to do something else other than our system that we have currently it would be like

1177
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:07,700
against human nature it would it would be like this is so obviously the case this is so what

1178
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:13,940
has to happen there's nothing else even like possible yeah I think that's a big like a draw

1179
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,780
there I don't know draws like that's like the biggest thing I feel like you I feel like you've

1180
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:23,300
missed you've missed the point like you you think that because you've been told it like your whole

1181
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:29,620
life it's same with everyone like everyone's just been told that over and over again and now it just

1182
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:36,580
feels true um because everybody's heard it well maybe that is what I mean that like like I'm saying

1183
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:42,100
that it sounds so correct because we've been told yeah it's not it's yeah it sounds right

1184
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:46,660
because everyone has been told it their whole lives like that's all I'm saying they've learned to

1185
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:54,900
repeat it as a mantra yeah yeah sure yeah I mean that's that's definitely the case yeah and it's a

1186
01:33:54,900 --> 01:34:02,180
big problem uh that is uh ruining everything and it makes and it's you know when Nate like

1187
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:08,260
think when Nate thinks he wins an argument because he says the thing that like is like

1188
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:14,660
dogmatically accepted but by everyone by default because it's just that thing you say it's just

1189
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:19,460
that cliche that everyone repeats over and over again it's just like a platitude but everyone

1190
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:24,820
just accepts that it's true so if you you say it usually you automatically win because you said

1191
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:30,260
the thing that everyone know quote unquote knows is true that even you don't even have to think about

1192
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:39,860
it um it's amazing feels great what are we talking about uh I don't know I don't think we're

1193
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:43,140
talking about I think we're talking about that and be stopped because there's nothing else to say

1194
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:47,700
yeah that's all I have to say about that I'm in the nether been it's amazing

1195
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:54,020
is it it's I couldn't have asked for anything better great I think you ever could have dreamed

1196
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:57,940
why why are you in the nether what are you doing here why why are you playing the game stop it

1197
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:07,220
why why why why why no no no man uh I'm going to go get blaze rods so that we can go fight the

1198
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:12,980
nether dragon the nether dragon the dragon man we can go fight strawberry milk I'm not gonna go

1199
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:16,580
fight I'm not gonna fight the nether dragon you're not gonna help me you're not gonna you're on your

1200
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:21,460
own oh sad you stupid idiot well I guess it's just not in your self interest to do such a thing

1201
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:27,380
no definitely not it's the human nature doesn't allow for such a such an action

1202
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:32,180
no we tried the nether dragon before and you know I mean look at china

1203
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:41,140
look at venezuela 100 million dead you criticize capitalism yet yet you exist I love that political

1204
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:47,300
comment I don't know did we just did we just do exactly what we were talking about before did we

1205
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:53,460
just say an unreasonable interpretation of nate's argument we probably did he probably like no

1206
01:35:56,020 --> 01:36:02,020
no I I like stopped listening to the podcast a while ago so I don't know how like the things

1207
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:05,940
have changed so I'm like and that was like a while ago I think at this point like like

1208
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:10,580
I think like half a year ago at minimum so I don't know if that's like people have gotten like

1209
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:17,060
uh buff intellectually oh my god what the fuck is this that's terrifying um

1210
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:22,500
you know and people are now have the maximum intellect they've read all the theory in the

1211
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:28,740
entire world and now it's like a battle of undisputed masters of their opinion but last I

1212
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:35,060
checked it was just kind of like you know what we were just describing so I'm going off of that

1213
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:40,660
but maybe maybe things are better now I mean are they maybe now no everyone everyone always

1214
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:46,180
on the last episode everyone was like oh I saw this was just like a ben and nate episode so I clicked

1215
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:50,500
like oh thanks for the comments for letting me know not to watch this one

1216
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:57,220
um everybody hates it everybody hates the punch then why do you do it then why do you

1217
01:36:57,220 --> 01:37:05,860
talk about politics because it's mostly you and me um I just have to I just can't I just can't

1218
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:12,420
let people be wrong what like we define have to like who's like I guess it's it's you hate the fact

1219
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:18,260
that this is being spread so you would be it would be immoral of me not to correct wrong things

1220
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:25,300
that's it but if people hate it then then what what if you were to correct

1221
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:29,460
their problem that's their problem isn't it your problem because your entire

1222
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,460
line your entire but like you're all the success of this podcast rests upon public opinion

1223
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:36,980
um

1224
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:46,420
I guess well what do you want me to do uh I don't know if I want you to do anything but I'm saying

1225
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:52,020
if if people are like commenting on every episode being like this is gay I hate this die and then

1226
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:56,900
maybe you should be like oh well maybe I shouldn't do that anymore well I mean I'll I'll stop I'll stop

1227
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:04,020
I'll stop bringing it up when other people stop making bad faith arguments against me

1228
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:13,060
done they'll never happen because I know right that's right but that but that's what it's gonna take

1229
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:19,780
and if people want to not hear about it anymore then we should all just agree

1230
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:25,700
that I'm right yeah that I am correct and then and then there will be no more need for debate

1231
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:33,060
epic yeah um we were talking about on the my birthday stream we were talking about

1232
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:37,140
someone was like hey Ben you should debate destiny hey Ben you should debate destiny I was like

1233
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:43,860
I'm not good I'm not actually I don't actually think I'm good at debating yeah like I couldn't

1234
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:50,500
even I couldn't even really like claim like victory in the debate against digi and digi is

1235
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:57,140
definitely not a good debater so like I must not be great either no um I also think I mean I don't

1236
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:04,660
know I mean I I know this isn't what anyone really means but I still am like I have that sort of

1237
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:11,380
repulsion the idea of winning a debate even though I know it's practical I know what everyone

1238
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:17,380
means by it but there's something about it still makes me feel you know yeah I mean it's all very

1239
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:22,500
performative yeah and very like uh you know you just do it for that you do it to win the

1240
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:28,660
cloud or whatever oh you won you you you you you perform strength in front of people they saw

1241
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:36,580
you win and their your reputation points go up or whatever I I feel like like digi like

1242
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:45,300
most the time what he says is not stupid like did you just always needs an extra video to like

1243
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:49,060
respond to comments because I feel like this is the way it always goes with the digi digi says

1244
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:55,060
something which you have to be like a hardcore digi head to like understand what he means and

1245
01:39:55,060 --> 01:40:00,420
it will always be misinterpreted and then once everyone is like that's obviously retarded then

1246
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:04,980
digi will say what he actually means because he understands how to respond and like why people

1247
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:09,380
are misunderstanding and in that case it's always just he should just say what he actually

1248
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:13,620
means in the first place then he should but he doesn't know how to he doesn't know he doesn't

1249
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:18,020
get it he doesn't know I mean I think I think he would agree with what I'm saying or I think that

1250
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:24,500
he would agree no I agree that is generally how things go a lot of the time I think digi most

1251
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:32,580
the time says things are very reasonable he just needs an extra well when he yeah yeah most most

1252
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:40,420
of the time upon further explanation you go oh okay oh it's not yeah yeah yeah and that's always

1253
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:44,740
been a thing about him I that this is a bit as a whole entire life quest isn't it that he wants to

1254
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:53,700
be understood yeah he says so and why should we doubt him I don't know maybe we should maybe we

1255
01:40:53,700 --> 01:41:00,740
shouldn't maybe it's true who's to say though in this doggy dog world we'll never we'll never know

1256
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:06,980
we have we do we can only speculate this is oh Jesus Christ

1257
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:19,460
oh oh oh oh hey man how's the nettle treating you it's hot a hot are you gonna you're gonna

1258
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:25,300
beat the ender dragon uh yeah I think I can this minecraft's not that long wait really yeah right

1259
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:31,860
if I find some blaze rods and I beat some enderman then yeah why not how how long do you think it'll

1260
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:37,860
take you to beat the ender dragon or the never dragon well we'll see real boss ender ender

1261
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,900
well it's hard to say right because it's all random so feel you know I could get a really

1262
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:44,580
lucky spot where the stronghold is really close to me and in which it probably wouldn't take that

1263
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:48,260
much long at all but like you know I could get one where it's very very very far away from me so

1264
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:54,660
it might take a long time all right okay I guess we'll see I guess we will see

1265
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:02,660
um I want to get anything God I yeah so you you asked me if I was gonna have the um

1266
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:09,380
the the the slime and punishment finale done for the birthday yeah I said maybe and the

1267
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:17,140
truth about that is that I definitely could have had it done um but I didn't I just didn't do it and

1268
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:23,140
I mean part of that is because like I have I have basically I just like stopped communicating with

1269
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:30,980
like a couple of people who were going to be like providing stuff for it um like as in their lost

1270
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:38,740
causes oh no they're not lost causes I just like stopped oh it's a new thing it's a okay it's a

1271
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:44,020
it's a new thing it's a new thing I mean well Sixten was gonna make the song but like I didn't

1272
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:49,540
really vibe with the first song he made and he was like okay well if you want me to rewrite it

1273
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:53,940
I'd like to see like a storyboard and I'm like I don't really have a storyboard I kind of just

1274
01:42:53,940 --> 01:43:00,980
have to like make the video so I'll just do that because you've made it like a shitty version of

1275
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:06,020
of like just like a quick version so he would have known yeah I guess like I guess I could like

1276
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:11,540
sketch it out yeah that's what that's what a storyboard is Ben I know I know I know well like

1277
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:19,940
I could sketch out what I think it'll look like um I it might not end up looking exactly that way

1278
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:27,300
but I guess that's probably fine yeah yeah I don't know I feel like maybe I didn't like

1279
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:33,380
communicate exactly what I wanted to him and so when he turned to his song and it wasn't exactly

1280
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:40,260
what I had like imagined and so I was like oh what do I do oh god I can't deal with this

1281
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:47,540
I can't deal with my free labor not being completely exact I'm paying him for it oh well

1282
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:55,700
never mind that fuck that guy yeah um I've been um I've been paying everyone it feels good

1283
01:43:55,700 --> 01:44:04,820
it is I gave um I gave I paid um a oblivion fall something for like helping me do the audio on the

1284
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:13,060
JDR lecture I paid um shout out some money for like an animation for the something for the

1285
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:20,420
Chris Chan lecture that I'm planning on using um I'm gonna pay six and for making the track

1286
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:29,540
um I offered to pay um to Munich for a thing that she was making for the finale she said like

1287
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:38,340
she didn't want it I don't know uh we'll see we'll see about that just pissed myself um why

1288
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:39,940
just I was hit in the video game

1289
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:45,460
no no that sucks too I was damaged once

1290
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:54,260
bomber um anyway I don't know I made a bunch since I made all this money from the first kick

1291
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:57,620
starter from the very very first two kickstarter I feel like it would I feel like it would be

1292
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:03,940
unacceptable for me to like ask people to make me stuff just as a favor like even if it's not

1293
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:09,940
something I'm selling I don't know yeah I can't just be like hey make me a song for a video you

1294
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:17,780
know for free we're all we're all in this together we're all just pals um but I'm the one who benefits

1295
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:26,020
yeah no no no no um we I kind of like the fact that we're doing like well I mean I really like

1296
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:30,100
the fact that we're doing the kickstart the way that it is I like the fact that R2K is like a

1297
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:37,940
really fucking weird like experimental like community driven consensus nightmare where it's like

1298
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:42,980
everything is only real when the community says it is and we're running the kickstart like that

1299
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:50,180
like this yeah I got I mean I would be a little I would be a little annoyed if like

1300
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:58,660
everyone votes for like some dumb shit you know which I I think there might be like a couple

1301
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:04,500
there might be some like dumb shit that ends up getting made as if it's only a little bit I won't

1302
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:11,700
be too annoyed if it's like a lot of dumb shit I will like grumble about it like this is a waste

1303
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:20,260
well why is it a waste if that's what they want well okay but if there's like okay I like can't do

1304
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:26,020
this imagine we have like a imagine we have a hundred people that are like donating right we

1305
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:31,620
have a hundred people that are buying pins and like we do a vote and like you know a whole bunch

1306
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:38,420
of them vote for like something stupid they might vote for it and it might get passed but like

1307
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:44,740
what what if what if they all like vote for it because it's funny but they don't actually want it

1308
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:50,340
only maybe like five of them actually want like the funny meme design yeah so then we make like

1309
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:56,820
50 or a hundred of these things and remove like five of them and then we're stuck with like 45 pins

1310
01:46:56,820 --> 01:47:03,780
that only or 95 pins that only exist for the sake of like a meme like a joke like what do we do with

1311
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:12,900
these right I I um I feel maybe we can um like phrase the vote in a way that's like like if you're

1312
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:23,060
like do you think that we could do it so like a vote is not a vote basically is like a you you want

1313
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:28,260
to buy this right it's like this is something this isn't just something you're voting for on the

1314
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:34,020
for like this like you voting for this basically says like yeah if I have another like like I have

1315
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:40,660
another like credit to spend or whatever on a pin and like this is the design I want yeah um yeah

1316
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:46,660
um we could drive that home yeah I think it's probably implied but it'd be nice to reiterate

1317
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:53,940
yeah yeah I don't know no idea to get home if anyone who anyone who has like multiple like

1318
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:59,220
designs that they wanted probably would be voting that way anyway uh the only like if someone just

1319
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:03,300
bought like one pin maybe they just wanted like the ratty fucker cop kill he didn't care about

1320
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:08,260
anymore and so they just buy two and then they're like well you know I don't actually want anymore

1321
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:13,220
but I'm still voting yeah I guess I'll vote for something fun I don't know I can't you know I

1322
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:18,820
probably am like overthinking it and it won't be a huge deal or anything but you know I can't help

1323
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:27,780
but imagine the worst-case scenario um I give you a bunch of crap uh I I was sort of like I don't

1324
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:34,820
know I mean again like I like that okay this was a thing that the lecture heads the the the the

1325
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:38,180
people are people who want to say the brain deads because it's like born deads but like

1326
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:44,660
they're during the shamblers so it's like zombies right like you get it like brain yeah right I don't

1327
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:51,380
know the jury's still at but anyway they really really liked the like everything is only canon

1328
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:58,020
by consensus they really like latched onto that as like an idea and it was kind of like it's always

1329
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:04,580
been like that no no no I know I'm saying that they like that was like while I was going through

1330
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:11,460
the tour describing the districts they like really like appreciated that as like a core element of

1331
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:16,420
rfck and like a way where it's like I I mean you know it's always been the case but it's like I never

1332
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:21,460
really like thought of it as like yeah I guess that's like a defined characteristic of it and that's

1333
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:29,060
almost like an ideological theme of in this war in a way where it's like everything is up to only

1334
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:35,940
what people like believe is true like you know like there's so little to the actual game like

1335
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:43,540
like the only thing that makes it cool really is what people think about it right um it's it's

1336
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:51,300
like mob rule uh for the greater good um and it's it's epic and I really I I think that's just like

1337
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:58,820
real play yeah it is it's like we're running our own little commune over here hell yeah um

1338
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:04,180
there's a um I've talked I've talked about like the floraverse before you know what I'm you know

1339
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:12,980
what that is it's a comic isn't it it is it is not just a comic it is a um it's it's comics but like

1340
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:19,380
they had like community events where like um the one I remember was there was like there was like an

1341
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:26,420
event in the comic where like the basically like the the the the protagonists were basically

1342
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:32,260
going to be like fighting in a war and there was like a battle plan and like they had a community

1343
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:38,340
event where like people who read the comic got the opportunity to like they could like write stories

1344
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:45,700
or do art or like make videos or whatever that's sort of like it's like depict your character and

1345
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:51,540
like what what is there like you will get assigned to like a commander or something and like like

1346
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:58,580
make art of like your role in the battle right and like I think the creators ended up like featuring

1347
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:03,700
some and be like like these like these the ones that get featured become canon yeah right we don't

1348
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:08,020
even have we don't even have to like feature it yeah it's canon if people want it to be canon

1349
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:17,220
yeah it's like very like it it feels very cool that it's like a big part of this is even though like

1350
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:24,980
you know rck is like very tied into me and you in a way we don't have to be there for it to like

1351
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:30,820
make sense for defunction because it's so like community driven where it's like the appeal is

1352
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:37,140
like what you can do in this setting like we are almost like window dressing for the appeal in a way

1353
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:44,740
yeah yeah for sure it's like your your passion for the show or for us individually like that brings

1354
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:49,860
you here and with that now what are you going to do like what is going to transpire

1355
01:51:51,860 --> 01:52:00,420
and I really this is the sort of thing where this is what I'm thinking about uh in the what

1356
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:05,780
kind of stuff do I want to make now that I don't want to do like podcasts and stuff like that uh too

1357
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:12,180
often uh besides this one this one is special to me in rck is special but other than this one I

1358
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:19,060
don't want to do it and I think I really love the like experimental aspect of endless war and I

1359
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:23,380
really want to like do more stuff like it not just like make you know you could say that lonesome

1360
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:27,780
cactus is like endless war but I don't mean like in the I want to make more discord bots but like I

1361
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:34,340
really like I'm getting into like coding in a more like serious not just I can do python because I

1362
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:39,780
have to do it so that I can do endless war stuff like I really like it and I feel like it's the

1363
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:43,700
future in a way and that's the sort of stuff I want to do is I want to do more stuff that engages

1364
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:51,540
people in the weird sort of you know endless war is very democratic sort of it's only the people the

1365
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:57,220
updates do come out only you know are supplemental to the experience of endless war in a way like I

1366
01:52:57,220 --> 01:53:04,100
really like that I want to do more stuff like that that's where my head's at um that um I think it's

1367
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:08,100
the most like interesting part about it right that's like the thing that makes it cool everything

1368
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:14,580
else just like you know all right yeah it it does it I remember like reading that stuff about like

1369
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:19,300
this like fan driven portion of like the floor reverse and thinking like that's really weird

1370
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:25,380
like that's really cool like that's interesting I don't know I guess I like that like endless war

1371
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:34,500
has like some elements of that to it um but more yeah um but with less porn unfortunately

1372
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:40,740
unfortunately there's not as much four versus a lot of porn canon porn made by v creators uh I've

1373
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:46,020
seen it it's a cool art style I like it it is a cool art style but so I think it's really good

1374
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,340
whoever draws it I forget their name

1375
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:58,980
I I can't I need to get a hose so I can do farming how long have we been going

1376
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:03,780
let's find fucking plum to uh at least two I think maybe like two and a half hours what I don't

1377
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:08,900
we're we're we're doing the edge of two hours right now we're on the edge of two hours okay

1378
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:16,660
um god it really took us till seven to start yeah ball cool um

1379
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:24,740
I don't know what do we what have we not discussed what's been getting mad lately

1380
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:28,100
let's let's just get into the things that make us mad because that's where all my brain powers

1381
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:36,420
going now it is great um do you want to start do you have something um oh god I have to think

1382
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:41,060
about it I asked that question without any indication that would come back around to me uh

1383
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:49,060
hmm I feel like I've been doing nothing but talking about what makes me mad makes me mad

1384
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:53,620
well I hate I going back to what we were talking about the very beginning I hate

1385
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:59,860
I hate school now because it's remote and dumb now and I'm painful that's awful it's really

1386
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:05,140
terrible that's bullshit it's totally bullshit it's like it's unacceptable like they're not

1387
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:10,020
giving you the fucking product you paid for no not at all like no like specifically like if you

1388
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:15,540
want to roll back the clock and go into old pcp episodes like the biggest thing is I wanted to

1389
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:20,020
be around other like new people and I wanted to have teachers one-on-one talk to me and like

1390
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:25,220
that's not that like both of those things are like not happening anymore it's like it's it's

1391
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:30,740
only the boring stupid parts that like I like like it's only the parts where I thought well

1392
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:35,620
it's for the greater good it's but it's now there is no greater good and it's just is only terrible

1393
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:45,780
yeah um I hate I hate how do I make quotes how do I do this guys in chat chat let me know

1394
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:54,180
let me watch do you chat is it this it is that epic um so I'm mad about that I'm mad about like

1395
01:55:55,140 --> 01:56:01,780
mad about fucking like everyone you know what okay all right here's the thing I felt like this

1396
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:05,940
way for a long time I think I've said this in a few podcasts before but and I don't know how

1397
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:09,540
legitimate it is I don't know how much it is in my own head but I feel like I don't know anyone I

1398
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:14,340
feel like no one knows me I don't mean that isn't like no one's smart enough to appreciate my

1399
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:18,100
intellect I mean that in the sense that it's like I can talk to no one about anything that I care

1400
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:25,300
about ever like I like I feel like I have been so I guess I guess it's my fault in a way where it's

1401
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:29,700
like I've been like a very like isolated person for a lot of my life and like especially for like a

1402
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:36,580
lot of my life leading up to like going to college and like talking to more people like I feel like

1403
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:42,420
I have developed in ways that other people have not not say that I have done it more but just like

1404
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:47,860
I have different interests than like everyone that I talk to and it feels terrible when I have to

1405
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:52,740
like inner pot like or not inner podcast but in our like discord chats and I have to talk to people

1406
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:58,020
and like remember that like I only am friends with like gamers and shit and it's like oh I have

1407
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:03,780
nothing to say and it is terrible and I want to die I don't know if I don't like when I think about

1408
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:08,660
these it's it flips us between why isn't everyone like me and I'm like why am I not like anyone else

1409
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:16,420
it flips us between itself and then extrinsic man versus world man versus itself that's that's my

1410
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:24,100
hatred that's my main hatred do you ever feel like you like you feel like I don't know no one else

1411
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:27,620
gets it no one else understands no one else likes things that are good everyone else likes things

1412
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:35,220
that are stupid and I can't talk to anyone yeah sure constantly epic I was just thinking that

1413
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:46,660
about you cool hmm um what do you what would um what would you find satisfying what would make

1414
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:51,540
you feel what would make you feel better well here you know what that but before we talk about that

1415
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:55,220
here I'm gonna leave this into saying things that will people will have an emotional grip to this

1416
01:57:55,220 --> 01:58:02,020
now because okay here's the thing about the pcp and here's like the unfortunate truth about the

1417
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:07,780
pcp and like here's how to fix it quote-unquote and the most unhelpful way possible is that you

1418
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:12,260
can't quote-unquote fix it because again I guess it's not broken and you know it's not it's not

1419
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:17,460
that bad but what people say like people when people say oh I miss topics they're like they

1420
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:22,740
they miss the sort of cohesion they miss the sort of like you know what this podcast is about a

1421
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:27,140
certain thing this podcast is about and everyone has like stuff contribute here's the thing that

1422
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:31,700
matters most in podcasts is the conversation and people like having interesting things to say about

1423
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:36,340
you know to one another in the conversation that is transpiring and the reason why people

1424
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:41,060
dislike the pcp or at least why I think so is because the conversations usually feel pretty

1425
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:45,540
shallow because most people are doing different things like we aren't usually like okay here's

1426
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:49,940
how the pcp used to happen again when I was on and when I observed it might have changed by now

1427
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:54,580
but it's like you and bin talk about or I'm sorry you and Nate talk about politics for a while and

1428
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:59,300
you guys have something to say about that so it's like you know it is a conversation and it's cool

1429
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:03,780
and then it's Nate and Tom talk about video game news for a little while and then they have something

1430
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:09,940
to say about that but it's kind of like two pairs of people like constantly like reversing and

1431
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:15,460
switching off about like the one thing that they have in common it's never like a big cohesive

1432
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:19,780
like group conversation talking about similar things because not everyone's on the same page

1433
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:23,460
anymore and that's not something to be fixed or like oh you know like fuck the pcp like it sucks

1434
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:27,060
and we have to fix it because there's nothing to be fixed about it it's just that people are

1435
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:31,300
different now and we are no longer all my little pony reviewers who are all in the same cultural

1436
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:36,740
sphere and that just is the way that people grow apart from another but that's that's what I'm feeling

1437
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:41,540
that's the sadness that I get is that I don't know anyone anymore and we all don't be like I don't care

1438
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:46,100
about fucking video game twitter you know I don't care about that so I have nothing to contribute

1439
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:51,060
in those conversations um and I have nothing to contribute in other conversations like that where

1440
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:58,260
it's like well it's just what I was saying yeah that uh I so what would make me feel better

1441
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:03,460
is I guess getting new friends that's that sounds like a rejection of the old friends they don't

1442
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:08,900
mean in a way but like I don't know it's hard it's hard to make friends that you actually want to

1443
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:16,660
because the the entire like what's the words like I don't know it's just hard it's just hard to go

1444
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:21,860
out there and try and meet new people uh when you're so yeah especially considering uh quarantine

1445
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:26,340
yeah exactly so you you can't you have to I I've I've long considered going on like forums and trying

1446
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:31,380
to become like a forum person but like I don't know those days are behind me and my my days role

1447
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:38,500
playing pokemon are behind me um I tried getting to I like really tried really really hard to get

1448
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:43,140
into reddit I just could never get it into my like I don't know I could not get addicted to reddit in

1449
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:48,500
the way that I wanted to where I really wanted to like prowl around subreds and like get involved

1450
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:53,620
with that community but I was always just repulsed by like the UI of reddit and I just hated it but

1451
02:00:55,140 --> 02:01:04,740
yeah uh I mean I I tried you know for a while there I was trying to like go out to like a

1452
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:10,020
fucking comics club and stuff trying to like meet people that way didn't work yeah didn't

1453
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:16,260
like with anything I completely agree do I I like try like a big part of like it like

1454
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:21,860
oh I already made it okay never mind um I I tried really hard to go into a lot of clubs and at my

1455
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:28,100
school and you you went to a club um and it was a nightmare and they were all like that it was

1456
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:33,460
pretty funny it was pretty funny though um I guess I guess I guess that I guess that is a

1457
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:39,540
word in the English language hmm um nightmare but yeah it was like

1458
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,860
I don't know I feel like I don't click with anyone and it's a nightmare and there's nothing to be

1459
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:50,500
said I guess or done about it uh but that's just that's one of the things that's why I'm angry

1460
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:54,660
that is the thing that I'm angry about always now is that that's relatable I feel that way all

1461
02:01:54,660 --> 02:02:00,180
the time even before before quarantine I felt that way and it's become all the more acute now

1462
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:07,700
I feel that hard core but you know hard core okay so there's like degrees of this right where it's

1463
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:11,060
like with like a date like I know nothing in common with Nate like I don't do anime or like

1464
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:14,740
video games or stuff really and that's and say that I don't like it but like you know he's one of

1465
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:19,540
the the ones that I'm most far removed from in in the way that I'm describing right now

1466
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:24,420
for the sake of demonstration but like you and me do talk and stuff like we do hang out in person

1467
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:30,820
so like you know or we did well yeah sure but I'm saying that uh what do you want to talk about Ben

1468
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:36,500
you know we we we are not so far gone that it's not worth it to even try to uh accommodate one

1469
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:42,260
other what do you want to talk about I'll I'll get into some stuff what do you want um we were

1470
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:47,140
doing audible and stuff for a while we were both into books oh you know I I told you that I started

1471
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:53,860
listening to um the bullshit jobs I never finished it I think I like halfway halfway through

1472
02:02:54,660 --> 02:03:05,860
yeah that's a thing though right that's pretty cool um um um um um yeah I don't know there's

1473
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:12,580
nothing new there's nothing new to report over here um well I'm saying what what kind of animal

1474
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:18,020
crossing I guess I'm saying what kind of things that you do you wish that people would talk about

1475
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:24,180
or that you wish that you like like what like on what way do you wish that people were more on the

1476
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:33,700
same like cultural level than you and like yeah that um I I guess I I wish that like um

1477
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:40,180
I wish that like when I when I went to like uh the comics round table or something people were

1478
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:45,460
talking about like I wish people were talking about it in a more specific way I wish people were like

1479
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:52,660
there to like first of all I wish people were more like serious about it I wish people were like

1480
02:03:54,260 --> 02:04:01,700
better I wish people were there to like collaborate or like work together in some way

1481
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:07,940
to like pool our resources instead of just to kind of like bullshit about like oh yeah here's like

1482
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:12,260
the newest thing I don't know the things that they were there to work on were like

1483
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:19,700
planning on like which like cons to go to and like I don't care about that yeah um

1484
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:29,220
I don't know they just yeah I don't know I would like for I would like to meet people that were like

1485
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:36,500
in your field they were serious about like doing the kind of things that I do and were like interested

1486
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:42,980
in like yeah working together and like doing something so you want to meet more web comics

1487
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:49,780
people is what you're saying well I don't know I mean I guess uh yet well I think a big part of

1488
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:54,580
the comics round table right is that it's like a lot of people who are meeting in person so there's

1489
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:58,900
gonna be a lot of like you know what cons do we go to you know like with our bodies because we're

1490
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:07,380
human beings but yeah that might not like um I say that I say that but like at the same time um

1491
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:17,540
I don't know I don't even know like what I don't really know like what I would like want to work

1492
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:21,620
with people I don't know I guess if they were like well it's not about working way it's just

1493
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:26,980
talking about it's just or like maybe it would be cool if like somebody had like a zine or something

1494
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:31,140
and someone was like looking for like stuff to like put in a zine and I could be like hey I could

1495
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:38,100
make stuff for your zine or some shit like that I don't know you know what the greatest service

1496
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:44,260
we've given to the rfck audiences is that we've created a fandom for them to exist in because

1497
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:53,380
there's nothing nothing better than being a part of a fandom those like that is the ideal state of

1498
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:59,540
a human being you know people in the wild like like a like a Russoian man in the jungle longs be a part

1499
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:04,420
of the homesuck fandom like that's their biggest like what in the world outside of like shelter

1500
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:10,100
to their mazla's hierarchy of needs yeah exactly because it's so home stuck fandom is home stuck

1501
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:15,300
fandom because it's when you're in a fandom right it's just big enough where you get like a big

1502
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:22,100
like display of like a large uh diverse sort of you know there's a lot of different types of artists

1503
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:25,940
who will want to allow different types of things you know it's a very it's big enough where you get

1504
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:30,660
that diversification that goes with civilization then you it's also small enough and you have such

1505
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:34,260
a thing in common with one another where it's easy to make friends and easy to talk to one other

1506
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:40,900
able easy to find people you can google search like carcat anime music video yowie big cock version

1507
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:49,700
two and then you'll get like 15 different results and it'll be epic um right sure but i mean that

1508
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:55,220
that's like the coolest thing and i wish i was a part of a fandom because okay go on go like every

1509
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:59,780
like weekly my little point episodes you tune in every week and then you have like a whole bunch

1510
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:06,660
of new fan stuff to do amazing you know and one of us is a homesuck update there's another whole

1511
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:13,300
round of videos and arts and stuff to do the homesick was crazy about it uh i missed that i want

1512
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:17,220
that how do i get into it without having to deal with new shows which are bad and stupid and i hate it

1513
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:23,220
that's the goal that's the goal for that i think i think that's like the way forward for me is i

1514
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:35,380
need to become a part of a fandom and then just redo that um i um i would be like you know something

1515
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:41,140
like um that like like the dsa or that like like socialist club that you were like that we tried to

1516
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:47,060
go to the meeting of like i feel like if something like that were good it would be really great

1517
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:56,100
but i have the suspicion that it would suck yeah and be boring i mean i don't know but like what like

1518
02:07:56,100 --> 02:08:00,900
what do what do you what do they do yeah what do you think they actually just sit around and talk

1519
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:10,820
about shit and like there's i mean i assume there's no real like action probably probably not um

1520
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:19,940
i don't know but like maybe maybe that just means there's nothing there's nothing to do

1521
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:24,660
you just you just gotta like lay just just lay down and die actually like what's the point you know

1522
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:30,180
there's nothing to be done you just give up you have merry weather surely can meet more

1523
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:40,260
webcomics people like that and then merry weather doesn't like no i don't know the i mean yeah i know

1524
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:49,620
merry weather but like he is just kind of he i don't know what does it like what exactly does

1525
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:54,820
that get me access to i'm saying that he's a part of the greater webcomic sphere i mean and he's

1526
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:59,380
particularly well known at that as far i mean i don't know but i i think he's a particularly well

1527
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:05,700
well known as that and you mean i know him and me yeah exactly so you can use that point that

1528
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:10,180
data point in your network to think about cynically and try and reach out to more people try and get

1529
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:15,140
more involved with him and then you'll meet more people merry weather is like a very well connected

1530
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:24,660
guy there you go well no well no don't there you go me because like what what what does it

1531
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:31,380
what does it do for me what what do i take and do with that information what you take and do with

1532
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:34,820
that is become better friends with merry weather and then when you were better friends with merry

1533
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:38,260
weather first of all you may enjoy his company as a friend but if you want to think about extremely

1534
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:41,700
cynically you can become better friends with merry weather to get access to his greater network

1535
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:46,660
through collaborations and stuff like when you were just like you were just saying where

1536
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:51,540
you may be able to meet people through calls and stuff like that and through just me and then while

1537
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:55,460
being his friend you're able to meet more people that you would be able to collaborate with and do

1538
02:09:55,460 --> 02:10:02,660
stuff like that zine that hypothetical zine i don't want to like i don't want to come off as like

1539
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:09,140
just poo pooing you out of hand or anything but this is like this this is giving me this is giving

1540
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:15,940
me like pound of pavement vibes like it's network like oh it's just like just network and make

1541
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:22,580
connections and like and and do what you know well like who like like what what what's the play here

1542
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:28,020
like i go hey merry weather hey merry weather uh introduce introduce me to some like well connected

1543
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:35,140
like like artist people and then he's like oh yeah okay okay here here's um here's um the guy who

1544
02:10:35,140 --> 02:10:42,740
does like that that one that everyone's heard and i go oh cool cool cool and i say hey uh i'm ben i

1545
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:48,020
drew some comics and they go like oh yeah cool um that's cool i also draw some and i go yeah i know

1546
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:56,820
i've heard about your stuff and they go oh cool nice like okay and like i don't know well well

1547
02:10:56,900 --> 02:11:02,660
okay if you have no want to meet other people in the field then yeah okay then there's no point

1548
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:06,500
but i thought you were just saying that you wanted to talk to more people who were taking

1549
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:10,820
webcomic seriously i thought that i thought that was the whole impetus for this conversation um

1550
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:21,780
i i don't maybe maybe i would maybe if i had more like wait dude i'm gonna milk a cow i'm gonna

1551
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:26,900
milk a cow dude shut the fuck up dude shut the fuck maybe if i have i got milk raw got milk dude

1552
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:32,500
yeah more regular contact with people who are doing that kind of thing maybe it would occur to me

1553
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:41,940
like what to do with such in such just scenario oh as it stands i have like no like i have no like

1554
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:50,900
goal or i have no like oh this is what i need to do like here here's how i like take it to the

1555
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:57,940
next level like i have no idea you're you're you're a very even steven sturdy person been your

1556
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:02,660
horizons when i feel like whenever we have a show where like what are we doing guys where

1557
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:06,420
you want to go i feel like you're you're always like i just want to do what i'm doing right now

1558
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:10,980
because i'm having fun and it's cool and i'm i'm perfectly fine where i am i feel like that's

1559
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:14,980
always your responses you don't want to you want like right now you don't want to meet new people

1560
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:19,700
you just want to hang out not to say that's even a bad thing that just seems to be always the case

1561
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:28,980
well maybe it sounds like that but um i don't know i do feel kind of like isolated i guess i do

1562
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:33,860
you know i don't know i i'm like i have two minds about it because like i have like talked to other

1563
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:42,820
like i've talked to other like webcomics people and like they're usually like fine but like i'm not

1564
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:48,420
generally that interested in what they're doing and like they're like only like marginally interested

1565
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:52,900
in what i'm doing and it's like okay well i guess we know each other all right you just keep doing

1566
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:59,780
what you're doing i'll just keep doing what i'm doing you know whatever and um so i don't know

1567
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:06,900
like i i guess like i i would like to know more people like that but like i have when i have done

1568
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:13,460
it in the past it's just been like uh well uh all right see you i think i get what you mean like

1569
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:18,260
it's easy to want that in the abstract but like the steps it would take to require to get to

1570
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:23,780
a point where you have like a good friend that you're able to like confer and like that it seems

1571
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:30,900
like the kind of thing that i ought to want and maybe be like striving for but i do not know what

1572
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:38,500
the end goal of it is we're not the end goal be companionship and and someone's shoulder to cry on

1573
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:48,500
and um fellowship in men i mean sure yes but uh like

1574
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:55,860
i mean that's like um that's like oh but what if you made a new best friend it's like well i don't

1575
02:13:55,860 --> 02:14:04,660
know what what if i did yeah you can't like set out to do that i i guess it is sort of like a

1576
02:14:04,660 --> 02:14:10,820
almost inherently selfish sort of thing because i'm always like i always am desperate for someone

1577
02:14:10,820 --> 02:14:16,740
i can talk about history with not talk to someone about his like you know i did the the lecture and

1578
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:22,340
that was like cool but not at all what is a satiety thing where it's like instead of you know like

1579
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:26,180
describing something to someone i want to like you know discuss it with someone i can't do that to

1580
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:31,700
someone who have just regurgitated information to like i've always wanted that but it's like

1581
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:37,060
you can't just like manufacture someone like like really like the the reason i would want that is so

1582
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:41,780
that i can say things to them and then have them hear my thoughts and be able to understand them

1583
02:14:41,780 --> 02:14:46,500
like it like i say that i want someone to discuss it with and have them what the there's a little

1584
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:50,900
cold going on over here uh so that they will be able to understand and like parse what i'm saying

1585
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:54,500
to them but in a way it's also very selfish because it's like well i want them to be able to

1586
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:59,700
parse it so that i can speak to what's in my head like i have things that i want to say to them

1587
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:04,980
right now and i want them to listen to me i get like i guess it's selfish in that way do you want

1588
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:13,380
to be listened to or do you want to be talked to well i i want it it's two things i like i can't

1589
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:18,420
i can't talk to someone in the sense that i can't like you know i meet someone i just want my friends

1590
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:22,740
and they don't know anything about history and i say hey let me relate to you this tale that has

1591
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:26,100
happened once like i don't want to do that because that's bored and there's no reason for me to just

1592
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:30,740
like talk someone's ear off of that something they don't understand but i do want to talk to someone

1593
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:35,140
who does get it like you know someone who knows what i want to discuss about so that we can have

1594
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:40,020
it like a conversation about it because i have a lot of like thoughts about history but i can't

1595
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:43,940
talk to anyone about it because none of them know anything about it so you know there's no

1596
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:47,620
there's no conversation to be had but those conversations would be selfish in the sense

1597
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:51,780
where it's like i want to talk to someone else about history i want them to understand what

1598
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:55,540
i'm talking about so that i can say all these things i've been on my mind but i've not been able to

1599
02:15:56,100 --> 02:16:00,020
express anyone else because no one gets their cares you know what i mean do you understand

1600
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:08,900
um kind of maybe a bit well there

1601
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:16,980
but like you can't like it's you can't just like say to someone like hey get into this like genre

1602
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:22,100
of like human experience please so that i can talk to you about it like it's not you know

1603
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:28,180
you can't convince anyone to do something like that no you've got to find someone who's already

1604
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:33,780
into it yeah exactly and and then you have to in order to do that you have to like plot around

1605
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:40,180
r slash history and it's stupid and dumb and i hate that place and i guess i guess i feel like um

1606
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:46,020
you know since i'm like a comics guy i should have like comics friends but i have like i kind of

1607
02:16:46,100 --> 02:16:51,780
have like very little to say about my comics like outside of the like the comics themselves

1608
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:57,140
you know it's just like fucking Hideaki ono and even galleon it's like you know he said what he

1609
02:16:57,140 --> 02:17:04,020
wanted to say by making the comic he doesn't have like there's not like he doesn't need to like go

1610
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:09,700
and like talk about them or like explain what he means like they just speak for themselves

1611
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:15,300
like all the stuff that i make i feel like it speaks for itself i don't need to like discuss it

1612
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:22,820
you know so um maybe that's like a weakness well i i feel like i feel like ben what's

1613
02:17:22,820 --> 02:17:27,460
happening here is that you know that you should want human connection but you don't actually care

1614
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:31,860
and you just have this husk of an idea in your brain that it's good to have those things but you

1615
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:36,660
don't actually care at all is what it seems like like it's like when you say these things like but

1616
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:40,740
like what would be the point of talking to other people well the point to me would be you're talking

1617
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:45,940
to other people and that like that is the point in it of itself but it's not an inherent that's

1618
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:54,980
not an inherent good to me it is but i that's just the difference um it can be good sometimes talking

1619
02:17:54,980 --> 02:18:00,260
to other people sucks well okay yeah but that's because those people suck and you shouldn't be

1620
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:03,540
talking to them like if you're talking to someone in the conversation is bad and you don't like that

1621
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:10,900
person then you just don't talk to them well sure easy i mean definitely definitely uh

1622
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:20,260
okay what have you learned i tell you know what good question i i tell you boy i tell you well

1623

1653
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:46,900
yes it is three which i was i found it annoying at first but then i started playing it's like

1654
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:52,260
i actually got like a big leg up because like my roommate had already he had already found he

1655
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:56,660
already started planting a bunch of like resources that i needed to craft some tools that i needed

1656
02:21:56,660 --> 02:22:02,820
like um he already had some stone for me to make an axe out of and he had like wood that i could

1657
02:22:02,820 --> 02:22:08,260
make a ladder which is like apparently he had to run around without a ladder for a while which

1658
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:12,500
must have been like so annoying because it means you can't climb cliffs so like half of the island

1659
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:19,300
would have been off limits to him jesus yeah um he built he built like some bridges he built he was

1660
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:25,940
he's in the middle of building a ramp up like the hill that's pretty cool yeah so like i have benefited

1661
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:33,220
i have benefited from his efforts and also like um it's just kind of cool like we're on the same

1662
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:38,420
island like we can like um like leave shit on each other's lawns actually like a bunch of people at

1665
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:58,420
trash mountain he has like junk and like boxes and like cardboard boxes and just like life

1666
02:22:58,420 --> 02:23:04,260

1698
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:38,980
happen if i slayed a cow anything anything else happening ben anything going on do you think

1699
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:42,420
do you think we're gonna survive to see another radcon do you think we're gonna see another radcon

1700
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:47,940
before uh we're we're running out of dodge and the pcp crumbles like the usyrian empire and we are

1701
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:53,060
all scattered across the air we always think the pcp is gonna crumble it probably never will

1702
02:26:53,940 --> 02:27:00,420
no i mean there have been times in the past when we like it it actually seemed like the pcp might

1703
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:06,740
just like be over soon or we're everyone's gonna get sick of it i actually don't win like when when

1704
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:13,220
would it hasn't happened yet um i don't think i've ever actually seriously there's ever actually

1705
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:19,140
been like seriously on the table at least i've never thought so uh because there's been no reason

1706
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:23,540
like like it's like it there's no reason to leave the pcp there's no reason for the pcp to end there's

1707
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:27,860
no reason to not be on the pcp like there's no reason well that's how i feel that's how i feel now

1708
02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:35,300
yeah how i feel now i don't know um shit when was i feel like there were like not that recently

1709
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:40,020
i don't know maybe it was back in like the monkey era it seemed like it seemed like man this

1710
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:44,340
shit is getting like this shit is getting heated she's getting toxic maybe she like shouldn't be

1711
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:50,980
here anymore really damn there were there were times but like you know i was never like on the

1712
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:59,220
verge of like handing in my tenuring my resignation letter or anything um i guess it's not it's i guess

1713
02:27:59,220 --> 02:28:04,100
there were times i had the sense that like this this shit is not going to go on for like another

1714
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:11,540
year like what are we even going to do for another year uh same thing that's oh yeah i mean the

1715
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:16,420
question the answer to that is just like what we've done every year well we do every night pinky

1716
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:26,660
mm-hmm um what do you think okay radcon five do you think we should do anything different

1717
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:33,700
like having done radcon four and that we all agree like it went by really fast i there are two things

1718
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:39,620
felt insubstantial i i think there's anything yes yes 100 i've been thinking about this i think

1719
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:45,060
there are two things number one we have to force everyone they have to have like a gentleman's agreement

1720
02:28:45,060 --> 02:28:51,300
where your your lecture has to be like 99 done when you come or like very like you have to

1721
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:57,140
like your lecture like you know that's fair i i really wish i had like i i meant to prepare mine

1722
02:28:57,140 --> 02:29:03,940
ahead of time but then i forgot that i had yet i had to do like the group shot art and so i spent

1723
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:09,300
like the last couple days before radcon doing that otherwise i would have been like doing all the

1724
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:15,460
notes and stuff for the year and i would have had it done um not yet like me and you specifically

1725
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:20,820
just because we i don't know just do whatever same chances we took a long time to do like to

1726
02:29:20,820 --> 02:29:26,740
make the notes and do the stuff for our lectures and uh it was a lot of time wasted and it sucked

1727
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:33,540
and i feel ashamed and it won't happen again uh and i i was i was doing the research for my

1728
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:39,860
lecture but like i don't even know what it was it just felt like like i was i think it's because

1729
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:44,500
like history it's like that's a big area where like a big thing is you don't want to be inaccurate

1730
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:47,220
when you say something like you don't want to fuck up when you're saying something about a history

1731
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:52,100
or else you know your ball is going to be ripped off uh so like there's a lot of like moments where

1732
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:56,500
it's like i i think i can just talk off the cup about this because i think i remember it pretty

1733
02:29:56,500 --> 02:30:02,340
well and then like you know i i would be like well let's make sure uh and so i would spend like a

1734
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:09,220
fucking hour researching just make sure i did everything correctly um uh i'm scared i'm scared

1735
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:13,860
of my lecture i'm oh well actually before we get into that so number one we make sure that all of

1736
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:19,620
our ideas you know our lectures and notes are taken and we're ready to like go um but also

1737
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:23,860
we i want to do like a really fucking long i just want i just want to be as long as fucking i want

1738
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:28,420
to be like like a month like two three weeks i want like a long rad con

1739
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:37,140
um you you see want to be longer yeah i want to be longer and for us to come into it with all of

1740
02:30:37,140 --> 02:30:43,620
our stuff so we can just have like like days upon days to work and just to do like record stuff i

1741
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:50,900
yeah longer i mean it would it makes it cost more to like stay longer but yeah i do in hindsight

1742
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:55,860
i do wish it had been longer ten ten days didn't feel like enough no not at all

1743
02:30:57,700 --> 02:31:03,540
so do it i do so i would i would like i think that we should do it we we kind i mean we kind of

1744
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:07,380
did it at the time that we did and for the length that we did because it was around when i would be

1745
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:14,180
able to for school um and so i think that next time i think we should just do it next summer

1746
02:31:14,180 --> 02:31:18,100
and like so i'm able to come you know selfish so i can come for as long as possible i think we

1747
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:22,260
should do it for like seriously like two to three weeks like i think we should do like a long like

1748
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:27,140
a fucking like radcon five like sabbatical it should be like a big deal like we were at there for

1749
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:39,220
like a while um at radcon five yeah yeah like how long two to three weeks man three weeks god damn

1750
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:45,460
two two two three you know around around that but yeah oh a lot two weeks is a lot i mean i

1751
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:50,980
guess ten days is a pretty long time two weeks is a long time well i mean it's four more days

1752
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:57,380
than we were there which yeah you're right you're right just that's like that's half of a month uh

1753
02:31:57,380 --> 02:32:03,940
yeah but but but think about how like if we like okay next radcon we will probably have more things

1754
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:10,340
like the ova like we know we'll probably have a thing like that for next radcon so if we just like

1755
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:14,260
and theoretically given the more time we could get more ambitious just keep it the thing as it is but

1756
02:32:14,260 --> 02:32:21,140
like we could directly like have like i don't know again more stuff more obligations and stuff we

1757
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:26,980
have to do so having us be there for much longer just allow for more things to promise the kick

1758
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:31,700
start and more like opportunities for us to record things other than you know the two big things

1759
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:38,180
we're able to do now than just like a fuck ton of lectures and streams i'm i don't know i'm

1760
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:44,020
undecided on how i think about this how do you think radcon went i think i'm second guess

1761
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:49,940
in myself by what by what metric by like house like i guess like i guess this could mean anything

1762
02:32:49,940 --> 02:32:54,740
but like how successful like do you think that we yeah that could mean well i think in terms of

1763
02:32:54,740 --> 02:33:00,660
like the stuff that we made it was a big success like that we made good stuff yeah do you think we

1764
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:08,820
made enough you know it does like because it feels like it was over too soon i feel like

1765
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:14,980
there was more we could have made but when i think back on it like it's not like we wasted a whole

1766
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:21,460
lot of the time like people were working on their stuff or like doing their stuff like most of the

1767
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:29,380
time so like i can't really feel like oh we could have we could have done more i do i do feel like

1768
02:33:29,380 --> 02:33:38,900
we made good use of the time um yeah i think the only i think the only thing was there wasn't

1769
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:45,220
there wasn't enough like unstructured like downtime i mean there were streams there were casual streams

1770
02:33:45,220 --> 02:33:52,180
but those were like those are not the same as just like hanging out and you're kind of on during

1771
02:33:52,180 --> 02:33:57,300
them a little bit even the sleepy ones it's it's interesting that you say that i i feel like that's

1772
02:33:57,300 --> 02:34:03,940
a very unbeen same thing to say why because i feel like we've had conversations like this before

1773
02:34:03,940 --> 02:34:09,220
where it's like i feel like you i mean we were just saying earlier about how uh you don't have to

1774
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:14,020
fake it to be on a show like i would i would imagine that you would feel like being on a stream

1775
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:17,700
would be the same thing as talking to us normally no that's not what i said what i said was that

1776
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:26,580
like i'm my genuine self but i do like bring extra energy to it i do kind of like you know

1777
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:33,540
i do like um try and like present like a higher like energy like the most engaging version

1778
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:41,060
of myself which does require some some amount of like effort this does require some mental

1779
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:52,340
energy not like a lot but like it's just being on a stream is not like just hanging out in private

1780
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:58,500
yeah well i definitely agree yeah oh i felt that if i'm stupid and we didn't we didn't really do a

1781
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:04,580
lot of just hanging out in any like context that wasn't like on a stream we were always either

1782
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:09,540
like working on getting something ready that we were planning on doing or we were or we were on

1783
02:35:09,540 --> 02:35:16,820
stream meaning you hung out my bedroom a lot weirdly led red con um three we just hung out yeah yeah

1784
02:35:17,700 --> 02:35:25,220
i feel like that's like what red con four was missing yeah well that and like coming up with

1785
02:35:25,220 --> 02:35:31,380
like shit that like no one had thought like like 10 paces in draw like we just came up with that

1786
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:35,780
like while we were there yeah and then we just did it and i feel like that fact that it was like a

1787
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:44,100
new thing that we were sort of like envisioning and then executing made it feel new and like made

1788
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:53,540
the process feel like more memorable and therefore it like seems longer in memory maybe um i imagine

1789
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:58,340
it's a lot of like warped like what we perceive to have been longer like you are only at red

1790
02:35:58,340 --> 02:36:04,340
con three for like nothing like you were there for like half of it so like it was definitely

1791
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:08,500
longer like right on four was definitely like objectively longer especially for you but like

1792
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:14,660
it didn't feel it didn't feel longer yeah even for me and i've said that over and over again

1793
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:20,740
but it's true it's weird but it's true and it's very i i really just think it comes down to the

1794
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:26,660
fact that like more of the time at red con four was like structured and being used deliberately

1795
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:33,300
yeah and made it go made it makes it not really like sticking my memory very much because like i

1796
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:38,660
was focused on accomplishing a specific task i don't know if this is a good dichotomy to do you

1797
02:36:38,660 --> 02:36:45,620
to work in but like red con three had a lot of like mid level content where there's a lot of

1798
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:51,780
like sequels to shows that we were doing already um so there's like the the hippos jrpg series and

1799
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:55,860
then um like you know potty cast and stuff like that at red con three there's a lot of like medium

1800
02:36:55,860 --> 02:37:00,020
level stuff like that where people were constantly recording like kind of just like new installments

1801
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:07,780
of series but here it was like non-stop just like the highest level like lectures um kicks

1802
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:14,180
our obligations like the big shit like it was not well well i mean there were um there was

1803
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:19,620
mid-level stuff like there was um the digi like interviews those are cool i wish you had gotten

1804
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:25,060
one i wish yeah i wish i had gotten to do one too i he had meant to do it with everyone but we

1805
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:31,860
just ran out of time i mean i guess i could do one anytime if you wanted to reach out we wouldn't

1806
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:40,100
have to be in person and there was like the um the weed or the two two toks in a bloke uh was a thing

1807
02:37:41,380 --> 02:37:47,700
i guess i would call that mid-level content what it was like low level content is like pooping on

1808
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:55,860
yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly yes yeah exactly that yeah um yeah there was there was a decent

1809
02:37:55,860 --> 02:38:00,740
them there was i think there was a decent amount of that of the low level stuff it's it's funny that

1810
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:07,300
we like have just just now like sort of invented this like category this level categorizing system

1811
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:13,300
but like we know what it means yeah um do you think there was more or less of that at four than

1812
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:19,300
i think i think that it was highly stratified i don't think that's right it was like very like

1813
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:24,500
up to contrast redcon four where it's like a lot of low level and a lot of high level but not that

1814
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:30,340
much mid-level and then redcon three was more like it like an even sort of blend yeah no you're

1815
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:36,980
probably right there because like yeah maybe this is something that didn't happen as much at redcon

1816
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:42,340
four was like one person would be doing one thing in one room and some other people would be doing

1817
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:48,020
something else in some other room yeah like i was saying earlier yeah we kind of expected that

1818
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:52,500
because like looking at the house we all we all kind of agreed that like all right so basically

1819
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:57,780
there's going to be like one central main room yeah we're mostly all going to be occupying yeah

1820
02:38:57,780 --> 02:39:02,020
and like there's going to be less of an opportunity for like people to split up and go to like a

1821
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:09,380
separate part of the house and do a separate thing because like the redcon three house was massive

1822
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:16,580
it was insane do you think we used the beach enough um i think we should have done more just like

1823
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:22,340
on it like you know not having it be like a big you know like i think we're fine on like beach

1824
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:28,900
themed things right but i feel like we have just like been on it more maybe i mean i didn't really

1825
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:32,580
i didn't really want to like just hang out on the beach for the sake of being there

1826
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:40,980
mm-hmm so like i don't feel like i like missed out on the beach at all um i feel like we did

1827
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:52,420
enough with it in terms of like videos that it was justified i don't know i don't know what

1828
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:58,580
else we would have done i want rckcon again so badly i love that shit i love it what is this

1829
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:07,060
i feel like we just did one we did one in february uh january right was it january i think it was

1830
02:40:07,060 --> 02:40:14,100
january mm okay you're probably right um yeah still it feels like it just happens no dude i i'm

1831
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:20,340
i'm hunkering for it i'm hankering i want that i want it real bad because that's like the cool

1832
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:26,660
that's like the people who show up to that are like so like such like old rck people it really

1833
02:40:26,660 --> 02:40:32,180
feels like i've known them for a long time so it's cool it's cool just to talk to them it is it's

1834
02:40:32,180 --> 02:40:37,860
really is really great like um i'm sure we've talked about this before but like after after the

1835
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:42,740
lecture we all just like talked about like funny rfck stuff that happened and we were like oh we

1836
02:40:42,740 --> 02:40:47,860
should have talked about that in the lecture like yeah we could have talked about that in the lecture

1837
02:40:47,860 --> 02:40:57,380
really oh that's a great story um i'm stupid we all said in unison are we are we judging are we

1838
02:40:57,380 --> 02:41:06,740
judging moments oh god yeah oh no no what i don't want it do you want to do you want to push that

1839
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:12,820
back uh well we'll see we'll see how tomorrow goes we have a pretty pat i'm we're doing oh i don't

1840
02:41:12,820 --> 02:41:16,020
know like that we're doing a muck tournament there's a muck tournament happening tomorrow

1841
02:41:16,660 --> 02:41:24,340
wait really yeah the muck cup is back yeah oh my god yeah uh no i had not even heard about that

1842
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:27,940
and it'll be happening currently when you watch this have you watched this as it comes out and

1843
02:41:27,940 --> 02:41:33,540
viewer it'll be happening right now so if you're listening to this have you already missed it um

1844
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:38,660
no it will be ongoing currently if you if you click on it as soon as it comes out on this episode

1845
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:46,100
i mean um it'll still be ongoing uh you know one of the one of the pins i did design a pin that

1846
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:51,060
was supposed to be like a muck cup batch and that's one of the pins that we could end up making if

1847
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:56,260
like enough people wanted i think it would be cool but like like with everything i'm worried

1848
02:41:56,260 --> 02:42:02,020
about like okay but it would be cool but how many people actually want one right how is would the

1849
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:11,060
cost of making it actually be justified well i mean yeah it's cool though do you know you know

1850
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:15,700
the one it's like it's like a little glob of goo and it looks like the muck colors

1851
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:22,980
it's a weird little bug it just like hops on my hand i have to pee real quick if you

you and like i don't know that's it hmm a tough equation to crack a very tough thing to acquire

1884
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:31,620
a life very sad very strange it's pretty wacky huh pretty wacky i guess that you know i i guess

1885
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:37,220
there's no need for like a like a greater thing than that i guess that is what everyone wants

1886
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:43,940
at the end of the day just to have to talk to i feel like that's all pretty normal it's all

1887
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:50,020
pretty normal hashtag relatable shit it's just it's relatable in the same way that like i love

1888
02:46:50,020 --> 02:46:56,580
drinking water is like a very normal like relatable thing to say that's right you know i am like i

1889
02:46:56,580 --> 02:47:02,100
feel like i should you know like you said before like i guess i have the sense that i should be

1890
02:47:03,060 --> 02:47:06,900
like socializing with people like being friends with people who like make

1891
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:12,500
comics or something because like that's what i do but like i don't need to like i don't really at the

1892
02:47:12,500 --> 02:47:18,660
end of the day if i'm not like doing it if i'm not doing anything that's like advancing my career

1893
02:47:18,660 --> 02:47:24,100
with that or whatever i don't actually care if like my friends make comics or anything you're such

1894
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:30,580
an enigma bin you like two sentences ago you're like i want to have like a diverse interactions

1895
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:35,620
with human beings i want to go outside i want to have fun but like that's how is that not how is

1896
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:43,140
that in any way in conflict with what i just said i like you want like do you okay what is what do

1897
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:48,580
you want okay why do you want to have to go outside and have complex interactions with people

1898
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:55,540
other than to talk with people like what in what way other is because it's what no like

1899
02:47:56,340 --> 02:48:03,540
i feel like i feel like we've got our wires crossed here like i definitely i yeah i do like like

1900
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:07,540
meeting people and interacting with you i was just saying that it doesn't have to be i don't

1901
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:14,260
care if it's like about comics oh well okay um and so like if we're talking if we're talking about

1902
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:21,780
like oh you know have like friends who do comic stuff like had like be part of like a web comic

1903
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:26,820
circle or whatever it's like well do i actually get anything out of it like does that actually

1904
02:48:26,820 --> 02:48:32,420
does does that benefit me in any way if not then like what's the point like why even focus on like

1905
02:48:32,980 --> 02:48:38,500
having that particular kind of like a circle you know what i mean okay i get what you mean now

1906
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:44,820
but i think the the obvious answer is that is that like is that not the easiest way to acquire new

1907
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:49,060
people like it maybe it's not well that's what i thought that's what i thought but it never worked

1908
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:54,900
it never like got it never made any headway how hard have you tried though i don't know

1909
02:48:55,860 --> 02:49:02,820
how hard am i supposed to try with all your might it will make you turn red with the force of blood

1910
02:49:02,820 --> 02:49:08,500
you say you say that you say that like oh well how hard have you tried it's like okay well how

1911
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:14,340
well how should i be trying what what what are the steps i should be following that i'm not doing

1912
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:21,620
the ones we're talking about i mean okay i mean it's it's easier said than done like and you know

1913
02:49:21,620 --> 02:49:26,500
it may not be the best way but like you know talking to maryweather is a way to accomplish

1914
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:32,340
meeting new people maybe it's not the best but that is a way you're you're gonna sit there and

1915
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:38,500
you're gonna tell me that if you were in my position you would like shoot maryweather a

1916
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:46,180
discord message that's like hey maryweather introduce me to some no no no no because i'm not

1917
02:49:46,180 --> 02:49:51,300
because i'm not insane because i'm not insane i wouldn't do that yeah that's right that's right

1918
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:58,500
okay that's not like okay okay okay okay i'm using the language i'm using because it's

1919
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:04,020
easiest to communicate but i'm like none of this is like you have to use maryweather to

1920
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:09,700
and ends like you use a tool like i that's what you just said that's not no i did not say that you

1921
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:13,300
have to use him like a tool i know that's what it may sound like but that's not what i mean like you

1922
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:18,260
don't have to just use him i'm saying that if you want to make friends then maryweather has friends

1923
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:22,100
maybe you want to hang out with maryweather so that you can meet new people but you don't have to

1924
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:25,940
treat so cynically a part of that could just be you want to hang out with the maryweather or you

1925
02:50:25,940 --> 02:50:29,060
know what am i gonna what am i gonna do with maryweather well if you have nothing in common

1926
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:35,220
my interactions with maryweather are just like he'll occasionally like send me a funny

1927
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:40,820
hello message on twitter dm's and i'll like respond with like i'll say something to him

1928
02:50:41,540 --> 02:50:46,900
well i mean there there there are ways to talk to people other than waiting for them to contact

1929
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:52,820
you i mean you this is what i'm saying so so you're saying that i should just like be like dm and

1930
02:50:52,820 --> 02:50:58,180
say hey do hey what's going on i saw that post they made their day or i follow your comic i'm

1931
02:50:58,180 --> 02:51:03,860
interested in you or anything like hey maryweather what's up do you want to do something maybe not

1932
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:10,020
even related to what what like what do you have interest like animal like animal crossing animal

1933
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:14,100
crossing how about that how about that you're literally telling me to pound the pavement

1934
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:21,060
and network right now i i'm i'm telling you that you can make friends if you want to that's what

1935
02:51:21,060 --> 02:51:25,540
i'm saying to you right now is that you have the power to do so and i don't understand why you don't

1936
02:51:25,540 --> 02:51:32,020
is right i'm telling me pound the pavement okay what what what it what it okay what does that

1937
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:36,740
mean exactly and just try harder you're not trying hard enough you're not working hard enough

1938
02:51:37,300 --> 02:51:41,300
it's not like a like a Protestant work ethic thing it's not that you aren't like

1939
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:50,180
it's not i okay okay here's what i say here's here's what i am seeing right now i you say that you

1940
02:51:50,180 --> 02:51:55,620
want do you want you're kidding no no no hold on hold on hold on i feel like you've got the wrong

1941
02:51:55,620 --> 02:52:02,580
idea i feel like you are advising me as though i'm sitting here like i'm so lonely like i don't

1942
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:07,940
know anyone like oh i can't i just can't i would i would i would love i would love to just have like

1943
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:12,980
anyone that i could just talk to like oh if only if only i could talk to somebody

1944
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:20,180
and about anything and you're like hmm well let me just pick a person that you know like why

1945
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:26,180
don't you talk to this person like yeah like obviate if i wanted to do that i would just do it

1946
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:33,060
but like i talk to mary whether occasionally there's nothing like there's nothing like

1947
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:41,060
like there's nothing like wanting there there's like i don't need to like push that there's no

1948
02:52:41,060 --> 02:52:50,820
where to push that that just is what it is i don't know if i'm just being misunderstood i don't

1949
02:52:50,820 --> 02:52:55,220
have your misunderstanding no i i i guess i guess i'm misunderstanding you because i definitely like

1950
02:52:55,220 --> 02:53:00,500
okay i know that you said you don't want to meet comics people the reason why we got back on to

1951
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:05,540
mary with like i don't think that he's your like way too like okay okay well okay let me repeat back

1952
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:10,020
to you what i think that you want you just want to have cool people to talk to not you that you

1953
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:14,420
need to talk to anyone for any amount of human substance like you need to talk to someone like

1954
02:53:14,420 --> 02:53:19,780
you want to have a good repertoire of friends that are nice whether or not they are comics people

1955
02:53:19,780 --> 02:53:25,140
is relevant is that the correct is that the situation here yeah sure sure isn't okay sounds

1956
02:53:25,140 --> 02:53:30,900
pretty good okay okay okay so the only reason who wouldn't want that agreed the only reason we got

1957
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:37,700
back on the matter with mary whether is because uh we the idea of it would be the easiest like group

1958
02:53:37,700 --> 02:53:42,020
of people to communicate with because you share a thing in common but i do not think that's the only

1959
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:47,700
way or like like i i didn't mean to like focus on like the mary weather angle as your like only

1960
02:53:47,700 --> 02:53:53,300
thing it just was one that asked you know i just i don't know i've never i've never like clicked

1961
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:58,020
with another like web comics person in a way that's like oh let's like bond over the fact

1962
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:03,140
that we both make a web comic or anything like that like that's just that's just never happens

1963
02:54:04,100 --> 02:54:12,740
and i i don't know i maybe that just says something about me uh no i mean there's nothing

1964
02:54:12,740 --> 02:54:16,980
like inherent about like liking the same thing as someone else that will make you like them i mean

1965
02:54:16,980 --> 02:54:20,500
like i was saying before that like you know i want to meet people who have the same interests

1966
02:54:20,500 --> 02:54:24,900
maybe that doesn't end like fadden stuff and that while it does like help like it doesn't go all the

1967
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:29,540
way i don't know like okay i don't i don't think that you're doing anything wrong i don't think

1968
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:33,140
that there's anything wrong happening here i don't know i guess you're right i guess you're

1969
02:54:33,140 --> 02:54:39,780
right that there's no like easy way to meet people and if you don't i mean that like there's not

1970
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:48,820
i'm i'm i'm just like okay like like what is what is what is my ideal my ideal life my best life

1971
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:56,900
i would say it differs from my current life and then i have like more and then i have like

1972
02:54:56,900 --> 02:55:01,940
more interactions with more people i have like a broader circle right it's not that i'm like

1973
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:10,340
completely starved for like interactions entirely but like i don't know i i would want i would want

1974
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:20,100
to like i would want to widen my circle but like in a in a in a natural way not in like a you're

1975
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:26,660
searching for people way yeah i don't know well i mean i i don't think i don't know if anyone is

1976
02:55:26,660 --> 02:55:32,900
like i like searching i really hope i really god i'll be so fucking mad if this comes out and like

1977
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:36,980
people listen to it and the takeaway is like oh ben's lonely oh we need to make we need to be his

1978
02:55:36,980 --> 02:55:41,460
friend oh guys let's let's like reach out to helping him let's go oh ben's up on his hill

1979
02:55:41,460 --> 02:55:47,220
he's up on his e or hill like looking up at like the sad clouds we gotta go we gotta go cheer him up

1980
02:55:47,220 --> 02:55:54,580
or something you know that's not i please please don't get that impression

1981
02:55:56,100 --> 02:56:00,500
i feel like this the way we the way we are talking about this just kind of naturally

1982
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:08,420
frames me in like a in like a position of like lack and i don't even though i have like i have

1983
02:56:08,500 --> 02:56:11,700
like things that i feel like i could improve it's not that i'm like

1984
02:56:13,940 --> 02:56:20,500
totally bereft right i don't know you know you know what ben i i was misunderstanding you know i

1985
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:26,100
i was bringing a lot of like my own like like what i was like i what i'm thinking about right

1986
02:56:26,100 --> 02:56:33,780
where like okay like i i saw that you like had a connection in like with a similar interest

1987
02:56:33,780 --> 02:56:36,900
and i latched on that because that's the sort of thing that i want but just because i

1988
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:41,860
like him like like to me that would matter but i guess it wouldn't necessarily matter to anyone

1989
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:46,420
else and so it seemed like the obvious solution of like well ben has this thing that i wish i had

1990
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:49,780
so why doesn't he just do that because that's what i would do if i was in a scenario but like that

1991
02:56:49,780 --> 02:56:55,620
doesn't you know that doesn't mean anything that was just me that was just me coming in here but

1992
02:56:57,060 --> 02:57:01,780
do you want me to introduce you to mary weller no well not that specifically that idea i don't

1993
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:06,900

2008
02:58:28,980 --> 02:58:33,060
everything i'm doing right now just makes me sad and mad and i feel like i'm not in a good

2009
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:37,220
headspace to engage with the things that i'm doing right now like being a personality and so i

2010
02:58:37,220 --> 02:58:42,820
want to i want to take a break from doing all of it uh like hardcore and just like stop and

2011
02:58:42,820 --> 02:58:47,220
not become an online man for a while and hone myself as like a human being to go train underneath the

2012
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:53,860
waterfall um that's um that's not exactly what i was expecting but okay i mean i understand the whole

2013
02:58:53,860 --> 02:58:59,380
like not wanting to be a personality thing i get that what do you mean when you say that everything

02:58:59,380 --> 02:59:04,820
you're doing now is making you mad what i mean what do you mean by everything what what i mean by

2018
02:59:21,380 --> 02:59:25,620
waiting to create things and i have not stopped doing that but like all the things that i create

2019
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:32,260
just kind of like bring me like sorrow like they just make things my life like i don't like it i

2020
02:59:32,260 --> 02:59:38,100
don't even think that's because like part of it is like the the like the inherent interactions

2021
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:42,020
and like dynamic inherent with like having like a fan base and things like that which i i don't

2022
02:59:42,020 --> 02:59:47,060
want to seem ungrateful for but just like i don't know i've become i don't want to do that anymore

2023
02:59:47,060 --> 02:59:52,820
uh but like so so stuff like endless war right like i like making endless war a lot and i have a

2024
02:59:52,820 --> 02:59:57,220
lot of like plans and i want to do stuff with it but in certain ways like sometimes i'll come on to

2025
02:59:57,220 --> 03:00:03,620
endless war and i'll just be like man i want to kill myself reading reading the chat i want to kill

2026
03:00:03,620 --> 03:00:09,300
myself i hate what i hate living because i've read this comment in a like nurse's office or something

2027
03:00:09,300 --> 03:00:15,060
and i want to die now i don't want to be alive i don't know if you've noticed like i don't really

2028
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:21,060
do a whole lot of that no i know and you're right and you're correct but i like i can't but i mean

2029
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:27,620
that's sort of like i mean you appear as though you are farther away from this war as you do to

2030
03:00:27,620 --> 03:00:32,500
like the average player like people are like oh where's ben but like to me to anyone who knows you

2031
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:37,380
it's obvious that you are like an endless warhead like greater than anyone you just will not stop

2032
03:00:37,380 --> 03:00:41,780
talking about it no matter what and you have like like this whole comic is like a huge part of your

2033
03:00:41,780 --> 03:00:48,020
like your personality as a human being alive on earth so it's like it's not like you left it i don't

2034
03:00:48,020 --> 03:00:56,340
um i just don't like i just don't okay like making endless war was cool and like i'm glad it exists

2035
03:00:56,340 --> 03:01:06,500
but i don't like i don't think i like engage with media in like a like an active way like i don't

2036
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:14,660
know like when you talk about like being in a fandom the way you describe it is like maybe a little

2037
03:01:14,660 --> 03:01:22,500
different from how i would do it um like how would you describe that i was never really like when i

2038
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:30,180
was in like the homestuck fandom i was never like i was never like out there like engaging and like

2039
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:35,380
i wasn't like meeting people through it i wasn't like forming like connections with people i was

2040
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:42,900
just like soaking up like fan creations and like reading like reddit posts and like just like reading

2041
03:01:42,900 --> 03:01:49,060
about it and like thinking about it all the time and maybe like drawing a thing related to it if i was

2042
03:01:49,060 --> 03:02:01,060
feeling really saucy that day so like endless war it's like um like i don't what i'm saying is i would

2043
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:08,260
definitely be if i was like just a normal rfck head i would be i would be i would not be a gameplay

2044
03:02:08,260 --> 03:02:14,420
guy i'd get all i would be like all i would just only be an art guy i would only be like i wouldn't

2045
03:02:14,420 --> 03:02:19,860
even be like an active poster or anything i would probably just like show up having made a thing

2046
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:29,540
like drop it in the chat and then like leave right um yeah that's and like that's kind of what i

2047
03:02:30,420 --> 03:02:36,500
i can i kind of continue that proud tradition in the way that i interact with endless war

2048
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:43,380
to this day i mean i don't want to feel say like make it seem like i'm like a social butterfly

2049
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:47,780
and fandom since like if like if i'm in the same like community as someone else like i know everyone

2050
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:51,860
i talk to everyone or anything most of it is like lurking but like with brony stuff like

2051
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:56,660
i would like be in the community i would read those reddit posts and i would know what's

2052
03:02:56,660 --> 03:03:00,420
happening in the show and then i'd be like okay i'm gonna draw some fan art and then i draw some

2053
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:04,340
fan art people would comment like hey i like your art too you want to be friends and they would

2054
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:09,460
say yes i'm also 12 and i'd be like cool let's hang out and then they would say okay and then

2055
03:03:09,460 --> 03:03:17,220
that's how like i i i really do see like fandom as like like an excuse to meet people which i guess

2056
03:03:17,220 --> 03:03:25,620
is not the the case for you i had i had i had like zero interaction with like any other bronies

2057
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:33,300
before i started before tbap well i mean yeah i mean i think creation is like a central part of

2058
03:03:33,380 --> 03:03:37,860
this equation where it's like you are inspired to create via the fandom and that's how you meet

2059
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:43,300
people is through each other's art of said thing it just it like it like it gives you a tag to

2060
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:51,060
search on twitter like that's the appeal yeah um you know i think maybe for a while i thought i would

2061
03:03:51,060 --> 03:03:58,500
like i would i would like search like um bernie tags and stuff on twitter i would like search

2062
03:03:58,500 --> 03:04:03,140
like i would like follow like other accounts that have like roses in their name and stuff yeah

2063
03:04:03,140 --> 03:04:07,060
i was like here like um why don't i fucking make like why don't i build like a fucking good like

2064
03:04:07,060 --> 03:04:15,300
socialist circle of like friends or whatever but like i don't know it again like i wasn't like

2065
03:04:15,300 --> 03:04:20,900
i mean i would occasionally reply to people's posts but it all just it all felt very it all

2066
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:29,860
felt very superficial it all felt like it wasn't really building anything um it was just like kind

2067
03:04:29,860 --> 03:04:36,420
of just a way to like i would just end up getting frustrated like i would just just read lots of

2068
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:41,380
posts that but that may be mad like followed a bunch of people i would read their posts they

2069
03:04:41,380 --> 03:04:47,860
would make me mad or i would just not care and scroll by them a while back like last week i

2070
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:51,460
like unfollowed a bunch of people that i had followed who were like that because like i don't

2071
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:56,740
i don't need to be following this person yeah there's no actual yeah i'm not learning anything

2072
03:04:57,460 --> 03:05:06,500
um i'm not accomplishing anything uh so i don't know that was like another another another failure

2073
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:11,460
i guess i i mean i don't want to make it seem like i it's easier like i like i tried like i

2074
03:05:11,460 --> 03:05:15,460
was saying before like i tried to do a sort of thing with history but like it didn't work out

2075
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:21,220
i i think i i think when it's not well okay there's a thousand factors in it but like when it's

2076
03:05:21,220 --> 03:05:25,380
not like a show right when it's like a historical or like it's a political thing like i think that

2077
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:30,580
i think that's like the cutoff point where it's like okay this is officially too big of a fandom

2078
03:05:30,580 --> 03:05:35,460
if you can even be called that to the point where it loses it's like luster of like diverse enough

2079
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:40,580
but also like small enough where it's it's close knit enough where you can meet people and it's easy

2080
03:05:40,580 --> 03:05:44,100
i feel like it loses it's like cohesion as like a group like i feel like

2081
03:05:44,100 --> 03:05:50,500
i feel like bernie twitter is like too unwieldy of like an entity where it's like yeah i don't

2082
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:55,860
think you could just like search bernie and get like people who you would be able to vibe with

2083
03:05:55,860 --> 03:06:02,020
i see like i see like people that i subscribe to on youtube like replying to each other's tweets

2084
03:06:02,020 --> 03:06:08,020
and stuff and i'm thinking like man i kind of wish i had something like that but like but why

2085
03:06:08,020 --> 03:06:14,500
i don't really i don't know it just seems like it seems like they're they're bonding over like

2086
03:06:14,500 --> 03:06:19,940
their shared beliefs which seems like as good a thing to bond over as any yeah and like but i don't

2087
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:31,220
like i don't know i don't make like quippy like observational posts i just make like angry

2088
03:06:31,380 --> 03:06:39,220
screams when i when i like state my opinions and it's not i don't think i do it in the right way

2089
03:06:39,220 --> 03:06:43,300
to like get that kind of a thing of like a rapport going with people

2090
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:54,420
so i don't know here's i guess that's something i'm jealous of here's like i guess like the point

2091
03:06:54,420 --> 03:07:00,340
of friendship for me if i wanted to like analyze it like my purely in my in my right brain lumarian

2092
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:06,500
point of view is like the point is that i can have someone that we can like hang out and have fun

2093
03:07:06,500 --> 03:07:11,780
and number one first of all we can like you know enjoy each other but also that we're able to like

2094
03:07:11,780 --> 03:07:17,460
communicate and like advance each other in in well whatever way that could mean at the time

2095
03:07:17,460 --> 03:07:21,540
whether it be like you know we just advance an idea where it's like hey did you hear about this

2096
03:07:21,540 --> 03:07:24,180
yeah i heard about that here's what i think here's what i think about that i'm glad that i heard your

2097
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:29,300
opinion because that's very interesting to me or it's like you know we we fucking we're gonna

2098
03:07:29,300 --> 03:07:34,020
draw every day and if you don't post in this discord server that i made then i'll kill you like

2099
03:07:34,020 --> 03:07:42,260
you know in a more like literal sort of advancement but like in some way i want to like have people

2100
03:07:42,260 --> 03:07:48,580
that like get it in whatever way that means and then i can talk to you about it and then continue

2101
03:07:48,580 --> 03:07:58,980
my further my further thought on it if you know what i mean okay i see makes makes sense i'm gonna

2102
03:07:59,060 --> 03:08:05,460
get a wolf please be my friend wolf you know he's my friend he's my friend oh you gave it a bone

2103
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:12,340
yes oh very nice how epic is that i didn't know there were wolves in minecraft that's a that's

2104
03:08:12,340 --> 03:08:18,740
yeah you can make them be your dog dude are they new there no they've been around for like several

2105
03:08:18,740 --> 03:08:28,420
years like before it was officially released like when not like notch added dogs oh weird okay

2106
03:08:28,420 --> 03:08:34,580
they came around with cookies they were adding the same update that cookies were updated cool okay

2107
03:08:35,940 --> 03:08:43,300
um i feel like what were we saying that got us on this we were saying something about want

2108
03:08:45,300 --> 03:08:48,660
um what did we're talking about what we wanted to talk like

2109
03:08:50,180 --> 03:08:56,980
oh i mean i mean how far back are we how far back are we going i don't know i don't the whole thing

2110
03:08:56,980 --> 03:09:02,740
has just been a stream of consciousness it has i love the stream my consciousness is my favorite

2111
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:08,740
streamer hey here's the best you you got to go pee i need to pee too i'll be back that's fine

2112
03:09:09,460 --> 03:09:14,660
what's up guys what do you what do you think about oh god why am i asking you what you think

2113
03:09:14,660 --> 03:09:20,580
about you see this is the sort of thing god okay i i come across as so fucking bad when i talk about

2114
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:24,740
things like this one it's like oh i don't want to be personality haha oh having a fan base is so

2115
03:09:24,740 --> 03:09:28,580
bad but like i've never i should like have a podcast where i explain what i mean by that

2116
03:09:28,580 --> 03:09:33,780
because i don't mean like i'm like oh the though the the fucking hardships of fame is so fucking

2117
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:39,940
hard you know like i don't mean like that or like i you know taking the heat is like so difficult

2118
03:09:39,940 --> 03:09:44,340
when you're at the level that i'm at which is to say nothing and i have like 20 fans like i don't

2119
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:51,860
simply what i mean okay okay i'm gonna say it really simply i think that personality driven

2120
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:56,340
shows are boring and i think that they're stuck like dumb and i think that they suck and i don't

2121
03:09:56,340 --> 03:10:01,780
like making them because i think that they're bad and so oh god skeleton and so what i mean when i

2122
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:05,940
don't want to become like a personality is i don't want to be like a youtuber i i seem like

2123
03:10:05,940 --> 03:10:10,500
really hoi-du-toi-di and like oh god like you know you fucking you're selling out you're making

2124
03:10:10,500 --> 03:10:17,940
canton law epic simply what i mean by that is that i wish that i was making more like

2125
03:10:17,940 --> 03:10:23,300
stuff that i perceived to be good like you know like like a like a i just want to throw out there

2126
03:10:23,300 --> 03:10:27,460
like a like a comic or just like an animation or something something that felt like it wasn't the

2127
03:10:27,460 --> 03:10:31,700
sole appeal of it wasn't that it was just me and i want to make a thing that can stand on its own

2128
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:35,860
and i because i think that that's better and that's what i mean by that audience i hope you

2129
03:10:35,860 --> 03:10:42,820
enjoy this intermission okay i'm back i i talk such mad shit about you been here i'm gonna

2130
03:10:42,820 --> 03:10:48,020
believe the audience will know about how i told them about your onion breath and your toes and

2131
03:10:48,020 --> 03:10:55,380
your feet yeah oh no your bunions your bunions oh my god you'll they'll know all about your mad

2132
03:10:55,380 --> 03:11:00,980
bunions i don't know what those are i know there's something you get on your foot they're like i think

2133
03:11:00,980 --> 03:11:08,660
they're like a callous sort of semi-ward i believe like a ward out of callous feet fibers

2134
03:11:08,660 --> 03:11:18,020
oh no it's like in your bone oh pain and stiffness in the big toe a bony bump that forms on the

2135
03:11:18,020 --> 03:11:23,940
joint i've got a bony bump for you of the big toe oh jeez yeah i thought it was like a ward yeah

2136
03:11:25,700 --> 03:11:33,540
oh god oh no the picture is like it's like a big like gray like lump in between like the your

2137
03:11:33,540 --> 03:11:47,620
toe bones oh god why why well okay now i know watch out for those i will i will get them as soon

2138
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:54,340
as possible sir what where do you where do you want to discuss i don't know i think i think

2139
03:11:54,340 --> 03:11:58,660
we're winding down we've been going on for like a few hours i feel like i feel like we're winding

2140
03:11:58,660 --> 03:12:06,820
down i don't feel like we solved anything or arrived at any like new truths well what's there

2141
03:12:06,820 --> 03:12:12,100
to discover i guess i mean we're just talking about things and trying to come to a greater i mean

2142
03:12:12,100 --> 03:12:17,060
i i guess in a way this is sort of the ideal in my circumstance where it's just like i just want to

2143
03:12:17,060 --> 03:12:21,220
know what other people are thinking god the king keeps freezing i don't know why my craft is chugging

2144
03:12:21,220 --> 03:12:25,060
so hard on my it's like it's like i it's like i said like what's even the point like what's even

2145
03:12:25,060 --> 03:12:29,620
the point of having a conversation if you don't get anything out of it here's my point is i know

2146
03:12:30,660 --> 03:12:35,140
i'm dumping you i'm breaking up with you you're not you're not serving you're not delivering on

2147
03:12:35,140 --> 03:12:40,820
utility my my you're not pulling your way my end game is that i think ooh now i know ben

2148
03:12:40,820 --> 03:12:44,660
saint thinks about this maybe i'll be able to better accommodate him in the future now that i know this

2149
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:53,540
why would you want to accommodate me because i i because you bring joy to my life and the way

2150
03:12:53,540 --> 03:13:01,460
to show that i appreciate that is to uh do things for you and so i say ben i'm happy we're friends

2159
03:13:56,020 --> 03:14:01,940

2160
03:14:01,940 --> 03:14:08,740
i'm starting two best brothers bitch about politics actually i hear some really black

2161
03:14:08,740 --> 03:14:12,100
pill that takes because he's black because he's a dragon get it

2162
03:14:14,900 --> 03:14:19,220
can we agree on something dragons don't have fur they have scales can we agree on this

2163
03:14:20,580 --> 03:14:29,460
well i mean is that like is that in contention yeah mammalian dragons big contention i mean

2164
03:14:29,540 --> 03:14:38,260
i mean yeah i mean it wouldn't i don't i mean if i mean whatever it's a fantasy creature who

2165
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:43,220
knows maybe there are like mutants that have fur i don't know i do i do feel like if it's got fur

2166
03:14:43,220 --> 03:14:50,500
then it's a mammal and like dragons are a reptilian it would just be like a mammal that

2167
03:14:50,500 --> 03:14:56,980
happens to resemble a dragon in shape yeah so yeah i guess i'm with you i guess i'm with you on that

2168
03:14:56,980 --> 03:15:04,660
god god no this is so terrible my dog can get hit by my own screechy scratches this is terrible

2169
03:15:04,660 --> 03:15:09,700
oh not the screechy scratches i know with the diamond sword but how does he feel about your

2170
03:15:09,700 --> 03:15:21,540
crisscrosses even worse he bowed out painfully at that oh sad we have arrived no more truths

2171
03:15:22,500 --> 03:15:32,020
no i didn't we haven't learned anything i didn't learn anything oh zombie well i learned that

2172
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:37,780
dogs are double edged sword in Minecraft because they'll help you kill people but maybe they'll

2173
03:15:37,780 --> 03:15:43,940
die one day too that's what we learned today everyone that's i hope you're glad you enjoyed

2174
03:15:44,900 --> 03:15:50,580
though the the lesson is don't get a dog in Minecraft it'll just die and leave you bereft

2175
03:15:52,500 --> 03:15:56,020
it'll just suck up all your it'll just absorb all the arrows that you're shooting

2176
03:15:58,100 --> 03:16:04,820
sad and riddled with guilt what's his name um

2177
03:16:08,340 --> 03:16:14,900
didorian epic his name is dory like my favorite Nemo character

2178
03:16:15,620 --> 03:16:22,900
uh oh dude i caught a um i caught a dory in uh yeah in animal crossing yeah i did

2179
03:16:24,820 --> 03:16:34,180
it was based i got like 3000 bells for it uh i'm gonna check my oh hey wait wait no no no no no

2180
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:40,420
storm before the storm we have to we are obligated by the company to mention it oh yeah that's right

2181
03:16:41,220 --> 03:16:49,140
um we we read it at some point um and yeah okay correct me if i'm wrong haven't i read it

2182
03:16:49,140 --> 03:16:59,300
before the last one yes okay and i don't think did you reread it again no okay

2183
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:07,220
okay okay well there is nothing there's nothing to like talk about because you i mean there's nothing

2184
03:17:07,220 --> 03:17:14,420
that you found like found that interesting correct or that you really cared about that much i i thought

2185
03:17:14,420 --> 03:17:22,660
that what was interesting was just all the times in history where like basically just an angry mob

2186
03:17:23,380 --> 03:17:29,140
decided what the rules were oh yeah that's like every revolution ever that's that's the coolest

2187
03:17:29,140 --> 03:17:35,860
part of every revolution yeah it's just like if if like the government or like some politician like

2188
03:17:35,860 --> 03:17:40,900
fucked around and and found that they would find out because like either some other like

2189
03:17:41,460 --> 03:17:47,540
a powerful person would lead like his like clan out into the streets or just like the general

2190
03:17:47,540 --> 03:17:52,660
population would like fucking revolt and just like threaten murder and like to destroy to

2191
03:17:52,660 --> 03:17:58,260
like tear the whole fucking thing down and the government would be like uh uh uh okay uh no

2192
03:17:58,260 --> 03:18:04,020
actually no we were wrong uh the rules say we do this other thing so yep sorry everyone don't worry

2193
03:18:04,020 --> 03:18:12,660
about it and it was that's that's the biggest takeaway from it there was a top so Mike Duncan the

2194
03:18:12,660 --> 03:18:18,500
creator of uh that book as well as my favorite podcast series revolutions and the history of

2195
03:18:18,500 --> 03:18:24,660
Rome uh is is a historic or a gruffer man and he was at a top did i i want to mention that i just

2196
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:33,140
happened to see someone retweet him like um i think i think just like saying lol or like laughing at

2197
03:18:33,140 --> 03:18:38,660
someone else's tweet saying that like um the grain doll uh was like what ended Rome or something

2198
03:18:38,660 --> 03:18:46,820
yeah well uh when he like extensively lines out about how that's not the case um um and it's epic

2199
03:18:46,820 --> 03:18:52,580
but uh so i really like his stuff and so he has a talk where he talks about this book and about

2200
03:18:52,580 --> 03:19:01,700
like why he made it and he made it because he like like you know he uh felt that it was analogous

2201
03:19:01,780 --> 03:19:06,660
in a way to like what current like political climate was and i thought it was interesting

2202
03:19:06,660 --> 03:19:12,180
and he sort of touches that and then on like the like the beginning of the book where he talks about

2203
03:19:12,180 --> 03:19:19,060
like i remember him saying that like we're not living in like the end times but like we might

2204
03:19:19,060 --> 03:19:25,460
be living in like the lead up to the end times yeah uh and i thought yeah i thought that was

2205
03:19:25,460 --> 03:19:29,860
interesting and that's that's the sort of like that's the sort of reason why i wanted i thought

2206
03:19:29,860 --> 03:19:33,780
it'd be a cool introductory so this was all part of my long game like we were talking about earlier

2207
03:19:33,780 --> 03:19:37,620
where it's like dude what have been really like storm before the storm and then he's like hey

2208
03:19:37,620 --> 03:19:41,620
munchie what other sort of things kind of listen to him like haha well been you see and then i would

2209
03:19:41,620 --> 03:19:47,220
pull out my big long list of things uh that you can watch and then we would be friends and it'd be great

2210
03:19:47,220 --> 03:19:54,260
but that didn't happen now that was a pipe dream yeah unfortunately but but i also thought that you

2211
03:19:54,260 --> 03:20:01,060
would like it because it was about you know current political stuff and and what uh societal unrest

2212
03:20:01,060 --> 03:20:07,220
would lead to something i did like a lot of it i just had a hard time like remembering which

2213
03:20:07,220 --> 03:20:12,580
person had which name yeah i mean roman names are very like everyone has like the same first name

2214
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:21,460
yeah yeah it was a little bit of a challenge pumpkin this is so weird i don't this is like

2215
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:24,980
a mod that used to be in the game where it's like you can see recipes now it's like a real thing

2216
03:20:24,980 --> 03:20:31,540
that just everyone can do i don't know if i like it um but we don't have to like my special anymore

2217
03:20:31,540 --> 03:20:34,980
no we don't have to talk about it for too long because i you know there's no reason to talk about

2218
03:20:34,980 --> 03:20:40,420
but i just want to mention it because we said the bigger need to talk about it on the podcast

2219
03:20:40,420 --> 03:20:48,900
last time we said like book club yeah but i just i didn't want to reuse again i read a bunch of other

2220
03:20:48,900 --> 03:20:54,500
books instead i read a bunch of david graver you want to talk about graver then you can talk about

2221
03:20:54,500 --> 03:21:03,940
graver well what which ones have you read so far i read um uh debts i read um the one that's got

2222
03:21:03,940 --> 03:21:09,460
like democracy in the title of the democracy movement or the democracy project or something

2223
03:21:09,460 --> 03:21:13,860
something like it's something like i know it's about him and the one in the wall street i know

2224
03:21:13,860 --> 03:21:18,660
you're talking about yeah dude i love that one was sick i don't know what you think about that one

2225
03:21:18,660 --> 03:21:26,820
okay that one was um it wasn't as interesting as debt no sure but it was like it was very different

2226
03:21:27,780 --> 03:21:33,300
it was like i felt like guilty reading it because like occupy wall street was not that long ago

2227
03:21:33,300 --> 03:21:38,740
but like i already had like forgotten like about it yeah it feels like ancient history

2228
03:21:39,620 --> 03:21:45,780
but like it like just happened and it's like feels like something that could like very easily

2229
03:21:45,780 --> 03:21:54,180
happen again and i kind of feel like i should have like supported it back when it was happening

2230
03:21:54,180 --> 03:22:00,580
yeah well so it was very like weird because okay my experience with david graver was not like like

2231
03:22:00,580 --> 03:22:04,980
i like i found out after like i google searched more about him that he was like apparently like

2232
03:22:04,980 --> 03:22:09,860
this like anarchist anthropologist i had no idea i just got him debt because i heard it was a good

2233
03:22:09,860 --> 03:22:14,020
book and i read it and i was like oh cool book epic um oh he's another book on honorable i'll check

2234
03:22:14,020 --> 03:22:18,260
it out democracy whatever okay i'll put on this apparently he's like you know like he was one of

2235
03:22:18,260 --> 03:22:22,820
the like the creators of occupy wall street and i was like whoa what i had no idea i had no idea

2236
03:22:22,820 --> 03:22:28,180
this was a thing and all like the coolest thing about this was like that shock of like dude this guy

2237
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:33,860
who's smart is also like a weird like political activist that's like epic and awesome um but the

2238
03:22:33,860 --> 03:22:39,060
coolest part about it for me was like hearing all like the weird like practical advice and like the

2239
03:22:39,060 --> 03:22:43,860
blow by blows like what it's like being in one of those like occupy wall street like tent city

2240
03:22:43,860 --> 03:22:50,100
sort of things and like hearing about like the general assemblies about how like how do you like

2241
03:22:50,100 --> 03:22:55,540
run a group with like anarchist ideals that also has to have like structure in it so that it can

2242
03:22:55,540 --> 03:23:01,620
produce anything of merit um and it was really cool about like the structures in place for like

2243
03:23:01,620 --> 03:23:07,140
voting about the general assembly like there was this long die tribe like chapters long discussion

2244
03:23:07,140 --> 03:23:11,540
about like how do you vote do you vote by like majority or do you vote by consistency like how

2245
03:23:11,540 --> 03:23:17,540
do you like which do you do when do you do it and stuff like that it's like interesting cool um so

2246
03:23:17,540 --> 03:23:22,020
like hearing like the practical advice of like someone who i respect who's also part of this

2247
03:23:22,020 --> 03:23:26,420
like you know occupy wall street which like i basically didn't even like i had the vaguest

2248
03:23:26,420 --> 03:23:31,700
conceptions of it i knew like we are the 99 percent that's all i knew and it's like it's cool

2249
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:38,740
hearing about it um because like i totally passed by totally completely yeah whoa whoa what the

2250
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:47,140
fuck is that shit oh my god oh my god there's fucking scary people i don't what do you wear
