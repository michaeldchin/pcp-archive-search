00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hi, I guess. Welcome to, I guess, The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I guess this is like another episode or something.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Surely not.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Whatever. No, yeah. Yeah, it's episode 200 in...

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The word on the street is that this is the show.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, that's what I heard. I didn't buy it.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know, I know. It's terrible. Funny gimmick. No, that's it. That's it. That's the episode. This is really the product you've chosen to listen to.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You've arrived here in 2021 listening to this. I'm so sorry.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You know, I was looking at the thumbnail for the last episode, and it's got two Nostalgia Critic faces and then our logo.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I kind of help but wonder because it's like the titles like Nostalgia Critic and Medical Fraud, PCP.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just have to wonder if somebody comes across that not knowing what we are. What on earth are they going to be thinking?

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't like that the title is Nostalgia Critic and Medical Fraud, and there are two images, but they are both Nostalgia Critic.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not like we spent the entire episode talking about the Nostalgia Critic.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It was just the beginning. Yeah, I don't know. Eleazar does all those, so send your hate mail to Eleazar.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Send your hate mail to Eleazar. He deserves every bit of it.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, so what's up gamers?

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, let's start. Speaking of gamers then, Ben, you have released the Alpha Build of your game. Do you want to talk about it?

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, I'll talk about it a little bit. My secret project that I've been teasing and teasing for months, I announced what it is, and I posted the Alpha Build of it.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think a lot of people guessed that it was a game. I tried not to give it away, but some people...

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think that the way I talked about it, the fact that I talked about adding stuff and including stuff, I think might have given it away for some people.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That it's a game. I just assumed it was a game based on the fact that if it was just another comic chapter, it wouldn't be, I don't know.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It'd be like, yeah, you already do that.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, I would just say I was doing it. Yeah, I feel like.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Maybe, maybe. Yeah, it is the Slime and Punishment, the true finale.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I made the video last year that was so long ago, S-Rivert, which was like this...

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was sort of the climax, sort of the, what's the word, the S-Cascade, but that wasn't the end.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But Phantom's Revenge is what I'm calling the game, and it will actually be the end of...

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, it'll be basically the end. There'll be a little bit of comic that comes before it and after it to kind of go with it, but the game is it.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I put out the Alpha build, which is like, it's not done. It doesn't have any of the story in it.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's basically just as dummy backgrounds, dummy enemies, but it's playable, and you can play it and beat it.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's like, I might tweak it a bit, but it's mechanically complete, so it's a playable.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And that's on my Patreon for $5 patrons to play-test it for me.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And having a bunch of people have played it, and I think the number is five people who have actually beaten it, because I made it really hard.

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I think it's... I made it really hard, expecting that people would probably surprise me, and there would probably be ways to beat it that I didn't consider.

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No. No. No, it's just really, really hard, and you really have to...

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Beating it requires that you have a lot of patience and try it many, many times.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe like a dozen or 20 times, somewhere in that range, and that you just very carefully exhaust...

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You think of what could I do differently, and then you exhaust many, many different possibilities trying it until you find the right way to do it.

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's a little... I guess that's a bit of a hint on how to beat it.

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, I don't know. Do you mind? Well, I guess since it's a patron-only game right now, we shouldn't probably talk about all the stuff in it, but I just want to say...

41
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't really mind if you talk... I don't mind if you... There's not much to spoil in it, really.

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, I wouldn't say don't spoil... And this goes for anyone who's maybe a patron of mine talking to other people about it.

43
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I would say don't spoil how to beat it, because there are sort of little things you can think of, and you go, oh, I could try this or something.

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, I can't do that, because I haven't beaten it, because I thought it was too hard.

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wait, I want to shout out everyone who's beaten it, because the list is so short.

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hold on. I'm going to look at my patron channel and search images, because when you beat the game, it shows an image that gives you stats to what...

47
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It shows you some data about how you beat it and what your numbers were at, and this was just for me to obtain information.

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But because it is so... The ways it can be beaten are so limited, they're all exactly the same.

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, I figured.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, it has an image, let's see.

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So the people who have beaten it are Munchy, Sean, Sean Don, Sean Garrett, that guy, Shinisaba, Taiyo, and Crack.

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Crack was the first to beat it. He currently holds the speedrun world record at 5 minutes and 57 seconds.

53
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Beat that.

54
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Speedrun?

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like as in like from the first... like booting up for the first time, just beat it in 5 minutes, or did he...?

56
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know if he timed it from... wait a minute.

57
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That seems impossible to figure it out so quickly and to do it perfectly.

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well no, not from booting it up and never having played it. I assume it's probably from hitting start.

59
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Or maybe it's from hitting restart?

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because it plays slightly differently if you start from the main menu versus if you do restart in the pause menu.

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So... I'm not sure which one.

62
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But I can find out. I can find out.

63
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because he has an unlisted video.

64
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, it is timed from... I can find it out.

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, it is timed from hitting start on the main menu.

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Not a restart, because that would be cheating.

67
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because you gotta wait through the opening quote screen that sets the mood.

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I had... I'm gonna say I had fun with it. It was a good game and it was very cute.

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Little phantom horn with a sword. His little sprite.

71
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
His name... there's a bit of lore. His sword's name is Platinum.

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I want to include something in the game that will let you...

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, it's named Platinum because it's after Princess Platinum, the founder of the Kingdom of Unicornia.

74
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Actually, yeah, that's the lore there.

75
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think I'm gonna put in a slime command that will basically be like a look command

76
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that will let you sort of scan your enemies and yourself and get a description.

77
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you read Phantom's description, it will give you...

78
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
As if you've done a slime or a look command in Endless War on a character

79
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and it gives you the characters' readout and what they're wearing and stuff.

80
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So I think I'll do that maybe and it'll explain like...

81
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He is wielding Platinum, a katana.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He is a level whatever sword master and so on and so on.

83
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So that'll be fun.

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think we need to add to it before it's done.

85
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The basics of it are... it's like some sort of a fighting RPG turn-based thing.

86
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Phantom horn, a little sprite.

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And there's enemies that are at the moment just orbs, like Unicorn Jelly orbs.

88
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'd assume they're like actual enemies.

89
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, those are just plate...

90
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, you just fight colored orbs that are just placeholders.

91
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Those are not the real enemies that are actually going to be in the game when it's done.

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, and it's got like a little text thing with like a...

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Your voice going...

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can tell it was my voice.

96
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, completely. It's so obvious.

97
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's so funny.

98
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, I mean, Canonically Phantom's voice is my voice, so I mean...

99
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I feel self-indulgent in talking about it, but I'll discuss it a little bit.

102
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He has lines that he like shouts in battle.

103
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I voiced all those, but then for like his text box, yeah, he has the little sands.

104
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I just made a little sound.

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I recorded myself going...

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I just made that little bit-bit-bit-bit-bit sound.

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He...

108
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I was...

109
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
My favorite part of it, and the part that I think is so funny, and I was like,

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have to make this game with this idea in mind, is...

111
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When he attacks, he yells the...

112
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He yells the...

113
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Like in Kendo.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Just like...

115
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Months and months ago, before I started working on it, I would think about it,

116
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and I'd be like, it would just be so funny.

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They have Phantom Horn doing that.

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And you know what, I would...

119
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Has he ever expressed interest in Kendo before that, or is it just sort of a...

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, in...

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I mean, in Slime and Punishment, he learns to fight, and he fights with a katana.

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So...

123
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Only in that...

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, and you know, it's implied that he is trained with a katana in the dojo.

125
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But I just decided like, you know, I used to do kumdo,

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and I feel like Phantom Horn is me in a lot of ways.

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And so I'll just migrate that element of myself into him.

128
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I think it makes sense that he would be very like...

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He would be very by the book.

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Like he would have like bought like a book about like Kendo forms,

131
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and like practice them, and like, you know, he would...

132
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He would say the lines at the appropriate time, like you do in the sport.

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just seems appropriate. Just seems like what he would do.

134
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was making more sprites.

136
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, I've been making more sprites since the Alpha launch,

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because there's a bunch of things that I kind of just put placeholder animations in

138
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that I want them to look better.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Like when he drinks the fuck energy in the Alpha build now,

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
there's just one frame of him like holding a can to his mouth.

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I would really like to add them.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So like, there's two frames where he's kind of like...

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The can is sort of like moving as he kind of like chugs it like...

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then I think I would like to like have him like either like crush it on his forehead

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
or like slam it on the ground afterwards or something.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I just think it would look cool.

147
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I was adding things like that in.

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's what my mind's at.

149
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The sprite work is really nice.

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You know, it's like he's got a little phantom horn with his sword

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and he's got this...

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Every time he does the sword slashes, when he says the words,

153
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
he does a different pose. I think he mentioned that to me.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I was like, oh yes, kendo moves.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
When he does...

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He does like a side slash across the abdomen

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and when he does men, it holds the sword up high

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and then when he does kote, it's kind of like middle forward.

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He slides forward.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He knows his kata.

161
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
He knows his forms.

162
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He's trained.

163
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's trained in the art of the blade.

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
While you were having sex, he was studying the blade.

165
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
While you were partying.

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It worked out for him, I guess.

167
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
For the people who could beat the game.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah.

169
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He's got to take his revenge and this is the only way.

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is the only way he can do it.

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's really hard.

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I think I will make it...

173
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I like that it is hard.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think maybe it's a little overboard right now

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and I will probably think of ways to maybe relax the difficulty

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
a bit before the final version.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A little bit.

178
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I still want it to be hard

179
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and I still want you to have to play through it multiple times

180
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and consider like,

181
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
what could I do differently that would make me survive?

182
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's good.

183
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Also, a bunch of people told me...

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm not going to say what,

185
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
but there are things in the game

186
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that a bunch of people tried to play through multiple times

187
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
without even finding or noticing

188
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and then when they stopped and were like,

189
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
shit, I keep losing,

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
they went a little bit into the options

191
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and were like, oh, that's there?

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, wow. Neat.

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, I didn't go into the options menu.

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No, no, no, not like the options menu.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I mean, like looking at your...

196
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
looking at like the stuff you have.

197
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, right, yeah.

198
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I want to talk about my experiences with it

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because like...

200
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
RPGs...

201
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't spoil, don't spoil.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I won't spoil like what I figured out, but I...

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Like the game you go in

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and you have to attack

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and in RFCK rules,

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
you spend slime to attack

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and slime is also your health.

208
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So you're like dealing damage

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to these enemies

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and then they're dealing damage to you

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and your slime is going down,

212
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you have podrons and you can munch on them

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to get some slime back

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and you know,

215
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
if you don't use your items,

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you have a bunch of items you start with,

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
like a fucking energy drink

218
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
for getting your hunger back,

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
which also depletes when you attack

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and you have to use these items properly

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and if you use them incorrectly

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and as far as I can understand,

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
if you do a single thing

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
in any of the turns wrong,

225
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you will fuck yourself for the later battles

226
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
where you will either run out of slime

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and be unable to attack

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
or you'll just die.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There is basically zero margin for error

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the way it is right now.

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It reminds me a little bit

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
of Robo-Dobot's

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Minecraft

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
car

235
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
map.

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Remember that?

237
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
God, yeah.

238
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, God.

239
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You have to do it completely.

240
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean, that one was a little different

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
because Minecraft has physics

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and there's so many different ways you could do

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the drive.

244
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's not painful.

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
At least it was memorable.

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This is the sort of game that I would hate

248
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
in every way because it's

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
trial and error. I know.

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's anti-gib and it's design.

251
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A lot of number munching.

252
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I feel like if I wanted to

253
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
truly understand

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
how to beat it, I would need to

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
pay attention to when the enemies come in,

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
how much damage they deal

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and then write a spreadsheet of,

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
okay, I have this much here,

259
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I have this much slime here.

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm able to get to this point.

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, but then something will go wrong.

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'd need to do a lot of

263
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
sitting down and writing stuff down.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's not what I like.

265
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But I did enjoy the process

266
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
of learning

267
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
because

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
in a lot of RPGs, you have all these things.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You never use them.

270
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How many times do you actually use

271
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
fucking X attack in Pokémon?

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
There's so many items

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that are completely useless. You just attack.

274
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
With a strong attack and you win.

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And in this, every

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
single part of the game is

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
integral to understand and to be used

278
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to its fullest extents

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
in order to win. You will be used

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
to fullest extents. Yes, you will.

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I think the quote is,

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I will you use to fullest

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
extents.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I thought it was you will be used

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to fullest extents. That's why I found it so funny.

286
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It was because it didn't make

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
any grammatical sense at all.

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I will you used

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to fullest extents. Wait, you there?

290
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Shit. Oh god,

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
my headphones died. Oh.

292
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Give me a sec.

293
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Classic bin.

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
How many times has

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
the headphone thing been a problem?

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh my god, no. How many thousands

297
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
of times? I'm sorry.

298
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Eleazar, cut this. No, don't cut it.

299
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
People need to know about

300
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the headphones.

301
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
How could this

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
happen to me?

303
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey, you there?

304
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hey, you there?

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay.

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hey, I hear you. Okay, cool.

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hey, cool.

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay, yes, fullest extents.

309
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm back.

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, I wanted to say

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
about it that like

312
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in terms of the difficulty,

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I, yeah, it's very exacting

314
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but the way

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
it's a menu based, turn based

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
RPG style battle.

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So like you only have limited options.

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And so

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I want to

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
when you're playing through it and trying to figure out

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
how to win, I think you go through a process

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
where you at first you kind of have to

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
come to grips with like, okay,

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
what options do I have

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
available?

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And then you kind of are like, okay, here's the things

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can do. And then, hmm,

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
so how can I best employ

329
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
these things against, you know,

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the configurations of enemies

331
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that I'm going against? And then eventually

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
you figure out like, oh, okay, if I use this

333
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
at such and such a time,

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
then I can get through this section without taking damage.

335
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah.

336
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Genuinely, like a cool, like

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
unique thing that I hadn't really seen

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
in a game. I feel like it's,

339
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
it's like, you know, being thrown into

340
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
a nuzlocke, except I hate those.

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But like,

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you need to know your shit

343
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and that when there's only

344
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
a small amount of shit to know,

345
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
like the items you have, the turns

346
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that it takes, the health you have

347
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and the damage the enemy does, once you know

348
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
all of the variables, and there aren't that many

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
variables to memorize, it feels like

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
it's doable. So it's not annoying

351
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
in ways that it would otherwise be

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
if it was like part of a larger RPG.

353
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
When you're, when you're

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
like learning it, I think there's that

355
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
first phase where you're

356
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
figuring out what your options are

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and how they should be used.

358
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And then once you get that

359
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
down, then there's like, you're not

360
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
quite done yet, because then there's like,

361
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
okay, now I understand

362
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
how to use this stuff, but

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
now it's a matter of like

364
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
trying over and over again

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
or trying a bunch of times

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
to like, use them in different

367
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
ways and just kind of experiment with it

368
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
until you find that perfect exact

369
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
combination of like moves

370
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
that results in victory.

371
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I think that like the first part

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
is good difficulty

373
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and the second part is like not as fun

374
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
difficulty. So I would kind of like

375
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to maybe increase that first

376
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
part

377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
of like the understanding, the complexity

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and then decrease

379
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the second part so that like

380
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
once you get, okay, these are

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
my options and these are how to use them,

382
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
then that's basically

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
when you win.

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, because I got to a point

385
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
with less sort of

386
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
trial and error of like,

387
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
okay, did this work? No, did this work?

388
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No, did this work? No, did this work? No.

389
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay, that finally got it.

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, that's where I was getting

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
is like, I got pretty

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
far. I learned a lot

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
about the ways to get to a certain

394
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
point in the game.

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But then I was running up against a wall of like,

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm not sure on which

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
turn I made a mistake, but I did

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
something wrong and I can't

399
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
figure out what it could have been

400
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and now I

401
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
realize that the next like 40

402
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
minutes to an hour is just going to be me

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
getting to this point again

404
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and then trying one

405
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
thing differently and then losing

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
again and being like, what, what is it?

407
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I'd be hitting my head against the wall

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and that's the trial and error and I

409
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
couldn't, I couldn't bear

410
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
the idea so I stopped.

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Without spoiling too much, I will

412
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
tell you that

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I know how far you got

414
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
you got most of the way through

415
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
but there was a little more

416
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and the bit more that there was

417
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that you didn't see yet

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I know that you

419
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
would have gotten there

420
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and been like, oh, okay

421
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I understand

422
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
what I have to do and

423
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
you would have been wrong

424
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
there would have been even more

425
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and it would have driven you fucking crazy

426
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah

427
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, it just didn't add up

428
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
there's not enough

429
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
numbers to, you can't

430
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
put them together to create victory

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
it doesn't make any sense, do I have to click

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
on a pixel or do I get a secret?

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You just can't do it

434
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, so

435
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I feel like

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
so I feel like

437
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Mission accomplished

438
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Well, part of me feels like

439
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
part of me feels like, okay, I should have

440
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
just known

441
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the short

442
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
strengths and shortcomings

443
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
of how I balanced it

444
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
already

445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
but I feel like having had

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
some people test it out

447
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and get their feedback really confirmed

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
it confirmed

449
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
what I feel like I should have already known

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
but that I didn't really have that much confidence in

451
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
which is like

452
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
yeah, that

453
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
difficulty curve

454
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
information that I just mentioned

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's, I mean it's

456
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
playtesting tells you a lot

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
because you're building it, it's like

458
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it's like when

459
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
like an editor

460
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
sometimes edits like a video

461
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and they do that thing where they

462
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
put the

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
like an image on every

464
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
like word being said

465
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
such that it, when it's

466
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
played back, it doesn't make any sense

467
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and you can't follow along because the images are too short

468
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and it's really annoying and terrible

469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and it would be so much better

470
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
as a viewing experience if it was

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
just like a simple image

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to go along with the audio

473
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and

474
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
from the editor's point of view

475
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
nothing is wrong, it totally makes sense

476
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
each word is lined up to an image

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and through

478
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
you know

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
a viewer's perspective

480
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
it feels different, so like you're making the game

481
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
you don't know

482
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the learning curve from the perspective of someone

483
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
who doesn't know what is in the game

484
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
so it's like, it's completely

485
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
you need to do playtesting

486
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and those things to figure out what

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you're missing because it's always something

488
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
yeah, because I

489
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I like had to

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
figure out the game in reverse

491
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
because like

492
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I sort of like

493
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I was like playtesting it

494
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and like this was, I didn't

495
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
hadn't decided like any like

496
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
numbers at all

497
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and so I had to like kind of

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I sort of had to like

499
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
assume like the optimal way to play

500
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and then like play it through

501
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
like that and then

502
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I put in like

503
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
counters to count like

504
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
how many attacks do you have to do

505
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
how many turns does it take

506
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
how many times do you

507
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
take this damage from this enemy

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
how many times do you take damage from that enemy

509
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and I built those in so that I could

510
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
look at it and then sort of

511
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
tally up the numbers and then be like

512
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
okay so if I set your starting slime

513
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
to this amount

514
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that gives you just enough if you

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
if you are

516
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
if you play correctly

517
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and then I was nervous though

518
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and the reason why there's so little margin

519
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
for error is because if

520
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I wanted to give a little bit of leeway

521
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but if I gave too much leeway

522
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
then that would allow

523
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
for sub

524
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
a wide enough margin

525
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
would allow for sub optimal

526
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
play to the extent

527
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
that you might be able to win without

528
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
understanding the like

529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the like what is the right

530
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
what is the right play

531
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and what is the wrong play

532
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
which I would consider a failure

533
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
like yeah if you

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
just if you didn't

535
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
understand why

536
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
you shouldn't

537
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't know waste certain resources

538
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
at certain times and but you did it

539
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
anyway and you won anyway I would be like well my game

540
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
failed you didn't learn what you were

541
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
supposed to learn

542
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
yeah which is why I controlled

543
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
it so tightly

544
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
it's interesting and I like

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
if we get into the philosophy of that

546
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
because a game

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
is an interactive experience

548
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
but if it's exactly the same

549
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I mean obviously

550
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
there's still interactivity because you can

551
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
fail and you can do it wrong

552
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
but once you know how to do it right

553
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you're doing it exactly

554
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
as the author intended

555
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
as opposed to most games

556
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
where you don't necessarily have to do it exactly

557
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that way there's like

558
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
yeah

559
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
you know

560
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
well it's like

561
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I guess it's like a

562
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
mystery when you

563
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
when you read a mystery

564
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
you know you have the

565
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
tension of the story and then you have the

566
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
when the mystery is revealed you have the catharsis

567
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
of the aha moment

568
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
so I guess in a roundabout way

569
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
what I was going for

570
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
was not so much that like

571
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
was not so much that like

572
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
oh you can

573
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
interact with this game

574
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
this is a creative experience

575
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
that you participate in playing

576
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
but I guess it was

577
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I was seeking after that

578
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that moment of revelation where you're like

579
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
oh I understand

580
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and it so

581
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and I mean based on

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
what people said

583
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
who played it they did have those moments

584
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
where they were like you know first they were like

585
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
oh I see what I have to do

586
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and they try and they're like what

587
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it still didn't work what am I missing

588
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
what am I missing and they're like oh

589
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
there's that works okay I get it

590
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
so like you know

591
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I guess mission accomplished

592
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
in that regard

593
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I think it's good as much as I sound like

594
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm like salty or whatever

595
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I am

596
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
a little bit because I wanted to see

597
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
what would happen

598
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
but I just got too tired

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
maybe I'll try it again soon

600
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
as much as I sound salty

601
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it is a good

602
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
well crafted experience

603
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
like I enjoyed the detective

604
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the detective stuff involved

605
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
hmm

606
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
it's not complete it doesn't have

607
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
a real ending but I did throw in

608
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
a funny little

609
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
something

610
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
when you win

611
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
just a funny little goof

612
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it's not much

613
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
but it's something

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
for anyone who has

615
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
the courage to see it through

616
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
did you ever

617
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
play

618
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and more importantly beat getting over it

619
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
with Bennett Fuddy

620
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I played a bunch of it

621
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and I got pretty far

622
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and I was committed

623
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to beating it because like

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I am

625
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm no offense

626
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
but I am the opposite of you

627
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I am a very patient gamer

628
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and I am very

629
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
driven

630
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm very much like

631
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't get bored

632
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I do get frustrated but it doesn't stop me

633
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I just am like

634
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
however long it takes

635
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I will beat this fucking thing

636
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm very like

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that's not a good thing or a bad thing

638
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
it's just

639
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm very easily hooked

640
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm very easily hooked

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
by something that is like

642
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
you can't fucking beat this

643
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and I'm like yes I fucking can

644
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
so I really wanted to beat Bennett Fuddy

645
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
but at some point I kind of fell off

646
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
trying and I never got around

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
to actually beating it much to my

648
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
shame so

649
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I played a bunch but I never actually beat it

650
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I did spoil myself

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and go and look up and see

652
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
people beating it even though they're not supposed to

653
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
they're not supposed to show it but somebody did

654
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I did it with like the

655
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
cause like seeing the ending is not really

656
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
the point is the

657
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the point is having gotten to the ending

658
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and feeling accomplished in doing so yeah

659
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I did it with the understanding

660
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
that like one day I will go back and I will beat it

661
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I will attain the technical mastery

662
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
but

663
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it's 2021 and I still haven't

664
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
so shame on me I guess

665
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think the thing with that game is that

666
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it's more

667
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
than your

668
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
game would ever be because of the fact

669
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that it's like physics based and you can

670
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
you know

671
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
the movements of the mouse

672
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
are so

673
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
numerous in the way they could

674
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
happen that it's like

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
impossible to have

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
unless you're a robot

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
a perfect path that always works

678
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
without any other problems

679
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
the like the

680
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
like the possible

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I mean you know

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in my game every turn

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you could give one of a number of different inputs

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
so like the number of possible

685
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
the number of possible inputs

686
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
is like

687
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't know how many turns it takes maybe like

688
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
30

689
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
turns or something and each time there's

690
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
3

691
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or 4 possible inputs so

692
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
that's like 3 to the power of

693
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
30 to the power of 4 which is probably

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
like you know

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
something like 10 to the

696
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
10 to the 35th you know some huge number

697
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
but like in

698
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the body it's like every moment

699
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
you know your mouse can be

700
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
have a different position and it can have a different

701
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
velocity and so like

702
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
every moment the possible

703
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
the possibilities are like multiplying infinitely

704
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and so like it's like

705
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
it's like fucking

706
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
instead of like aleph null it's like aleph

707
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
3 or whatever it's like

708
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
it's like

709
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
it's like

710
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
uncountably infinite

711
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
instead of like countable infinite

712
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
if that makes any sense

713
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I guess it's also like

714
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
not a strategic thing

715
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
it's because

716
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
necessarily like knowing

717
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
the right thing to do

718
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
is not so much as important

719
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
as being able to have the

720
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
reflexes to do it or the muscle

721
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
memory to move your mouse in that way

722
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
yeah there's reflexes

723
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and there's muscle memory but there's also like

724
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I mean you do have to

725
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
there are like techniques to learn

726
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
like getting up the

727
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
the chimney

728
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
do you know the chimney part where you have to go up

729
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
the really narrow like

730
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
vertical tunnel

731
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
yeah like getting up that

732
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I mean you can kind of like

733
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
fudge your way through it sometimes

734
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
but

735
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
after you try it a bunch

736
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
you figure out that there is like

737
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
there are consistent strategies

738
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
there are consistent like techniques

739
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that will consistently get you up it

740
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
like cooking your hammer on the lights

741
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and stuff

742
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
so like yeah there's reflexes

743
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and there's like stuff but there's like

744
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
there's sort of puzzles in that

745
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to figure out too where you go oh I can use

746
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
that bit

747
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and if I do it just like this then it works

748
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
like 99% of the time

749
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
there's definitely things you can learn

750
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
but like the game is teaching you

751
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
as you play it

752
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
twitch reflexes and muscle memory

753
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
will not help you get better

754
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
at phantom horn revenge

755
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
phantom's revenge

756
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
phantom's revenge

757
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
so it's purely a 100%

758
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
intelligence test this only

759
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the only thing is the brain

760
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
knowing

761
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and I don't have that you see

762
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
knowing how to beat it yeah it takes some

763
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
oh you gotta learn

764
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you gotta learn like the room

765
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
layouts and you gotta like remember

766
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
like when

767
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
when enemies are coming

768
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
oh I definitely got

769
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
used to

770
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
to the first

771
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
is it a spoiler to say how many

772
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
rooms I got through

773
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
no that's fine

774
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the first seven rooms

775
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I memorized them pretty well because I couldn't get past

776
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
the seventh one

777
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
yeah

778
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
it's a little bit of a

779
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
as I was

780
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
deciding like the room layouts

781
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I was like

782
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you know I want the game to be very exacting

783
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and I want you to have to really know it

784
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
to beat it

785
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but then I was like okay so I have that one

786
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
design goal on the other hand

787
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
on the other hand

788
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
um

789
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
ludonarratively speaking

790
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
sorry to use that word but ludonarratively

791
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
speaking

792
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I forget what that even means

793
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
it's when um oh the gameplay doesn't match the

794
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
story that is yeah gameplay and story

795
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
ludonarratively speaking and I guess this is

796
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
no this isn't a spoiler exactly but this is

797
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
about like

798
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
you know the final game will have story

799
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
elements and it and like the alpha doesn't have

800
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
a story yet so

801
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
so I guess this is a spoiler

802
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
kind of but not really

803
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
you know phantom is he is

804
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
fighting his way through this place

805
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
for the first time

806
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
like he is delving into

807
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
a

808
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
a dungeon essentially

809
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
like a game definition of a dungeon

810
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
uh you know

811
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to get his revenge he's fighting through it

812
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
on his first time he wouldn't know

813
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
like what is coming

814
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
in the next room he wouldn't know

815
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
like oh I have to conserve this for then

816
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
or oh like this room will give me an opportunity

817
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
to you know do such and such

818
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
uh so I was like

819
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
is it ludonarrative dissonance

820
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
is it is it like a bad thing

821
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
if I'm requiring the player to know

822
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
stuff that phantom

823
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
wouldn't know and I was like

824
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I guess my conclusion was yes it is

825
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but

826
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't see a way around that without

827
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
just like completely tanking the difficulty

828
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and making the game winnable on your first try

829
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
which is like an unacceptable

830
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
compromise so I just had to say fuck it

831
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I mean

832
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
there's a in universe built

833
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
in way for him to try again

834
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you could just like revive with

835
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
endless war rules

836
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
no no is that not

837
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
is endless war not here

838
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
it's a bit of a spoiler but no the game does not take

839
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
place in lakakam

840
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
sucks game sucks

841
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
ludonarrative dissonance at

842
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
100% so no if he if he dies

843
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
in the game he is not

844
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
reviving and trying again he actually

845
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
dies for good those are the stakes

846
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I mean lots of games like that but

847
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
what do you do

848
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
we all know that there's an abstraction between

849
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
what the character is and the player playing it

850
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
unless there's deliberately throw attention to

851
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I guess most games

852
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
are like

853
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you generally don't win on your first try

854
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and therefore like

855
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
how did the player character know that he

856
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
had to

857
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
that enemy was waiting for him it's because

858
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
the player played this before

859
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and died and tried to second

860
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I guess most games are like that

861
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
to the point that it's kind of silly that I even thought

862
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
like hmm will this take

863
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the player out of the gaming experience

864
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean

865
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
there's certain ways

866
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
because it's like

867
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
in some games like early NES games

868
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
where like killing the player

869
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
off is like a hold over

870
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
from the arcade where

871
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
if you kill the player unfairly

872
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
they'll spend money to play

873
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
again to get extra lives

874
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and then early

875
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
video games were like

876
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
unfair in ways where you couldn't see

877
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
stuff coming and you'd need to die over

878
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and over again in order to figure out exactly

879
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
what you should do on the way through

880
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
so that you don't fucking kill yourself

881
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and then

882
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that's annoying

883
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
but it's a challenging

884
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
experience and some games are good like that

885
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but more modern games

886
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
like Dark Souls

887
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
are like

888
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
cool

889
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to me at least in the way

890
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
that you can see

891
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
everything coming as long as you

892
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the player

893
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
are paying attention to

894
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the environment

895
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
there's nothing that comes out except in Dark Souls 2

896
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
but there's nothing in Dark Souls 1, Demon Souls and stuff

897
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
there's nothing that

898
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
can surprise you that

899
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
it requires you to die a few times

900
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
to figure out what to do

901
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
you can

902
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
theoretically figure out

903
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and defend against everything

904
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
you say that

905
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and I know you're right

906
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and yet

907
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it never happens

908
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
it never happens

909
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
it's not like anyone ever has the

910
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
experience of oh I'm the chosen undead

911
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and oh I could see

912
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
everything coming because I'm such an attentive player

913
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and I was able to avoid

914
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
all damage

915
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
it's not about having a perfect run

916
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
it's just for the player's

917
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
benefit seeing that

918
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
if you die to something

919
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and then you go back there and you're like

920
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
if I was cautious here

921
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I would have lived

922
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
because I can see the thing coming

923
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I can see the guy around the corner

924
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
it's

925
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
satisfying or gratifying

926
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that

927
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
to know that you the player

928
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
were at fault in a death

929
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and then you feel okay

930
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I did that

931
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
bad now I must get better

932
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and that's why it's so

933
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
because when you play a game

934
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and it's like you couldn't have fucking seen something

935
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
coming and it's like that's bullshit

936
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I hate this and you just get frustrated

937
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and I usually leave

938
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but like

939
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
yeah

940
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
that's what I have to say

941
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I understand

942
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I understand

943
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I mean I guess

944
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I guess the old games

945
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
right it was a holdover from the arcade

946
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
at first but then even after the arcade

947
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
even on console

948
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
like old games they had

949
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
they were difficult

950
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
as a way of extending

951
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
the game time yeah yeah

952
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
which I guess is my goal too

953
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
because like I'm not a

954
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AAA gaming industry

955
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
you know

956
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that was my gym sterling impression

957
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
AAA game

958
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
yeah

959
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
the

960
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm not that I'm just a guy

961
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm making a short little game

962
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and yeah making it

963
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
hard is a way that like

964
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the player will have to

965
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
it won't be over in

966
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
5 minutes and 57 seconds

967
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
maybe it'll take

968
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
an hour or half an hour

969
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
or whatever

970
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
make it a little more of a substantial

971
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
experience which I guess

972
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
is cheap in a way

973
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
but also it's sort of

974
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
a gaming tradition and probably

975
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
generally accepted as

976
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
fine as long as it doesn't

977
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
push into obnoxious territory

978
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and I mean each run

979
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
is pretty short so I'm hopefully

980
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
like yeah because it's

981
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
really bad when it's like oh I couldn't have seen

982
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that coming it's really bad when like

983
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
oh you've been playing for half an hour

984
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and it sets you back all that way right

985
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that's why nobody minds that shit kills you all the

986
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
time in Meat Boy because you respawn

987
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
in like 30 seconds and it's just like do it again

988
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
do it again do it again so like a run

989
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
of Phantom's Revenge is only a few minutes so

990
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that's all you can be said back if you lose

991
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the only way it would be

992
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
bad in Phantom's Revenge if

993
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
was if there were

994
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
too many variables too many things to try

995
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and like too many things

996
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
to memorize at where

997
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
to the point where you would have to start writing down

998
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
like

999
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
every single encounter every single turn

1000
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to do and then trial and error

1001
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
trying everything

1002
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
but you don't have to do that you can

1003
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
figure out quite a lot by

1004
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
just you know

1005
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
simple logic like what haven't I tried

1006
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
like oh if

1007
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
this item if I don't have any of these

1008
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
items at this point then I'm fucked

1009
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
so I gotta keep at least one or

1010
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you know some something like that

1011
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
where it's the the solution

1012
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
to the problem is pretty obvious if you run out of

1013
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
slime it's because you took too many hits

1014
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
or it could be because

1015
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
you attacked too much

1016
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
you know so you learn

1017
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
by the way you

1018
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
lose what you need to

1019
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
alter in the next play

1020
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
play through so it's like it's it's doable

1021
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I feel like I could do it

1022
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
there are a few

1023
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't know

1024
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
there are um yeah

1025
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
there there are a few things

1026
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that I think are maybe like oh okay

1027
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
maybe like if you

1028
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
are someone

1029
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that has like a bad memory maybe there are a couple

1030
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
points where you're like you might write down

1031
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
like okay in this room

1032
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I should do this because

1033
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I mean I've probably forgotten all of the things

1034
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
in the next room yeah but there's not

1035
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that many of them and probably you could

1036
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
just kind of keep them in your head and remember

1037
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
or or not uh I don't know

1038
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
yeah uh

1039
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
yeah I mean so

1040
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
you know I've learned a lot

1041
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I guess I've learned a bunch

1042
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I guess it's given me a like

1043
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
hearing people's input

1044
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
has given me a bunch to consider

1045
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm hoping that a few more people

1046
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
will beat it in the coming

1047
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
days

1048
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
before

1049
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I would like to say

1050
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
that I could have the final

1051
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
version done this month

1052
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
but

1053
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I don't know if I could have the final version

1054
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and all of the like the

1055
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
comic pages that I want to release with it

1056
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
because I want to release a bunch

1057
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
of comic pages that lead up to it and sort

1058
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
of come after it

1059
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
along with the game itself

1060
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
so I don't know if I could do all of that

1061
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in this month but I want to give

1062
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
it my best shot oh

1063
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and then um

1064
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
some a couple people asked

1065
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
this is the thing that

1066
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I was waiting for

1067
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
that I wanted to have done before

1068
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
um

1069
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Sonichu 102 so when

1070
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Phantom's Revenge is done

1071
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and it comes out along with the

1072
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
final pages of Slime and Punishment

1073
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
then I will finally be ready

1074
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
to be like ok mission accomplished

1075
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I can put

1076
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I can finally release

1077
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Sonichu 102

1078
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so that'll be a glorious day

1079
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it'll all come together

1080
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
it'll all come together

1081
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I love it when a plan comes together

1082
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
this is my this is my

1083
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
long game my stupid and

1084
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
probably pointless long game but I just

1085
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
really I just had

1086
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
a vision it's just like

1087
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
it's just like Phantom's Revenge itself I had

1088
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know if it's good or bad

1089
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I just have a very specific

1090
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
vision and I feel compelled

1091
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
like I must make reality

1092
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I must make reality

1093
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
reflect this

1094
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
very specific vision that I have

1095
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and it will be this way or it will be no way

1096
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and that's

1097
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that's how it is

1098
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
it's really

1099
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
exciting seeing this

1100
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
little project this game

1101
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm excited

1102
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
it's legitimately cool it's like

1103
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
it's a little

1104
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you know obviously not all the graphics

1105
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
are there yet but it's the stuff

1106
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
that is there is really good

1107
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
it's very solid

1108
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
it feels like more

1109
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I don't know

1110
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I don't know if well built

1111
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
is the right term

1112
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
but like

1113
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
the first page of the champion

1114
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
had that little video game

1115
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
thing

1116
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it feels a little

1117
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
like more advanced from that

1118
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and it's

1119
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
obviously it's a lot more advanced because it's like

1120
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
actual gameplay

1121
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
this game actually has

1122
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
numbers in it

1123
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
in the champion

1124
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
it's the point

1125
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
that she's so powerful that nothing

1126
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
can touch her but like

1127
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
still means there's not much like

1128
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
replay value for that

1129
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I feel like in a way

1130
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
in a certain way

1131
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Phantom of Revenge is kind of the sequel to

1132
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
that game never really had a name

1133
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
just the champion

1134
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
page zero

1135
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
prelog or something

1136
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
yeah like

1137
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
because it sort of starts out in the same way because

1138
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
minor spoiler

1139
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
the first enemies you encounter

1140
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
in Phantom's Revenge can't hurt you

1141
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
just like the enemies can't hurt

1142
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Sophia

1143
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but then

1144
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
after a room or two

1145
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
some enemies arrive that can hurt you

1146
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and in the final version

1147
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
that'll be justified

1148
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
you'll understand why that's the case

1149
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
in universe but so

1150
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
because it sort of starts out in the same

1151
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
like the main character is invincible

1152
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I feel sort of like

1153
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that champion game

1154
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
iterated upon to like

1155
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
but then let's introduce some enemies

1156
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
that are an actual threat

1157
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
haha

1158
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that's I don't know

1159
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
that's a

1160
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
feeling I have about it

1161
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I don't know

1162
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm very gratified that

1163
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
some people have complimented my

1164
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
sprite work and the animations

1165
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I put a lot

1166
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I put a lot of it work into the sprites

1167
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and the

1168
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the timing because you have to like

1169
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
in game maker studio you have to go in

1170
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and you have to like

1171
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
tell the object like

1172
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
okay

1173
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
when the menu sends this command

1174
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
like when the menu says phantom

1175
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
an attack command it's like okay

1176
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
pause the menu commands

1177
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
pause all the other game functions

1178
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
then the phantom or horn object

1179
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
begins a timer

1180
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and then the timer starts counting

1181
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and then the timer counts

1182
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
it does all these operations on him

1183
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
to like change his position

1184
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and change his sprite

1185
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
all with very precise timing

1186
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and it does certain if l statements to determine

1187
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
like what attack he does

1188
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and then he does the sound effect

1189
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and then he does the sprite

1190
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
and then when he ends his animation

1191
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
it's like okay where is he

1192
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
where does he need to go

1193
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
okay have him move in this path

1194
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to get back to his original position

1195
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
where he'll like sort of like bounce a little bit

1196
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
to give himself sort of like that bounce back

1197
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
that like lends a little more weight

1198
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
to a movement in animation

1199
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and

1200
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
it's just a lot of little bit

1201
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and he does the him and

1202
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
other things they do the

1203
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
when they move

1204
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and they land at their final position

1205
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
they have a little like sort of dust cloud that kicks up

1206
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
from their feet where they move to

1207
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
to sort of give a sense that

1208
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
they've stopped their movement

1209
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
yeah I had that same

1210
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I did that same thing with the

1211
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
yeah with the dust cloud in

1212
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the champion

1213
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
game had the same thing

1214
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
so I put a lot a lot of work into that

1215
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and so it's nice that some people appreciated it

1216
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and I'm like yes I did it

1217
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I did a couple of good things

1218
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and

1219
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't know I want to add more

1220
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
like the drinking animation

1221
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I want to improve and stuff

1222
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
oh boy

1223
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
um

1224
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I was like I feel like I might have had

1225
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
one more thing to say about that but

1226
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
we've talked for like

1227
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
45 minutes about that

1228
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
uh

1229
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it's a big moment

1230
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but yeah it is a big moment

1231
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
it won't be it's not as big as when the final one

1232
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
comes out and people can actually play it that'll be the real

1233
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
that'll be the real poggers moment

1234
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I gotta get my secret

1235
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
project up the ground

1236
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
it's still

1237
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I mean since I've been ill it's been like

1238
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
paused for a while

1239
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
whole last month I didn't really do anything with it

1240
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
why be paused when you can be pogged

1241
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
why pog when there's nothing to look at

1242
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
how can you pog when there's nothing to pog at Ben

1243
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
did you see

1244
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
on Twitter this week

1245
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
there was some sort of kerfuffle

1246
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
about

1247
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
pogs like PAWGs

1248
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
do you know what that is

1249
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
uh fat ass something

1250
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
white girls fat ass white girls

1251
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
and

1252
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I gotta be honest

1253
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I did not look into like

1254
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
what is the controversy about

1255
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I assume it's something about being white

1256
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
um no I didn't

1257
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I've never I've not heard that

1258
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I deliberately didn't go and find out

1259
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
like why are people arguing about

1260
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I was like I think I'm happy

1261
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
or not knowing

1262
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
maybe there's a PAWG

1263
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
champ out there

1264
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
pog I mean

1265
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
if there's not

1266
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
if there's not there should be

1267
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
uh

1268
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
yeah um

1269
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
the pog champions my new comic

1270
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I wanna be a pog champ

1271
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
but I can't

1272
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
cause I'm a virgin

1273
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
that doesn't make sense

1274
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
well I mean I assume that

1275
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
to be the champion

1276
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
means you win

1277
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and to win

1278
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
over a female

1279
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
such as you fuck them

1280

1308
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
because

1309
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I had I was going to

1310
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
draw a new comic for it

1311
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but I was so

1312
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
medicaled

1313
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I was so like hospitaled I was like

1314
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I was weak and

1315
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
weary and I could barely

1316
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
get out of bed a few days

1317
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and it was just sort of not

1318
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
good so I couldn't

1319
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000

1320
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
two to three pages

1321
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
lined I was gonna color them later

1322
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
but I just I just ran out of time

1323
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
so I failed on that and then

1324
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I put instead a snippet

1325
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
of the lord of ghost comic so it's

1326
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000

1388
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
yeah so that was

1389
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
blood taken I didn't faint it wasn't as bad

1390
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
as being in an IV drip

1391
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I don't know whether I mentioned I was at that happened

1392
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I went in one time as an IV drip

1393
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
because I was super dehydrated

1394
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
super dehydrated I get the blood

1395
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
test sent into the lab I get a text

1396
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
a few days later they say

1397
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
blood levels

1398
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
all of these other all these tests we did for these

1399
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
generic things these are normal but this one

1400
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
thing is abnormal

1401
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and we're going to have to look into it

1402
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
we need you to come back for some follow-up blood

1403
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
tests about your liver

1404
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and then I was like

1405
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
oh

1406
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
because I think I talked about last time like I'm

1407
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
scared what if it's diabetes

1408
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
mm-hmm

1409
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
is that a liver thing I don't know much

1410
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that's a kidney thing

1411
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
so it's not a liver thing

1412
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
diabetes is a kidney thing

1413
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I think so kidneys like filter the

1414
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
water blood sugar

1415
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't remember

1416
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
something about the kidneys is what I was assuming

1417
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the liver produces

1418
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
insulin

1419
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
right

1420
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
oh god

1421
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
am I making a fool of myself

1422
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
the kidneys do that and the liver

1423
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
is creates bile for

1424
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
digestion

1425
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
the liver might produce

1426
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
bile but I think the liver produces

1427
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
insulin

1428
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't think the kidneys produce insulin

1429
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
no your liver

1430
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
your liver stores

1431
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
sugar as glycogen

1432
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
yeah sure sure

1433
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
okay so it might be

1434
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't know

1435
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
diabetes

1436
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the point is

1437
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I'm wrong though the liver does not produce insulin

1438
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
okay no

1439
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
yeah so it's probably not that then

1440
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
but it could be like hepatitis

1441
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
because I was just I was going on like okay

1442
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
liver

1443
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
could there be like

1444
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
is there like a terrible liver

1445
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
explodey disease

1446
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
could I have that I looked up

1447
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
hepatitis seems to be one of those

1448
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
things

1449
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
that the liver could have wrong with it

1450
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
so I'm just looking at liver diseases

1451
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I had gone to the doctor

1452
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
got the second set of blood tests

1453
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
they're in the lab

1454
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
it's the weekend so I assume they're not

1455
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
doing analysis at the moment

1456
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and I'm gonna wait for them to get back

1457
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
to me so

1458
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't know at the moment all I know

1459
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
is that there's something abnormal with the something

1460
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
in my liver

1461
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
and that's

1462
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that's it so I'm just sort of trying

1463
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
to survive and drink water

1464
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and eat food and be okay

1465
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
by something abnormal

1466
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I mean do you mean like

1467
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
some kind of

1468
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
hormone or some kind of like

1469
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
some kind of I don't know

1470
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
what's the word enzyme

1471
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
or something or like some

1472
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
sort of blood

1473
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
juice

1474
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
oh yeah wait

1475
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
there was on one of the forms

1476
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
they gave me

1477
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
for the test there was like

1478
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
because

1479
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
you give these forms into the blood test and then

1480
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
they write the thing on the labels

1481
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
so that they know what they're analyzing

1482
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you know

1483
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
there's like a little

1484
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
area for comment from the doctor

1485
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and the doctor was like

1486
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Nash question mark

1487
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
something something I can't remember because I've given the forms

1488
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and I can't read them

1489
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Nash

1490
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
which is apparently non-alcoholic

1491
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
steato hepatitis

1492
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
it's a liver inflammation

1493
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and damage caused by buildup of fat in the liver

1494
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I don't know if that's it

1495
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
but that was just one of the things the doctor was like

1496
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
could it be this could it be that they put a few comments

1497
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and but I don't know

1498
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
so it's probably

1499
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I did get a call and they said

1500
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
it's probably don't

1501
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
worry it's probably not that

1502
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
bad I'm like okay yeah right

1503
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
yeah you're just trying to make me

1504
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
not go insane right now

1505
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
but I trust

1506
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
classic doctors

1507
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
back on their bullshit

1508
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I'm gonna trust her because

1509
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'd rather feel like it's not a big deal

1510
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and then be scared out of my wits when they

1511
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
tell me I got cancer and I'm gonna die

1512
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
oh no

1513
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
it's

1514
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
probably not cancer

1515
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
but it could always be something

1516
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
terrible so

1517
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
when things go wrong

1518
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
it's much more often

1519
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
not a big deal

1520
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
than it is a big deal

1521
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
so I mean

1522
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I wouldn't get too worried

1523
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
yeah yet no I

1524
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I don't drink a lot so that

1525
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it wouldn't be alcohol related

1526
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
yeah so it's

1527
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I don't know you don't I mean you don't drink

1528
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
so how could it possibly be non-alcoholic

1529
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
steato hepatitis

1530
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it just wouldn't make any sense

1531
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
maybe the

1532
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
the prescription is to drink more

1533
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
maybe they'll just say you need to drink

1534
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
you need to get fucking wasted

1535
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
you gotta convert it to alcohol

1536
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
steato hepatitis which is actually a good thing

1537
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you like that

1538
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the non-alcoholic version

1539
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
is the bad kind

1540
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
yeah

1541
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I mean who knows

1542
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I gotta pee

1543
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
hang on

1544
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
okay oh god

1545
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Eleazar you know what to do

1546
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
you gotta cut

1547
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
you gotta cut that shit out

1548
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
you gotta cut that shit right out

1549
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
boy oh you gotta take it

1550
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
you gotta take it all away

1551
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
you gotta take it all away

1552
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
when you shove it

1553
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
in my face

1554
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm living me

1555
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
definitely cut that

1556
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
definitely cut that part

1557
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
don't let him hear

1558
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
don't let them know

1559
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
let it go

1560
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
let it go

1561
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
back anymore

1562
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
sorry

1563
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
sorry

1564
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
you know people have been saying in the comments

1565
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
that they want to hear me sing more

1566
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
because they like the

1567
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
chug jug cover

1568
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
you know I considered recording like a full

1569
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
version of that

1570
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
or a longer version

1571
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
at least with one chorus

1572
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
with one verse

1573
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
when I sat down to like decide what the words would be

1574
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I tried to write

1575
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
a verse and the chorus

1576
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
but I got stuck

1577
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm not very good at writing lyrics

1578
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
so I got stuck writing them

1579
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
and I just decided to only write

1580
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
oh I'm talking about the

1581
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
chug jug cover that I sang

1582
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
and how it's only the chorus

1583
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and how I meant to make it longer

1584
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
but I just

1585
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I was very lazy and only did

1586
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
the like three lines

1587
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm very

1588
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
particular

1589
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
if I can't think of

1590
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
if I can't think of a good

1591
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
lyric that is like

1592
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
funny and not awkward

1593
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and doesn't make me cringe then I'm like

1594
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
no it's no good

1595
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
throw it out

1596
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
won't do it

1597
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
throw it down these bare essentials

1598
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
that's all

1599
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
to put a cap on the

1600
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
gib is

1601
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
diseased thing

1602
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I don't know anything yet

1603
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm probably gonna be okay

1604
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
don't worry about it

1605
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
but if you wanted to know

1606
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'll follow it up

1607
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
if they come back

1608
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
with the test and they say you have something

1609
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and I'll just say I have something

1610
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
whatever

1611
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I don't want it to be like a fixture of the show

1612
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but I also don't want it to be a fixture of my life

1613
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
so I'm gonna try and figure it out

1614
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
we gotta have gib's disease corner

1615
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
every week

1616
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
gib's mystery disease

1617
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I can get a new one every week

1618
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
guess the ailments

1619
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
cool

1620
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
what new malady is gib's suffering under

1621
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
oh

1622
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
it's just been

1623
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
it's like low key pissing me off

1624
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
a little bit I just

1625
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
sure

1626
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
you know on a good day I can get

1627
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
a lot of work done

1628
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I can draw a lot of comics I can work on my secret project

1629
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I can do some stuff

1630
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
these days I'm like

1631
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
if I have a good day

1632
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I'm like thank fuck

1633
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I feel okay let's cook

1634
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
some food

1635
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
once instead of like ordering in

1636
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
let's

1637
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
tidy up let's

1638
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
have a shower and let's do all this stuff

1639
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
wash the dishes

1640
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
let's sit down and relax

1641
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and I guess that's the good thing to do

1642
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
but it does annoy me that the entirety of last month

1643
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
went by and I basically did nothing

1644
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
now this month has started

1645
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
who knows how little I could get done

1646
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
yeah

1647
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
yeah not

1648
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that sucks

1649
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I

1650
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
when you're

1651
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
you just don't have the spoons for it

1652
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
when you're sick you just don't have the spoons for it

1653
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
you know what I'm fucking talking about

1654
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
excuse

1655
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
spoons like

1656
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
alakazam from pokemon

1657
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
yes

1658
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
no like

1659
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
wait the hussy references

1660
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
in psycholoneals

1661
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
once or twice

1662
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I don't know spoons

1663
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
it's a metaphor

1664
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
for like

1665
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
people with like disability

1666
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
when people talk about disability they talk about spoons

1667
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
but it applies to everyone

1668
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
it's just like the metaphor that

1669
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
you only have a certain amount of energy

1670
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
to expend

1671
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
in a day and like when you spend all your spoons

1672
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
you can't do anything else

1673
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and like when you're disabled

1674
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
when you're sick it's like the number

1675
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
you have fewer spoons than the average person

1676
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and you just can't

1677
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
oh that's right there was that spoons

1678
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
there was that spoons meter that depleted

1679
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I didn't know what that was about

1680
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Z has a

1681
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
yep it's uh it's

1682
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I don't know I've heard it here and there

1683
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
most in the context of

1684
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
talking about disability

1685
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
but it's generally applicable

1686
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
it's like

1687
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I know I shouldn't beat myself up

1688
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
over stuff and I'm not really doing that

1689
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
but I can't help but

1690
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
keep it in my mind a little because I want to

1691
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I want to like hit the ground running

1692
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
whenever I can

1693
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
if I get feel better and I'm like

1694
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
okay no reason to like

1695
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
ease my way back into work

1696
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
if I feel good or if I get the medicine

1697
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I need and I can start I just

1698
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I want to be ready to get back

1699
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
to doing things because

1700
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I have a secret project and I want to announce it

1701
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I want people to say oh this is based

1702
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
that's what I want that's the only reason

1703
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I'm having a secret project is because Ben had one

1704
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I made it up immediately

1705
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
as soon as Ben said I have a secret project

1706
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and I was like I have to copy Ben saying

1707
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
make my own oh shit I need

1708
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
a secret project now fuck

1709
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
it's not true but I but I feel

1710
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I fear that some people assume that

1711
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
just cuz it's not true

1712
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
but it's not true and I know it's not true

1713
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
but I believe it anyway

1714
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I believe it

1715
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
do you have that do you have like fear

1716
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
of like people assuming

1717
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
you're a copycat I don't know what you would call

1718
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
that

1719
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I feel like I've talked about it before

1720
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
fear of people

1721
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I don't know if I

1722
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't know if that's a particular fear

1723
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I mean I

1724
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
sometimes I don't really get

1725
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm not really like scared of it but like

1726
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
it's something that comes up when like

1727
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
ah I have a secret project

1728
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
around the same time Ben does

1729
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
oh yeah because every time

1730
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
like I want to like review

1731
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Shrek 2

1732
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I'm like oh I want to do this but then like

1733
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
somebody else on their channel

1734
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
already reviewed Shrek 2

1735
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
that I can't review Shrek 2

1736
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
only one reviewer can have a movie

1737
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
yeah no I know exactly what you're talking about

1738
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
big copycat energy

1739
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and it's just a bad look

1740
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
yeah no but like

1741
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
yeah if I do something

1742
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
something yeah with

1743
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I don't know I'm trying to think when the last time

1744
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I felt it was

1745
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I mean another thing

1746
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I guess if I do something like

1747
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
like the Winnie the Pooh reviews

1748
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
right when I did those I had a feeling like

1749
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
boy

1750
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
this is me like doing like

1751
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
a retrospective about a cartoon

1752
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
which like a million and one

1753
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
other people have done that's like a pretty

1754
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
common thing to do on YouTube feels kind of

1755
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
derivative kind of just feels like

1756
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm doing what all those other guys do

1757
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
people are going to roll their eyes at me

1758
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
when I do it yeah like I had a bit of that

1759
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
feeling so I know

1760
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I mean that's a little different because

1761
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
my secret project is not the same

1762
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
type of thing as yours

1763
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
uh oh spoilers

1764
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
um well

1765
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
but there's other things

1766
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
like I've seen this

1767
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
and it annoys me a little bit I'm not that

1768
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
bothered by it but like yeah

1769
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
when people

1770
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
ascribe like my transition

1771
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
to Digi

1772
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
or Trixie I should say

1773
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
like Trixie transitioned

1774
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and that

1775
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
like put in motion me and I'm like

1776
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
no you don't understand

1777
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
what was going on in my head before that point

1778
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
no

1779
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
and there was even a moment

1780
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
in like at Radcon 4 when I was

1781
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
wearing like the punk cosplay

1782
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
or the

1783
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
the uh the what

1784
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
shoot for the calendar shoot

1785
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
uh huh

1786
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
like Trixie was not

1787
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
like going for feminine

1788
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
at the time no and I was

1789
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I was kind of going for feminine

1790
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
yeah she did like the

1791
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I feel like she was inspired by the way

1792
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I looked and I was like

1793
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
oh that's cool but now people

1794
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
just because Trixie came out first

1795
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
people think I'm

1796
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I was I'm not copying anyone

1797
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I think didn't

1798
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
she say specifically

1799
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
that she was kind of inspired

1800
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
by

1801
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
you know

1802
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
she probably said it about other people

1803
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
but she did she did

1804
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
she did tell

1805
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
she told

1806
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
she told me that like the way that I looked

1807
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
uh uh

1808
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
was like

1809
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
the makeup

1810
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
with the eyeshadow and stuff

1811
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
she said that like that

1812
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
it was probably just all of us just like

1813
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
seeing all of us like go for the girl look

1814
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I think yeah more

1815
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
accurately it wasn't like anyone came first

1816
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
yeah it was

1817
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
the idea of it

1818
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
was put forward

1819
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and then when we actually had to

1820
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
do it some of us was like

1821
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
uh oh

1822
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
uh oh

1823
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
uh oh I like it uh oh

1824
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
this isn't good or is it

1825
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
and and that was that

1826
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
um LeMau

1827
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
well I wouldn't know about that

1828
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
it is a LeMau moment

1829
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
a big big LeMau moment

1830
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
um

1831
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
no um

1832
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
no I like the I like the eyeshadow but in like

1833
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
uh but in like a I'm a cool

1834
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'm a cool like goth guy

1835
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
in like a super masculine way like

1836
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
in like a super masculine way though

1837
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
in a real testosterone based way I love

1838
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
in a very yes in a very toxic

1839
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
masculinity kind of way like

1840
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
really fucked up

1841
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
like I'll punch people

1842
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
uh

1843
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
yeah not to imply that

1844
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
you have to transition because

1845
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
you like makeup makeup can be for everyone

1846
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
that's true that's true

1847
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
um but uh

1848
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
sure I I

1849
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I well I don't

1850
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
understand but I empathize

1851
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I I I don't know

1852
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
okay how about I just say okay

1853
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
how about I just say okay to all that

1854
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
okay

1855
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
fine

1856
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
um right

1857
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
so there's no there's no pressure

1858
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
necessarily to do anything

1859
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
okay well

1860
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
don't worry about it Ben

01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I'm being peer pressured

1862
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'm being peer pressured

1863
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm being indoctrinated into the cultural

1864
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Marxist cult

1865
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
these pink pills I have here

1866
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
they're just they're just like props

1867
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
they're like theater props

1868
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm gonna I'm gonna abolish

1869
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000

01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
perfectly speaking of abolishing capitalism

1876
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
yesterday was May

1877
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
day

1878
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
um and I

1879
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
was invited to

1880
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
a

1881
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
a communist rally

1882
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
basically that's what it ended up being

1883
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
it was

1884
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
not very big

1885
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
it was in it was actually in the exact same place

1886
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
that um the other one

1887
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
the um

1888
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
the march that I went to after the George Floyd

1889
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
stuff

1890
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
oh that was on the 4th of July

1891
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
so this was on god that was almost

1892
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
almost a year ago oh my god

1893
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
it was in the exact same place

1894
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
this one was much smaller

1895
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
and it was a bunch of people

1896
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
who were trans

1897
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
not like most of them but like a significant number of them

1898
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
um and they

1899
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
you know they gave some

1900
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
speeches this was like

1901
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
there had been like previous

1902
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
activities in other places

1903
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
the thing had moved from like downtown to it had moved to this

1904
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
the place was called newbie and square

1905
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
this was in like a sort of

1906
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
a slightly more off the beaten

1907
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
path part of Boston

1908
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
um uh uh

1909
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
and then and then

1910
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
it was sort of like the final

1911
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
meetup followed by like one final like last

1912
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
march like back to

1913
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
the downtown area so there weren't that many

1914
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
people there maybe there had been more in the day this was pretty small

1915
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
there were probably like maybe

1916
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
40 people 30 or 40 people

1917
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
um

1918
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
and um

1919
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
they had they had uh the anarcho communist flags

1920
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
uh you know they had red flags

1921
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
and stuff they had

1922
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
international workers of the world

1923
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
flag I just thought was pretty cool

1924
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
uh they gave some speeches they talked

1925
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
about like programs

1926
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
one girl gave

1927
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
an announcement about like an org

1928
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
that they were founding which actually sounded pretty cool and it was called

1929
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
it was called blue

1930
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
oh god

1931
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
blue crime blue dime

1932
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
that's what it was and it was an organization

1933
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
dedicated to pushing

1934
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
for like legislation

1935
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and like

1936
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
court rulings I guess

1937
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
in favor of police

1938
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
basically being forced to like

1939
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
pay for their own crimes

1940
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
instead of like taxpayer money

1941
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
covering it which is what

1942
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
uh usually happens

1943
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
so I thought that was pretty cool

1944
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
um and we did the march

1945
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and the march was definitely

1946
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
illegal

1947
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
um the march was

1948
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
nice the march was most definitely

1949
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
not like sanctioned by anyone

1950
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
there was no

1951
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
there was it was like blocking traffic

1952
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
cars were honking at us

1953
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
uh

1954
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
uh buses were definitely

1955
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
held up uh which was very funny

1956
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
uh the guy

1957
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I don't I actually

1958
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
the the person leading it I

1959
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
genuinely couldn't tell you if they were

1960
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
a man or they could have been a trans mask

1961
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
or a trans femme it was just

1962
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I just I just don't know I just don't know

1963
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000

1964
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
they were yelling in a microphone

1965
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and we passed by like a restaurant

1966
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
where a bunch of people were doing

1967
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
outdoor dining and this

1968
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and they like screamed

1969
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
in the microphone they're like it's May Day

01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
later on if like it doesn't do anything

2023
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
like the point of

2024
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I mean I guess a journalist

2025
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
was go and have a look and I guess

2026
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
but that would be about it

2027
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I guess like that's all fine if you

2028
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
get your fucking protest like

2029
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
approved by the local authorities

2030
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
and schedule like that's fine no no

2031
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
disrespect but like

2032
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
you know thinking

2033
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
back thinking back

2034
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I don't want to I don't want to compare myself

2035
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I don't want to compare myself to like

2036
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
uh a fucking

2037
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
one of the people doing like

2038
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
us the civil rights movement

2039
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
under like Martin Luther King or I don't want to

2040
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
compare this to that I don't know grand

2041
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
eyes it like that but I mean

2042
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
those people did like sit-ins

2043
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and diners for instance

2044
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and like

2045
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
you know that was the point

2046
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
literally the point of that was to inconvenience

2047
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
people and like not even

2048
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
not even like the government

2049
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
just like

2050
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
people and it was just to make a point

2051
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and to make a public spectacle

2052
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
the idea is to

2053
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
get it to the point where the government

2054
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
has to do something to alleviate

2055
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
the situation thereby

2056
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
causing the government

2057
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
to pay attention to whatever was happening

2058
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and did it inconvenience

2059
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
you know

2060
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
random everyday people just trying to go about

2061
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
their lives who had done nothing wrong

2062
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
yep it sure did

2063
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
but like

2064
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
so what

2065
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
so what you know

2066
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
you can you can look at that

2067
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
you can look at that fact

2068
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
and you can think to yourself

2069
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
well small price to pay

2070
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
or you can be like

2071
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
mmm you know

2072
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
people should

2073
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
maybe they should maybe they should be a little more civil

2074
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
you know maybe maybe they're

2075
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
pushing a little too hard for civil rights

2076
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
mmm scoop

2077
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
you know I kind of think that

2078
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Negro liberation

2079
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
shouldn't maybe should

2080
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
maybe we're not ready for it just yet scoop

2081
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
maybe

2082
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
maybe they should just stay in their lane scoop

2083
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
you know what I'm saying

2084
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Shaggy why

2085
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
he's

2086
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
he's learning he's getting better he's getting better

2087
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
he's not a Nazi anymore

2088
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
we've de-radicalized him

2089
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
he's got a lot to learn but he's getting better

2090
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I promise

2091
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
who would have known that Shaggy would have been that guy and then Fred

2092
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
was like the hardcore leftist

2093
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Fred became like an antifa

2094
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Fred Fred Fred is antifa

2095
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Fred is antifa he beat the shit out of Shaggy one day

2096
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
he beat the shit out of Shaggy one day

2097
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
we weren't looking

2098
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
we weren't looking

2099
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
okay well

2100
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
so that's so that's my thought those are my

2101
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
thoughts on civil disobedience

2102
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I was thinking if I could scoop it in a word it's good

2103
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
political affiliations where's Velma

2104
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
where'd she go

2105
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I

2106
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
there's um

2107
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
there's a really funny video

2108
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I don't know if it's from a stream or something but it's um

2109
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
it was re it was tweeted

2110
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
by means TV you know means TV

2111
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
nope

2112
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
they it's it's the same channel

2113
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
it's the same people that made

2114
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Nyan Cat

2115
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
but they like they rebrand

2116
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
themselves into just like a full on

2117
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
like communist like media

2118
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
collective that is

2119
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
that is like a

2120
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
yeah they're like a worker they're like a co-op

2121
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
they're like a cooperatively run

2122
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
fucking

2123
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
youtube channel

2124
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
twitter account slash you know just sort of like a

2125
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
social media I mean

2126
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
empire I guess would is probably

2127
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
overstating it but a brand

2128
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
if you will and

2129
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
oh this video

2130
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
it's a guy like going through the entire

2131
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
roster of like the latest

2132
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Mario Kart

2133
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
you know going through all the characters

2134
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
all the different variations of dry bones

2135
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
and all the different like koopalings and stuff

2136
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and being like yeah this guy is like

2137
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
a hardcore Reaganite

2138
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
yeah this guy is Antifa

2139
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
you know this this guy

2140
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
is like an anarcho primitivist

2141
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
you know this guy is really into bitcoin or whatever

2142
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
do they have reasons or are they just looking at them

2143
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
in the same statements

2144
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
he does give a little bit of justification

2145
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
for most of them I'm probably not doing it justice

2146
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
because he does kind of explain why he thinks

2147
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
and it's really it's really funny

2148
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
baby Luigi's a fascist

2149
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I don't remember

2150
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
one or two of them were

2151
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
well Bowser's a fascist obviously

2152
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but there was more to it

2153
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
they weren't all like super obvious

2154
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I'm not doing it justice

2155
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
it made me chuckle a lot

2156
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I wonder if I could find that

2157
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I saw it like months ago

2158
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
baby Mario's an anarcho Bidenist

2159
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
yeah he's a twitch streamer

2160
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
he's a voshite

2161
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
he's a voshite twitch streamer

2162
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
a debate bro

2163
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
lol

2164
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
so that was my

2165
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that was my May Day

2166
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
it was pretty

2167
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
what if a political race had blue shells

2168
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
a political race

2169
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
you know like the race

2170
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
like a Koopas

2171
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
no like in like politics

2172
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
so they say it's like a race

2173
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
oh that's what they did to Bernie

2174
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Bernie was the front runner in the DNC

2175
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
and then Biden fucking blue shelled him

2176
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
so true

2177
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
he was in last place

2178
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
he was in last place

2179
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
so he got the blue shell and it changed everything

2180
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
it was the worst

2181
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
mother fucker

2182
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it was malarkey

2183
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
it was pure

2184
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
unadulterated malarkey

2185
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
um

2186
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
that was my May Day

2187
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I have one, I have notes here

2188
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I have a couple of notes on my notepad

2189
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
there's one

2190
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
sad story that I have to relate

2191
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I think

2192
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
okay

2193
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
before Covid there was a thing

2194
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
called mice

2195
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
which stands for

2196
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Massachusetts independent

2197
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
comics expo

2198
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
and once a year

2199
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
at a place pretty close to my house

2200
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
like you know like two fucking bus stops

2201
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
down for me or whatever

2202
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
or tea stops

2203
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
they would have this thing

2204
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and it's basically comic

2205
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
artists go and they have tables

2206
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and you can buy their shit

2207
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and I hate it

2208
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I hate going to it

2209
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
but it's because I don't want to buy anything

2210
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
but for a couple years now I have been

2211
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
wanted to like try tabling

2212
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
cause like I've never tabled at a con

2213
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
or anything but it's a thing that people do

2214
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
that people like me do

2215
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
people that sell comic books or whatever

2216
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and I feel like mice would be the perfect place to do it

2217
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and I

2218
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
should really see if they're gonna have one

2219
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
in 2022 and see if I can sign up for one

2220
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
um

2221
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
cause I still want to do it next time they have it

2222
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
um but last time

2223
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I think this would have been late 2019

2224
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I went to it, I hated it

2225
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I did meet a couple of famous people

2226
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
who I knew

2227
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Casey Green was there

2228
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
he was sitting at a table, he was selling his shit

2229
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
and there was also

2230
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
you know Casey Green

2231
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
do you know

2232
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
you might not know this other person, Abby Howard

2233
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
nope

2234
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
okay well she

2235
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
she does um

2236
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
she did comics

2237
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I think she's

2238
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
does a lot of like more commercial illustrations

2239
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for like

2240
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
children's books

2241
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
a lot of like zoology themed like kids

2242
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
texts

2243
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
and stuff I think is what she's doing a lot of now

2244
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
but she um

2245
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
she used to do comics but the reason I knew her is because

2246
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
she got her break

2247
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I guess you would call it on

2248
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
uh she was on strip search

2249
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
she was one of the contestants on strip search

2250
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
she didn't win I think she was like

2251
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
she was one of the finalists though

2252
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
and then she went on to do a kickstarter for

2253
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
what she had come up with in the course of that show

2254
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
the comic was called The Last Halloween

2255
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I think the kickstarter raised like $50,000

2256
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
so pretty good

2257
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
anyway she was there

2258
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and I got uh I said hi to her

2259
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
she was on it and I was like can I get a picture with you

2260
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and she was like yes and I got a picture with her

2261
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and

2262
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I realized

2263
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
yesterday I think I lost the picture

2264
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I don't think it exists anymore

2265
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I think

2266
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
it was on my old phone that I lost

2267
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
at that bar

2268
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
um you know

2269
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
early last year

2270
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
yeah I lost my phone at that bar

2271
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me

2272
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
did I talk about

2273
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that you did talk about losing your phone

2274
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and how I went back to the bar

2275
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
and the bartender like sneered at me

2276
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
and like glared at me like I was like

2277
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
like he hated me and I felt like so bad

2278
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I still think about it

2279
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I still think about like god I

2280
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
made that bartender hate me like I must be the worst

2281
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I must be the worst person

2282
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I must have been heckling that stand-up comedian

2283
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
like so bad like everyone in the room

2284
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
must have thought I was the biggest loser

2285
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I made a fool of myself and I can never

2286
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
show my face in public again

2287
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm getting upset

2288
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I'm getting upset just thinking about it

2289
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
um anyway

2290
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
did it not go to like google photos or anything

2291
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
yeah it's

2292
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
it's worth checking

2293
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I actually I have a couple of like hard

2294
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
drives that I think it's possible

2295
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
that it might have backed

2296
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
my phone up at some point on

2297
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and also it's possible that it might

2298
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
have gone to like google

2299
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
the cloud somewhere

2300
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
maybe I don't know I need to check

2301
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
but I as of right now

2302
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm afraid that that picture may

2303
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
have been lost and I would be sad

2304
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
about that

2305
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I'm not even like

2306
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I'm not even like a huge Abby Howard

2307
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
fan it's not like I think

2308
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
her work is like amazing

2309
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
if she speaks to me or anything

2310
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I just

2311
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I know her from that show

2312
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
she's kind of a big name

2313
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I thought it was cool that I met her

2314
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and I thought it was cool that I got a picture

2315
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
with her so

2316
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I would be probably a little bummed

2317
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
if it was gone but I

2318
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I'll look around and if

2319
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I do find the picture

2320
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I will tell Eleazar to show it

2321
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
and if not

2322
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
then

2323
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I had a thing

2324
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
a few days well a few weeks ago

2325
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I realized that a whole like month

2326
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
or something or at least

2327
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
there was a day out it was my birthday

2328
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
like a year or two ago

2329
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I went to see

2330
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I went to see the universal

2331
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Harry Potter like the

2332
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
film set stuff

2333
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and I walked around and we took pictures

2334
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
and I was like I want to look at those again

2335
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
those are funny some of them

2336
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
and they're all gone

2337
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
that entire like block of time

2338
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
is not on google photos it's not backed up

2339
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
anywhere it's not on my phone

2340
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I do not remember deleting them

2341
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I have no idea

2342
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
where they're gone and I was so upset

2343
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
because I couldn't figure out

2344
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
what the fuck happened because it was like

2345
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
my phone went back to like

2346
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
you know all the way to Redcon 3

2347
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
and then like

2348
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
everything before that

2349
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
things after that but this one

2350
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
like area there's just like

2351
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
a few months where there's nothing

2352
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I was so upset

2353
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
that it wasn't like stored in the cloud

2354
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I don't know what happened to it

2355
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I mean yeah

2356
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
that would be

2357
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
that would suck really bad

2358
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
especially if there was like

2359
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
some stuff that happened in that period that you

2360
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
would like to have pictures of

2361
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
that's lame as hell

2362
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
why would it do

2363
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
fuck god

2364
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
who would have thought that

2365
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
images

2366
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
who would have thought that like entrusting

2367
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
all of our fucking data

2368
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
to these like monolithic megacorporation

2369
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
who would have thought it could ever backfire

2370
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I mean it's weird though

2371
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
cause like all of the photos are still

2372
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
on my phone like physically

2373
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
and they're also

2374
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
okay so they're not gone gone

2375
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
yeah I don't delete things

2376
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
off my phone it's got like a big hard drive

2377
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
capacity so I'm like

2378
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I don't need to delete anything

2379
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
and I don't remember doing anything

2380
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
like to save space

2381
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
maybe I did

2382
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
maybe they just deleted a few months of stuff

2383
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
for no reason

2384
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
maybe

2385
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
sucks

2386
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
sucks pretty bad

2387
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
sucks pretty bad

2388
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I went to see the gringots

2389
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I saw the gold

2390
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
and I saw the spiders

2391
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I did post a few things on my personal instagram

2392
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and those are the only things I have

2393
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
from that time

2394
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I guess I have the memories

2395
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
which were good

2396
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
that's pretty good memories

2397
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
you can't get like likes

2398
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and subscribes with memories

2399
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
you can't like print that on a t-shirt

2400
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
you can't

2401
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
you can't sell that on gumroad

2402
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
nope

2403
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
yeah I can make an NFT

2404
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
of my time at the Harry Potter thing

2405
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I can make an NFT of my memories

2406
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
it'll be like a notepad document

2407
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
that says I had a great time

2408
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
NFT please buy

2409
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
damn

2410
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I thought

2411
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
it seemed for a minute there

2412
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
that NFTs were over

2413
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
but I keep seeing them

2414
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
so

2415
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
they caused enough of

2416
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
a hubbub

2417
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
that some normies

2418
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I don't know really whether normies

2419
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
are the right word but like

2420
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
crypto freak

2421
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
people who are like less

2422
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
internet savvy

2423
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
just wholesale

2424
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
bought into it because it's like

2425
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
oh dude money

2426
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
dude I love bitcoin

2427
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I love something

2428
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and then you know there's like a few people

2429
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
legitimately thinking it's

2430
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
worth their time in any way

2431
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
it's so upsetting

2432
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I saw a

2433
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
tweet from Dan Olson

2434
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
speculating that

2435
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
like okay

2436
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
that maybe just a lot of this NFT stuff

2437
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
is literally just money laundering

2438
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
like it's just

2439
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
rich people with dirty money

2440
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
doing this

2441
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
NFT thing as like

2442
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
a cover for just like

2443
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
moving money around in a way that like

2444
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
will hide it

2445
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I mean there's no regulation

2446
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
for the crypto currency stuff

2447
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
so that would obviously be the way

2448
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
to do it

2449
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
yeah

2450
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
which

2451
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
honestly if that's true

2452
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I hope that is true because it

2453
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
makes me less sad than like

2454
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
thinking that like

2455
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
a real consumer market

2456
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
for

2457
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
nothing which is what NFTs are

2458
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
like exists

2459
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
and like will continue to exist

2460
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I would like to think that if such a thing

2461
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
exists it's just a front for something

2462
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
you know

2463
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
bad but

2464
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
at least comprehensible

2465
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
yeah

2466
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
so you know

2467
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
world is a fuck

2468
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
yeah

2469
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
what do you think about the voicemails

2470
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I think voicemails sounds good

2471
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I think that sounds

2472
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
a-o-k

2473
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
all right

2474
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
well you got them

2475
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
if you got them up

2476
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
the first voicemail

2477
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
the first voicemail

2478
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
of the day is called

2479
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
choose

2480
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
choose

2481
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
okay on 3, 2, 1, go

2482
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
big choice

2483
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
let die the gummies you

2484
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
love

2485
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
or suffer the little children

2486
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
now choose

2487
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
the demand

2488
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
what

2489
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I could make out some of that is he saying

2490
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
you get the gummy thingy

2491
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
or you kill children

2492
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
oh I thought he said the commies

2493
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
as in like I have to choose communism

2494
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
or kids die

2495
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
oh if it's gummies then that's

2496
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
that's difficult

2497
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
all the

2498
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
the tiki mickey mickey mouse

2499
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
saccharide

2500
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I can always make more gummies

2501
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I can always make more gummies

2502
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
but I can never make children

2503
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
because I will never have sex

2504
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
so I will sacrifice

2505
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
the gummies

2506
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
yes, yes

2507
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
facts don't care about your feelings

2508
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Mr. Goblin sir

2509
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
we got to choose the children

2510
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
they're more mathematically

2511
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
speaking they're more precious

2512
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
just in terms of dollars in the sense

2513
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
like if there are more children

2514
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
then I can grow up to create

2515
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
a malucaduca saccharides

2516
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
that you could then use to make gummies with

2517
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
we can put them to work

2518
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
we can put them to work

2519
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
in the tapioca fiber farming

2520
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
factory

2521
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
exactly

2522
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
next voicemail is called

2523
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
autism part 1

2524
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
there's a part 1 and a part 2

2525
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
so part 1, 3, 2, 1, go

2526
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I'd like to weigh in on the whole

2527
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
self-diagnosing yourself

2528
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
with autism thing

2529
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
for me personally

2530
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
it's like

2531
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I totally get what you're saying

2532
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Ben

2533
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
there's definitely people

2534
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
who use that as a crutch

2535
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
right to sort of

2536
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
as an excuse to act a certain way

2537
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
or to absolve

2538
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
their actions

2539
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
but it's like

2540
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
for me personally it's like

2541
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I guess

2542
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
it's sort of a

2543
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I see it as somewhat of a shorthand

2544
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
to explain myself

2545
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I guess

2546
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I've generally found that there are

2547
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
certain ways

2548
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
that like people

2549
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
generally aren't

2550
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
able to accept

2551
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
certain facets about me

2552
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
and it's like

2553
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I admit that I'm somewhat

2554
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
attached to this interpretation

2555
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
of myself

2556
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
but it's like

2557
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
it's sort of this shorthand

2558
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
to explain these things to people

2559
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
in a way that they can like

2560
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
understand

2561
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
for me it's sort of

2562
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
it's like a shorthand

2563
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
in that it allows me to

2564
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
you know

2565
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
communicate things in a way that

2566
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
people can like empathize with

2567
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and like actually like understand

2568
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
as opposed to like sort of dismissing it

2569
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
and sort of

2570
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
expecting me to be able to conform

2571
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
unconditionally

2572
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I get this like a shorthand

2573
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I feel like I get what you're saying

2574
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
let's listen to part two

2575
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
3, 2, 1, go

2576
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
like

2577
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
regardless of whether or not I'm actually

2578
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
you know

2579
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
high enough on the spectrum

2580
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
to be categorically classified

2581
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
as autistic

2582
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I relate to enough of these

2583
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
characteristics

2584
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
to like enough of an extent

2585
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
at least that it is useful for me

2586
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
to like

2587
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
use that

2588
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
to attempt to explain myself

2589
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
to people to sort of like

2590
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
to attempt to like

2591
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
convey like why I am

2592
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
the way I am right and it's like

2593
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
fuck I don't know

2594
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I think

2595
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
the problem with this is the

2596
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
wait I want to

2597
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
love you guys keep doing what you're doing

2598
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I don't know

2599
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
okay I understand that like

2600
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
it might be useful shorthand

2601
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
for some things

2602
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
but is it

2603
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
does it explain anything

2604
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
like I think I don't know if I can

2605
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
make the leap like it

2606
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
describes something like if you say

2607
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
oh yeah I'm kind of autistic

2608
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
lol maybe that

2609
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
says something about the way

2610
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
you think god I don't

2611
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
remember like all the attributes

2612
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
you know I don't know

2613
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
rigid thinking

2614
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
a you know a

2615
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
you know a resistance

2616
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
to like a change in routine

2617
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
you know hyper fixation on

2618
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
certain particular

2619
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
interests whatever

2620
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
inability to recognize social cues

2621
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
whatever maybe it's useful shorthand for that

2622
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
but does it explain why

2623
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
or are you merely describing

2624
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
a set of traits by invoking

2625
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
the word I don't think it explains

2626
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
anything

2627
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
yeah I think my problem with

2628
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
this is

2629
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
the implication because he said like

2630
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
some people use it as a crutch

2631
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and

2632
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
you know like that

2633
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
idea could be bad but for him

2634
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
it's different I feel like

2635
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
it's still

2636
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
up in the air regardless

2637
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
of whether you're using it as a crutch

2638
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
or whether it's a good shorthand

2639
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
or not people

2640
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
people will not necessarily

2641
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
understand or react in the same way

2642
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
when hearing that you have autism

2643
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
if you make a social faux pas

2644
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
it could be because

2645
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
you have autism or it could be

2646
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
because

2647
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
you have like a lack of social practice

2648
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I mean even autistic people

2649
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
need social practice it's just

2650
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I guess

2651
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I guess I would wonder

2652
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
what the purpose is in

2653
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
assuming it's true

2654
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
when

2655
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
you could just say like

2656
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
do you have autism I don't know

2657
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
could be could not be never had tested

2658
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
never been tested but like

2659
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
it's

2660
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I feel like

2661
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
in a situation whether you're talking to someone

2662
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
and then you say something and you think oh god

2663
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
that was kind of autistic and then you say

2664
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
to them sorry if I'm a bit autistic

2665
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I have autism

2666
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and that's just how I am

2667
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
like what is the goal

2668
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
with that statement is it to

2669
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
say please treat me

2670
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
with patients

2671
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
or

2672
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
or is it saying I act

2673
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
this way please don't expect me to

2674
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
improve like what could it be

2675
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
used for I guess is my

2676
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
question

2677
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
if you

2678
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
if you

2679
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
as shorthand

2680
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
for the traits

2681
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
associated with

2682
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
autism I guess I understand

2683
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
why it would be useful

2684
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
to describe

2685
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
yourself or someone else in that way

2686
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I suppose but like

2687
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
to make

2688
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
the leap from that to saying

2689
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
like I am autistic

2690
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I have autism

2691
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I don't know

2692
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
if that's like the same thing

2693
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
yeah I'm thinking like in a social situation

2694
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
you say something that's kind of

2695
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
a little cringe and you're like

2696
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
sorry I'm not

2697
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
very used to this or like I'm kind of

2698
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
bad at talking to people like there are ways you can put it

2699
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
that don't like ascribe a medical

2700
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
something or other to you

2701
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
that you may not have

2702
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I think being socially awkward

2703
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
is like

2704
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
it's something a lot of people have that doesn't

2705
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
necessarily

2706
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
necessarily

2707
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
go with autism

2708
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
like exactly you can just be

2709
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
out of practice

2710
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
like I feel like I may have

2711
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
thought I could be

2712
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
potentially autistic but I also

2713
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
don't know

2714
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
whether it's just a

2715
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
like a

2716
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
general lack of practice

2717
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
in socializing because I

2718
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
don't like doing it generally

2719
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and that's like is that

2720
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
an autism thing or is that just a thing

2721
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
thing like it's like a life thing

2722
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
you could just grow and have

2723
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
preferences for types of interactions

2724
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I think the

2725
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
it may be a good

2726
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
shorthand but like

2727
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
it's also a medical thing

2728
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I don't know

2729
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
it's an interesting question because like

2730
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
normal people don't

2731
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
necessarily know what it means to

2732
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
medically be autistic or not

2733
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
if they associate autism with

2734
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
like being a little socially awkward

2735
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
and you say that then they'll get it

2736
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
that will be true but I guess

2737
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
it won't always be true depending on who you're

2738
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
talking to

2739
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
like if somebody knows more

2740
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
about autism and then you say that

2741
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
and they're like really

2742
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
then it's confusing

2743
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
things where it doesn't need to but

2744
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I guess I would find a different

2745
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
shorthand way of saying

2746
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
that you have these problems or

2747
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
just get tested and then you'll know

2748
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I would

2749
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
say

2750
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
seeing as

2751
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
unless I'm wrong

2752
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
and autism is not

2753
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
a like

2754
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
biologically based

2755
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I mean I think

2756
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
it's not like

2757
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
it is a biological

2758
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
thing like we don't understand it

2759
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
but it's not like a learned behavior

2760
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
it's not a

2761
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
socially constructed

2762
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
condition

2763
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
it is a

2764
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
function of your biology

2765
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
you either are autistic

2766
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
or you are not and it's determined by

2767
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
your genes

2768
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I mean I don't know exactly how it

2769
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
works but the spectrum

2770
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
if I'm wrong then like

2771
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
fuck me and I don't know what I'm talking about

2772
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
but that's what I think

2773
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
and if that is true

2774
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
the spectrum

2775
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
the spectrum became

2776
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
like a thing

2777
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
at some point

2778
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
in the past I used to think it was like

2779
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
you either have it or you don't then there was the

2780
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
spectrum and I heard about that and I was like

2781
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
okay so all I really know

2782
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
is that the science is not

2783
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
conclusive and it is being

2784
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
worked on and like

2785
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
understood more as time goes on

2786
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
so like

2787
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
it's a

2788
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I mean the spectrum is like

2789
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
in the same way I mean there's a spectrum

2790
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
of height where like

2791
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
some people are short

2792
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
some people are tall

2793
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
but there is a wide gradients

2794
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
of

2795
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
numbers that you could be at

2796
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
in between those two

2797
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
and if you're kind of in the middle are you short

2798
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
are you tall well you're kind of in the middle

2799
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I mean you know

2800
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
that's kind of an interesting metaphor

2801
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
because

2802
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
if everyone

2803
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
around you is a certain height

2804
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
and you're a little

2805
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
taller you would be considered tall

2806
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
even though you may be like 5 foot

2807
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
and everyone else is 4 foot

2808
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
right so like

2809
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
maybe autism could work the same way

2810
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
like it depends on your environment

2811
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
the way that you stick out

2812
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
in the environment

2813
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
is like the autistic

2814
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
like are you suggesting

2815
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
that maybe certain populations are just

2816
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
generally more autistic than others

2817
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
and like within those places

2818
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
what I'm suggesting is that

2819
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
it's more contextual

2820
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
than it is like absolute

2821
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
like how many autism

2822
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
like points does a person have

2823
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
before they're considered autistic or not

2824
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
or is it just how

2825
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
they differ from the people

2826
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
like the general

2827
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
population that they live in

2828
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
like if you've got all the autistic people

2829
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
and put them in one country

2830
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
would that become a normal country to each other

2831
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
citizens are they all going to be normal

2832
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
who knows

2833
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I don't know

2834
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I feel like it could work more like that

2835
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
maybe

2836
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
if everyone

2837
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
if everyone was just like

2838
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
more autistic across the board

2839
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I mean

2840
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
would society like change

2841
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
if like the general population was just

2842
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
like more or less

2843
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
you know autistic

2844
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
would society like look different

2845
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
would we have structured

2846
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
our

2847
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
governments and our

2848
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
communities differently perhaps

2849
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
probably I don't know

2850
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
it depends on

2851
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
when you were talking about the effects

2852
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I actually know like

2853
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
literally what

2854
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
behaviors are caused

2855
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
by levels of

2856
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
autism

2857
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I mean I don't fucking know what I'm talking about

2858
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
there's a lot of science to this

2859
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I want to

2860
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
dovetail this

2861
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
with just a mention

2862
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
that some people

2863
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
last episode we got a question about

2864
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
isn't calling yourself

2865
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
trans kind of like being

2866
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
kind of like just calling yourself autistic

2867
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
and I don't want to talk too much about that

2868
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
but I just want to say

2869
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
if you think gender is a

2870
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
medical condition

2871
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
or a biological condition

2872
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
if you think it is something that you need to be diagnosed with

2873
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
you're just an idiot

2874
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
you're just a complete idiot who believes in fairy tales

2875
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
and I don't even know how to fucking fix you

2876
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
so I'm not even going to try

2877
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
okay I just want to mention that

2878
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
next voicemail I guess

2879
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
that was thought provoking though

2880
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
that was thought provoking

2881
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
good voicemail

2882
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
next one is from

2883
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Frost Drive

2884
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
3, 2, 1, go

2885
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
hey have you guys heard of the new underwater

2886
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
magical roguelike game

2887
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
it's called subnoidica

2888
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
what

2889
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
no

2890
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
no I haven't heard of it

2891
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
get out

2892
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
ah

2893
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
god dammit

2894
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
okay at least it was short

2895
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
next one is called response to

2896
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
the behind the bastards guy

2897
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
2 weeks ago

2898
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
3, 2, 1, go

2899
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
oh my god

2900
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
oh my fucking god this fucking idiot who comes on this show

2901
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
last week this fucking moron this fucking pawns

2902
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
this fucking maroon who comes on and is talking about

2903
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
how you bend these to listen to behind the bastards

2904
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
and the robber Evans is an arachis

2905
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
and it'll make them stopping a fucking lectures because he talks bad about Stalin once

2906
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
when if you listen to any of the other

2907
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
almost any other episode

2908
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
it's all about how companies are evil

2909
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
how nazis are evil how the right wing

2910
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
is evil how liberals are evil

2911
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
his twitter banner is like

2912
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
obviously communists

2913
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
cause Stalin wasn't

2914
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Stalin was an authoritarian

2915
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Robert Evans is an anarchist

2916
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
anarchists fucking hate authoritarians

2917
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
they hate capitalists, liberals, communists

2918
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
they fucking hate you people

2919
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
dude dude

2920
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
wait, Stalin did some bad things

2921
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
like oh shit I guess

2922
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I guess capitalism

2923
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
does work after all

2924
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I guess we shouldn't

2925
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
open up the COVID-19

2926
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
vaccine patents to the other countries

2927
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Bill Gates is right

2928
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Stalinist Russia and Maoist China

2929
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
they got the flag with the red and the sickle

2930
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
that means everything socialist

2931
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
and communist is exactly the same as everything they did

2932
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
it's just like that

2933
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
it's exactly the same

2934
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
what? that's what we want to do

2935
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
that's what we want to do

2936
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
such

2937
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
such base

2938
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
takes

2939
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
it's not true

2940
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
you fools

2941
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
it's not true it's libel

2942
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
it's slander and libel

2943
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
good voicemail thank you

2944
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
thank you mister response to the behind the bastards

2945
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
guy two weeks ago

2946
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
next voicemail is from alaskanweeb

2947
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
three two one

2948
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
go

2949
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
but yeah like behind the bastards

2950
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
is actually pretty fucking based

2951
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Robert Evans used to write for Cracked

2952
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
and he has another podcast also called

2953
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
it could happen here that's about how the United States

2954
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
is on the precipice of a civil war

2955
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
and it was written about two years ago

2956
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
so there's some parts that are more focused on the election

2957
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
but in general it's kind of timeless

2958
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
and you should totally fucking listen to it

2959
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I

2960
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I forgot to listen to it last time

2961
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
maybe I'll give it a try

2962
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
this will be the time that I actually do

2963
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
since I've since I keep getting recommendations

2964
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
for it

2965
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
next one is called questioning

2966
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
benjamin sainterman's

2967
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
leftism

2968
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
three two one go

2969
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
being, why don't you ever bring

2970
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
leftist onto the podcast

2971
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
you bring cryptophascist

2972
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
onto the podcast but you don't reach out to leftists

2973
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
like who

2974
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
you have people like hungry bowtie or epic hunter

2975
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000

2976
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
that you were talking about the other day

2977
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
you could invite many leftists onto the podcast

2978
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
but you don't

2979
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I can't get Zae Squirrel

2980
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I can't get Zae Squirrel

2981
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Zae Squirrel is too good for me

2982
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000

2983
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000

2999
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
but who is not too big

3000
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
that they would

3001
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
not

3002
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000

Zae Squirrel

3006
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I don't know I don't know what Zae Squirrel is like

3007
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
first of all I don't know

3008
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
that she even like does

3009
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
podcasts or any audio appearances

3010
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
at all I'm not aware that she has ever

3011
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
done such a thing maybe she has I don't know

3012
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
but I mean she's like

3013
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
she's got like she's got like 50,000 followers

3014
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
she's a she's a much

3015
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
bigger deal than I am

3016
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
imagine how it looks think about how it looks

3017
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
for some idiot

3018
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
with 5,000 followers

3019
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
to go to someone with 50,000 and be like

3020
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
hey I'm a really big fan

3021
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
would you like to come on my podcast

3022
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
you look like a fucking moron everybody hates people like that

3023
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
so I don't do it

3024
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
yeah

3025
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
yeah

3026
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and maybe do I maybe miss out

3027
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
could there maybe occasionally be someone

3028
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
who like I would be a big

3029
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
a big scoop a big break a big hit

3030
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
and they'd be like yeah sure and they would

3031
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
gain to grace the PCB it's possible

3032
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
it's possible I might have missed out

3033
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
on some opportunities because of my Jim

3034
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
kind of storm dancer on

3035
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
we got Jim storm dancer on

3036
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
but Jim storm dancer himself

3037
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
is not famous frog fractions

3038
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
is much more famous than Jim

3039
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
storm storm dancer is

3040
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I guess so

3041
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I mean that's why I asked him

3042
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
is because I looked at his Twitter and I saw that

3043
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
like he's only got like 8,000

3044
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
followers like he's not like a huge

3045
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
personality

3046
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
on social media he might be within

3047
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
he's got a Twitter

3048
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
he might be

3049
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
you know willing and I was exactly

3050
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
right and he was and he came on the show

3051
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
and it was legendary

3052
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
legendary

3053
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
so

3054
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
left us are small but

3055
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
cool

3056
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
are there any I mean if you've heard of them there's not

3057
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
if you've heard of them

3058
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
honestly I was shocked that

3059
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Minerva came on

3060
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
she's got like

3061
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
she's got like hundreds of thousands

3062
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
of

3063
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
well the reason I asked her is because

3064
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
she like responded to one of my tweets

3065
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
and like she knew who I was

3066
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
so I was like

3067
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
oh okay well hey would you like to come on my podcast

3068
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I wouldn't have just asked her that out of the blue

3069
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
because

3070
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
she's got more

3071
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
cloud than me

3072
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
your

3073
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Christian lecture has like

3074
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
over a million views now right

3075
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
it's got a million views but

3076
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
my channel is only 17k

3077
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
which is like more of a

3078
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
people find videos and they're like

3079
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I don't know

3080
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
you might be able to like

3081
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
like say hey I'm like

3082
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I got a podcast

3083
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
you want to be on it you've seen that video loads of people have seen those videos

3084
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
that's true

3085
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I mean that is true

3086
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
that is true

3087
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
yeah but

3088
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
you know what I'm not going to go around

3089
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
asking like hey have you seen that Christian

3090
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
lecture that I made it's got

3091
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
a million views you must have seen it

3092
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
it's got a million views

3093
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
you must have seen it

3094
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
yeah it's obviously not the way to do it like that but like

3095
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I don't know I feel like maybe you have more

3096
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
cloud potential than you

3097
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
realize

3098
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I

3099
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
maybe but

3100
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I feel like

3101
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
waiting for someone to know me

3102
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
is the

3103
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
is the only acceptable is like the only

3104
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
like socially acceptable way to do it

3105
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
sure I can't go around

3106
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
go around asking people

3107
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
yeah I don't know so that's why

3108
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
but fuck you I've had

3109
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I've had a bunch of fucking left

3110
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
us on just not just not specifically

3111
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
the ones you're thinking of and I'm so

3112
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
sorry okay

3113
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
next one you know

3114
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
maybe maybe I'm speaking out of turn to say

3115
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
that about Minerva but I mean from her

3116
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
tweets it really seems like she's

3117
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
she's uh

3118
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
she's of a mind she's on the

3119
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
she's on the wavelength

3120
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
that's just my assumption though

3121
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
next voicemail is called

3122
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
the third stage of grief

3123
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
three two one go

3124
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
does anybody else have contact with this

3125
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
ghost lightning person that Trixie has

3126
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
mentioned a million fucking times before

3127
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
like anybody that Trixie

3128
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
actually respects and will listen to

3129
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
that isn't like a fucking crazy

3130
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
sociopath or whatever

3131
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
we talked to that person

3132
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
can somebody fix this

3133
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000

3135
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
ghost lightning is just on twitter

3136
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
um they're not

3137
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
like particularly well known or anything

3138
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000

3142
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Trixie doesn't like communicate with anyone

3143
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000

thank you

3165
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I will keep going I'm so you know

3166
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I had um

3167
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
it was a it was a relief it was a relief

3168
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
to put the game demo out because I felt

3169
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
like it had been a while since I had really

3170
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
put out like a substantive like

3171
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I made a thing

3172
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
uh I had been feeling like

3173
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
for a while like oh god I don't do

3174
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
anything like oh god

3175
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
um so that that feeling

3176
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
has been um momentarily alleviated

3177
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
uh which is nice

3178
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
um

3179
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
next voicemail is called

3180
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I don't know I didn't pay for

3181
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
it three two one go

3182
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
all right first time

3183
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
here's my thought

3184
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
that lecture that everyone's mad about

3185
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
right yeah what if

3186
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
it was just

3187
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
some kind of technical failure

3188
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
like you guys

3189
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
were done recording then

3190
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Trixie looked

3191
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
oh shit I didn't hit record

3192
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
or like later

3193
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
she puts it on some

3194
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
shitty hard drive

3195
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
without backing it up and it

3196
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
just dies and it's kind of her fault

3197
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
what if it

3198
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
that's all it was

3199
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and she just decided

3200
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
to make a big thing

3201
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
a big ideological thing

3202
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
out of it just

3203
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
so she wouldn't have to admit

3204
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
she fucked up

3205
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I mean

3206
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
he's saying that that could be

3207
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
the case I don't think that would be the case

3208
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
well I

3209
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
like why would she lie about that

3210
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I don't know why did she do

3211
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
anything um

3212
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I would I don't think that's

3213
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
the most likely explanation

3214
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
but it could

3215
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I mean I could see it being

3216
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
true maybe but if it was

3217
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
true like it wouldn't really change my opinion

3218
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
about anything

3219
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I mean if it was

3220
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
true like if it was like a fat 32

3221
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
moment and like

3222
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
and and

3223
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and if that was the case

3224
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Trixie would just be able to say yeah

3225
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
the hard drive failed it's gone

3226
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
and then we'd honestly it would

3227
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
be a better excuse yeah

3228
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
that would be a much better excuse

3229
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
that would because because what would we even

3230
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
say about that like

3231
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
we just have to accept it

3232
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
like you can't really yeah honestly she should

3233
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
have honestly if she just didn't want to accept

3234
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
it she should have just quietly deleted

3235
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
it and then like pretended that there was

3236
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
that there was a technical failure it would

3237
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
have worked out better um

3238
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
so but

3239
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I don't know

3240
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I don't know

3241
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I don't know

3242
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
who knows

3243
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000

had this week I have had

3268
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
a um

3269
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
a sea shanty

3270
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
stuck in my head I've been like singing it

3271
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
in the shower actually

3272
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I had a dream

3273
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I had a dream and I don't really remember

3274
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
what the dream was I I remember

3275
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
it took place in a school

3276
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
and a song came on

3277
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
on the intercom

3278
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
and it made me cry in the dream

3279
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
and I woke up

3280
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
and I wanted to

3281
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
and I just was

3282
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
and I had it I was like what was the song

3283
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I couldn't really remember but I thought maybe it was this song

3284
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
and it was the sea shanty

3285
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
that I had heard posted around

3286
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
like remember

3287
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
at the beginning of the year when there was like

3288
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
the little sea shanty fad

3289
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
yeah

3290
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
um it was a shanty it's called bones

3291
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
in the ocean and I and I

3292
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
put it on and I listen to it and I just

3293
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
uh

3294
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
and the and

3295
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
that's no that's Wellerman

3296
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
um bones in the ocean is different

3297
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
bones in the ocean I didn't

3298
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
realize this until later it's not

3299
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
like a historical shanty it was made

3300
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
in 2003

3301
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
by a like modern folk band called

3302
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
the longest johns

3303
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
um which is fine it's still a good

3304
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
song but I listened to it and I sobbed

3305
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
and I cried and I bawled

3306
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I listened to it a bunch of times on repeat

3307
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
and I cried tears

3308
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
um

3309
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
and it's been it's been stuck in my head

3310
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
all week since then

3311
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
uh it's a very sad

3312
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
song but it's life affirming

3313
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
it's a beautiful song I really like it

3314
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
it's not very much it's pretty

3315
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
not similar to

3316
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
nightcore remix of come clean

3317
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
by Hilary Duff it's a different genre

3318
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
um

3319
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
another song another song that I

3320
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
have in my head and this one's very specific

3321
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
and very weird it's the

3322
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
do you know a channel called mandalore gaming

3323
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000

3326
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000

one go

3421
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
someone who really enjoyed

3422
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
your undertale discussion from the early

3423
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
pcp days

3424
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
and someone who has recently finished

3425
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
undertale I was wondering

3426
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
what were your thoughts on azrael

3427
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
dreamer as a character

3428
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
thank you

3429
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
um azrael is

3430
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
real azrael is the kid right he's the kid

3431
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
go yes um

3432
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I think

3433
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
that azrael

3434
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I don't think

3435
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
he's a great character

3436
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I think he's kind of just

3437
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
no I think he's kind of

3438
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I think the story surrounding him

3439
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
I think he's kind of just there

3440
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
in the story because he needs to be

3441
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
but he himself like

3442
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
isn't really

3443
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
much of a character he's a gut punch character

3444
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
and I think his

3445
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
as a character it's more

3446
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
of like what you learn about

3447
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
him than it is talking to him

3448
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
uh

3449
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
the whole like laboratory stuff

3450
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
where you realize that

3451
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
there was a fallen child that came

3452
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
before you that was sort of

3453
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
not you but it is you

3454
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
or I can't remember the undertale very well

3455
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
but I do remember really

3456
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
enjoying azrael

3457
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
uh boss design in like the

3458
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
true pacifist ending

3459
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
um because

3460
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
it's like

3461
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
really I don't know whether this was intentional

3462
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
but it's like the sort of

3463
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
like um

3464
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
design that a kid would come up with

3465
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
so like if azrael was

3466
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
to choose his own form he'd be so

3467
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
fucking badass with all these fucking

3468
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and like laser beams

3469
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
and like the rainbow magic

3470
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
stuff going all over the place

3471
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
hyper ultra mega death laser

3472
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
yeah and you

3473
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
like that's sort of cute

3474
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
yeah that's cute

3475
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
but

3476
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
but there's not much

3477
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
there's not much more than the cuteness

3478
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
he's a cute kid

3479
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
and I guess he's been turned evil

3480
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
by what is it is it the

3481
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
fact that he's like trapped in like a time loop

3482
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
he's become evil

3483
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
yeah he's the sort

3484
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
he is what you could become

3485
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
if you do the genocide route but then he

3486
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
is like overwhelmed by

3487
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
how much more deadly you are

3488
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
by when you do it

3489
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
so you destroy him

3490
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
and he's like oh shit

3491
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
that's too much but in every other playthrough he's like

3492
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
haha I know I can save

3493
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
and load I know what you're doing

3494
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
he's like he's he's he's

3495
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
bigger than his britches

3496
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
flowy is him right like flowy

3497
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
is yes real okay yes

3498
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I don't feel like

3499
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
okay I think what I don't like is that

3500
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
flowy and him don't feel like the same

3501
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
character even though they like canonically

3502
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
are

3503
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
like flowy doesn't seem

3504
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
like a little kid

3505
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
he just and he doesn't seem

3506
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
like he would have these like

3507
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I don't know this you know

3508
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
the high super ultra mega death power

3509
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
stuff like that's

3510
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
like as to as as real

3511
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
as a kid and as real the boss

3512
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
don't feel like I feel like that's

3513
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
like was like maybe toby came up with that

3514
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
at the last minute he's like oh what if flowy was

3515
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
as real along but I feel like that was like an after

3516
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
thought like after flowy was already written

3517
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
no no I feel I feel

3518
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
like this it's there is a dissonance

3519
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I kind of agree but I think the reason

3520
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
of it is because you learn

3521
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
about as reels past through

3522
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
those like lot data logs

3523
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
or videotapes or whatever you find

3524
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
in the lab where you can like

3525
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
hear him and like Kara talking

3526
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
or

3527
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
something and you get a sense he's like a really

3528
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
little kid but then flowy

3529
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
feels just like a cynical

3530
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
edgier older

3531
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
kid a little bit he's kind

3532
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
of like

3533
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
you could imagine him having a deep voice

3534
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
but in the context of knowing

3535
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
everything about as real and then seeing

3536
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
flowy through all the different play throughs

3537
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I think it is more cohesive

3538
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
a little bit

3539
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
because it does feel like if a kid

3540
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
was like you know how

3541
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
kids can be cruel a kid

3542
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
learns this power or is stuck

3543
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
in a flower

3544
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
and they play

3545
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
this thing over and over again they can

3546
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
kill people and then they can

3547
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
go back and then they can kill them again

3548
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
and over time I think that would make

3549
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
anyone kind of evil

3550
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
but flowy seems to

3551
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
take a like a childish

3552
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
glee in it and when things

3553
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
get too real when you're the genocide

3554
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
player he's like

3555
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
he's playing tough

3556
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
and he is tough because

3557
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
of that boss thing but I don't know

3558
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
the way that I'm coming off with this on the top

3559
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
of my head because I haven't played in a while

3560
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I guess

3561
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I mean you can come up with reasons why

3562
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
but just the way that he acts

3563
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
when he's flowy and when he's

3564
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
the flowy boss versus

3565
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
when he's as real the

3566
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
boss I understand that like

3567
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
when he's kid as real he's like good

3568
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
so like that's different so it's fine

3569
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
that he acts different when he's kid as real

3570
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
but like what is the difference

3571
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
between when he's flower like

3572
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
when he's flowy boss he's like

3573
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
insane and crazy and when he's

3574
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
like regular flowy he's kind of like

3575
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
insane and unhinged but like in a sneaky

3576
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
conniving way but then when he's

3577
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
as real he's like

3578
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
he's just like earnestly angry

3579
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
anime villain like heartfelt

3580
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
like kid who's who's been

3581
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
turned dark but like has

3582
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
like you know has like a

3583
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
pure heart that you can reach if you try hard

3584
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
and they don't feel like the same character at all

3585
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
they don't act the same I guess I'd need

3586
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
to replay it because I don't remember what

3587
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
as real was like as a boss

3588
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
yeah he's like

3589
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
most of what I remember was sans

3590
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
as a boss because I played that the most

3591
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
yeah he when he's

3592
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
he's like

3593
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
when he's flowy he's like

3594
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
sadistic and crazy but when he's

3595
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
as real he doesn't he's like

3596
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
he's like

3597
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
he's like he says like don't leave me or stuff

3598
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
and stuff and like

3599
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
like how could like before you beat him

3600
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
yeah I think like he's like

3601
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I'll kill you or something isn't it

3602
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
like he's like mad that like

3603
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
he thinks you'll abandon him or something

3604
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I feel like he says

3605
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
something like that during the battle

3606
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I can't remember they

3607
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I don't know that's my thought is they don't feel

3608
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
like the same they don't feel like the same

3609
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
and I like that I don't like that they are the same

3610
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
because when I think about them I don't

3611
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
it I had to

3612
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
ask to confirm because in my mind they don't

3613
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
that doesn't feel real

3614
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
it it is yeah like

3615
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I feel it as well a little bit

3616
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
um but like

3617
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
in terms of like what at

3618
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
as real the as real

3619
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
as as real boss and kid

3620
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I guess they feel about as fleshed out

3621
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
as any other of the undertale characters

3622
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
was just to say not a huge amount

3623
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
other than they have a very

3624
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
particular you know

3625
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
character archetype that they

3626
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
express very strongly

3627
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
which is fine

3628
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
uh

3629
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
okay next voicemail is

3630
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Solaru

3631
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
3 2 1 go

3632
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
hey y'all

3633
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
this might be a long voicemail

3634
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
a few episodes ago Ben and Gid

3635
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
talked about hiding and printing out their first

3636
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
ludes in the other days on the internet

3637
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I wanted to share my story that I haven't told

3638
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
anyone please

3639
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
back in the mid 90s I would walk home from

3640
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
grade school and junior high school in Long Island

3641
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I had no internet access yet

3642
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I was just thirsty all the time

3643
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
as I walked home from school

3644
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
there would be times when I would find business cards

3645
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
on the sidewalk

3646
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
these cards would have a topless model on them

3647
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
on one side

3648
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
for one 900 sex lines

3649
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
on the other

3650
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I collected these cards wherever I could

3651
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
yeah

3652
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I didn't have access to anything else

3653
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
and I would just keep it close by

3654
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I needed a way to hide them

3655
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
and knew my mom would search my room

3656
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
constantly

3657
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
so I managed to survive to tell you

3658
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
the story since I did find a perfect hiding spot

3659
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
under every first gen

3660
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
nintendo console

3661
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
there was a square dust cover

3662
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
that would protect the accessories port

3663
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
it's the one that they used

3664
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
in Japan for the disk system but never came out

3665
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
to America

3666
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I found that I could fold the cards and get them

3667
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
stacked inside the tray

3668
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
even though it was a great hiding spot

3669
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
it came with paranoia every day

3670
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
it was a great hiding spot

3671
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I was essentially

3672
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
holding them on for a year

3673
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
before I destroyed them as we moved out of the house

3674
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
anyway that's my story

3675
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
sorry

3676
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
that's um

3677
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
that's great

3678
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
imagine the

3679
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
with no internet access what are you gonna do

3680
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
but you're a kid

3681
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
but imagine

3682
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
all you've got is these fucking

3683
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
gentlemen's club business cards

3684
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
on them

3685
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
oh god

3686
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
digerotype printed in

3687
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
matte black and white

3688
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
it's so much of it

3689
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
is the imagination

3690
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
you see it

3691
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
and then you burn that image into your brain

3692
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
and then you create something with it

3693
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
in your brain

3694
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
in your imagination

3695
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I feel like I've been in situations like that

3696
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
where it's like

3697
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I don't have a lot

3698
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I mean you know what

3699
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
there's moments where it's like

3700
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
internet's out

3701
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
oh no I can't look up porn

3702
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I have to think about it

3703
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I have to make it up

3704
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I have to remember what it looks like

3705
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
like a barbarian

3706
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
it doesn't always work

3707
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
next voicemail is

3708
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
fena2

3709
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
3 2 1 go

3710
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
ok

3711
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
so the real problem with fena

3712
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
alright the quality of his animation

3713
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
the designs

3714
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
the uncanniness

3715
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I can deal with that

3716
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I can copy the performer best anime in the world

3717
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I like rap boy genius

3718
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
when I watch rap boy genius

3719
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
that looks bad on purpose

3720
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I'm filled with happiness

3721
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
when I watch fena I feel like

3722
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I'm sitting next to fucking george

3723
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
from 6th grade math class

3724
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
and he's like

3725
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
this is

3726
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
abel

3727
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
he was killed by his brother

3728
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
in the bible

3729
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
and he thinks that genocide

3730
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
and eugenics actually isn't that bad

3731
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
and also

3732
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
your dog doesn't really love you

3733
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
it's just an

3734
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
just a fucking animal

3735
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
you idiot

3736
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
fena just doesn't seem like a really good guy

3737
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
he doesn't really seem like a nice person

3738
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
he makes good things

3739
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I don't like him

3740
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
that's interesting

3741
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I didn't really watch enough

3742
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I didn't really watch enough of the videos

3743
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
to really

3744
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
to get a sense of his

3745
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
personality other than

3746
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
that he reminds me of

3747
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
that one german

3748
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
asshole who kept asking me

3749
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
to review his shitty

3750
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
furry novel

3751
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
yeah that's the one

3752
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I guess he was Austrian

3753
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I mean

3754
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
it doesn't shock me

3755
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
to think that maybe if I watched a bunch

3756
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
of his content like his opinions

3757
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
would strike me as those

3758
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
of an asshole

3759
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
that doesn't surprise me at all

3760
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I mean that's the sort of thing you would do

3761
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
if you were an asshole is to make a youtube channel

3762
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
is to be fena

3763
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
you're right

3764
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
you're absolutely correct about that

3765
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
but

3766
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
this poppy the performer

3767
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
is from

3768
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
a show called wolf circus

3769
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I get

3770
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I'm not really familiar with this one

3771
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
but ratboy genius looks bad

3772
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
on purpose

3773
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
it's funny

3774
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
the way it looks is part of why it's funny

3775
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
so that's not

3776
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
a good comparison

3777
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
this is trying to look good

3778
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
fena thinks this looks good

3779
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
and he thinks he's done a good job

3780
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
and the people that watch it

3781
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
agree so like that's the problem

3782
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
that's the problem

3783
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
that I can't move past

3784
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
there's a problem that I can't move past

3785
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I'm sure there's others

3786
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
next voicemail is called

3787
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
please god watch odd taxi

3788
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
3, 2, 1, go

3789
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
if you guys are still into anime

3790
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I'd like to hear your opinion on

3791
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
odd taxi

3792
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
because I think it's pretty good

3793
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
and the fucking idiots

3794
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
idiots on A are like

3795
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
it's so boring

3796
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
furry ship

3797
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
when I don't think

3798
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I hate media, I hate people who consume media wrong

3799
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I hate them

3800
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
but I hate them slightly more than fena

3801
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
slightly

3802
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
it's good, it's good

3803
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
it's a crime drama about a walrus

3804
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
who drives a taxi

3805
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
there's a missing girl who we may or may not have kidnapped

3806
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
there's a lot of drama

3807
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
a lot of like intrigue

3808
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
we're only on episode 3

3809
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
and I made like a huge

3810
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
sprawling chart of the characters

3811
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
and their relationships

3812
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
and yeah, it's really good

3813
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
it's really good

3814
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I really hope that it doesn't like get left in the dust

3815
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
this season

3816
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
like I hope it becomes another mole car

3817
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
it's really good

3818
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
mole car? I don't know what that word mole car is

3819
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
um

3820
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
it looks like

3821
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
it looks like a mole car

3822
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
it looks like it could be fine

3823
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I don't know

3824
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
oh wait, Nate

3825
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
made a

3826
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
made a video at some point

3827
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
talking about a bunch of anime

3828
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
from a season and mole car was a little

3829
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
mole car

3830
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
was a little something from it

3831
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I think

3832
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
all one word

3833
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
mole car anime

3834
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
um

3835
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
oh yeah, yeah, it's like a

3836
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
it's like 3D

3837
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000

02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
a pui pui mole car

3845
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000

um

3847
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000

they walk on their wheels

3850
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000

3880
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
it looks great

3881
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I'm not excited to watch it

3882
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I probably won't

3883
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I probably won't watch it

3884
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
I don't want to watch a fucking show

3885
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
I think about watching a show

3886
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
and I just want to cry

3887
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
because I'm like why would I do this to myself

3888
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
why would I spend

3889
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
fucking 10 hours

3890
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I don't care, I don't fucking

3891
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
care about media

3892
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
god, I'm so bored, I'm so bored

3893
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
just thinking about watching a serialized television program

3894
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
to speak to shows

3895
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
you should watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer

3896
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
yes, but definitely watch

3897
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Buffy the Vampire Slayer

3898
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
god, that was a really really funny

3899
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
episode recently, but of course

3900
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I will not talk about it ever

3901
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
because I don't want to spoil anyone for anything

3902
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
wait, what?

3903
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
there was a what?

3904
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
there was a really really funny episode

3905
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I guess it's not really a spoiler

3906
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
but it's like

3907
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
everyone bursts into song

3908
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
and the entire episode is a musical

3909
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
and they're like trying to figure out

3910
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
what could be making them

3911
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
like what sort of demon is causing them to all burst into song

3912
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
and have like choreographed dance numbers all over town

3913
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
and there's like

3914
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
they're doing all these songs about stuff

3915
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
and then in the background

3916
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
sometimes you'll see like some random lady

3917
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
doing like a

3918
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
her own little musical number

3919
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
with a parking ticket guy

3920
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
he gave her a parking ticket and she's saying

3921
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
why, oh why

3922
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
can't you like just singing

3923
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
about that as they walk around

3924
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
that was funny, that was good

3925
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
very nice, very good

3926
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
um

3927
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I'm sorry

3928
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
voice mailer

3929
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I'm sorry

3930
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
your pitch just didn't land with me

3931
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
your pitch just didn't land

3932
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I'm sure this isn't the reaction you wanted

3933
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I'm so sorry to disappoint you

3934
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I love you, I appreciate you

3935
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
but I'm not gonna watch your fucking

3936
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
bullshit anime

3937
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
piece of shit

3938
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
next voice mail

3939
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
is called based joker 6

3940
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
3, 2, 1, go

3941
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
you know Batman

3942
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
when you say peacock

3943
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
well no one bats an eye

3944
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
but when you say poop

3945
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
yeah I knew it

3946
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
well suddenly let's get that man off

3947
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
of the mall PA system

3948
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
you know it's a good bit

3949
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
you know it's

3950
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
you know it's a formula

3951
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
it's a formula but you know

3952
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
you shake it up

3953
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
each time you twist it around a little bit

3954
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
you do a new shape and you know it's evergreen

3955
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
it's an evergreen formula

3956
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
you know I'm reminded a little bit

3957
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
because of that line

3958
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
of the time

3959
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
where double Batman was like a meme

3960
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
we had

3961
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
and like Radcon 1 or something

3962
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I like

3963
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I remember double Batman

3964
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I don't even remember like where that came

3965
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
from I remember talking about it

3966
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
at Bronycon

3967
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
but that was like

3968
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
wait did we

3969
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
we might have been talking about it before

3970
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I remember it being like

3971
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
in the car a lot

3972
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
that was in the car at Bronycon

3973
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
but that was before any Radcons

3974
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
right?

3975
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
yeah that was the Bronycon

3976
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
that we went to

3977
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
before we did the first Radcon

3978
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
where we thought that would have been a better idea

3979
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
yeah

3980
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
so that's an old ass PCP meme

3981
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
and I don't even remember where it came from

3982
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I really don't

3983
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
do you?

3984
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I think it might be

3985
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
footage in one of my

3986
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
vlogs of the Bronycon

3987
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
like the

3988
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I forgot what they were called

3989
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
something to rather give and take

3990
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
vlog

3991
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Bronycon part 2

3992
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I feel like there's a clip in there of that

3993
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
because I remember having my camera out

3994
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I feel like there

3995
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
but I think it was from before that

3996
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
it was definitely

3997
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
came up before that

3998
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
there's a clip of it like

3999
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
evolving in real time

4000
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
because at that we joked about

4001
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Triple Joker

4002
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Triple Joker was only funny because

4003
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Double Batman was already a thing

4004
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I don't remember, I don't think I was around

4005
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
for Double Batman

4006
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
to come into

4007
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
into existence

4008
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I can't remember, I have no idea

4009
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
if any voicemailers remember

4010
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
send us one

4011
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
but not

4012
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
imagine that like 30 people all send voicemails

4013
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
that are all just like telling

4014
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
I feel like the only people who would know

4015
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
is Jesse and Trixie

4016
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
it was from

4017
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
the 30 voicemails that all just say

4018
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Double Batman came from that one episode

4019
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
of the horse cast or whatever

4020
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
oh yeah, maybe

4021
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
like, comment, and subscribe

4022
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
don't go back and listen to those

4023
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
don't listen to anything I did before

4024
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
like, comment, and subscribe if you remember

4025
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
the horse cast

4026
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
the progenitor

4027
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
like, comment, subscribe

4028
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
and

4029
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
patron if you remember

4030
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
the Norse cast

4031
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
are the horse casts

4032
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
still

4033
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
around? I hope those are still

4034
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
available somewhere

4035
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I mean, I haven't looked for them

4036
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
it wouldn't shock me if like, wherever they were

4037
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
had been like, deleted just because

4038
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
like, entropy

4039
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
but I hope not, I hope they're

4040
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
somewhere

4041
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
well, my horse cast live

4042
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
is on

4043
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
horse cast the second with Trixie

4044
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
and Jesse is up

4045
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
by just Google

4046
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
they're all on Jesse's channel

4047
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
on um

4048
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
which channel, Endless Jest?

4049
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Manchild, Inc

4050
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
oh, on Manchild, Inc

4051
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
that was the one that used to be

4052
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
used to be drowning in horses

4053
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
why did he make a new channel?

4054
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
for Manchild, Inc?

4055
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I think he just wanted to coast off

4056
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
of stuff that was supposed to be like

4057
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
corporate, like

4058
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
no, no, no, no, Manchild, Inc was

4059
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
no, but then he made a new channel for Endless Jest, right?

4060
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
uh

4061
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
no, drowning in footwear

4062
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
became Endless Jest, didn't it?

4063
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
oh, so Manchild, Inc

4064
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
was a spin-off?

4065
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
no, but

4066
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Manchild, yeah, Manchild, Inc was a spin-off

4067
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
that I think he made

4068
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
it was for like the plot line

4069
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
that was supposed to

4070
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
come around

4071
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
after the horseshoe finale

4072
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
there was like, there was like a

4073
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
gonna be a plot line where he was like selling out

4074
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
and that was like the gimmick

4075
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
and that's what Manchild, Inc was about

4076
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
something about a magic scepter

4077
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
yes, the magic scepter, which I always

4078
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
wanted, I always wanted to know

4079
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I always wanted to find out what was going to happen

4080
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
and it never happened

4081
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
what happened?

4082
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
what was the wrestler villain?

4083
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
oh, um

4084
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
oh god, with the mirror mask

4085
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
K-Fabe Commander?

4086
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
K-Fabe Commander?

4087
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
okay, yes

4088
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
but that doesn't make any sense because

4089
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
why is the, if the horse cast

4090
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
was a new channel made for that

4091
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
then why is the horse cast

4092
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
wait a minute, was one of them drowning in

4093
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
wait, what do you mean?

4094
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
because

4095
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
because Manchild, Inc

4096
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
uh

4097
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
was drowning in horseshoes

4098
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
that was the pony channel

4099
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
that was the pony channel

4100
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
and the other one, right, he had a separate pony channel

4101
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
that's right

4102
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
drowning in footwear

4103
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
that's why the horse cast is on it

4104
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
okay, got it

4105
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
drowning in footwear was like video game reviews

4106
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
and then a few pony things

4107
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
and then he made drowning in horseshoes

4108
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
to be specifically the

4109
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
pony review show

4110
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
and then horseshoe finale

4111
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
and everything brony related

4112
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I'm so stupid, it makes perfect sense

4113
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
it makes perfect sense, okay

4114
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
that became Manchild, Inc

4115
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
where it became Endless Jess

4116
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
yes, understood

4117
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
um

4118
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
okay, uh

4119
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
I guess next voicemail

4120
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
uh, is spiral senti

4121
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
wait, you missed cross

4122
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
oh, I did, yeah, cross what makes a bad voicemail

4123
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
excuse me

4124
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
cross what makes a bad voicemail

4125
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
3, 2, 1, go

4126
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Ben was talking about how he didn't like the idea of live callers on the PCP

4127
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
because they would inevitably

4128
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
ramble on and on trying to make a point

4129
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I was gonna send in about that Johnny P guy

4130
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
but I didn't want to come off as pretentious

4131
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
being like, now here's what our friend did wrong

4132
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
but fuck it, it's suddenly relevant again

4133
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
now given how many voicemails there are

4134
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
bad voicemails are the ones that act like they are

4135
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
in the call with you guys taking a lot of time

4136
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
to make their point and clearly not scripting it out

4137
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
this approach to conversation works when you're actually

4138
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
talking to somebody but not when it's a pre-recorded message

4139
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
because the listener knows that you won't

4140
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
pause so that they can ask a question

4141
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
or make a report

4142
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
this is one aspect of a bad voicemail

4143
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
the silent moments of the PCP members listening

4144
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
to people inefficiently make their point

4145
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
or if they do interrupt the caller

4146
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
they end up talking over the voicemail and confusing everyone

4147
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
you can make a long voicemail

4148
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
but it has to be dense enough with information

4149
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
and well articulated enough that the listener

4150
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
can understand it instantly

4151
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
that way they don't feel uncomfortable with just absorbing

4152
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
the information even if it's for an entire minute

4153
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
obviously this isn't an absolute rule

4154
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
but the general takeaway is

4155
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
script your voicemails

4156
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I wasn't gonna say anything

4157
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
but the autism voicemails before

4158
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
could have been a lot shorter

4159
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
there was a lot of um uhs in that

4160
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
that could have been like half the length

4161
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
uh but

4162
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
yeah it's true

4163
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
yeah this true

4164
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
okay next one is spiral senchi

4165
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
um

4166
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
if this is the same spiral

4167
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
by the way I mentioned that there was

4168
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
a guy who was going through

4169
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
all the old PCP

4170
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
um episodes

4171
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
doing a count on n-word tally for everyone

4172
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
uh I believe

4173
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
this is the guy spiral

4174
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
uh uh uh

4175
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
he's actually he decided to actually go back

4176
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
and start over and like do a more

4177
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
like a rigorous count

4178
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
like you know tracking like hard

4179
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
r's and stuff and like and other things too

4180
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
he says I don't I'm not even sure

4181
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
but he's he's he's

4182
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
what a strange thing to do

4183
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
he's doing god's work though

4184
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
um three spiral senchi

4185
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
three two one go

4186
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
hey PCP

4187
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
it's

4188
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
right now it is

4189
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
May 1st

4190
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
1214

4191
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
and about 14 minutes ago

4192
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
I submitted

4193
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
my comic for the kato anthology

4194
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
yes

4195
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I didn't hear about it until like

4196
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
a month in so I only had

4197
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
well I had like a month to do it

4198
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
and

4199
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
my what I wanted to do ended up

4200
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
being 12 about 12 pages

4201
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
could have used more

4202
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
not really good at comics yet

4203
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
but I had never really done one before

4204
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
so I don't know

4205
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
I finished it and I submitted it

4206
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
it's not very good

4207
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
uh it's not

4208
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
really complete either

4209
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
but I got all 12 pages done

4210
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
for the most part

4211
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
um

4212
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
yeah um

4213
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
okay just wanted to thank you

4214
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Ben for

4215
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I guess retweeting it

4216
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I don't know that's a weird thing to thank someone for I guess

4217
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
but here's just thanks for bringing it

4218
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
to bringing it to my attention

4219
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
sure I don't know

4220
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
if I ever would have

4221
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
completed anything without

4222
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000

4223
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
good motivation and I really

they've got a bunch I don't know how many

4248
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
they're choosing from for their

4249
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
submission maybe it depends on page

4250
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
count um

4251
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
it's nice oh

4252
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
it's nice that it seems like a bunch of people

4253
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
got uh uh inspired

4254
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
and uh did

4255
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
something for this

4256
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
thing I think it's

4257
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
nice uh

4258
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
they are gonna I guess they'll be starting

4259
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
uh they'll be starting a kickstarter

4260
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
soon to fund like the actual

4261
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
printing of it so

4262
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
um I will announce

4263
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
that when it happens

4264
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
um

4265
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
yeah

4266
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000

4267
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
next voicemail is called Riley

hey guys can we

4271
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
just talk about how Riley is like

4272
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
the worst promoter ever

4273
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
like it's

4274
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
insane he calls himself a producer

4275
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
but he acts more like a promoter

4276
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
if you leave the slightest bit of criticism on the yin channel

4277
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
he'll send you a whole fucking paragraph

4278
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
about how fans are

4279
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
entitled and don't like don't watch

4280
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
uh first of all mother fucker

4281
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
they're not watching that's why you're making

4282
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
a fucking

4283
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
1000 video news per video

4284
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
to 3000

4285
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
video uh

4286
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
because nobody fucking wants to see this shit

4287
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
uh fucking

4288
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
procrastinators fans

4289
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
would have been on board but you tried to

4290
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
steal radcon and now they hate you

4291
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
uh fucking

4292
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
cantent ended

4293
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
they probably would have just said creative differences

4294
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
but he's like oh well he doesn't want to talk

4295
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
about it we will first of all

4296
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
who's we right

4297
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
uh and then fucking

4298
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
the dick show guys he could have fucking

4299
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Ralph was the easiest slam dunk ever

4300
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
he managed to fucking fuck that up too

4301
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
uh the guy was comparing himself

4302
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
to the fucking joker and got clobbered by a girl

4303
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
and but at least

4304
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
he fucking called in so people hate Riley

4305
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
now uh it's just fucking

4306
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
amazing just how bad he is at his job

4307
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
fucking Trixie had a whole platform

4308
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
that was really successful for years

4309
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
and in like

4310
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
four months Riley's managed to completely

4311
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
squander that goodwill your wife

4312
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
did not want to work with him Ben Riley's an idiot

4313
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
you're you're right

4314
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
but I dis I will disagree

4315
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
with one thing

4316
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
which is that I Riley didn't Riley didn't

4317
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
fuck it up uh Trixie

4318
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Trixie is fucking it up all on her own she is

4319
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
going along with Riley's ideas

4320
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
true but like

4321
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
she's doing it all under her own power

4322
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
and I don't think it's helpful

4323
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
to say Riley

4324
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Riley is doing it Riley's the one

4325
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
like Riley's the one like making her do it

4326
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
he's not making her do anything

4327
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
so let's not get that twisted

4328
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
um

4329
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
what did he say about the

4330
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
call in somebody called in

4331
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Riley called into the dick show about this

4332
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I don't know I don't know

4333
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
what happened with like the Ralph

4334
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I don't know and couldn't possibly care

4335
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
about the the drama

4336
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
goings on of that

4337
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
the dick show the Riley the

4338
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
yeah Ethan Ralph

4339
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
yeah I don't know about that

4340
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
they're just they're just whatever

4341
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
they're whatever

4342
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
the the thing about

4343
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
the canton

4344
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
it I want to say

4345
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
it was

4346
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
because like Nate didn't want to say anything

4347
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
and all he did was make that

4348
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
that tweet saying that like

4349
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
we're going on hiatus

4350
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
and then

4351
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
literally never mentioned it again

4352
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
in any capacity anywhere which is

4353
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
honestly

4354
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
weird and like bad in its own way

4355
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
um but like

4356
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
okay

4357
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
the fact that like apparently like

4358
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
um Trixie and Riley considered that

4359
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
to be a like

4360
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
a big PR problem

4361
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
that they needed to fix

4362
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
and then like their

4363
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
solution to that was to make that

4364
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
video where Trixie

4365
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
introduces

4366
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
the yig channel explains what it's

4367
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
about and then

4368
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
in the course of introducing

4369
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
it to potential new

4370
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
viewers explains that like

4371
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
by the way these other people

4372
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
have like refused to work with me

4373
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
on the basis of what this channel is

4374
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
which is not even like true

4375
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
like I don't even believe that that was

4376
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
really like I just don't believe

4377
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
that Nate would just be like

4378
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
your I don't like your channel

4379
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
therefore we can't

4380
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
work together it can't be that simple

4381
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
and yet it makes it sound that way

4382
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
which is like so much worse

4383
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
than the actual truth

4384
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
which is just that like your mobile

4385
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
lifestyle doesn't allow us to continue

4386
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
doing the show together it's

4387
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I don't know

4388
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
it's really baffling on every level

4389
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
in a way that

4390
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
like the idea that Trixie

4391
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
would be like this is what I'm doing

4392
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
now and everybody hates it

4393
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
honestly yeah that's the two things

4394
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
you don't really want to say together

4395
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
yeah there's a big section devoted

4396
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
in the like what

4397
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Yeeg Studio is about video

4398
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
that is like

4399
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I'm and by the way

4400
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Yeeg Studio I'm

4401
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
breaking off relations with the PCP

4402
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
because Ben doesn't

4403
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
fucking like me anymore

4404
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
and Nate won't work with me

4405
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
on Kansan anymore and like

4406
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
she says it's like because

4407
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
she doesn't like

4408
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
like the Yeeg

4409
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
content paradigm like that's what she says

4410
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
was Nate's problem with it

4411
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
which is not I don't think that's true

4412
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
but it's like

4413
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
it sounds like she's saying

4414
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
my channel is so fucking toxic that people

4415
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
are burning their bridges with me and cutting ties

4416
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
with me over it and like it's

4417
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
it's worse it's worse

4418
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
than the supposed like thing

4419
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
that they were upset about which was Nate's

4420
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
like non-statement about it

4421
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
through content

4422
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I don't know

4423
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
that's

4424
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
so weird to me so fucking weird

4425
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
so

4426
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
I don't know

4427
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
voicemailer I agree Riley is bad at his job

4428
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
but other people are also

4429
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
bad at their job

4430
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
okay

4431
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
sorry to go on an unhinged

4432
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
rant like that

4433
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
next voicemail is called

4434
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
monkey more like dumb

4435
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
3 2 1

4436
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
go

4437
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
in the comments

4438
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
always clamoring

4439
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
for monkey

4440
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
they are so great about him

4441
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
he's pretty average you know

4442
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
kinda

4443
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
kinda lame

4444
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
got him

4445
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
um

4446
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
yeah I don't really get it got him

4447
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I don't really get

4448
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
the commenters in particular

4449
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
the commenters in you think so

4450
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
yeah

4451
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
the fact that monkey was kicked off the show

4452
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
a return

4453
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
is like what they want

4454
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
they don't care necessarily about monkey

4455
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
being on the podcast

4456
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
they just want the spectacle of like

4457
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
it might even just be like

4458
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
an anti-trixie thing as well

4459
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
cause like Trixie had a beef with monkey

4460
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
and monkey's back

4461
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
and it's like haha

4462
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
I think that's quite a lot of the reason

4463
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
why people actually want to see it

4464
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
okay that makes sense

4465
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I mean

4466
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
yeah

4467
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
yeah okay

4468
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I guess that's it

4469
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000

4470
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000

02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000

02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000

02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
having that to look forward to

4612
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000

02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
positive thing for my

4614
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
mental health

4615
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000

of have to go

02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:39,280
patreon to reach 30k so I would consider that if his patreon reach 30k and

4797
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:49,000
Riley were fired I would consider that to be a lateral move at best so no I like

4798
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:53,560
your gusto though I like your spirit I like that you're making moves I don't

4799
02:58:53,560 --> 02:58:57,160
necessarily approve all the moves that you're making but I am but I like that

4800
02:58:57,160 --> 02:59:04,280
you are making moves I also think it's kind of a stupid like obvious like like

4801
02:59:04,400 --> 02:59:10,800
chump move to pledge to the dick Masterson patron cuz like if he wanted to if

4802
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:17,400
Riley was actually a problem to dick he could fire him at any point yeah like

4803
02:59:17,400 --> 02:59:24,800
like if if it's it's it's clearly just like milking stupid fans because of drama

4804
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:31,520
like I mean people will hate Riley give me money haha like it's so like there's

4805
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:35,000
nothing there's not I mean I'm sure I mean I'm sure it doesn't I'm sure it

4806
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:38,840
didn't work I'm sure it didn't actually I'm sure nobody actually was like yes

4807
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:42,840
I'll donate cuz I hate right I mean nobody cares well nobody cares maybe so

4808
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:47,520
and also people care I don't think I don't think I feel like Riley's more of a

4809
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:53,840
figure in that crowd as me I don't think so I mean I'm not even convinced that

4810
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:58,600
I'm not even convinced that he even works for dick I think dick paid him like

4811
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:04,040
for once I don't think he actually does anything I think it's just a meme I

4812
03:00:04,040 --> 03:00:09,640
think it's just a meme that Riley just leans into because it's like his his

4813
03:00:09,640 --> 03:00:14,680
his keys to the lever of power or so he or so he thinks it's all he's got going

4814
03:00:14,680 --> 03:00:19,200
on he doesn't seem to do anything is what I'm saying and I don't know maybe

4815
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:24,320
I'm wrong but it doesn't look like he does anything so I don't I mean that and

4816
03:00:24,320 --> 03:00:31,840
also I just don't believe that dick would keep his word like if assuming I'm

4817
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:39,240
wrong and Riley does do anything at all for dick if dick does if dick does want

4818
03:00:39,240 --> 03:00:44,200
him around for some reason I don't think he would actually do it like I don't

4819
03:00:44,200 --> 03:00:51,000
think he would actually get rid of him even if we hit that goal but so so

4820
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:55,120
there's that one it wouldn't even it wouldn't even accomplish the thing that

4821
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:58,880
you think it would accomplish to it wouldn't even be a net gain because you

4822
03:00:58,880 --> 03:01:02,400
would have to do something bad i.e. raising dick master since patreon numbers

4823
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:08,680
in order to accomplish it three I don't know yeah we need we need the money more

4824
03:01:08,680 --> 03:01:14,680
we're dying here we're dying we're literally dying yeah I'm wondering literally

4825
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:20,560
dying it's true it's true see I would I've been I've been to the I can milk my

4826
03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:27,240
illness for money for cash if you want right if you want to help pay for Gibbs

4827
03:01:27,240 --> 03:01:34,320
oncoming massive medical bills and pretend you live in America please yeah

4828
03:01:34,320 --> 03:01:44,080
I I've I've recently moved to America right now this second donate to the

4829
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:49,960

these days I will open the invites back up but not today next one is called who

4838
03:02:50,720 --> 03:02:58,600
is the best Tom three two one go hey PCP this is like my fifth or sixth time

4839
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:03,280
recording this and it's like 5 a.m. specifically 510 and I had a question for

4840
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:08,560
you guys where is the best Tommy Oliver OC when he when he first viewed on the

4841
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:11,360
scene is probably curious I didn't think he looked that good he was just kind of

4842
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:16,440
dark blue with a door you know the mullet he had the OC look kind of bland but

4843
03:03:16,440 --> 03:03:22,360
is actually coming to his own with tall tales nice red feather a nice unique

4844
03:03:22,360 --> 03:03:27,040
art style that really made him stand out from the crowd but then he kind of went

4845
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:32,320
all lanky got all skinny long like an actual horse kind of interesting but I

4846
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:35,000
think some people would find it weird and then there was the zombie version

4847
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,960
that was used in some of analysis videos I don't I don't know if Tom had that

4848
03:03:37,960 --> 03:03:42,360
one that one's not even cannon count or even knew it existed or whether she'd

4849
03:03:42,360 --> 03:03:46,320
even count but then there's like his 2d like avatar of him which I think looks

4850
03:03:46,320 --> 03:03:51,040
pretty good and you know I was just wondering what you guys thought was the

4851
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:55,200
best I think I personally towards the second one personally and I just

4852
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:59,520
realized something just Tom have a 3d version of himself I mean he's a 3d guy

4853
03:03:59,520 --> 03:04:03,040
now so it would make sense and you're right you know you're right you should

4854
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:07,200
make it you should make a 3d viewer of him then please please release it's on

4855
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:11,000
which you want to I'm begging you come on come on you heard me say you heard me

4856
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:17,080
say that it's coming it's coming after phantom's revenge this that was like a

4857
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:23,000
keystone in what I wanted to do before release it we're getting there um yes

4858
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:27,520
one should definitely make a 3d avatar that just seems obvious now that you say

4859
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:35,800
it yes and I and my favorite so far is the the the classic the red beret

4860
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:41,800
brony curious yeah original design I would have to be it stood out from all

4861
03:04:41,800 --> 03:04:46,440
the other brony analysis people and it was just really solid it just looks

4862
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:51,040
great I would I would have to say I would have to say that that's the most

4863
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:56,800
iconic was the yeah the beret tall tales not not the really tall one

4864
03:04:57,080 --> 03:05:00,680
cuz like you know that one was unique but it was kind of weird looking was that

4865
03:05:00,680 --> 03:05:04,960
drawn by someone else I feel like it may have been I don't think so I mean I

4866
03:05:04,960 --> 03:05:10,040
could be wrong I assume Tom drew it time to go to the brony analysis week I did

4867
03:05:10,040 --> 03:05:15,640
like find out I did like remember the you remember the avatar before the

4868
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:21,440
beret right like when yeah with it way out of fedora with the fedora I mean I

4869
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:26,720
liked that one and I liked that the horn like like pokes through the fedora I

4870
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:31,680
thought that was pretty good the beret is more iconic I like that his design

4871
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:36,880
was it looked oh it was drawn by him yeah it looks similar enough to like an

4872
03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:40,840
on-model like show accurate but it's it's different enough that you can tell

4873
03:05:40,840 --> 03:05:45,920
that it's it's drawn by him it's got a couple like the it's got like the kind

4874
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:52,760
of the hair coming off the ears I think is a little different it's got yeah

4875
03:05:53,120 --> 03:06:00,200
honestly when I when I learned that he had the hat in real life like I at a

4876
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:04,240
certain point the hat became an ironic statement but I believe that at some

4877
03:06:04,240 --> 03:06:09,520
point the hat was worn unironically which I gotta admit did poison the well

4878
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:14,880
did poison the hat a little bit for me but you know once once it was moved into

4879
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:20,320
since strictly ironic territory then I the healing could begin and in hindsight

4880
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:24,760
yeah I would say that's the most iconic Tom Oliver OC is the beret wearing tall

4881
03:06:24,760 --> 03:06:31,440
tails the beret where it's just like the it's cute enough it's fluffy enough but

4882
03:06:31,440 --> 03:06:34,960
not too fluffy it's just that the proportions are very good it's like a

4883
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:42,800
it's like a you know could fit in a in a sphere very nicely why that's part of a

4884
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:47,120
good character design I feel like it is is that a hallmark of good character

4885
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:54,400
well it's it's it's good for for like cuteness I mean like tall tails is cool

4886
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:59,640
but he's too tall and thin he feels like he's not sturdy enough with their all

4887
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:04,600
they're all tall guy this guy you they're all told I mean like tall as in like

4888
03:07:04,600 --> 03:07:10,200
little physical tall tall tails yeah the final iteration yes yeah yeah like this

4889
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:14,720
one feels like you could make a 3d model of it and like print it out and then

4890
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:26,560
have it like a little pony true I want one I want one yeah okay so you know what

4891
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:29,960
I'm looking it looks even better than I remember it looks even better than I

4892
03:07:29,960 --> 03:07:34,720
remember it's crisp it looks great it's great honestly I'm like I'm feeling I'm

4893
03:07:34,720 --> 03:07:38,600
feeling it I'm feeling the nostalgia I'm feeling like that was those were the

4894
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:44,480
days of this this particular pony you see hey you know what I'm more sure than

4895
03:07:44,480 --> 03:07:51,080
ever definitely this one look at the shading it's great yeah it is just it's

4896
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:56,440
great what happened huh what happened three dimensions this was all it was all

4897
03:07:56,440 --> 03:08:05,040
all downhill from here yeah then the next voicemail comes with an image and I

4902
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:33,480
voicemail this is from oblivion fall three two one go I'm sure you're in the

4903
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:38,240
middle of recording a podcast episode right now I'm just currently listening

4904
03:08:38,240 --> 03:08:43,200
to the previous one pretty interesting conversation about bail jpe and tiki

4905
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:49,600
wiki mickey now lovely character she is then you mentioned several times this

4906
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:55,920
word Maori I believe you were trying to pronounce Maori or Maori which is the

4907
03:08:55,920 --> 03:09:00,640
sorry indigenous New Zealand population I've only got like a little bit of Maori

4908
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:06,320
on me so I can't you know really comment on this that much ctole is I believe

4909
03:09:06,320 --> 03:09:11,360
full Maori for the most part but again they grow up in Australia so I don't

4910
03:09:11,360 --> 03:09:15,680
know to what extent ctole is familiar with this stuff yeah so tiki is like

4911
03:09:15,680 --> 03:09:20,080
this like these wooden statues that you see around shrines and stuff they tend

4912
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:24,600
to look very like actually like very different from what's in bail jpe like

4913
03:09:24,600 --> 03:09:29,520
completely different a lot more like circular patterns spirals and swirls and

4914
03:09:30,400 --> 03:09:33,600
they actually look kind of cool sometimes it depends on the one you look at if

4915
03:09:33,600 --> 03:09:37,440
you I guess you could see it if you google a Maori like wood carving or wood

4916
03:09:37,440 --> 03:09:42,840
statue so I know I just thought that was like an interesting thing kind of kind

4917
03:09:42,840 --> 03:09:48,600
of like Gibbs perspective she's very based based Gibb by the way I'm drawing

4918
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:52,080
like a fat pair of titties as I record this I'm gonna leave a link in the

4919
03:09:52,080 --> 03:09:56,920
voicemail it's nsfgo you can't show it on the podcast but just I want to hear

4920
03:09:56,920 --> 03:10:01,480
your reaction if this fucking look well you heard you heard you heard our

4921
03:10:01,480 --> 03:10:12,280
reaction you heard what we think and yeah yeah oblivion fall at some point I

4922
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:17,360
guess it's been a while since they've started but they just decided to start

4923
03:10:17,360 --> 03:10:26,040
drawing porn and like huge tits and stuff like for my now just just to do it

4924
03:10:26,320 --> 03:10:30,160
I don't know whether they've sold anything necessarily but it's just like

4925
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:35,280
they enjoy the idea they're in the big booby mummy milkers server nice that's

4926
03:10:35,280 --> 03:10:39,040
us that's still a thing it's it's very quiet haven't heard much about that

4927
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:44,480
lately but yeah I mean it's it's you know people people are occasionally things

4928
03:10:44,480 --> 03:10:48,200
they're they're making nice it's but people I don't think the bots working

4929
03:10:48,200 --> 03:10:55,160
that's sort of a lot of nothing to do but yeah oblivion fall is like just

4930
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:59,160
immediately really good and it's been getting better and it's been annoying me

4931
03:10:59,160 --> 03:11:05,080
how good they are at drawing that sort of that the pornography I wanted to draw

4932
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:09,240
the pornography but I can't do it it's too hard I need to learn things and

4933
03:11:09,240 --> 03:11:15,880
that's difficult these nipples but yeah I'm sorry I gotta say the nipples are too

4934
03:11:15,880 --> 03:11:21,680
big they're like I mean they do they do like the like the entire front of the

4935
03:11:21,720 --> 03:11:26,480
breast is nipple and I that's I don't like it I don't like that that's really

4936
03:11:26,480 --> 03:11:30,760
that's that's really actually turning me off quite a bit the more I look at it I'm

4937
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:42,440
like God oh you know I can the the hair right breast nipples seems a lot bigger

4938
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:52,880
than the the other one sorry that might just be the angle because like you

4939
03:11:52,880 --> 03:11:56,480
know the one you're kind of seeing from a more top-down angle versus the other

4940
03:11:56,480 --> 03:12:00,720
one you're kind of seeing from the side but I see what you mean yeah I see what

4941
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:05,840
you mean like it could be it could be painful does draw really no no that

4942
03:12:05,840 --> 03:12:09,400
would make sense and be fine if the nipple is actually like wider than it

4943
03:12:09,400 --> 03:12:14,000
is tall but if it if they're supposed to be a perfect circle I think you're

4944
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:21,520
right and the proportions are a little different yeah yeah yeah I believe in

4945
03:12:21,520 --> 03:12:31,080
full does draw like hyper large sex hyper large sex I hyper large sex that's

4946
03:12:31,080 --> 03:12:37,160
that's what they call it Craig Craig you fucker he left the truck didn't want to

4950
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:09,600
recording Craig is a volso I've been unexpectedly disconnected if you want

4951
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:16,120

4952
03:13:16,120 --> 03:13:24,800
want to fuck with Craig I just want can I tell him to leave and then rejoin yes

4953
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:34,320
but I didn't okay okay well whatever um you got anything to say about the tiki

4954
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:40,720
thing yeah I'm not sure that I haven't seen many comments talking about it like

4955
03:13:40,720 --> 03:13:44,200
what like necessarily having like an opinion I think there was that one

4956
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:50,600
commenter said hey I'm black and I don't care yeah so I was like yeah okay

4957
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:56,440
problem solved I yeah it's not really problem solved but like it's something I

4958
03:13:56,440 --> 03:14:02,400
I don't really know exactly what to do yet yeah obviously a redesign is in order

4959
03:14:02,400 --> 03:14:08,000
I'm just trying to figure out how to do it what if you know what I thought about

4960
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:13,720
I thought about this this week and like I had a thought and I don't want to speak

4961
03:14:13,720 --> 03:14:19,920
on it as though I have like any say in like what the character is or does right

4962
03:14:20,720 --> 03:14:24,640
so that's that's not what I'm trying to do but I had a thought that was just like

4963
03:14:24,640 --> 03:14:30,320
a what if and it was like I don't know this is kind of stupid don't take this

4964
03:14:30,320 --> 03:14:36,520
too seriously don't take this too seriously it was just a funny what what

4965
03:14:36,520 --> 03:14:42,360
if what if the character of tiki had a revelation that they were like huh you

4966
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:47,680
know I didn't even know anything about Maori Islander culture I just made this

4967
03:14:47,720 --> 03:14:51,960
mask because I thought that's what a witch doctor should look like but now I

4968
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:55,800
realized that this was like an insensitive racial caricature and then

4969
03:14:55,800 --> 03:14:59,520
she just takes the mask off and it's like I'm still gonna make potions and

4970
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:04,440
stuff because that's what I do but I'm not gonna wear this mask anymore because

4971
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:10,960
like I don't think it's appropriate that would be funny it's a little it's a

4972
03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:19,360
little like too like obvious self-insert meta humor sort of thing sure yeah

4973
03:15:19,360 --> 03:15:22,480
wouldn't it wouldn't be it wouldn't be canon I'm not saying whatever the

4974
03:15:22,480 --> 03:15:26,360
character I'm not I'm not saying but I like it it's funny I'm not saying you

4975
03:15:26,360 --> 03:15:29,400
should do that but I thought about that and I was like you know I feel like that

4976
03:15:29,400 --> 03:15:35,880
would that would be a solution that is like acknowledging like why the

4977
03:15:35,880 --> 03:15:40,080
character changes it but also not doing like a sweep under the rug like let's

4978
03:15:40,120 --> 03:15:46,680
just pretend she never looked like that sort of thing all right maybe I guess

4979
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:52,600
it sort of opens again not my not my question not my character I don't have

4980
03:15:52,600 --> 03:15:57,400
anything about it yeah that the reason I would not do it that way is because it

4981
03:15:57,400 --> 03:16:07,560
opens up the idea that blackface and like indigenous cultures and being

4982
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:13,320
offended from those things would all exist in this universe just in the

4983
03:16:13,320 --> 03:16:17,480
exactly the same way that they would exist in our universe and it's not

4984
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:23,840
exactly what I want to go for but you know yeah that would sort of imply yeah

4985
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:30,480
that would sort of imply that like yeah maybe not necessarily that it takes it

4986
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:35,120
would sort of imply that it takes place in our world which like if it doesn't

4987
03:16:35,280 --> 03:16:39,680
then like it doesn't it doesn't make any sense yeah okay that's totally fair that

4988
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:48,320
makes sense um LeMau it's it's I'm imagining her like I'm imagining she

4989
03:16:48,320 --> 03:16:54,200
takes the mask off and like she's got kind of like a long neck right and like

4990
03:16:54,200 --> 03:16:59,840
sort of and like the math I'm imagining that without the mask on she's got sort

4991
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:04,240
of like a long neck in her head is like pretty like just sort of like small and

4992
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:10,760
like a sphere it's kind of like a ball on the end wait a minute let me let me

4993
03:17:10,760 --> 03:17:15,160
really quickly like doodle what I what I think like the shape of her head would

4994
03:17:15,160 --> 03:17:23,800
be without wait this will take me two seconds get my stylist it's kind of

4995
03:17:23,800 --> 03:17:27,800
like here's her shoulder here's her other shoulder here's her kind of like

4996
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:29,560
skinny neck

4997
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:43,840
yeah that's perfect let me grab that with my little tool here and bam

4998
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:52,920
like without the mask that's the shape of her head and it just and like and like

4999
03:17:52,920 --> 03:17:56,520
the mask is like thick wood and the mask has sort of like a perfectly

5000
03:17:56,600 --> 03:18:00,800
spherical like indentation in the back of it and her spherical head just kind of

5001
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:08,560
like sort of sticks into the spherical indent like a ball joint not canon not

5002
03:18:08,560 --> 03:18:18,840
canon like a little snap Lego thing yes yes precisely food fan theories fan

5003
03:18:19,400 --> 03:18:25,320
that's just a theory a fan theory a bail theory

5004
03:18:26,520 --> 03:18:28,280
bail jpeh that is

5005
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:33,760
I was thinking about like bail jpeh and like the the the fact that the story

5006
03:18:33,760 --> 03:18:37,560
continues but it wouldn't be called bail jpeh again because bail jpeh is just a

5007
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:46,400
it's a silly play on jailbreak yeah and it's also barely makes sense bale

5008
03:18:46,440 --> 03:18:51,400
does not have anything to do with the comic and jpeh kind of does kind of

5009
03:18:51,880 --> 03:18:59,800
kind of it's jpeh but it's not bail related there's no bailary no no so

5010
03:18:59,800 --> 03:19:05,680
like if there was like an extended comic that you know one piece it's about one

5011
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:10,080
piece and everything in the comic will eventually lead to one piece I need to

5012
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:14,720
think of a name for whatever my big comic is that include like carries on the

5013
03:19:14,720 --> 03:19:20,920
story oh like the name for the and like the name for like the extended

5014
03:19:20,920 --> 03:19:28,800
universe kind of the ongoing series the ongoing series the main thing that you

5015
03:19:28,800 --> 03:19:33,920
know the thing leads into the pumpkin like bail jpeh would be the wanted to

5016
03:19:33,920 --> 03:19:41,240
whatever the one piece will eventually be oh I get it I get it hmm are you are

5017
03:19:41,280 --> 03:19:47,120
you saying that like you you plan to do like a like a is that your plan like make

5018
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:55,520
a more realized series about it yeah I like the characters that I make but I'm

5019
03:19:55,520 --> 03:20:03,320
I'm like you know bail jpeh was you know I made it all up and then I went around

5020
03:20:03,320 --> 03:20:07,800
afterwards thinking like okay well all these things I introduce what how could

5021
03:20:07,800 --> 03:20:12,120
they fit into a world that I could build and then I did all that but nobody

5022
03:20:12,120 --> 03:20:18,200
knows anything about it and that was the plan going forward is to do that in

5023
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:23,440
some form but I don't have a name for it yet it's the only thing is like oh it's

5024
03:20:23,440 --> 03:20:27,880
punks in it maybe could be punk related but she's not the main character is she

5025
03:20:27,880 --> 03:20:36,440
oh I don't know is she not the main character um that's also a thing I'm

5026
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:39,960
not in I'm not even sure there's so many things I want to do and it's so

5027
03:20:39,960 --> 03:20:46,480
complicated hard to talk about yeah maybe I should make it more simple maybe

5028
03:20:46,480 --> 03:20:50,720
maybe you should what maybe I should make it more simple and just decide that

5029
03:20:50,720 --> 03:20:54,200
there is a main character and it is about them and their journey and these

5030
03:20:54,200 --> 03:20:58,040
other characters I have are secondary because at the moment I have like a lot

5031
03:20:58,040 --> 03:21:02,480
of secondary characters that will all meet together in one big thing but it

5032
03:21:02,480 --> 03:21:07,600
kind of does it it requires a protagonist and like a main one otherwise

5033
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:15,400
it's hard to link everything together punk would be it probably I mean that's

5034
03:21:15,400 --> 03:21:21,440
just what I assumed that's just what I assumed but yeah I don't know names are

5035
03:21:21,440 --> 03:21:28,560
hard and so is basically everything when it comes to nailing down nailing down

5036
03:21:29,400 --> 03:21:34,400
the details it's like it's like painful right you know what I mean because like

5037
03:21:34,400 --> 03:21:37,960
when you're coming up with a story and you're when you finally nail down the

5038
03:21:37,960 --> 03:21:43,960
details of what it is you are throwing away like all the other things that

5039
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:48,560
could have been everything things yeah and sometimes it's like oh that would

5040
03:21:48,560 --> 03:21:52,080
have been cool but I want to do this and it always comes at the expense of

5041
03:21:52,080 --> 03:21:56,880
something else and it's like it's hard it makes it very hard for me it takes

5042
03:21:56,880 --> 03:22:01,320
takes me a long time sometimes the only takes me a long time sometimes and

5043
03:22:01,320 --> 03:22:05,840
like sometimes the only way that I can be sure that a thing that I want to make

5044
03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:09,600
is definitely the thing I want to make is just because I realize I've been

5045
03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:13,920
thinking about this thing for a long long time and it has the fact that I keep

5046
03:22:13,920 --> 03:22:18,840
thinking about it means that I must want to make it and so that's what I'm

5047
03:22:18,840 --> 03:22:22,960
gonna do that's what that's what slime and pun not slime and punishment that's

5048
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:27,400
what fandoms revenge was is I just kept picturing like what if it ended with a

5049
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:32,040
video game and I kept picturing what it would look like and it always looked the

5050
03:22:32,040 --> 03:22:36,560
same way in my head and I was like well I guess I got to make a game that looks

5051
03:22:36,560 --> 03:22:46,480
like that and I did partially yeah I'm excited to see that the final thing

5052
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:50,800
when the when the final thing comes out I definitely will not give up even if it

5053
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:59,000
is difficult I have shit I have I have some the demo has no story to it at all

5054
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:06,520
but I have a few big ideas I have a few big like story ideas that I'm like really

5055
03:23:06,520 --> 03:23:10,400
excited about I'm actually more excited about like what I want to present

5056
03:23:10,400 --> 03:23:15,200
story-wise in it than I am about the like the mechanics itself so like I

5057
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:19,720
consider what's there right now to not even be like the most important part

5058
03:23:19,720 --> 03:23:24,000
that's like that's just sort of like okay I guess I had to make it an actual

5059
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:28,040
game so you know that part's done now on to like the real work which is like

5060
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:34,440
making the cutscenes which I don't know how to do making like I talked about how

5061
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:39,120
hard and complicated it is just to make like one character do one animation I

5062
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:45,320
feel like making a cutscene is going to be like a bunch of that plus a bunch of

5063
03:23:45,320 --> 03:23:51,120
like adding in like moments where like you know you gotta I gotta mix that with

5064
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:55,160
like dialogue and like you know having the functions that like switch between

5065
03:23:55,160 --> 03:23:58,720
like progressing dialogue and progressing like character and it's gonna

5066
03:23:58,720 --> 03:24:04,640
take a lot of grunt work and I haven't really worked out how it works yet but

5067
03:24:04,640 --> 03:24:12,960
whatever I figured out everything else I'll figure it out too and boy I'm it's

5068
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:18,640
very ambitious it's maybe a little too ambitious what I want to show but we'll

5069
03:24:18,640 --> 03:24:28,880
see we'll see yeah I wonder I mean game maker is very specific I don't know like

5070
03:24:28,880 --> 03:24:34,720
the way in Psycholonial's Hussie just has videos or like flashes probably the

5071
03:24:34,720 --> 03:24:41,920
play that would be like a rendered cutscene material right yeah rendered

5072
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:45,880
video like it is not rendered in-game or anything so like if there's a way to

5073
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:54,520
like play a video file in game maker I'm envisioning probably make it I was

5074
03:24:54,520 --> 03:24:59,320
considering maybe having cutscenes be presented as like a series of images like

5075
03:24:59,320 --> 03:25:05,640
comic panels I might I might do some of that but I would like it if the majority

5076
03:25:05,640 --> 03:25:11,560
of it was like it was like the actual sprites kind of like walking around in

5077
03:25:11,560 --> 03:25:16,040
the room like they're in-game sprites walking around you know gesturing at

5078
03:25:16,040 --> 03:25:21,320
each other having the dialogue boxes pop up as they talk to each other having

5079
03:25:21,320 --> 03:25:25,360
little like custom animations go when like when they do things like that's how

5080
03:25:25,360 --> 03:25:30,440
I would want to present most of it oh like like a little camera that's like

5081
03:25:30,440 --> 03:25:35,400
floating around and and looking at things and no you don't have control I

5082
03:25:35,400 --> 03:25:42,520
mean like I mean like you know like you know around in the no that's not what I

5083
03:25:42,520 --> 03:25:46,880
mean what I mean is like it's it looks like like you're playing the game like

5084
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:51,200
you know at the very beginning you know Phantom he runs down the ramp and then

5085
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:54,040
he stops and he stands there and then there's little dialogue box and then he

5086
03:25:54,040 --> 03:26:00,040
runs like out yeah imagine like imagine that but like with more going on like

5087
03:26:00,040 --> 03:26:04,080
maybe like in between lines like he walks around or he like he maybe does a

5088
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:08,480
gesture or maybe there's another character who's like doing the same thing

5089
03:26:08,480 --> 03:26:12,360
talking back to him and like they have a back and forth and like they they

5090
03:26:12,360 --> 03:26:15,640
enter like they move and they interact and they have they animate with each other

5091
03:26:15,640 --> 03:26:20,680
to display some action that's what I'm talking about like it looks like it's

5092
03:26:20,680 --> 03:26:27,560
like in-game but if you I feel like this is a concept that there must be a

5093
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:30,720
simple way to describe but I'm just like floundering and finding really

5094
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:36,440
complicated ways to describe it it's like in like in game like gameplay in-game

5095
03:26:36,440 --> 03:26:40,920
rendered as opposed to a pre-rendered cutscene I don't know I just want to have

5096
03:26:40,920 --> 03:26:48,320
the fucking sprites move around and they go whoa that's it easy easy peasy you

5097
03:26:48,320 --> 03:26:58,040
there the they move around as if in-game yes yes like like an undertale cutscene

5098
03:26:58,040 --> 03:27:03,920
kind of exact yes I should have just said that I should have just said like an

5099
03:27:03,920 --> 03:27:09,760
undertale yes that's what I'm talking about you know like a video game like a

5100
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:19,880
JRPG yeah like that lol I'm sorry I took so long to express that very simple idea

5101
03:27:19,880 --> 03:27:31,080

5104
