00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone and welcome, oh god I hit the mic. To another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, die Mike, die.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm the bestest boy with the most microphone skills. And we've got Ben Saint is here.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nate, why did our sister not show up on the show?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Grace! Grace, come here!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I know, it's too late.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Wait, okay introduce yourselves. Let me see if I can get her.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm Hippocrit, who cares.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah? What's your deal?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh you know, I'm just one of those people who don't do anything.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, my favorite.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Alright, grand debut. Here's Grace, say some words.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're a dog, you're a dog and I'm sick of it.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's my sister guys, it's Grace.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You hit mine too, idiot.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't appropriate Ben's sister.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, that's a meme now.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How nice. Yeah, that is good. Way to go, Grace.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I assume the rest of you introduced yourself. You're all the same shit.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm just glad there's only four of us because it means I make more money.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, don't talk inside baseball. Don't pull the curtain back and kill the magic.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Inside baseball, inside basketball.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The only people that information is relevant to, that I do in fact try not to mention is the other members of this podcast

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
so as to not overly encourage them to show up on the off chance I can make more money.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Our system of distributing our assets is fundamentally broken.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think it's perfectly reasonable. What's wrong with that?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Isn't it weird that you get more for being on an episode if there's less people on it?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, you have to do more work. You have to assert yourself more.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It doesn't feel like more work.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, you know, if somebody shows up to every show it means they were dedicated to making that dash, you know?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, like the real thing that you have to do is just get there and start recording.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is why capitalism doesn't work. That's all I'm saying.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's a silly point. I will grant you though, Ben.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I mean, simply having the profit motive, like that alone, totally changes the dynamic of like any given relationship.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that's very true.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I gotta imagine that there's somebody who listens to this show at the stop clock that says on it like minutes till Ben mentions capitalism.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, guess what?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They slapped it just now and went, God damn, new record.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Your job is done. You can go on.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can rest now, we're each other.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Speaking of capitalism just a little bit, I have been watching videos of the left or whatever direction.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh my God, let's fucking chat about it.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've been watching a lot of Thought Slime. I've been watching a bit of ContraPoints as well.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I like them because they're funny and also the things, well, you know, they have a humorous spin on the things they're saying,

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
which makes it more palatable and easy for me to get into it.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ContraPoints is very theatrical, which is, you know, it's fine.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you're a drama kid, I'm sure it appeals.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I am fine with it. I wouldn't say that it's like, I mean, it's a little much, I get feeling like it's a little over theatrical.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is kind of how I feel about Philosophy Tube and how the way that he mugs the camera is like a little weird sometimes.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You said like the incredible sensuality of the videos can be a little much.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He will sometimes get really sensual in the way that he makes direct eye contact with the viewer and licks his lips and stuff.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, that sort of stuff. I'm not so much, like I think I've seen one of his videos and he seemed, I just looked it in.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was like, yeah, I don't watch all of, okay, well he has a goatee and I hate goatees.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's like, that's the worst thing about him by far.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Fair enough. Fair enough. I hear he's like a real philosopher or something.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He has like actual credentials, Philosophy Tube. Is that true?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is there such thing as credentials and philosophy?

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, like a PhD and like is like a doctor or something. I don't know.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There's no way he has a PhD.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, I could be wrong. I could be wrong.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He probably has some kind of qualifications. I don't know what they are.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But he's got, my favorite Philosophy Tube is a little series he's got called What Was Liberalism and it's very informative.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's a really good one.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I feel very informed. Just about things in general, seeing it from the other side.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I grew up kind of grew up on things like The Amazing Atheist, who is still not that bad.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He's just sort of obnoxious in the way he approaches things.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But he's very more thoughtful than you would imagine if you don't really watch him that much.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But then there's like all that whole crowd of amazing atheists like copycat people who are the same video every time.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The skeptic community.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The skeptic community.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, and I was just like, ah, geez, this is all really boring and who cares?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ah, geez, Rick, there's a lot of atheists on YouTube and it's upsetting me.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Morty, don't you know God isn't real, Morty? What are you fucking stupid, Morty?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, but then actual dialogue from season four.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I don't think women should be in video games.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But then there's thought slime.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's just sort of like he's just talking about things that they wouldn't talk about, like what anarchism actually means.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I mean, I know like words mean things to different people, but it's just interesting to see from different perspectives.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There's nothing wrong with being in a perspective totally agree.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It is. It is, right? I mean, can I ask, okay, where did you jump in?

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Did you jump in with thought slime?

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Or did you jump in with contra points and migrate to thought slime?

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I watched a contra points video when it was recommended to me like months ago.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I was sort of taken aback by the whole, the way it looked.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I was like, what? I don't get it.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Like, what's going on here?

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a little too much for me. It's a little too much for my little brain, P-brain here.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's my favorite thing about contra points.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It was. It was just sort of like, wow, this is like the big trap.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Like, my first thought was, this is a trans woman.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And therefore, I don't know whether the content will be good.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Just because I-

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What does that mean?

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, no. Yeah, I mean-

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Relax.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I got me some-

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No, I want to know what that means.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I got like prejudices because like, oh, social justice for a trans community.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They're the same thing.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And so, if there's somebody popular, it's probably just because they're trans

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and not because they have interesting things to say.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But I stuck out the video because I was so, I guess, enthralled by like what was going on

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that I was like, oh wait, they're sensible and they're like, they're not,

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
they're not like preaching to the choir.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They are talking about things that I don't hear people talk about

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and they're just really good.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know if I would say they're not preaching to the choir.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, I mean, not every video is the same video.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Everyone who does commentary, you know, by virtue of the fact that they have,

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you know, gained an audience through the things they say is,

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you know, like obviously they're preaching to the people that have subscribed to them

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and are therefore sort of self identifying them as the choir.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Only because I used to be a fan of Contra points.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And in the early days, she was a lot edgier and a lot more willing to sort of go

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
against the grain of like what's popular in that movement.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I think it kind of became that as she became like a bigger voice,

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
more and more people were looking to her as like, oh, you are like our representative

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
spokesperson.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So you have to be more careful about what you say.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And you have to, you know, like basically play by the book a little bit more.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it seems like she very much like internalized that and kind of took it like,

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
okay, you know, I do have to be, I do have to take more responsibility and be more like that.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And that just ruined it for me.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a very typical phenomenon for people.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I mean, what do you, what do you mean?

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Not that I know.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like what changed?

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm curious because I haven't watched all of Contra points.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So like, I might not know.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It would be easy to understand if you watch a lot of the earlier videos because

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
yeah, in the early days, like Contra points is just a lot more.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I guess I would say nihilistic about it all or just like she didn't care so much

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
about being politically correct with the ideas.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It was like presenting the arguments in a way that was charitable to the,

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to people who don't see, like, don't think you have to communicate this particular way

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that you have to like watch your words and really like walk on eggshells through your explanation.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I know she used to go on 4chan.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't know if that stopped or if she's changed her approach.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But I mean, anyone who does that, I remember when, whatever one video she said,

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
she used to go there to hear, like,

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I forget which video this was.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She would go to like the LGBTQ board, I think, and would like post her like,

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
you know, how's my transition going specifically to receive the kind of incredibly harsh feedback

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you'll never get from like your friends and allies.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You'll only get from people who just don't give a shit about you.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Contra points is kind of like a hard ass and kind of like,

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
which is what I like about those early videos is that they come off as somebody

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
who's very critical of themselves and their own side, you know, like somebody who...

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I always enjoy that.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I mean, I think she's, I think like, she seems pretty willing to like,

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
she doesn't really seem to be that like towing the party line.

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like, I think, I feel like she's pretty willing to come out,

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to come out with like an unpopular take on like, you know, something like,

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
like what is, what does it mean to be trans, for example.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, I'm sure she is and I haven't been keeping up with her content for a long time

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
because what bogged it down for me was just the sheer amount of like,

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
over-explaining the language or like trying to basically compromise,

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
what's the word I'm looking for?

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's like she babies you through the videos in a way that she didn't used to.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you think that's like a sort of a, like, as her videos got viewed by more and more people,

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
she had to like, simplify them, like make them more accessible?

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, and make them more accessible and also less, like less potentially triggering, we'll say.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Like that she might have made an edgy joke before and not explained it.

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And now she feels like I have to explain every single thing I say on the off chance

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that somebody is going to be offended by the way I've chosen to phrase it,

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
which is exactly what my problem with that community is in the first place.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That like, people are in, are just so soft that they need to have everything broken down and explained in depth.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And it's like, you can just offend people sometimes, like, it's okay.

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just if they can't handle it, they shouldn't watch the videos, you know.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's always going to be a pressure to avoid that when you are trying to reach more people.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was watching, I watched the R-Traps gay video, have you seen that?

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think I've seen that one.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, like that one, she says like, I think maybe this might speak to what's going on there.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
She says like, this is like a bad question in like, the question itself is sort of like inflammatory

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and like derogatory, just in the way that it's phrased.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But like, she said that she wants, you know, she wants, she's making a video so that like,

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
some kid who hears the question and maybe goes home and Googles it,

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
she wants his first exposure to the answer to be like, her video versus like, some fucking idiot,

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
some meme or unfortunate or whatever, who is just, you know.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's just kind of like, in the early days.

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
In that way, I think if you're looking at it that way, she probably just wants to like, control her language in a way that like,

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you know, gives like, people who aren't being newly exposed to these ideas like,

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
absolutely.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
She wants to guide the conversation in a certain like, more productive way.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's just the opposite of what I want to watch.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Like, it's that ContraPoints in the early days, because when I was watching her,

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
she had like 50,000 subscribers or something, less than that.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like, this is years ago, you know.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
682k.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, way, way bigger.

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
She had like 45,000 when I was watching her.

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And like, again, the content was a lot edgier.

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And like, part of the appeal was that she called herself like, the right whisperer or something like that,

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
because her appeals reached across the aisle to both camps and were capable of, you know,

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
basically being nuanced enough in their approach that people from the other side would also be able to appreciate it.

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And now it just, when you watch the videos, it is so indebted to the community that she's speaking for at this point,

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that it could no longer reach across the aisle that way.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like, people on the right are not going to watch these videos because they're going to see it as excessively SJW pandering.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think that, I don't know.

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think that they are still intended to reach across the aisle.

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I mean, I don't know how.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hence the Trap's Gay. Hence the Our Trap's Gay thing.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't know how long ago this change started, but the one I watched recently was the two part,

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What's Wrong with Capitalism video, which, I mean, the reason I liked these videos,

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I haven't been watching them in order or anything, just like what's recommended to me,

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
is that she would bring up things like the alt-right perspective,

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and she wouldn't attack it in the same way that the armored skeptic would attack a left idea,

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
just make fun of it and make names out of it.

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
She would bring it up and honestly talk about it in a sort of neutral fashion,

210
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
before going on to her explanation of how whatever she's talking about.

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Now, it's just sort of like, I mean, I don't know whether that aspect still,

212
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I mean, her most recent video, Transtrenders, I watched and I felt like that was the same sort of thing.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It was a bit, like, difficult to follow because I didn't know a lot of the terminology at first,

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but I got the gist by the end about, I don't know.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know whether she's too pandering.

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not that I don't think that she still thinks the same way as before.

217
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's that the videos are boring now because of the fact that they have to softball so much,

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
explain all the jokes, you know, like make sure everybody knows that she's not saying this or I'm not saying that.

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like I said, I mean, if you just go watch some of the earlier videos,

220
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
they are just a lot more like dense and edgy and they don't come from somebody

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
who seems like they were trying to appeal to everyone, you know?

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It just felt much more personal and raw and like what I see now is like somebody who is trying to take responsibility

223
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for their level of celebrity and present things and like be the spokesperson for trans people,

224
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you know, because people are taking her that way because of the fact that she is more reasonable than most people.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
She's the one who everyone's going to link you their videos, you know?

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Like everyone's going to say, oh, you want to talk about this issue?

227
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You got to watch the ContraPoints video and like I think she's internalized that and taken that into account

228
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and I totally respect that, but it doesn't work for me because I already understand all this shit

229
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and I don't need it to be re-explained.

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't need to be babied through the video.

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't want to have to listen to you correct yourself and like make, you know, apologize for everything you say.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You know, obviously my own content, I make a point to not do any of that because I find it annoying.

233
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I would rather...

234
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, there you go. You're not the target audience.

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You know, I would rather just offend you and then have a conversation about it than, you know, to make my content boring.

236
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I doubt she hopes for the same.

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, sure.

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sure.

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hippo, what got you on Thought Slime?

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because I love Thought Slime.

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think it was just that you had mentioned you were watching him and something about Slime and getting him on IRFCK and that was funny.

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So I saw a video of his and I was like, oh, okay.

244
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I didn't like his cartoon face and his more recent videos with his actual human face.

245
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's not a great artist.

246
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We can all agree on that.

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

248
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He also has the misfortune of looking like a giant baby man, which, you know, I don't hold against him, but is true.

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Professional soft boy.

250
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
See?

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes.

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Indeed.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, he's like, who's that guy from Dark Souls 3 who just consumed like human flesh until he softened and turned to ooze and just started spreading everywhere.

254
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Saint Aldrich of the Deep or whatever.

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's him.

256
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's Thought Slime.

257
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I got nothing against that guy.

258
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's just funny.

259
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
When I found Thought Slime, I was just like, oh, wow.

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Here's a guy who's just outright saying like he's not, there's no, there's no pretense.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He's outright saying, hey, I'm a fucking anarcho-communist and I want to fucking end capitalism.

262
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And here's why.

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And you know what?

264
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's just refreshing, right?

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's not like he's the only one like that, but he was like the first one that I found and he was just like bald-faced like capitalism sucks and I want to dismantle it.

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And here's the problems with that.

267
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was like, oh my God, sick.

268
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's like a relief.

269
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, that's understandable.

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hey, hey, I've got a higher, let me go one step up on the conversation tree here because I experienced a truly euphoric piece of content recently that is very relevant to what we're talking about right now.

271
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You may be, of course, you know, of the world-famous podcast known only as Grimp, episode two.

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

273
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The title, Should Grimp Do Politics, was the question.

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And now let me just cut through all the, let's do it.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You know, you and Duobo, is that what is first be known as online?

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, I mean, we just call him John.

278
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay, I just didn't want to.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, Duobo, AKA John.

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay, so John, I'm going to call him John because that's how I think of him.

281
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Discussion, you guys both very left leaning, no problem, that's fine.

282
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But you get to the end and the summary is, should Grimp discuss politics?

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I would like to quote, I wrote down, when Ben, quote, insanely transphobic Ben St., with the words, Ben, should Grimp do politics?

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Definitely not no, end quote.

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's the exact words used by one Benjamin Eleanor St.

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I would just like to present that to the group.

287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
As in, definitely not colon, no, definitely not semicolon, no.

288
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Correct, correct.

289
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Not a negation of the previous statement being made, but a continuation of these-

290
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes, got it.

291
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Negatory expression, yes.

292
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Got it, got it.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So I would say, and you know, that conversation was interesting, everyone should go listen to World Famous Podcast, Grimp.

294
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
World Famous Anarcho-Communist.

295
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Indeed.

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well-

297
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Advocate, Grimp.

298
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sure, but the consensus of that show was like, there are times when politics should be discussed and fleshed out and dived into,

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
but politics is a fraught subject, can cause stress, inevitably causes much conflict.

300
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And there are times and places where it's appropriate, not appropriate, and one needs to just partition your life

301
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
in the appropriate way, probably, to decide when you want to get into it and when not.

302
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I submit to the group that I think the PCP, my vision of the PCP, is one of these places.

303
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It is a fun place, not designed to cause- there are times when it'll inevitably come up,

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
but to make it like a staple of the thing, I would think is not probably the optimal solution.

305
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I agree.

306
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I think I could probably dial it back.

307
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I've been thinking, yeah, I don't need to- but I'm not going to dial it back down to zero.

308
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because sometimes, sometimes things are said, and I feel the need to comment on them.

309
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm not the one bringing in the politics.

310
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The politics are coming in accidentally, and I'm merely reacting to them.

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you know what I mean?

312
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You know, I am sympathetic to that point.

313
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I would say that, however, there's a way to look at the world where anything could happen

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and one can view it through a political lens.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I would say that it kind of depends on the observer.

316
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I wouldn't exempt any particular person who views an event and chooses to view it through the political lens,

317
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
as opposed to someone who doesn't do that.

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You could look at- I mean, kind of like Anita Sarkeesian.

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
She says everything is sexist, and you need to look for these things and point them out.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I have no problem with her life, whatever, do whatever you want.

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But she's choosing to view the world in that way, so as to identify-

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's a little bit of a caricature.

323
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But I don't think so.

324
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I mean, I think that's a very rational reading of the ideology being put forward.

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I think there is a clip of her saying everything is sexist, everything is racist, and you have to point it all out.

326
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes, and it's taken out of context.

327
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I am not trying to say that Anita Sarkeesian thinks that everything is sexist.

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm merely positing what I think is a reasonable point that it seems to me that her and people of a similar persuasion

329
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
choose to view the world through the lens of their particular ideology, which in their case is feminism.

330
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Well, I mean, everybody does that.

331
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Everybody views the world through the lens of their particular ideology.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But not everyone's ideology is to lean towards politics, so there is a difference between people.

333
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Well, I think the thing here is that Anita Sarkeesian does-

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:04,000
She talks about feminism things as sort of a job at this point, so of course she's going to comment on them more than someone who isn't doing it for a job.

335
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
This is just kind of an evolution of the, like, keep your politics out of my video games,

336
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
which is like a wrong-headed argument in the first place because, like, everything is inherently political.

337
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I want to pause it first of all.

338
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's not true.

339
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It is.

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't think this is a new thing for our podcast.

341
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think we just have been using more political terms.

342
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Like, when I think back to the early days of this show, like, almost every fucking episode ended up in some kind of anti-SJW rant

343
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
where we would go down the road of language politics or political correctness or something, like,

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
it's not unusual for us to spiral into political rants.

345
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's just that with Ben consuming all this political content all the time, it is more, like, direct.

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Like, the terminology is there.

347
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The argument is more, like, directly in reference to political terms.

348
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But, like, I mean, it inevitably happens if that's what's on your mind when you discuss things.

349
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm just going to say it.

350
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm just going to come right out.

351
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Guy, are you ready?

352
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Are you ready for my bombshell?

353
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Are you ready to get triggered?

354
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay.

355
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Well, here's what I think.

356
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I think that as I have developed as a human being, right, as I have evolved, as I have opened my third eye and, you know,

357
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
ascended to the anarcho-communist utopia,

358
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I feel like there's, I've just had, I've moved a little away from what the rest of you guys might think.

359
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I've moved away from the centrist bullshit that dominates our society.

360
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I know.

361
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's not real.

362
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It is.

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But anyway, the point is that I, I don't know, that I have disagreements now.

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That's it.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I think that's a crux of it, is now I have disagreements.

366
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We didn't used to have disagreements and now I have disagreements.

367
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I've changed my position on a bunch of things.

368
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I mean, I'm, I'm like pretty casually political.

369
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So like, I'm not like so overt, like I don't have a set goal in my political like ideology or what I want out of the world.

370
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So like you having like this different, you know, this, this change in politics a little, it's really just made me curious and I'm going to look.

371
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That makes me so happy.

372
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That makes me so joyous.

373
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I mean, I don't know what centrism really is, but I'd like to be able to understand both Nate and Ben at the same time.

374
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
If you know what I mean.

375
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
By the way, I want to be fair to our audience here for a second because the argument is not really from them that they don't want us to talk about politics.

376
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They're split.

377
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
They're split.

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No, it's that they don't want us to talk about politics.

379
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's not that they have a problem with listening to people talk about politics.

380
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They just think we are retarded and they don't like us talking about politics.

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's the biggest, that's by far the biggest complaint.

382
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You know, I see it.

383
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not unsympathetic to it.

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm trying to get less retarded.

385
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's hard.

386
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's also hard because I'm not there yet.

387
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't trust the people who are criticizing me always to actually be, to actually know.

388
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Because a lot of the time the argument is just you should shut up about politics because you don't know about it.

389
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And then I say, well, what do I not know?

390
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Are you capable of explaining this?

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Because as far as I know, you're retarded about politics and I'm right unless you can put up an argument.

392
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But, you know, I mean, there's, I'm just being charitable to what their actual feelings are, you know, not that I think they're correct.

393
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
On the one, on the one hand, there's like, you know, there's lots of books out there to read.

394
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There's lots of stuff out there to consume, right, to get educated.

395
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
On the other hand, you can, you can never have read it all.

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You can never know enough, right?

397
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You'll never be done learning.

398
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
How do you vet which ones are like, there's always people who they've read a few books and now they think they know it all,

399
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
but they haven't read the counterbooks.

400
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And it's like, you have to have read all the books and all the counterbooks and all the everybody's perspective before you can really look at it all and make a judgment for yourself.

401
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Like, it's always going to come down to not what is correct, but what you agree with.

402
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I mean, even then there's infinite knowledge that humanity doesn't know yet.

403
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So any of that amount could be the, look, the problem with this whole discussion is that let's say we, let's say we literally,

404
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
we as the PCP found literally the perfect political ideology.

405
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We knew it.

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We had done this in some way.

407
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay, let's say we did that.

408
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I already did it.

409
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I already did it.

410
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay, great.

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So you've got it.

412
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And now our mission is to convert the audience to thinking this in whatever way we choose.

413
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:12,000
There is like, okay, you just have to think that the audience does not immediately like agree with you and the process of making it like converting a show that's like a comedy show.

414
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Are we a comedy show?

415
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I have always stood by that and I believe it to this day.

416
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Well, we're funny people.

417
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So therefore we're a comedy show, I think is generally like we didn't get, we don't sit out to make jokes.

418
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I don't think there have been no laughs on this particular episode.

419
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I know.

420
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I know.

421
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And I consider it a tragedy.

422
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Do I look like no laughs?

423
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And there have been laughs.

424
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There have been laughs.

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But the point is, look at the laugh, Nate, show me the laugh.

426
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Even if we, you're laughing right now.

427
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Even if we had a perfect political ideology and we were attempting to like teach it to the audience, I would like that process will be fraught and contentious.

428
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And you're making it like a political thing that just will be divisive.

429
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Could not everyone will agree with you.

430
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And that the question is, is that the kind of atmosphere you want for your show?

431
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Some shows are political.

432
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Some shows are not.

433
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And you can say that everything is political.

434
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I know, I understand the point and that's kind of true.

435
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But there are shows where they talk about things where the point is not to be political or to make any kind of major point.

436
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I couch everything I say in, I'm an idiot.

437
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't know anything.

438
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
This is just my life experience.

439
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Could be wrong.

440
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't trust me on anything.

441
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Believe what you want to believe.

442
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What I want the PCP and any content I'm involved with to be is a place where people don't get hung up on this.

443
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Like you have the strength of mind that you can listen to us talk about anything.

444
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Like that's what I would hope is that like we could talk about politics.

445
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We could talk about anything else.

446
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The point of it is that it's us and our perspective and just being ourselves.

447
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And if you are interested in us, that's the appeal.

448
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like I don't think the PCP really has like we could say it's a comedy podcast, but obviously you don't listen to this podcast for comedy.

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You listen to it because you're interested in us.

450
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And so whatever we have to talk about, you know, again, I understand the people whose argument is I don't want to hear you guys talk about politics because you don't know what you're talking about and they find it infuriating.

451
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I would encourage those people to consider the possibility that we do know what we're talking about unless you can prove that we don't know what we're talking about.

452
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But you know, I just think it's not fun.

453
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I just think it's and my goal is to make it fun to listen to.

454
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This is my priority.

455
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, I would say just we should we should always just if we think a conversation is not going anywhere, we should move.

456
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I want to keep the conversation upstream at like ideas and culture.

457
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I do not want to bring it down to downstream to politics.

458
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's my that's I don't know what the fuck that means.

459
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But the trend that I notice in the last like two episodes is that like the episode would come out and then there'd be kind of a bunch of comments and, you know, sprinkled in there would be a bunch that were like, I love the political discussion.

460
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And then later on, like more would trickle in that are like, I hate the political and in the end, it would kind of even out.

461
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But it was like the people who are like watching it right when it comes out, they seem to like it more.

462
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And then the people that like watch it later or something.

463
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It seemed it seemed like more than like lessons like does this mean that like maybe the people that are like more engaged like it.

464
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And like the people who are more casual listeners are annoyed by it.

465
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Man, we don't have an analytics on that.

466
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No, I think it's possible people literally just jump into the comments leave that comment because they want to get ahead of the other comments that they haven't even listened to the episode yet.

467
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Who knows who knows.

468
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, I think inevitably as always, the funny thing about the PCB has always been there is no thought leader.

469
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
There is no one whipping the ship.

470
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's just whatever any of us want to talk about.

471
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And there are inevitably going to be disagreements and differences of vision as to what is to be done.

472
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The emphasis where it should be put.

473
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So I think all we can do is just state our case, write it out and see what inevitably wins out long term.

474
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, this conversation has been boring for like 20 minutes.

475
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Exactly.

476
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Exactly.

477
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I can say, well, you want to go?

478
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, yeah, I got I got a thing.

479
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It was just sort of like an idea I came up with and I want to see who else feels this way.

480
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It is copycat anxiety.

481
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And this is the the anxiety that when you are about to do or say something and then someone else does or says that exact thing.

482
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You find yourself unable to do the thing you wanted to do for the fear that somebody will think you're copying the first person.

483
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Absolutely.

484
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Right.

485
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I mean, I've thrown away video concepts many times because somebody else has already done it.

486
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Somebody made a Banjo-Kazooie kind of stylized like my Smash confirmed series.

487
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And when I first saw that, I was like, oh, shit, someone just did this and perhaps I have some idea to make something like it.

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We'll see.

489
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I was like, well, shit, I guess that's out.

490
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But then I watched it and it wasn't that good.

491
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And I was like, oh, OK, that's fine then.

492
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah, it's always easy to justify doing it again if you think that their version sucked in your version.

493
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
There's many differences, but when I saw that, they used the same kind of thumbnail template I used.

494
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They used the same font that I used for it and I was like, ah, shit.

495
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But then it did seem to have a different kind of intention.

496
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I mean, in that case, if it's somebody who's doing your style, I would see them as the copycat.

497
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, but it's still kind of like, let's just say that he literally ripped off my formula, which is fine, including like thumbnail, title, everything.

498
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's very deliberate and like you could instantly know if it's like copying me, which it kind of was.

499
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Let's just say that he made like the full thing in the way that I would have.

500
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Like, is that bad?

501
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Should I be like mad?

502
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Should I not make my own if it already exists, basically?

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I would think you would do, I would definitely say you should do your own because it's your series.

504
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, I mean, the thing about that is like, those videos were so big and they were so shareable,

505
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
but they weren't like Nate videos.

506
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
No, they're not about me.

507
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
They're copyable.

508
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's a style that people can copy.

509
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But the problem is with that is that people won't realize if they're like casual watches, they just saw these smash videos.

510
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They won't notice that a different person has made them.

511
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like some people probably don't even realize it's not as good.

512
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think it would be evident when you watch it and it sucks.

513
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, I mean, I'm not even saying this was like horrible, but it was not at my level.

514
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That's true.

515
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It went on for like 20 minutes doing the intro before I got to the music or something.

516
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But a lot of people are dumb.

517
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
They'd see like the black background with the smash ball.

518
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
They'll see Banjo.

519
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
They'll be like, oh good, another one.

520
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They'll see like the font.

521
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And they'll be like, wow, this guy really dropped off.

522
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Like what happened here?

523
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't know.

524
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Nothing I'm really worried about.

525
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But like the point just to get back to Gibbs point because I do find that interesting.

526
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And like it did kind of dampen my spirits a little bit like, ah, shit.

527
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But then I got over when I saw that like, okay, this didn't really like do what I've done.

528
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But like if you want to like do a review of an anime because you've got something interesting to say

529
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and it's an original idea you thought or something.

530
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Then you like happen to click around and you see, oh shit.

531
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This guy talked about the exact thing I was going to talk about and his video is like nice and stuff.

532
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I mean, what the fuck am I going to do?

533
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
This is not like you.

534
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I mean, in a small enough community, this is more powerful and more potent,

535
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
especially when it comes to each us in the PCP because I came up with this idea like a few weeks ago

536
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
when Digi had been paid to rant about the quick draw not being advertised enough.

537
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Up until that point, I'd been thinking I really got to get around to making a video

538
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and then Digi says it in the rant and then people like, yeah, what the fuck?

539
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Where's the quick draw ads?

540
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And I'm like, damn it.

541
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Now people are going to think I wouldn't have had the idea if not Digi had said it.

542
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They think I'm cocking Digi's advice and that it's all his reason that, god damn it, I got so mad.

543
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Then I made that like sort of passive-aggressive ad.

544
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It was very passive-aggressive.

545
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Like, yeah, it's your fucking...

546
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Because I knew immediately people in the comments would think, oh, Digi saved the day and I was like, it wasn't Digi.

547
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I was thinking about it.

548
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I already knew.

549
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm the smart boy.

550
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I know how to do things.

551
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I know I hadn't done it.

552
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I know.

553
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's why, I mean, it's not even that I was angry at you, obviously.

554
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It was that I was angry that I took so long and now people are going to think I'm a copycat freak with no brain.

555
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah.

556
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You know, this is...

557
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I can't really speak to that situation.

558
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But just like two things like I was saying before about like other ideas.

559
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is why for anything that like I want to even like tangentially relate to things I want to make videos on,

560
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I just like don't consume other people's media about it.

561
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Unless I like do...

562
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I expect to like quote it in the video or whatever.

563
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That's a funny thing, Nate, because like I know a lot of reviewers do that.

564
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like Yahtzee has always said like, yeah, I don't watch anybody's reviews until I do my own.

565
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And it's because they usually say they don't want to have like anybody else's opinions color theirs.

566
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And like, I feel the total opposite because...

567
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And this is wrong of me to feel this way because like most people view creators individually.

568
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's like I follow you.

569
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I follow this guy.

570
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Those are the people I consume.

571
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I always think of it as like this overarching discourse that like anything that's been said already.

572
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I don't have to say that again.

573
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, like if somebody else has said it, I don't have to say it.

574
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And so I always am trying to find the one thing nobody said.

575
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So like rather than, you know, just like not consume anything else.

576
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Which at this point, I don't because I don't like any anime reviewers at all.

577
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So I don't watch anybody's shit just for that reason.

578
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But like for instance with Mob Psycho.

579
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Like I would have made a video about Mob Psycho season 2, but you had already gotten out your Viagoa before I got to it.

580
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And in my video, I literally am like, hey, Nate already talked about the show in broad terms.

581
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm just going to fixate on this one detail he didn't bring up because like I don't want to just repeat everything you said when you already did a good job.

582
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'd rather just send people to your video, you know?

583
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
See, that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

584
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
To see what other people are talking about and kind of like avoid it.

585
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Or even maybe in general terms, recap it like to a degree, that seems fine to me.

586
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But I very much worry personally about the guilt of either consciously or unconsciously like ripping off other people's ideas in any way.

587
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So I don't know.

588
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:56,000
When it comes to like an anime or a video game video that hasn't been covered to death, then I think it's fine to make your own video because people will think of it as your take.

589
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Even if it's very similar to some other video, there's a lower chance that they have seen all those other videos of the same thing.

590
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
When it comes to something like a review of The Last Jedi, nobody could do that anymore.

591
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Like that has been done or like the last episode of Game of Thrones or something like overwhelmingly like, what's the word, cluttered, stodged.

592
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's just too many. It's too many saturated.

593
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You know what's funny about that though?

594
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Unbelievably saturated about that one aspect.

595
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The funny thing about it though is that the audience by and large will just watch all of them.

596
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
They don't care if they repeat themselves. They don't care if they hear the same information.

597
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm sure some people can.

598
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I must have watched 20 videos about that Game of Thrones finale just because they were out there and I was like, alright.

599
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I watched one.

600
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Eventually people will stop.

601
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,000
A certain person will only be able to consume so many last Jedi reviews, but the audience doesn't disappear.

602
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It tapers off over a long period.

603
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
For me, it's always difficult for me to understand other people's viewing habits because I only watch my subscriptions.

604
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I really do not adventure out of that.

605
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm not the type of person who watches a movie and then searches for what people are saying about it.

606
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I don't care.

607
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I really don't care what anybody has to say.

608
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I only watch people because I like those people and I don't care what they're talking about.

609
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll watch anything they talk about.

610
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But that's not how most people are.

611
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
They watch everything pertaining to their interests.

612
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'll talk to Victor, for instance, who will do that.

613
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
He'll go and watch every video that's about something he cares about.

614
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
He just thinks all the videos are shit.

615
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,000
He'll tell me, you have to talk about this show because I watched 10 videos and they were all garbage and you have to make a video about it.

616
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'll just be like, okay, is there anything I can say that they didn't say?

617
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Is it just a problem with the presentation or what did they talk about?

618
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I want to know what he's unhappy about in a situation.

619
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Did they not discuss the ideas he was interested in or is it that the presentation was terrible?

620
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I think it's usually that he thinks they're wrong about it.

621
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That they have the wrong take.

622
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I think he was positive about-

623
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Every girl log in review before I made mine and my great rage at that.

624
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I think Victor was actually more positive about the final season at Game of Thrones, for instance.

625
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think he was upset that everybody had the same negative take.

626
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But I think he watched them all.

627
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Every single one, he just gets madder and madder as he watches them.

628
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I watched them all in a quest for additional details that most people weren't aware.

629
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
For nuggets of information.

630
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Maybe there was-

631
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This was said, Daenerys' thing was set up in a really cool way.

632
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We weren't aware of it.

633
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That's not what happened.

634
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But maybe someone knows something that I wasn't aware of.

635
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm on a quest for people who did actual research and looked behind the scenes info

636
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and are going to present it to me in a way where I don't have to do any work.

637
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I feel like that's what I'm doing when I scour video after video.

638
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm looking for the more things than just the whatever.

639
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Women are gay.

640
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I suppose if it is down to everybody's covering something and if it is Game of Thrones,

641
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I would react a certain way after watching it.

642
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I wouldn't watch reviews first.

643
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And then based on my reaction, I didn't like it.

644
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So I wanted to see all the ways in which it sucked because I'm not going to watch it again.

645
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So I would find somebody detailing everything.

646
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But then I'd also want to know how they fucked up.

647
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Alt-Shift-X got us covered.

648
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No, no, fuck Alt-Shift-X.

649
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You got to go with Preston Jacobs.

650
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Alt-Shift-X is fucking...

651
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
He's the fucking bargain bin.

652
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Fucking watered down Preston Jacobs for the dirty degenerate masses.

653
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah, like me.

654
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Like me.

655
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I've never watched any of those books.

656
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So it's perfect for me.

657
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No, Alt-Shift-X, he only talks about the show.

658
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I spit on him.

659
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's not even true.

660
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
He made a fascinating video about the extended lands.

661
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That video fucking ruled.

662
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You know what?

663
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You know what?

664
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You're right.

665
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It actually does rule.

666
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
All right, there we go.

667
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I have a vlog that's going to come out soon where I talk about this.

668
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But one of the most important things that's extremely difficult for you as a content creator

669
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
to put yourself in the mindset of is the fact that the audience has not seen your video yet.

670
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
When you title it, I have this problem where I always try to give my videos a title that

671
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
makes the most sense for the video, which doesn't matter to the audience because they haven't

672
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
seen it yet.

673
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
When they read the title, they will not know what the video is.

674
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So I can make the title basically anything and then once you click the video, then you'll

675
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
understand what it is and you'll go, oh, okay, now I see how the title pertains to this.

676
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But like, you know, and so I think that with people are looking for information on a show,

677
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
they don't know before they click if your video has any original or unique information.

678
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
They're going to watch it to find that out.

679
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And so even if it has no original or unique information, it's going to get watched because

680
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
people are looking for that and they can't know if you have it or not until they watch

681
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
the video, which is why you end up watching 25 fucking videos and you think half of them

682
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
suck because there's so many people who are just spamming every single, everything that

683
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
is popular, anything that their SEO manager tells them this is the thing to talk about.

684
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They're going to make a video regardless of what information they have and you just have

685
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
to be the guy who had the most unique take or just the best made video so that people

686
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
will actually say, wow, this guy was actually good.

687
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm going to subscribe to him.

688
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But like, if you concern yourself about it, like if you're too hung up on everything I

689
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
say has to be unique, you're missing out that there's only two kinds of audience members

690
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
who are going to see your video.

691
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's either somebody who's watching everything that has to do with the show you're talking

692
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
about, or they only watch you anyways, which means that they're not going to hear any of

693
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that other shit.

694
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So if you only have like the most unique take and you don't focus on any of the outer details,

695
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
then maybe those people who are watching absolutely every review will watch yours and

696
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
think, okay, this one had something unique to say, but they would have watched it anyways.

697
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And if they're not that person, then they only are watching your channel and they don't

698
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
hear any of that other shit.

699
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So what's your suggestion?

700
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What's the way to operate then to capture that?

701
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Just say whatever you want to say and don't worry about what anybody else is saying.

702
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You mean in like the title and thumbnail?

703
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
No, in your video, just don't think about what anybody else is saying because it won't

704
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
affect you.

705
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It won't matter to your audience at all.

706
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It only matters to you because you want to feel original and you want to feel like they're

707
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
not copying people.

708
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But your audience won't perceive it at all.

709
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They're only going to perceive like what the video is in and of itself.

710
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And if the video is good, regardless of if it repeats points from other people, then

711
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
that will be what's recognized.

712
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I suppose the most important audience to capture on YouTube, as sad as it may be, is specifically

713
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
that demographic that isn't just watching everything about the show nor your own core audience

714
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
because you've already got those people just by making the video.

715
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's that other demographic that like you just aren't reaching that you need to in some

716
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
way like clickbait into the video or I don't know, like convinced to watch where they otherwise

717
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
wouldn't have.

718
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's through making the video really good or like clickbait-y stuff or whatever.

719
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I suppose thinking cynically from like a business perspective, that's like the most important

720
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
demographic to appeal to however you can.

721
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The funniest thing to me is like my brother Vic, he watches Jeff, mother's basement, pretty

722
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
regularly and hates it.

723
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But he watches it because Jeff talks about every relevant cultural thing.

724
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That's his gig and Victor just wants to hear about those things so anytime Jeff talks about

725
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
anything Victor's consumed, he's going to watch it and just get mad.

726
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Like that's what people-

727
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But he wants to know what's going on.

728
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
People don't care if the video is even good, they watch it just because it's about the

729
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
thing.

730
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,360
Like who's the, I don't know, like a guy's like Tim Poole or whatever who I'm actually

731
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,000
pretty bored with because I'm sick of news, fuck news, news is shit.

732
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But he'll make a video about any event that happens politically speaking, like in the

733
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
world and he'll give his take, I mean who cares?

734
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm over it.

735
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Like who's doing that for anime?

736
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Jeff?

737
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And I guess that's it.

738
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Like just Jeff.

739
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Maybe gig a little bit with his like wrap up things he does.

740
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I mean Jeff, even beyond anime.

741
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The anime man?

742
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
He covers everything that's relevant at the moment.

743
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, that's true.

744
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Because that's what, I mean what SEO is, search engine optimization is essentially you just

745
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
look at whatever everybody's talking about and you talk about that and it always works.

746
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It will always be the most successful thing you can do.

747
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's the nature of it.

748
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Is just talk about the thing we're all talking about and I think that Jeff is somebody who's

749
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
really good at getting interested in that thing.

750
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I mean you could just say he has basic bitch taste, but like anything that everybody's

751
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
talking about he will legitimately form an interest and find something to say about it

752
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
because that is what he's passionate about, is being on the money, you know?

753
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And I think for you and I, we have a much stronger like I have to really legitimately give a shit

754
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and I don't about most things, you know?

755
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So it's like.

757
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh dude.

758
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's like the.

759
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Paul this, this Tim Pool guy.

760
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Seems like he really sucks.

761
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Let's not get into it because my point was I don't care so let's just keep it at that level.

762
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay.

763
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
All right.

764
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah.

765
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Well, anyway, I guess I was just going to say that when, when something I care about is

766
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
also popular, it feels like the planets are aligning.

767
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's like the most beautiful sensation.

768
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's like, oh my God, everyone's talking about it and I have something to say about it.

769
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes.

770
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm going to ride this all the way.

771
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,500
Like I have to put all of my focus onto this because nothing else is going to be my meal

772
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,000
ticket for the next however many months this is relevant for or.

773
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Indeed.

774
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Indeed.

775
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
In some cases.

776
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,560
I mean, not to, not to make a cynical transition, but there was a tragedy recently that happens

777
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
to appeal to you.

778
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,800
Oh, not appeal, obviously, but in your wheelhouse of, of interest things, which is of course

779
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,500
the Keohani nightmare.

780
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,600
Yeah, but that's not a good thing.

781
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
I'm not saying it's good.

782
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,500
I'm saying it's relevant to Digi because he's a big Keohani fan and.

783
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Well, in the, in the sense that like being relevant is like good for money, but like.

784
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Well, it literally is.

785
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
It literally is.

786
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,000
But I mean, yeah, I can't, I can't really deny what Nate's saying because like as much

787
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
as it, it really is like, I don't want to say an opportunity, but like I have gotten

788
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
a lot of views from talking about it.

789
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Like, I mean, my initial one was just kind of breaking the news story, which I'm like,

790
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I made international news.

791
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Did you guys see that?

792
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I was on the news in like, some Mexican or Latin American country or something.

793
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah.

794
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
What?

795
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Why?

796
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,500
Because I broke because of my video on a, oh yeah, I should get the link.

797
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,000
It's on Twitter.

798
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,500
I was like the first person on YouTube to report on the Keohani fire and my video.

799
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Yes.

800
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,300
My there's a clip of my video in a news report from some other country.

801
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,300
So it's like.

802
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,300
That is so crazy that like, I mean, I guess it makes sense.

803
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:07,300
It's just, it's just funny that like they'd make a, I don't know, be like a news report

804
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,800
and like they would include footage of like a YouTuber talking about it.

805
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Just like a news person talking about the thing, basically.

806
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Yeah.

807
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,000
I mean, isn't that sort of like them like including a clip of like another news network

808
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
talking about it?

809
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I mean, I know it's not.

810
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah.

811
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They don't like play a clip.

812
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,900
It's just like, like running in the background as this guy's talking, like he's basically

813
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,300
talking about the fan reaction on the internet, like how people are, you know, how people

814
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,740
are reacting to it and I come up in that, but it's like, so yeah, I can't deny that

815
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:46,860
like even if my goal is just to, you know, break the news to as many, like the only reason

816
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,900
my point is of course not to call you out or anybody.

817
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
I understand.

818
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
This is.

819
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Absolutely.

820
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,200
Like, yeah.

821
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,200
The fact that I feel something about something that everybody else is feeling something about

822
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,000
and I'm able to put it into words is, is to my benefit in the long run.

823
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,200
I mean, like, yeah, you know, there were some people who criticized me for the, because

824
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:16,400
the second video I did the, the one you will experience hurt or whatever.

825
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
Yeah.

826
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,400
The damage is coming.

827
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
Right.

828
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,900
I monetized, which I had not done for the original news breaking because I thought,

829
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:29,300
you know, obviously this is, this is not, this is not about me, but the second video

830
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,900
is a creation I made.

831
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,900
It is, it is in the vein of every other video I've done.

832
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:42,700
It is my creative output and my ability to connect with your emotions is my job.

833
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,240
So it's like on the one hand it is, there were some people who said like, I can't believe

834
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,900
if you monetize this video, you know, when it's about this tragedy and it's like, well,

835
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,740
this is, this is like me writing a book about a tragedy that happened, you know, like you

836
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,340
would pay for a book about 9-11.

837
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,340
You know what I mean?

838
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,340
Like.

839
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,740
We have complicated relationships with tragedies as a society, I think.

840
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,740
I mean, I don't know.

841
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,740
I don't blame you.

842
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,740
It's whatever.

843
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,740
I mean, I don't know.

844
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,380
I mean, you know, just my take on it was like, I considered even tweeting about it.

845
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,280
I was like, you know, I, like after I did, I was like, I don't know what to say.

846
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,960
Frankly, I was like, I don't know what charity to trust.

847
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Maybe they're literally embezzling.

848
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,360
Like, I don't know any of these people.

849
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,360
What am I going to do?

850
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,960
I just don't want to get involved because it seems weird to like a tweet about Edeca

851
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,000
and I kind of felt bad because I'm like, I don't even want to be part of the conversation.

852
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,160
All energy should go to focus on like Edeca and other people.

853
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,640
I, this is like, like, maybe I could amplify like helpful voices in some way.

854
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,640
I don't know.

855
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,880
It just made me a little uncomfortable.

856
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,640
And then like this happens.

857
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,900
It's funny, because ordinarily I wouldn't, and like in a case like Edeca, I mean, I

858
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,660
didn't know about him, but I wouldn't have probably said anything other than maybe just

859
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:57,260
like, oh, I missed the guy because there's nothing you can do.

860
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,260
He's dead.

861
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,780
There's nothing you can do for him.

862
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:04,220
In the case of KyoAnnie, it was like, this is an ongoing scenario where there's not

863
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:09,140
only is there going to be the families affected, but like the studio is going to have to rebuild

864
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:13,540
a bunch of people are out of jobs, you know, like it's not just about the people who died.

865
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,600
It's everybody surrounding it who's going to need help.

866
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:21,240
So like, that was why I felt like I had to do, I had to say something like, oh, if there's,

867
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,800
I wasn't going to say anything until there was some kind of action that could be taken,

868
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
you know, right?

869
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,120
Like there's no sense in me just making a video to cry about it.

870
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,080
It's like, okay, well, there's, there's a GoFundMe.

871
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,000
It's being done by Sentai Filmworks, who basically licenses all of KyoAnnie's shit.

872
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,040
So I would trust them to, you know, have the right intentions and it seems pretty fair.

873
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
Yeah.

874
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Yeah.

875
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
It was just kind of like, yeah.

876
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,620
Is there been any, any new information on like the person who did it?

877
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,220
Do we know why he did it yet?

878
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,220
I mean, I'd rather not.

879
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,020
You know, I pulled up an article from the AP, well, I just like, I think his motivation

880
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,740
is relevant just in terms of like why he did it so we can understand.

881
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,540
Well, he seems to think that they had plagiarized his book or something.

882
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,540
Yeah.

883
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,540
Stole his novel or something.

884
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,540
Just some insane shit.

885
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,540
I mean, that's the only thing that people have.

886
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,540
It doesn't sound legit.

887
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,160
I mean, I'd be, I would, I would like someone to investigate this to some extent to find

888
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,160
out if there's any truth.

889
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,920
Obviously, even if it's 100% accurate, disproportionate backlash, obviously, but, you know.

890
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,920
I'm just curious.

891
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,080
Whatever the case is, the guy clearly had meditated this for a long time because the

892
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,080
amount of, like it just so happens that that day, because the studio only has one fire exit

893
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,560
because it's like an older building and they had unlocked it that day because the news was

894
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,660
coming to do interviews with them.

895
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,580
So he would have had to have known that.

896
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,580
Yeah.

897
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:48,980
So like, he was definitely like stalking them, trying, like he was planning for it, you know.

898
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,020
And I mean, he's fucking insanely ruthless.

899
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,860
He was dumping fire on people as they ran out of the building and shit.

900
00:55:54,860 --> 00:56:00,780
Like, it's fucking crazy, but the reason for something like that could only be something

901
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,780
insane.

902
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,900
Can you fucking believe this happened to Kyoto animation of all fucking studios?

903
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,180
Like, Jesus Christ.

904
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
What the fuck?

905
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
I mean, okay.

906
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,840
It seems like they were like the least bad one.

907
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:18,000
They're like the one studio that like really takes care of their employees and like, like

908
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,800
has good hours, good management.

909
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Everyone there is extremely talented.

910
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,760
And this doesn't really matter, but it's like mostly women too.

911
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,120
And it's like, what the fuck?

912
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
Mostly women.

913
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,200
They had a daycare in that building.

914
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,200
Oh, God.

915
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,560
I don't think any children were there that day.

916
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,560
Yeah, I heard.

917
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,560
Yeah.

918
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,560
Well, all right.

919
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:42,820
It keeps getting brought up, but it's still like to walk through that.

920
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:48,220
You know, even in this moment, I feel a little guilty about even expressing any sentiment

921
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:53,540
because I feel like I might be playing it up for an audience and it makes me feel uncomfortable

922
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,340
that I'm doing that.

923
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,860
You don't have to worry about feeling that way because everybody is feeling something,

924
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,860
you know?

925
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,860
I guess.

926
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,860
Yeah.

927
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,980
So early into this happening, because I was following everybody who was tweeting about

928
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,980
it.

929
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,960
Director, is there any news on that guy?

930
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,960
Have we heard anything?

931
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,960
Jesus Christ.

932
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,280
I mean, if they're labeled, the reason that they're considered missing is that they haven't

933
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
–

934
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,200
There's like a weird Japanese thing.

935
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,200
They don't pronounce somebody dead until a doctor is pronounced dead.

936
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,200
So missing.

937
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,120
Were they working on season two like right now?

938
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,120
Yes.

939
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:30,080
I think that's probably why he was in the studio is that they were working on it.

940
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080
Yeah.

941
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:38,140
I mean, it's fucked, but there was people saying everybody grieves in their own way

942
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:43,160
and I was like, yeah, it's always important to keep that in mind because a lot of the

943
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:49,500
ways that people react to it, I look at and I think, what the fuck?

944
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,060
Why is that what you're focusing on?

945
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,060
Why are you reacting like this?

946
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,060
Right, right.

947
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,260
And then I just have to stop and say, okay, well, look, not everybody thinks like I do.

948
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,900
Everybody's emotional.

949
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,900
Just let them –

950
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,760
Let them do whatever they think they have to do.

951
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,800
I saw a great interaction, which was just Demo tweeted like, this is horrible.

952
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,680
And then his follow-up was like something, something, this would a horrific event and

953
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,760
like, what a blow to the industry.

954
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,880
And then someone said like, really bro, you're going to focus on like the industry instead

955
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,880
of the people.

956
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,440
And of course, this is him following his first tweet about like, what a nightmare for the

957
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,440
people.

958
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,120
And Demo's like, we really going to nitpick my specific word choices, bro.

959
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,120
And like not –

960
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,900
He responded in such a calm way and was like, come on, bro, we really going to do this.

961
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,060
And the guy's like, oh shit, you're right.

962
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,060
Sorry.

963
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,060
Like it's fine.

964
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,060
I mean, it's been –

965
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,060
Way to keep it cool, calm and collected.

966
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,860
You should have been invited by Discord yesterday with 13-year-old Annie Fred, newest member

967
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:48,860
of the TNCP was running around screaming about how he doesn't actually think that we, that

968
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:53,620
like everyone's emotions are legitimate because they're worried about – you only care because

969
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,060
it's Kyoto Animation, not because it's people and it's just like, yeah, all right.

970
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,920
I mean, yeah, literally kind of true, I'm not really overly – I should be, but as

971
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
a flawed human machine –

972
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
I don't think you should.

973
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,640
I think that people should only be concerned about things that concern you because if you

974
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,920
try to concern yourself with every single human life on earth, you will just be depressed

975
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
all the time.

976
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
True.

977
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,240
If it had been like the building next door that was burned down and the people in that

978
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,400
building had died, like none of us would have heard about it.

979
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,440
We have a personal – I mean, many of us do.

980
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:31,980
I've seen many of – obviously, many of us are big fans.

981
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,380
People take this line about like, yeah, you only care because you're personally involved,

982
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,380
like other things.

983
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,380
No shit.

984
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,380
That's not even a real argument.

985
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:43,260
That's not like – I mean, I guess you're correct, but what should I not care because

986
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,260
I don't know.

987
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,780
You're only sad because you care specifically about people.

988
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,740
By the way, nobody – nobody attacked Annie Fred.

989
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,740
He's like 13.

990
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,740
He's young.

991
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,740
He doesn't know what's up.

992
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,340
Well, we had a long – there was a long discussion.

993
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,340
Right.

994
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
Okay.

995
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,440
He's not admitted to being wrong or anything.

996
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,040
He's 13 in the time, people.

997
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:13,040
Anyway, the thing is that like, yes, obviously, it would be nice if we cared about every human

998
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:22,240
life, but there are billions of people and you cannot do something for everyone.

999
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,240
You can't.

1000
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,640
You have a limited amount of self.

1001
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,260
The first priority of everybody should be taking care of yourself.

1002
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,340
Make sure you are in the right place.

1003
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,580
You are mentally okay.

1004
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,180
You're physically okay.

1005
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,180
Take care of yourself.

1006
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,340
If something's wrong with yourself, don't worry about other people unless it helps you

1007
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,740
to take care of yourself.

1008
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,180
Hence the – hence the put your mask on in the airport before helping those next to you.

1009
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,180
Exactly.

1010
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,180
You just gotta –

1011
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:51,100
And then once you are taken care of, you should worry about other people, but like think

1012
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,380
about like how much can I give?

1013
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,000
If I have to give money, for instance, how much money do I have, who needs it, and what

1014
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,080
causes am I – what do I care about?

1015
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,920
Fix the stuff that you care about because nobody else is gonna fix it.

1016
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,720
Everybody should be fixing the problems that are relevant to them, and that way, every

1017
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,480
problem's getting worked on at the same time by the people who should be working on it.

1018
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,420
Yeah.

1019
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,500
Like if Kill Andy burns down, like I was on Twitter, and there's a lot of people who

1020
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,140
weren't talking about it, who don't know anything about it, who don't care.

1021
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,580
You know, I follow plenty of people who aren't anime people, and like I just kind of – I

1022
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,820
didn't want to read those tweets.

1023
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:39,060
I was like, I only really care about this thing that's happening, so I'm not reading

1024
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:42,300
all these other tweets by other people, and I don't blame them at all.

1025
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,900
Why would I – why would they care that 33 people they've never heard of died?

1026
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,180
Like that happens all the time.

1027
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,320
That's true.

1028
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,520
You care when you heard of it and when it's relevant to you.

1029
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,640
I almost worry even more about – I mean, I know, whatever, there's no point in comparing,

1030
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,560
but like imagine being like not one of the people who died.

1031
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,520
One of the employees there who's now permanently burned and scarred for life, you watched your

1032
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,720
co-workers burn and die around you, and you – and now you're like your job is gone,

1033
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,640
your life is for – and maybe you're like permanently crippled as a result of this one

1034
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:18,000
guy who you saw shouting, die, die in the building and killing people.

1035
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,260
What a fucking piece of shit.

1036
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,260
I mean, obviously, but – you know, this makes me think though.

1037
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,260
I'm sorry, did that happen in –

1038
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,260
Yes.

1039
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,260
That's – what?

1040
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,260
Yeah, that's what happened.

1041
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,860
Wait, the arsonist was in there shouting, dying.

1042
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,220
He was in there screaming, die at the people in there, yeah.

1043
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,180
He was not – this was like a very active arson.

1044
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:37,580
He was like in there dumping gas on people.

1045
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:42,700
He lit the exit on fire and then was throwing gas on people as they left the building.

1046
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,700
Like –

1047
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,660
Makes me feel legitimately sick to think about it.

1048
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,660
Ridiculous.

1049
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
It's nuts.

1050
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,680
Oh my god.

1051
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,680
That's why I'm saying like the reason can only be something insane.

1052
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
Okay, you know what though?

1053
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,560
This is the heaviest episode of the PCP ever by the way.

1054
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,560
It is terrific.

1055
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,120
Okay, I was just going to say, you know what, on this subject it kind of even relates to

1056
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,560
politics as we were talking before, and it's just that like – I mean, the – specifically

1057
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:12,920
I heard about Q&A, fucked me up, then – it's fucked up to even think about it this way,

1058
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:18,180
when I heard about like the director of Dragon Maid, like that he probably dead, like that's

1059
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:22,220
when it was like – that's when it kind of became real, and I'm like something that

1060
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,300
I was looking forward to, was really excited about.

1061
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,300
I'm like, I will – like I'll probably never get it, and even if I get it, like it

1062
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,340
won't be what it was, everything that was in the building, all their work gone, even

1063
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,380
if they rebuild it, they're starting from scratch.

1064
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,820
And it was like – I thought to myself like, oh, I want a tweet.

1065
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,660
I want to like share the information.

1066
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,440
But you know, when I ultimately decided for various reasons I already talked about, I

1067
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,400
was like, you know what, I think I want my online presence to be like, other people can

1068
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,560
talk about politics, totally understandable, totally fair, other people can talk about

1069
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,160
tragedies, I get it.

1070
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,840
I kind of want my little bubble to be like an oasis of just like positivity and like

1071
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,320
a little bit of like, you know, just lighthearted, like talking about video games, talking about

1072
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,880
anime, things that we like.

1073
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,620
I was like, there's a time and a place for these things.

1074
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:17,500
I think I will kind of craft my online experience to just be a place where people can like

1075
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,460
chill and like get away from like stress stuff.

1076
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,300
Current broadcast not with standing eyes.

1077
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,620
Not counting this, you know, I don't know.

1078
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,620
This is a shared group.

1079
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,620
This isn't just my stuff.

1080
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,900
I don't – like this is – maybe that's me being like a coward.

1081
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,860
I mean that we talked about – No, I think that's totally – I think we need stuff

1082
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,860
like that.

1083
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,780
There needs to be a place for them to – I agree.

1084
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,960
That was like why I put out – because I almost didn't put out the newest whirling

1085
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,520
dervish episode because like I personally – like that episode was done before the

1086
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,520
fire happened.

1087
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Right.

1088
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,200
I felt really weird about like saying anything other than about it.

1089
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,720
I was like, this is the only thing I can talk about right now and it wasn't until I had

1090
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,720
out my tribute video that I felt I could post anything else.

1091
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,120
It was like, this has to come out first, then we can do – but I was like – there was

1092
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,100
a part of me that was like, all right, do I want to post this podcast because it's

1093
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,100
still on my mind.

1094
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,460
But then I was like, well, what about all the people who would like rather think about

1095
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,420
anything else right now, you know, like –

1096
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,740
I posted my We Agua like the next day and people were like, oh, I was really hoping

1097
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,020
he'd like make a video about, you know, the Kill Annie.

1098
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,500
First of all, I don't have time to get that out before this.

1099
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,500
Right.

1100
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,500
But I mean, that's just the sentiment.

1101
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,500
I get it.

1102
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,500
I get it.

1103
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,500
That's what's on everybody's mind.

1104
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,540
I think I saw one person like criticizing you for like talking about something else.

1105
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,540
Who me?

1106
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,160
Yeah, like they wouldn't have imagined that you could have – you would have recorded

1107
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,760
this before you heard that news or something.

1108
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,760
Yeah.

1109
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,760
Well –

1110
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,760
I don't remember where I saw that.

1111
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,760
It was a comment in a discord.

1112
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,040
It's another case of like everybody grieving differently.

1113
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,240
Like there are some people who I totally get why you are just going to be upset that anybody

1114
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,200
cares about anything else because that's always how it feels.

1115
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,240
It's like when your like parent dies, like you are not going to be interested in hearing

1116
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:02,620
about anything that anyone has to say because you're going to be completely focused on

1117
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,500
this thing that nobody but you has a reason to really care about, you know?

1118
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Right.

1119
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,780
And it's just like you have to face the fact that we all have to reserve our grief for

1120
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,660
when we need it, you know?

1121
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:14,660
Like I don't –

1122
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,660
Sometimes I think about –

1123
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,940
There was a mass shooting 10 minutes from my house a month ago.

1124
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:24,260
And when I heard about it, my reaction was like, wow, that sucks.

1125
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,280
The world's a shitty place.

1126
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,260
Even though it happened right near my house because I don't know the people involved,

1127
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,820
mass shootings happen all the time.

1128
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,060
If I'm just depressed every time there's a mass shooting, I'll never not be depressed.

1129
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:40,340
But like when something that's really relevant to me, like this happens, it's like, okay,

1130
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,780
the walls are coming down.

1131
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:44,580
Like I can't control this emotion.

1132
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,260
This is – that's kind of the point of my video.

1133
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:51,260
It's like sometimes it's going to happen directly to you and that's when you're going

1134
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:52,260
to feel it.

1135
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:57,400
And you know, a fascinating thing happened to me recently, which was just me and Michelle

1136
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,640
went to Kings Island, a big roller coaster water park place in Ohio.

1137
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,640
Pretty fun.

1138
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,640
Pretty good time.

1139
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,640
Did you make a vlog?

1140
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,640
I should have.

1141
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,640
No.

1142
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,640
I took the pictures.

1143
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,640
I don't know.

1144
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
I didn't post them on Instagram.

1145
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
Maybe I will at some point.

1146
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,320
But it was just that like the first thing that we did was Michelle and I went on like the

1147
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,840
first – it was like a wooden roller coaster.

1148
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,840
And it was – I don't know.

1149
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,060
The first one to go on or something, Thunder – that might be the wrong name.

1150
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:26,180
But like as we're getting on it, like Michelle hates roller coasters.

1151
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,020
And I'm saying to her, oh, this is a wooden roller coaster.

1152
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,020
Like these aren't as bad.

1153
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,540
Like we can see a diamond bag.

1154
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,540
Oh no, no, no, no.

1155
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,540
Wooden ones are the worst.

1156
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,180
Well, okay, at the time I wasn't – the shaking you get on a wooden roller coaster

1157
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:41,860
feels far worse than the sleek experience of a metal.

1158
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:45,140
At the time I was not thinking about that, have not been in a while.

1159
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,140
So we're in line.

1160
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,140
Michelle's very nervous.

1161
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,140
I'm like, no, it's fine.

1162
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,620
Like this isn't that big of a roller.

1163
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,760
It's going to be fine.

1164
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,760
We get up in the front of the line.

1165
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,680
Michelle's still nervous.

1166
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,680
We ask the guy there.

1167
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,400
It's like – we ask the guy like in the line, hey dude, is this – like she's a little

1168
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
nervous.

1169
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
Is this roller coaster bad?

1170
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,920
Of course, we aren't thinking this is a jaded man who works at an amusement park.

1171
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
And he says to us like –

1172
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,280
If I were you, I'd have done that specifically because like, yeah, I'm going to ask this

1173
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,280
guy.

1174
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,840
Obviously, this guy doesn't give a shit.

1175
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,720
He's just going to be like – he's going to be like, yeah, it's fine, don't worry

1176
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,720
about it.

1177
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,720
Don't be a pussy.

1178
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:17,720
I was kind of thinking that at the time.

1179
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,820
Yeah.

1180
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,620
And then, you know, it's going to put her mind at ease.

1181
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,620
That's what happened, yeah.

1182
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,120
And then she's going to do the thing.

1183
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,620
I'm like, it'll be fine.

1184
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,620
Well, okay.

1185
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,620
It's going to be fine.

1186
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,120
Ultimately, it was fine.

1187
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,140
But when we get on, there's a moment where as we're on the ride, the guy said like,

1188
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,220
yeah, this is the first roller coaster you're supposed to do.

1189
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,220
That's what he said.

1190
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:39,980
Now he meant of the serious roller coasters there because there are kitty ones that you

1191
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,980
can do too.

1192
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,460
But anyway, we're going on it.

1193
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,060
We're going up and up and up on the thing for the first drop.

1194
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,840
And as we're like halfway, Michelle just leans over and she's like, wow, we're really

1195
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,800
still going up, huh?

1196
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,280
And the answer was, yep, we're still going up.

1197
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,280
And it just feels like an eternity as we climb.

1198
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:00,440
And the realization dawns on both of our faces as we look at each other that this was more

1199
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,760
than we had bargained for.

1200
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:11,160
And as we go down that first hill and I see any anticipation, any, you know, feelings

1201
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:20,420
of possible trepidation, turn into sheer pain, sheer agony, any feelings of possible reconciliation

1202
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:26,500
out the window, well, that the screams, you know, and at first I'm like, yeah, this is

1203
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,500
fun.

1204
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,220
My stomach was, was like holding it together at first for the first dip or two.

1205
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:39,500
But then I turn over and I see just the, the actual agony, the actual not a joke pain,

1206
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,500
pure pain.

1207
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:46,120
This is not a joke, like wanting anything but to be doing what's doing there on Michelle's

1208
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,120
face.

1209
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:53,000
And my first, I lost my nerve and then I felt sick and I was like, this is not fun.

1210
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,080
This is not fun anymore.

1211
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:02,260
And and then I actually felt deeply emasculated that my girl is in such pain and there's nothing

1212
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:08,040
I can do to help her and we just have to endure until we get to the end of this ride.

1213
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:13,620
It was a very negative experience for that, like 30 seconds at the end of that ride and

1214
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,620
we get off.

1215
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,420
What a bunch of pussy shit I'm hearing.

1216
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:21,660
I just, all right, we get off and Michelle was very unhappy about, look, she recovered

1217
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:26,140
like real fast, but in that moment of being on that ride, it was like the, if you could

1218
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:31,740
crystallize her emotion, you have pure crystallize anti fun in, in some sort of gem and that

1219
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,860
I would sell it to the highest bidder.

1220
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,300
Somebody hates roller coasters as much as I do.

1221
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,080
Clear that she is, she is, she's your girl.

1222
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,080
She's your girl.

1223
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,480
Now I went on to go on the metal roller coaster and had a grand time.

1224
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,080
I was too scared to go on the biggest one, Diamondback or whatever it is.

1225
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,600
But the other, like the loop to loop, it was easy.

1226
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,920
What difference does it make to go on the not as bad one versus the super bad one?

1227
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,440
Like they all are the same.

1228
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,440
It's always going to be the same.

1229
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,440
I disagree.

1230
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,600
I think a wooden one is a bad choice.

1231
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,520
It was a bad choice because you'll get waist, you'll get waist sicker.

1232
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,940
I think Michelle would have actually been much better on like the metal one I went on.

1233
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,900
Like it was even bigger because the shaking on a wooden one is so much worse.

1234
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:11,900
Okay.

1235
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:12,900
But this was my point.

1236
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:17,260
Like the helpless feeling I felt looking at Michelle was like similar to how I felt

1237
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,060
when I heard the news about Kew Annie.

1238
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,460
I just felt like such, I kind of forget the point I was making it first, but I think this

1239
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,460
was it.

1240
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,540
What a strange, what a strange comparison.

1241
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,540
You think so?

1242
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:32,780
I, you know, I forget exactly what I was trying to link up, which two ideas I was trying to

1243
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,440
connect here because that story was too long, but, uh, oh, you know what?

1244
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,600
I've got, I've got another story.

1245
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,760
I wanted to report here to the ladies and gentlemen on the PCP, which this one's shorter

1246
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,720
and much more fun.

1247
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,240
So me and Michelle are just, we're going into the, we're by a university of Cincinnati.

1248
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,920
I forget what we're doing there, picking up some stuff or whatever.

1249
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:56,600
We park next to a famous landmark in Cincinnati, Toppers Pizza, where, uh, you know, Grace

1250
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
was here.

1251
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,480
Uh, we ordered some yesterday just for a little snack.

1252
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
It was fun.

1253
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
It's, it's.

1254
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,480
You're a dog.

1255
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,060
I tracked my calories.

1256
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,780
I was a little bit over, but it's fine.

1257
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,860
Uh, uh, but it, um, it's like the staple of drunk college kids at four AM.

1258
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,020
You go to Toppers Pizza and you get their breadsticks and you dunk that shit in marinara

1259
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,020
sauce.

1260
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:17,220
That's what you do in Cincinnati.

1261
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,340
If you're a college kid.

1262
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,780
So that's the, that's the vibe.

1263
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,180
So we happen to be parked.

1264
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:26,620
I just, I just got a break in and say that yesterday I made my best, I made my masterpiece

1265
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,780
keto pizza.

1266
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,780
Oh really?

1267
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,500
I made the ultimate keto pizza.

1268
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:36,840
The secret was I use Arlo's recipe, less egg, more xanthan gum, ultimate crust.

1269
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
Shit was crispy.

1270
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,400
It was legitimately crispy and I couldn't be more pleased with Arlo Keto.

1271
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,720
No, but one time he posted a, he posted like a low car.

1272
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:51,280
He was doing like, he was dabbling in low carb and he was like, Hey guys, hey guys,

1273
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,400
you know, like store bought like cauliflower pizza crust, they just don't do it for me

1274
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,400
anymore.

1275
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,400
You know, I just can't get off to that shit.

1276
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,400
I need the hard stuff.

1277
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,400
Yeah, right.

1278
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,400
I got my own.

1279
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:05,540
So here's the best recipe I found, yeah, almond flour and fucking coconut and whatever.

1280
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:06,540
And he was right.

1281
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,780
It was base Arlo knocks out of the park once again.

1282
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,780
Base Arlo.

1283
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,780
All right.

1284
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,780
Thanks man.

1285
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,780
Listen, this is what happened.

1286
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,220
So we pull up, we're parked in front of Toppers.

1287
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,260
We're getting in the car to leave.

1288
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,260
We went and we didn't go to Toppers.

1289
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,220
We just have to be in front of it.

1290
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:26,140
However, next to us, a car pulls up and blocks us in so we can't leave at the moment.

1291
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,720
We're like, okay, we got to wait for this guy to go.

1292
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,740
He gets out of his car, walks into Toppers.

1293
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:34,100
He's wearing a hat and sunglasses and we're like, well, dude, I mean, we're like, what

1294
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,100
the hell?

1295
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,100
We're trying to leave here.

1296
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,900
Um, well, you know, a few seconds past, we're like, hopefully he'll be back soon.

1297
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,000
Looks like his car is still running out of the store.

1298
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
He comes back.

1299
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,160
He's kind of hustling.

1300
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,460
He gets in his car and he drives off and we're like, okay, we can go.

1301
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,460
Okay.

1302
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,860
Out of the Toppers bursts a woman who comes running looking back and forth and is like,

1303
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,860
where did he go?

1304
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,860
Where did he go?

1305
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,080
Well, I lean out of the car window and I say, uh, ma'am, he drove off.

1306
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,080
What?

1307
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,080
Like, what happened?

1308
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,080
What's the deal?

1309
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,160
She says that man robbed the store last week and just came back now and threw a roll of

1310
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:12,620
toilet paper at us and then ran away and sped off in his fucking car.

1311
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:19,240
This man had robbed this store the week before and came back a week later specifically to

1312
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:26,220
throw a roll of toilet paper and prank them in some way before speeding off to adventures

1313
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:30,940
unknown at Toppers fucking pizza and Cincinnati.

1314
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,260
What's the deal with that?

1315
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,900
Why did he do that?

1316
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,260
That's what he, um, any, any thoughts?

1317
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,700
He robbed them.

1318
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,700
He robbed them.

1319
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,660
Well, maybe he thought they were unsporting about it.

1320
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:45,260
I think that's probably true.

1321
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:49,220
Um, just one of the strangest things I've seen, then we just drove off.

1322
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:53,200
And that was the end of that, but, uh, fascinating event.

1323
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,000
I don't know, just like a tall, well, I don't know, middle-aged white guy hat, like looking

1324
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,120
to be incognito, uh, just came back and pranked her story had arrived the week before and

1325
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,120
off he went.

1326
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,240
I wonder about his motivation.

1327
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,880
I wonder about what he did later that day.

1328
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,680
Uh, he probably put it on his YouTube channel.

1329
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,280
He was probably streaming the whole time.

1330
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,280
He probably was.

1331
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,480
He occupies a lot of my thoughts these days.

1332
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,200
Um, but that's it.

1333
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,340
I have a, I have a story, I have a story, something that happened to me this week.

1334
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,340
All right.

1335
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,460
So, um, this is going to be stupid.

1336
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,460
Okay.

1337
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,300
Um, so I'm, so I'm going to Aldi, right?

1338
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,500
Cause they got the best deals, right?

1339
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:38,260
They got the best fucking deals at Aldi heavy, heavy, nowhere can you buy heavy cream for

1340
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,700
less per quart, uh, than an Aldi.

1341
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,860
And you know, that's where you get, uh, that's where you get, uh, my, the ultimate energy

1342
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:50,720
drink, uh, gridlock extreme red, um, 99 cents a can can't, you can't beat it.

1343
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,720
You just can't beat it.

1344
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:56,280
So, so, you know, uh, I'm like, okay.

1345
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,280
So I leave the house, right?

1346
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,280
I'm all right.

1347
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,280
I'm going to go catch the bus.

1348
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,800
There's like, I take a bus and I catch another bus and it brings me there and then I take

1349
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
it back.

1350
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,800
That's the route.

1351
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,800
Right.

1352
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,440
So I get, so I get on the first bus and I realize as I'm going like, oh shit, I didn't

1353
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,960
charge my phone, my phone's dead.

1354
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,760
So I want to have Google maps, whatever.

1355
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,720
I know how to get there, right?

1356
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,580
So I'm like, okay, but I know how to get to Aldi.

1357
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:20,460
So I take the first bus to, you know, the place and I stop and I'm waiting and I'm

1358
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,740
waiting for like half an hour.

1359
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:22,980
It's taken forever.

1360
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:23,980
It's bullshit.

1361
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:27,540
And then finally I'm waiting for one bus, but another bus comes.

1362
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,020
I'm like, this bus has gone the same way and it's not that far.

1363
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:32,820
I bet it'll take me to like the same place, right?

1364
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:38,500
So I get on that and I go for a while and it drops me off at, uh, Sullivan square or whatever

1365
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:43,660
there's some, uh, mart, mart, whatever, the, the, the stop, let's say Sullivan square.

1366
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,840
And so I'm there and I'm like, shit, this isn't where I was supposed to go.

1367
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,400
And so I'm just like, but you know what, I, I have a keen sense of direction.

1368
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,160
I know generally where I am.

1369
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,560
This has worked out for me before.

1370
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,560
This strategy has, has yield, has borne fruit.

1371
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,720
So I'm just like, I'm just going to start walking in the general direction that I'm

1372
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,960
pretty sure Aldi is in and I'll probably recognize some landmarks on the way there.

1373
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,960
So he did a full magta.

1374
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:12,280
I mean, yeah, I mean this, you know, I'm prone to this kind of thing.

1375
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:17,100
So I just start walking and I just start going, Vapors 3 available now, StComics.com.

1376
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:23,140
Um, so, and I just start walking and, and I'm going for probably like, I'm going for

1377
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,900
a while and I'm like, I don't recognize anything.

1378
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,940
So we duck into a vape shop, right?

1379
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:28,940
Of all places.

1380
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,940
A haven from the heat of the, of the cool world.

1381
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,940
Right.

1382
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,260
It's like a, it's like a pocus, a Pokemon, no a fucking Pokemon center.

1383
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,940
You dive in and recharge your batteries.

1384
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,940
Yeah.

1385
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:39,940
Right.

1386
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:40,940
Yeah.

1387
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:41,940
All right.

1388
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And I asked the guy like, the guy behind the counter, I'm like, Hey, do you know where

1389
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
the Aldi is?

1390
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,520
And he does not know what I'm talking about.

1391
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,880
And I'm like, you know, the grocery store and he's like, Oh, stop and shop.

1392
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,920
And I'm like, uh, yeah.

1393
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,400
So I, so I pretend to be interested in him telling me the directions to the stop and

1394
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
shop.

1395
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Of course.

1396
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400
I pretend that I'm going to take any of this and use it.

1397
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,400
The right thing to do.

1398
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,200
So I, so I, I humor him for a minute and I'm like, okay, thanks.

1399
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,360
And I'm like, I turn around and I walk back to the station.

1400
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,560
I'm just going to go back and wait for the bus.

1401
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,420
I'm going to wait for that bus to go the other way.

1402
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,860
I'm just going to go back to the first stop.

1403
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,980
Um, so I get on, I wait for a while.

1404
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,980
I get on what I think is that bus.

1405
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,260
Turns out it's going the other way.

1406
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:25,260
I'm going, I'm going, I'm actually going the wrong way, but I'm like, okay, whatever.

1407
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,540
It'll turn around, right?

1408
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,300
I'll get back to where I started eventually.

1409
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:34,220
So it's going, and then I think that, wait, I do recognize this landmark.

1410
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,820
I have seen that Bank of America kiosk.

1411
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,620
I have seen that CVS before.

1412
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,860
I know where I am.

1413
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,640
So I'm like, I hit the fucking strip on the side, right?

1414
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,920
So I get off the bus and I'm like, sweet.

1415
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,080
And then I walk to where I think the bus stop is at this place.

1416
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,800
And then I realized, no, I have no idea what this place is.

1417
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,000
This is not what I thought it is.

1418
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,080
I'm lost and my phone is dead.

1419
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:54,600
Oh no.

1420
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,840
So I'm like, okay, cool.

1421
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,600
So I just, I'm just like, you know what, I'm just going to start walking.

1422
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,800
So I just, I just start walking and wonder, right?

1423
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,560
I'm like, I'll find another bus stop eventually.

1424
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:07,840
Um, I go like, I go up and down like a couple of times.

1425
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,300
Uh, I pass the bus stop.

1426
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,820
I'm like, no, that, that bus stop looks bad.

1427
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,700
Look, it's, it doesn't look like it's, what is it?

1428
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,380
Stop for an express line.

1429
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,060
I don't want that.

1430
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,700
But then I finally settle on it.

1431
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,700
So wait, and the express line comes and I'm like, Hey, are you going to such and

1432
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,380
such square?

1433
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,580
And he's like, no, you're going to want that bus.

1434
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:27,020
And he points to a bus that is one stop down.

1435
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:27,780
It is there.

1436
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:32,100
Like I must run to the stop across the street.

1437
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,580
I must beat the bus to it.

1438
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,620
I barely do.

1439
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,580
I jump on that.

1440
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,340
And I'm like, are you going to such and such square?

1441
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,040
This is the bus that I just got off, right?

1442
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,080
It's the same one that I just jumped off thinking.

1443
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,400
So I'm back on the original bus, which is whatever.

1444
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,720
Anyway, turns out somehow this does in fact get me back to where I started.

1445
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,400
And then I wait at the original place.

1446
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,720
I wait for the first bus that I was supposed to take in the first place.

1447
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,800
I get there.

1448
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,040
It takes me to sort of near the Aldi kind of, I get off in like, I'm

1449
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,360
within like a couple blocks of it.

1450
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,280
I have to like go through a chain link fence.

1451
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,360
There's the, luckily someone tore a hole in it.

1452
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,660
So I'm able to, so I'm able to dive through.

1453
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,260
This is like the fucking odyssey.

1454
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,060
When does it end?

1455
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,900
I have to ask a guy, like a mailman.

1456
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,940
I'm like, hey, do you know where the Aldi is?

1457
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,300
And he like looks up on his phone.

1458
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,380
He's like, yeah, it's that way.

1459
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,260
So then I'm like, okay.

1460
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:24,620
So I go and, and, and I find the Aldi.

1461
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,340
Okay, great.

1462
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,380
It's closed.

1463
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,700
It doesn't, it's temporary closed for repairs.

1464
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,500
So I have to go to the stop and shop instead.

1465
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,740
You should have looked for that wise man.

1466
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,880
Which turns out is the stop and shop that this guy was telling me

1467
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,560
about, which is right next to the Aldi I was trying to get to.

1468
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,240
I should have just taken his advice and followed his directions.

1469
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,320
It would have got me there.

1470
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,240
So I fucked it all up.

1471
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,200
Um, so I do my shopping, right?

1472
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,000
I buy my heavy cream, cheapest you can find anywhere.

1473
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:52,640
Except Aldi.

1474
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,480
Mushrooms.

1475
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,220
Oh, that's right.

1476
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,280
No, it was a terrible deal.

1477
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,720
It actually was a terrible deal because I got from stop and shop.

1478
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,160
So I get my shit and I go and I walk and I feel like again, I

1479
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,660
missed the bus stop and I have to walk around several blocks to

1480
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,500
find the place I was looking for.

1481
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,820
I sit down, I'm waiting for the bus.

1482
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,780
And then, and, and who do I see?

1483
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,060
Right?

1484
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:18,900
Who do I see coming down the street, but some, but some young thug, right?

1485
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:26,420
Some like criminal, some thought criminal, wearing a Trump make America

1486
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,100
great again shirt.

1487
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,460
So I pull out my stiletto, my blade and I slip it between his ribs and I

1488
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,040
make like a quick sideways cut.

1489
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:33,560
No.

1490
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,080
So I have, I'm, I'm wearing my, I'm wearing my yang shirt.

1491
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,880
I just have, I'm wearing, I'm wearing my yang shirt.

1492
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,160
And I'm like, I'm going to kill this guy.

1493
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,600
I'm going to kill this guy with, with facts and logic.

1494
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:49,240
So he's walking by this is he, he gets close and he's like, um, he's like a

1495
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,200
teenager, he's like an Asian kid.

1496
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,560
He might have been like, could have been 18, could have been like 15.

1497
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,800
I don't know, high school college.

1498
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:00,000
And I'm just, so I just kind of turn to him and I just kind of grab my shirt at

1499
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,820
the corner and I just kind of like sort of like, you know, you know, you can

1500
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,980
kind of like tug it up a little, just sort of like, I basically just kind of

1501
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,460
like make a gesture that it like draw his eyes to like the logo on my shirt.

1502
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:13,740
And I just look at it and I like, uh, uh, uh, and he looks at me.

1503
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,500
He's on his phone.

1504
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:18,940
He looks at me and he says like something in Chinese and I'm like, um,

1505
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,740
uh, I sent all you people back.

1506
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,860
What's going on here?

1507
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,180
And now I don't know what to say.

1508
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:32,400
I'm like, uh, uh, Yang, like, cause like you're, you're wearing a, and he's

1509
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,680
like, cause like you're, you're wearing, and then, and then the bus that I'm

1510
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,480
waiting for starts to pull up and, and he's like just staring at me and I'm

1511
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:43,800
like left, I have like a moment, I have but a moment to explain what I was

1512
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,840
trying to do.

1513
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:49,720
And I'm like, and I'm just like, cause you know, our shirts got two different

1514
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,080
guys and he's like in like a super thick accent.

1515
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,260
He's like, oh, oh, and I'm like, all right.

1516
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,860
What, what, I got, I got to take this.

1517
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,820
He was like, oh, okay.

1518
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:04,900
Or something and I'm like, and I'm like, I got to take this bus.

1519
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,860
I'll see you later.

1520
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,140
See you at the ballot.

1521
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,860
And I made a great friend that day, an ally for life.

1522
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:12,700
Right.

1523
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:17,260
So having, having owned the Cuck servitors jumped on the bus and headed home.

1524
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:17,900
Victoria.

1525
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:23,060
I don't, I wonder if he even knew like, I mean, surely he knew.

1526
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:27,140
And this is like exactly the story of the like, that meme of like the two guys

1527
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,220
walking by each other.

1528
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,620
Once is like, howdy.

1529
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:33,580
The other guy like cries to himself and then he like goes back home and blogs

1530
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:37,900
about how he owned the libtard or whatever, uh, you know, in that, in that exchange.

1531
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:42,740
He's just like, just be muddled by your attempted communication.

1532
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:47,100
And then here you are claiming victory, the moral victory, if nothing else.

1533
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,380
I, I, I, he went home.

1534
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,040
Yeah, I'm sure he had a long hard think that night about what he really

1535
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,080
believes and what his priorities are.

1536
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:55,760
I've no doubt.

1537
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,480
I've no doubt.

1538
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,240
And what really makes a great nation when you really get right down to it.

1539
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,080
Yeah.

1540
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,480
So that was my adventure.

1541
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,040
Fascinating.

1542
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:10,120
Um, yeah, uh, anyone else, you know, I'm just, I'm just going to say, I've

1543
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,480
heard that Chinese people, uh, uh, have a hive mind.

1544
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,520
And I think that your attempt to convert one of the drones was unsuccessful in

1545
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:21,140
this particular exchange, but also explains, you know, why, why he was

1546
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,020
unable to communicate.

1547
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,100
The queen wasn't there.

1548
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,180
This is my, this is my understanding.

1549
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:30,260
I mean, I wonder, I mean, I wonder what, just, you know, I wondered like, why

1550
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,580
was he wearing that Trump shirt?

1551
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:32,660
Does he know what it is?

1552
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,620
He probably knows that it's a Trump shirt.

1553
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,380
Like he's probably knows like, here's the theory.

1554
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,220
Here's just a theory.

1555
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:42,380
Maybe he's wearing it not because he like loves Trump, but because like, maybe

1556
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,100
he just acquired it in some way and that is just like the president.

1557
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:49,640
And so maybe, maybe he, maybe he just, maybe he just had the shirt, right?

1558
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,440
Maybe his parents like Trump or something and he just had this shirt.

1559
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,080
Maybe he does know what it is and he sincerely likes him.

1560
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,960
Maybe he like thinks it's funny.

1561
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,120
Maybe it's hard to say.

1562
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,760
Maybe he's like a big memester.

1563
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,920
Um, but I think it's highly likely that he probably didn't recognize my

1564
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,600
vaporwave Yang logo.

1565
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,880
Probably, probably.

1566
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,600
Um, cause I, you know, it's that, it's that sunset, not pulling too

1567
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,960
well these days, uh, I mean, this is a kid.

1568
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,020
He's probably not that politically engaged as well as like, his English,

1569
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:22,620
his, I mean, maybe his English is better than I, he would have led up.

1570
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,380
Then he led on in his like one and a half words that he said to me.

1571
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:26,300
Right.

1572
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:32,100
Um, but you know, just really, really makes you think, really makes you think

1573
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,460
about what's going on in the world.

1574
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,540
This is a power of political discourse.

1575
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,080
Ladies and gentlemen, there's always, you know, I just think that there's a

1576
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,540
lot of things going on in the world.

1577
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:43,860
Like there's always something going on and like, you know, world leaders are

1578
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,160
real, they're, they're keyed into it.

1579
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,000
Like they're always paying attention to like what's going on in the world.

1580
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,680
And this is something that went on in the world.

1581
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,920
Certainly went on.

1582
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,400
It qualifies for that.

1583
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,360
And not much else, but yeah.

1584
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,320
That's right.

1585
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:03,560
Ben, uh, there is an Aldi near my, my house, uh, that Munchie visited.

1586
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,280
Yeah.

1587
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:11,480
Um, and he was bemused to find a, an Aldi specific, uh, energy drink called Dark

1588
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,000
Thunder.

1589
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,200
Oh, was that it?

1590
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,620
Was that at your place?

1591
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,300
Was that a, he was an, okay.

1592
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,140
He told me about that.

1593
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,620
He told me about Dark Thunder.

1594
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,300
And okay.

1595
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,620
So I wonder, right?

1596
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:27,820
Cause the thing about Aldi is that Aldi is one company that branched off of a,

1597
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,940
a parent company that split into two.

1598
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,820
And in Europe, they're like Aldi East and Aldi West.

1599
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:37,980
But in America, like I, I might be getting this little messed up, but like in Europe,

1600
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:42,340
they're like Aldi East, Aldi West in America, like Aldi East is just Aldi and

1601
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:45,840
Aldi West is drum roll, Trader Joe's.

1602
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:46,480
What?

1603
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,440
Like, like, yes, that's true.

1604
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,160
Trader Joe's related to Aldi?

1605
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,200
They, yeah, they are split off from the same parent company.

1606
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,840
But they're nothing alike at all.

1607
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,320
That's why they split.

1608
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,680
They had a fundamental philosophical difference and they couldn't reconcile it.

1609
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,520
They couldn't reconcile.

1610
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,320
I think it's like two brothers that founded the company and like,

1611
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,520
that's interesting.

1612
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,440
Yeah.

1613
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,480
And, um, yeah.

1614
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,400
So, you know, and like one of them, you know, one of them, one of them,

1615
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:14,180
one brother leaned left and the other leaned right and they couldn't reconcile

1616
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:16,940
the differences, which is what I don't know the difference and ended in a boy.

1617
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,060
Sound familiar Nate.

1618
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,660
Sound like a tail is all this time.

1619
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:20,740
Indeed.

1620
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,740
Only my, yeah, fair enough.

1621
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:24,460
Yeah.

1622
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:28,780
So, you know, which one, which one of you is Trader Joe's left or I don't know

1623
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,300
the difference between the, like, which is which, I don't know.

1624
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,300
But okay, fine.

1625
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:34,900
I don't know the difference.

1626
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,660
More like Trader Joe, more like, yes.

1627
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,420
Okay.

1628
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,740
But now I wonder, okay.

1629
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,960
This is your story has some holes in it.

1630
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,960
According to wikipedia, I was thinking, okay, my details don't matter.

1631
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,240
Right.

1632
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:52,800
Um, so I was, so I was going, if, if the Aldi had been open, I would have gone

1633
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,920
in there and immediately looked for dark thunder, but it didn't get the chance.

1634
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,280
But now I wonder, hmm, if this was at a European Aldi, maybe then, if this

1635
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,520
Aldi doesn't have it, maybe if I went to a Trader Joe's, they would have dark

1636
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:03,960
thunder.

1637
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,960
So that'll be my next intricate web.

1638
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,240
Yeah.

1639
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:06,600
It might be.

1640
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:06,800
Yeah.

1641
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,320
It might be.

1642
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,120
Yeah.

1643
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,200
Keep us posted.

1644
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:09,980
I mean, I'm in it.

1645
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:10,540
I'm in it.

1646
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,300
What are the holes in my story?

1647
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:18,740
Uh, well, that Trader Joe's was originally a Californian grocery store that

1648
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,740
opened in 1967 in 79.

1649
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:28,900
It was bought by Theo Albrecht, who owns Aldi North until his death in 2010 when

1650
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,780
the ownership passed to his heirs.

1651
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:37,060
Um, maybe those heirs were the two brothers that like split us.

1652
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:41,920
There are two, the two brothers do own the two different Aldi's.

1653
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:47,520
Like it was founded by a pair of brothers and they did split it into Aldi

1654
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:53,320
Nord and Aldi Sood, but the guy who owns Aldi Nord just happens to also have

1655
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,480
owned Trader Joe's, but it's not that it's the same.

1656
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,800
That's enough of that.

1657
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,160
Okay.

1658
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:05,720
You guys have little, uh, little in America, little LIDL.

1659
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,840
It's a very similar Europe.

1660
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,300
No, no.

1661
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,100
Wait, it's, it's basically the same as Aldi, but, uh, spelled slightly differently.

1662
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,940
We have BJs.

1663
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,140
We have BJs and that's sick.

1664
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,060
I walked by.

1665
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:19,340
Okay.

1666
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:24,220
So as I was, as I went after I went under the chain link fence, uh, to get to Aldi

1667
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:29,780
or Sopin Shop or whatever, I walked by none other than an ocean state job lot.

1668
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,180
Oh yeah.

1669
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:30,340
Right.

1670
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,700
But the thing about this ocean state job, it was completely boarded up and I

1671
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,820
shit you not, right?

1672
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:35,360
Okay.

1673
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,000
Imagine an open state job lot.

1674
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,040
Like, you know what they look like?

1675
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,080
Like they got a big front wall and there's like a big, like sort of opening with

1676
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:47,240
like what I probably like some fucking, uh, automatic doors, right?

1677
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,480
Some sliding automatic doors.

1678
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:52,400
You can imagine the entrance way to an open ocean state job lot.

1679
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,720
This one, it was like, it was a brick wall.

1680
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:01,520
Like there was no, there was no recession, just the entire thing that would have

1681
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,620
been like the entrance way leading to the sliding automatic doors that would

1682
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,780
enter into the store had been entirely covered.

1683
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,460
Someone had just brick and mortared over them into a solid brick wall.

1684
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,940
Dude, that is a basic bitch Minecraft build.

1685
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:15,460
You have to switch up your blocks.

1686
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,260
You can't just be using bricks like that.

1687
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:20,900
I mean, it would have been, probably would have been more energy efficient.

1688
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:21,660
Just use crap.

1689
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:22,940
Indeed.

1690
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,260
Well, cobblestone.

1691
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,940
Ben, I'm reading about Aldi and I want to know how you feel about the fact that

1692
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:33,120
while Aldi is the cheapest grocery store with the best prices, the guy, Carl

1693
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:39,200
Albrecht, who, who owns, uh, Aldi sued is the richest man in Germany and the 21st

1694
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:44,400
richest man in the world while the brother was the 31st richest man before he died.

1695
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,760
Um, well, hey, what can you do?

1696
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,640
I mean, we all use Amazon.

1697
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah.

1698
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,600
You know, it's, it's bad, but there's no such thing.

1699
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:58,100
There's no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism.

1700
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:00,540
So, you know, it's damned if you do, damned if you don't.

1701
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,380
Fair enough.

1702
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:06,220
Um, and they're just, I mean, that had the deals on the heavy cream.

1703
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:07,620
Forget about it.

1704
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:11,140
It's like, it's like, it's like a dime less per tablespoon.

1705
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:12,940
That's not true.

1706
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,180
That's an exaggeration.

1707
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:20,260
Um, one might say that the low, low prices are able to be so low because of the

1708
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,260
strengths of the competitive market.

1709
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:23,580
Any thoughts?

1710
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,040
Um, I mean, it's a little reductive.

1711
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:35,320
I mean, probably, how can you, I mean, you could say that, I mean, but this,

1712
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:40,520
this is a, this company was formed in the, the, you know, the market.

1713
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:40,960
Yeah.

1714
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,160
So like, it's the way it, yeah, it's the way it is.

1715
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:48,640
I mean, you, you could say that about any company, like any company, however good

1716
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,920
or bad, whatever strengths or weaknesses it has, you could attribute those things

1717
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:54,500
to, you know, the competitive market.

1718
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,660
Remember when Nate was like, I don't want to do politics on the show.

1719
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:03,740
I get to say, I say, I say one thing, I just make one mild point.

1720
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:04,780
Give me a fucking break.

1721
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:11,180
One wild point that is a question that has huge ramifications.

1722
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:13,300
It could lead to a massive discussion.

1723
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,660
I know, I know.

1724
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:19,900
But then I wonder, is it best to just, you know, let everything go unchallenged?

1725
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,660
I guess.

1726
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,160
What do you mean unchallenged?

1727
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:22,800
That's what I do.

1728
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,000
I mean, I fundamentally disagree with much of what you just said, but I guess I

1729
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,760
just won't say anything because I, I don't want to argue about it.

1730
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:34,120
Well, well, Nate, well, if your goal is to not talk about politics, then I would

1731
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,960
say that that is the only thing you can do, um, in pursuit of that goal.

1732
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:39,480
I guess.

1733
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,480
I mean, what are your, what are your priorities?

1734
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,960
Well, but what's to be done when one hears political discussion that they

1735
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,160
disagree with, but they also don't want to talk about politics.

1736
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:48,560
Do what I do.

1737
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,920
There's no way to win.

1738
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,180
I just ignore it.

1739
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:56,140
If I, if I contended every single thing I disagreed with on this podcast, there

1740
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:00,300
would be nothing, but that it would, you know, do your right.

1741
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,260
You're better than that.

1742
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,420
You're better than me at that.

1743
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,380
Absolutely true.

1744
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:04,740
I need to get on your level.

1745
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,100
Well, I also just feel that way all the time about every interaction I have with

1746
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:08,620
anybody.

1747
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:12,100
It's like, if I stopped this to nitpick everything they said, I would, there

1748
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:12,820
would be no end.

1749
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:14,260
This is all that we would be doing.

1750
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,220
I do that a lot.

1751
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,260
And I want to stop.

1752
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,060
I want to not do it anymore.

1753
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,500
This is a personal issue.

1754
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,240
I'll work on it.

1755
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,040
You're right, guys.

1756
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,480
You're right.

1757
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,840
Do we want, do we want to transition topics?

1758
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,200
How about to voice mail?

1759
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,000
Well, I have one.

1760
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,280
Okay.

1761
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,800
Well, kind of, I don't know how much we want to talk about this, but

1762
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,000
speaking of politics, kind of, not really.

1763
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,320
I was just going to say that I fell down the, the destiny well and I watched

1764
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,960
like a million destiny debates.

1765
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,760
Oh no.

1766
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,360
I, I really, he's, he's good.

1767
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,480
I think he's really good.

1768
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,840
And I don't agree with him on a lot of things, but boy, I sure do hate a lot

1769
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,660
more people now.

1770
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:50,980
I've got, I've got a juicy one.

1771
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,260
This isn't really, this isn't political.

1772
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:55,300
This is, I suppose, a cultural issue, but it's one thing I see destiny get

1773
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,060
attacked for all the time and I could not be more with him on this subject.

1774
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:04,460
And it is that everyone shits on destiny for being ostensibly in the

1775
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:12,220
sense that he has no moral objection to the consensual adult incest.

1776
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:17,540
And I listen to the video, I listen to the video where he debates that the guy

1777
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,160
he's debating it with is so stupid.

1778
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:24,400
Nobody, no one has ever raised to me why it's like morally, like, yeah, okay.

1779
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,080
This is not, okay.

1780
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:29,560
If you're looking for like a really robust argument for why it's not wrong,

1781
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,640
you're not going to find it here because the guy he's debating, it's incapable.

1782
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,800
He's barely even capable of stringing a sentence.

1783
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,800
He will literally say a thing.

1784
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,560
Destiny will quote it back to him word for word and say, is that what you're

1785
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:40,840
saying?

1786
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,520
And he'll say, no, I didn't say that.

1787
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,000
And he does it over and over and over.

1788
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,320
I don't know about any specific, I don't even, I don't think I watch

1789
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,460
any specific video, but I see this come up a lot.

1790
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:53,460
That specific video is really frustrating, but it's also really just okay.

1791
01:34:53,460 --> 01:35:00,940
People cannot understand the concept of like, of like, he can't, he cannot understand

1792
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:05,780
like the, the process by which an argument is made people have so much trouble with

1793
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,940
this issue and they, whatever they get all mixed up.

1794
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:12,060
Let me just state my case because I think, I mean, Destiny, we're totally in

1795
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:17,140
agreement on this does involving yourself in incest in my humble opinion.

1796
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,380
Like pretty much fuck up your family life in a major way permanently.

1797
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,540
Absolutely.

1798
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,460
Absolutely.

1799
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:28,740
That being said, does a person who's an adult have a right to fuck whoever they

1800
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:30,100
want or not?

1801
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,860
I say yes.

1802
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,140
Therefore it's not my business.

1803
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:38,420
Whether people choose to engage in consensual adult insight.

1804
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:43,620
I have no moral objection to it and I cannot find any reason to what people

1805
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,080
who say, but people get so on his case about this, like it makes him like a fucking

1806
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:49,920
idiot.

1807
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,240
Is this a contentious issue?

1808
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,520
I feel like probably people are just trying to mess with.

1809
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,600
Yeah, it seems like it to me.

1810
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,440
I see people use this like it's kind of like the way people just throw it.

1811
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,840
Pito, they say that like, Oh, Destiny is like pro incest for, you know, I could

1812
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,680
imagine, I could imagine that people are just scorned by the fact that Destiny is

1813
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:11,360
really annoying and so anything they could potentially do to attack him.

1814
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,780
Destiny, extremely annoying, much of the time, nonetheless.

1815
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,980
I don't understand why people find him annoying.

1816
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,540
I really, I really don't get it.

1817
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,780
Yeah, I really don't get it.

1818
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:26,700
The, the reason they find him annoying is that, Hey, the constant just barrage of

1819
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:32,380
insults that he throws at people, he doesn't really really, he will, he will slip

1820
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:37,020
some in like if someone, if the person he's arguing with slipping them in is being

1821
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:41,220
like really, really, I find him very patronizing to listen to.

1822
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,120
To the people he's to be extremely patronizing.

1823
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:48,960
He also constantly recontextualize what you're saying and, and like just changes

1824
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:49,160
it.

1825
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,960
He changes what you're saying into something else on the fly constantly.

1826
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,400
I don't, I don't agree with that.

1827
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,680
Did you watch our debate?

1828
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,280
Yeah.

1829
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:02,720
You didn't feel that he was literally proving my point as we were arguing.

1830
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,760
You're retarded.

1831
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,160
You are fucking retarded.

1832
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:05,920
I'm sorry.

1833
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,320
Did you?

1834
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,360
Not that I don't already think so, but you're fucking retarded.

1835
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:15,340
I don't think most people think that you came out on top in that particular debate.

1836
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:15,700
And you know what?

1837
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:19,860
Most people are stupid and they didn't understand the point of the debate because

1838
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:22,460
he changed it to be about something else.

1839
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,260
The thing, the thing.

1840
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:28,620
Well, yeah, I thought that the whole point of the debate and what it turned

1841
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:34,220
into was like, it was sort of, I didn't understand why it needed, like, I know you

1842
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,740
like, you went on there to talk about dick.

1843
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,860
No, I did not.

1844
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:37,940
That's the whole point.

1845
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,480
He made it that way.

1846
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,560
It was not about dick at all.

1847
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,560
The, okay.

1848
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:42,960
Hang on.

1849
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,000
What can you, can you state the point of the debate then?

1850
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,320
Yes.

1851
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:46,040
So I understand.

1852
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:46,360
Okay.

1853
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:51,920
What happened was that I had made a video criticizing the debate he had with dick

1854
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:57,120
where I said that I thought dick was correct in, cause dick's argument had been

1855
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,840
you put words in people's mouths and you argue like an asshole.

1856
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:05,800
Destiny continually deflected this and made the conversation about all this other shit.

1857
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:10,660
And he put dick in a position where he's arguing with him about like stuff that

1858
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:13,660
destiny has clearly done a lot of research and has very particular points

1859
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:18,020
about and forcing him into an argument he wasn't prepared for cause he's not

1860
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:21,620
showing up to argue about this, which is proving the point.

1861
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:23,580
Dick had no fucking idea what he was talking about.

1862
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,180
It doesn't matter because that's not what the point was.

1863
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:30,460
The point of the argument was just that destiny argues like an asshole and

1864
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:33,060
makes it about other things, which is what he did.

1865
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,660
What kind of an argument, what kind of an argument is that?

1866
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,560
Do you even have like, what do you mean?

1867
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,400
The argument is that he argues like an asshole and that's the whole fucking point.

1868
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:47,520
What's the point of going on his show to debate him about whether or not

1869
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,920
who cares what the point is?

1870
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,040
Who cares what the point is?

1871
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,080
That's what the argument was.

1872
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,560
The argument is you argue like an ass and you make the conversation about other

1873
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,280
things, you constantly divert what the person's saying and you put words

1874
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:03,160
in people's mouths and that's exactly what he did.

1875
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:09,460
So I accused him of the same thing and then on Twitter, he, he wanted to

1876
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:12,860
bring me on the show and he wanted to argue with me about Dick.

1877
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,980
I told him, I'm not interested in having that argument.

1878
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:21,500
However, I will argue with you that you put words in people's mouths on

1879
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:25,980
the basis of this tweet where you did exactly that, where he took what I had

1880
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:31,020
said and he reframed it in a way that was not at all what I was trying to say.

1881
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,440
And so I said, let's argue about this tweet.

1882
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,560
So I went on his show to argue about that tweet.

1883
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,080
What was the tweet?

1884
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:38,880
I don't fucking remember.

1885
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,880
This is ages ago, but it was that I had said something where I chose my

1886
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:48,120
words very carefully and he found an interpretation of it that was not what I meant.

1887
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,960
Look, I do think that as a man who debates a lot, my biggest criticism, and

1888
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,440
this is a common thread for me, I say it all the time, is I find Destiny, he

1889
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:00,840
engages in the kind of debate that is kind of like, who can win with

1890
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:03,620
the information that you bring to the table and look, that's fine.

1891
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,500
I don't, I don't care.

1892
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,980
But I do wait, wait, wait, wait, it's the kind of, it's the kind of debate.

1893
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:08,500
Yes.

1894
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:13,060
Where like he's trying to triumph over the other person in that particular debate.

1895
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:14,260
And like, I get it.

1896
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:19,100
What I like is when people try to be as charitable as possible to the other

1897
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,220
person, and he definitely does not do that.

1898
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,500
No, he tries to opposite.

1899
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:23,660
He tries to find.

1900
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:29,340
He makes your argument into the worst version of it that it could be.

1901
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,700
And most people don't catch it.

1902
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:35,780
Like he'll say, you say something, he doesn't mean he's factually wrong.

1903
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:37,420
It's just the particular lens.

1904
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:39,220
Well, it can mean that he's factually wrong.

1905
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:43,380
Like when in the case of my tweets, he literally reframed it as something that

1906
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:44,900
was not what I was saying.

1907
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:49,820
Like I said one particular thing and I only meant what I was saying.

1908
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:55,500
He responded by extrapolating from that something that he wants me to be saying

1909
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:56,940
and said it back.

1910
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:58,220
And I said, that's not what I said.

1911
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,600
That's just literally not what I was saying.

1912
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,400
You have just reframed it into something else.

1913
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:08,400
And so I went on the show to argue just that point.

1914
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,720
And in service of arguing that point, he was trying to break down the exact

1915
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:18,200
semantics of what the words I said could potentially mean, what

1916
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:21,800
interpretations there could possibly be of those words.

1917
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:27,040
And to say that, oh, it's, it's, I'm not misrepresenting you if it could

1918
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,420
potentially mean this.

1919
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:32,580
And in order to do that, we had to get down to the bedrock of what each of us

1920
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:35,060
thinks winning a debate means.

1921
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:40,220
And because we had a disagreement about that, then, you know, basically

1922
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:45,540
in order for me to prove that he was misrepresenting me, I had to present

1923
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:48,820
that winning a debate can mean more than one thing.

1924
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,500
And he disagreed with that.

1925
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:53,900
And a lot of people disagreed with my idea of what winning a debate could

1926
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,120
mean, but that had nothing to do with the argument I came there for.

1927
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,440
I came there just to say that he's putting words in my mouth, which he was

1928
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:06,600
doing demonstrably, but the debate becomes about something else because of

1929
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:11,920
him using exactly the tactics I'm talking about, which is to divert the

1930
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,600
conversation to be about something else.

1931
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,200
Ever watch Thank You for Smoking, because the whole point of Thank You

1932
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:22,920
for Smoking is that the idea is to win debates by framing things the way

1933
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,060
that you want them to be presented.

1934
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:27,060
Because when people are right about the facts, you've got to change the

1935
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,380
conversation to something that you can win.

1936
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:34,380
And I think that's basically pro-debate, and it's so obvious what he's doing

1937
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:39,900
because he will constantly drill down through anything you say until you

1938
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,180
call him out on something he can't respond to, and he immediately changes

1939
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:46,740
the subject, like he'll instantly make it about something else.

1940
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:48,140
He'll ask you a different question.

1941
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,580
He won't, he'll divert.

1942
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:52,740
And it's like, when you see it happening, you just go, Oh, okay.

1943
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:54,760
So you're a piece of shit and you're not worth talking to.

1944
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,480
Like that's, Oh, I get it.

1945
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:00,760
Like you just want to, you just want to be able to say you want an argument.

1946
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,920
You don't actually care about having a conversation.

1947
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,280
I mean, that seems to be the currency he travels in.

1948
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,280
I find, I mean, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to open myself up to criticism.

1949
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:10,840
I don't know.

1950
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:13,840
I don't know what the like popular take on destiny is.

1951
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,480
Um, my, uh, I like him.

1952
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:19,600
I think his arguments are generally pretty good.

1953
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:24,300
And I feel like what he's mostly doing is taking another person's argument

1954
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,820
and just like poking holes in it and like dismantling it and like showing

1955
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:31,380
how it doesn't, a lot of the people who destiny argues with are retarded.

1956
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:35,860
And so yes, he's going to come off as just being right most of the time

1957
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,900
because he's arguing with fucking retarded people.

1958
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,540
Like he's arguing with people who are just wrong about, who don't have

1959
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:45,460
any facts whose, whose position is completely unsubstantiated, who really

1960
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,780
don't know how to argue and he's blowing those people out of the water.

1961
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,080
And that's obviously going to happen.

1962
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,600
And the reason he's got popularity is because of when he blew out John

1963
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,640
Tron, who I was going to say sounded like a fucking idiot because he didn't

1964
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,760
know what he was talking about.

1965
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:05,400
And like, um, people want, I mean, people want, they want it from destiny

1966
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,760
because they want to be able to talk about how he bodied this celebrity, how

1967
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,440
he's, oh, he's, he's fucking taken names.

1968
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,040
He's, you know, he's taken people to task and like, yes, if you agree

1969
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:18,940
with his politics in general, it's going to be gratifying to watch him

1970
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,220
make a bunch of dumb people look even dumber.

1971
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:27,620
But like the tactics he's using for that are just inherently obnoxious and

1972
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,060
faulty.

1973
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:31,220
And it's like, I don't care to watch somebody beat up on dumb people.

1974
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:34,120
Like I probably agree with destiny on most things he believes because

1975
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:38,420
he's pretty well researched, like he's trying to be correct.

1976
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:42,780
But like he also says things like, um, you know, I think conservatives

1977
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,120
are such a problem that I would endorse violence against them.

1978
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,640
And it's just like, okay, well, now you're, now you're fucking crazy.

1979
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:53,400
You know, that's, that's really not, that's really un-nuanced.

1980
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:58,120
I mean, when he literally said that, he said, I would support political or

1981
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,160
actual violence.

1982
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,160
Well, there are, yeah.

1983
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,240
Well, there are arguments for violence sometimes.

1984
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:02,880
I disagree.

1985
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:04,480
Ever.

1986
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,360
Not, well, not necessarily never, but he was literally just talking about, I

1987
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:12,680
think that conservatives are just such a problem that we should have violence

1988
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,420
against them.

1989
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:17,380
Like there was no, there was no circumstance he was describing it under.

1990
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:21,580
He just said, I mean, if you, yeah, there are some, sometimes it's appropriate.

1991
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:26,060
That's ridiculous to, to make, that's ridiculous to frame as what he was saying.

1992
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,780
Well, I, all right.

1993
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,860
Well, I mean, I'd have to hear the quote.

1994
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,140
It's pretty damning the way he said it.

1995
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,780
I mean, look, even if he literally said that he is a live streamer who streams

1996
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:41,220
24, like would he today, like agree even with the words that he said at that time?

1997
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:45,160
I mean, that's the sort of thing that, you know, sure, at the time, maybe he

1998
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:49,680
said something bad, but does he even to, like, that's why you should ask people.

1999
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,080
Okay.

2000
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,720
You said this.

2001
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,160
Do you still agree with this personality is toxic.

2002
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:58,080
It's that he himself is about being an asshole to people.

2003
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,480
I mean, he would agree with that.

2004
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,120
I think it's pretty funny because like he's, it's funny to listen to people who

2005
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:06,400
knew about him before he became like a famous debater, because apparently he

2006
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:10,280
was basically driven out of the Starcraft community for just being a piece of

2007
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:14,260
shit, like people just I can see why he would have trouble in like team sports

2008
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:18,380
and whatnot, because he was like, he was like a pro Starcraft player.

2009
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:19,300
But he didn't last long.

2010
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:20,500
He wasn't wasn't very good.

2011
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,820
And also everybody hated him.

2012
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:27,540
But, but I was I was going to say this this morning, I did finally get around

2013
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,940
to listening to the John Tron one.

2014
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:31,660
I'd never I'd never heard it before.

2015
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:32,980
Have you guys heard it?

2016
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:39,380
Oh, I heard a bit that I was like, it is fucking rough.

2017
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,960
It is a fucking sh yikes.

2018
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,600
It is.

2019
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,800
It is kind of a dude is fucking.

2020
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,840
It kind of comes off as a white nationalist.

2021
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,880
Yeah, a bit.

2022
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,800
I mean, he had, I mean, look, if someone presented you facts that you thought

2023
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:01,280
advocate or that, you know, that that showed the racial demographic skew in a

2024
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,960
certain way and like, and you just thought they were true.

2025
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,960
I haven't listened to the whole thing.

2026
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,440
So I don't really know what else you said.

2027
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:09,360
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, there's there's the facts, right?

2028
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:11,920
And then there's the the way you argue them, right?

2029
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:18,240
Like, like, I mean, some things he said are just factually untrue, like that he

2030
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:22,520
said that, you know, like rich black people commit more crime than poor white

2031
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,640
people. That's the one thing that I know, he said in the in the discussion.

2032
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:30,560
There's that there's if that was true, then like fair enough, but if it's not

2033
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:35,080
true, OK, I mean, if that were a fact, it would be a remarkable thing.

2034
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,440
That would be really be cause for like what's going on here.

2035
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,660
Absolutely. It's made up.

2036
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,900
And then and then there's a part there's a part where he draws.

2037
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:47,340
He's like, oh, yeah, crime rates among black people are really high in America.

2038
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,580
Oh, you're you're trying to say that's just because of socioeconomic reasons.

2039
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,660
Well, look at the crime in Africa.

2040
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:59,860
And it's like, I mean, what's what's that supposed to make a racial point there?

2041
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:03,260
Right. I mean, I don't what is that is the crime rate bad in Africa?

2042
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,940
I don't actually know what the what that is implying.

2043
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,640
I mean, I don't know either.

2044
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:12,840
But like, even if it were high, yeah, what would be what would be the take?

2045
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,640
I don't think there's anything there that would be more of like a poverty thing.

2046
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,080
There's there are a couple other things.

2047
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,880
But like, oh, there's OK.

2048
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,680
There's one part where he talks about global elites, but like I'm going to give

2049
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:27,480
him that I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on that and assume

2050
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:29,480
that he wasn't thinking like Jews.

2051
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,200
He was just thinking like super rich people.

2052
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,700
Although he brings it he just kind of throws this like global elites term

2053
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:39,020
out there at like a weird moment as he says.

2054
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:42,260
And this one I'm going to kind of just assume is weird wording, too.

2055
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:45,660
There's a part where he talks about like, like it wouldn't.

2056
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:50,260
He said, like he just asked him, like, would it be what do you be OK

2057
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:55,100
with like a hundred million, like Mexicans, like suddenly emigrating

2058
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:58,700
to the United States all at once, assuming they all like perfectly integrated

2059
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,420
into our culture, like perfectly.

2060
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:04,080
And John Tron has he goes like, yeah, I guess that would be OK.

2061
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,380
Just it doesn't usually happen like that.

2062
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:10,320
Usually they have to like they come in slowly over a long period of time

2063
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,840
and integrate into the gene pool.

2064
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,680
And it's like I'm sorry.

2065
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,840
It was like just kind of they'll they'll mix in with the white people

2066
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,280
and like they'll they'll become white.

2067
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,720
I don't know. That was I don't know.

2068
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:25,880
I mean, I don't know. People people are weird about this.

2069
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:30,120
But like a Mexican culture is not identical to American culture.

2070
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:33,780
If you like American culture and don't want it to just disappear,

2071
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:38,380
it's not crazy to be like, no, I like things about it's just a phrasing of gene pool

2072
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:43,340
that is like, hmm, you know, like, are we concerned about their genes

2073
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:45,020
or just their culture?

2074
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:49,020
I don't I don't necessarily want to have a destiny versus John Tron debate

2075
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:53,220
right now, but like me, maybe American American culture, right?

2076
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:56,740
Like people that move to the United States, they become Americans.

2077
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:59,380
Like, I mean, are we going to act like

2078
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:03,800
American culture is just purely, you know, doesn't because it does exist.

2079
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:07,040
It's definitely real and it's not identical to outside countries.

2080
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:11,440
Well, sure. But like no culture nowhere is culture

2081
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,680
identical to culture anywhere else and cultures shift.

2082
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:20,440
And you know, America culture has been I don't see it's whole existence.

2083
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:23,080
I I generally don't.

2084
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:27,440
I don't I mean, I I understand the the emotional reasoning

2085
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,940
for like caring about the culture you can't you grew up in or whatever.

2086
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:34,800
But like preserving culture is not that important.

2087
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:39,440
Like in Mayan culture is completely gone.

2088
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,000
We just have a bunch of ruins.

2089
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,640
It's and if Mayans were around today, they might be bummed about that.

2090
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:49,000
The introduction of the introduction of like new people into an area

2091
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,500
doesn't like erase the culture that exists. But it changes it.

2092
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:57,200
Well, all right, I'm just going to take the culture always changes.

2093
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,420
That doesn't make an extreme example.

2094
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:01,620
It doesn't matter if you like the way something is.

2095
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,620
Why would you want it to change?

2096
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,660
Well, it will change no matter what for white add to that.

2097
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,820
If you like how it is now.

2098
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,220
Well, you can't avoid it.

2099
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:12,720
But you cannot do it as fast as possible.

2100
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,320
You can do it slower than that.

2101
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,360
Well, but why?

2102
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,760
Because you like how things are. That's it.

2103
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:24,620
No, no, Nate, like people who like the way things are don't decide to change it.

2104
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:27,920
It's just that things change around them and they have to change with it.

2105
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:32,380
Otherwise, they have to cordon themselves off and build wars and all that

2106
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:36,440
and and and segregate themselves from from everyone else.

2107
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,320
But I mean, but this is this is the question.

2108
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:42,980
It's this idea of magically adding a hundred million Mexicans to the American population.

2109
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,780
Like if I don't know, like, what would happen in this example?

2110
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:49,980
If like, are am I going to genocide those people if they don't come in?

2111
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,780
I mean, maybe then that'd be different.

2112
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,580
But wait, what are you talking about?

2113
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:56,420
The example that you said, like in the discussion where they said, like,

2114
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:59,080
would you just like assuming that they integrated perfectly?

2115
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:03,260
Would you accept, you know, a hundred million Mexican immigrants just into American culture?

2116
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,920
I mean, that would affect so many different things that who can say, like, let's say.

2117
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,560
Well, no, well, no, because like the the question is like,

2118
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:14,200
what if they just integrated perfectly into existence?

2119
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:17,640
So they're not like a Mexican culture, they're American culture

2120
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:20,040
just with the genes of Mexican people.

2121
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,600
Is that the question? Well, yeah.

2122
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:22,680
That's what he was trying to say.

2123
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,440
Like that there will be a lot more.

2124
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,940
So it's a purely racial question, not about culture.

2125
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:30,180
Right. That's why John Sean Spencer came off as so weird

2126
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:33,720
that he's talking about the entering the gene pool as if that matters.

2127
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:36,760
Like, it's like he's he's not saying, oh, it's the culture.

2128
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:37,560
That's the problem.

2129
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,720
He's implying that just having the genetics is the problem,

2130
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,000
which is what makes it racist, you know?

2131
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,960
Yeah, I don't know.

2132
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,120
Do we know everything about every racial group?

2133
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,960
They're not identical.

2134
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,500
They're pretty close.

2135
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,300
I agree.

2136
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,360
Nate, just because they're not identical, it's it's if you are not

2137
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:57,100
OK with one of them, that is what racism is.

2138
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:00,160
Like it doesn't matter that it like the fact that you're not accepting

2139
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,600
something that is different from you is what you're saying.

2140
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:05,560
The word not OK in a in a pretty loaded way.

2141
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:10,440
I mean, to I don't know, like nobody wants to be have like the environment

2142
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,200
around them like be radically different.

2143
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,840
No, no, no, we're not talking about the environment.

2144
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,760
We're talking about the genes.

2145
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,200
He specifically said they're entering the gene pool.

2146
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:24,140
So his concern is that like the like the white race, like your blood,

2147
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:29,580
like your lineage will be polluted by other races, like integrating in and marrying.

2148
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:31,820
Like he's not talking about culturally.

2149
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:35,700
He's talking about literally the genes of non-white people.

2150
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:36,860
He's he's talking.

2151
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,500
He's talking about like genetic.

2152
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:43,340
He's talking about like genetic, like like intermarriage and intermix intermix.

2153
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:48,340
Implication there is that genes like non-white genes are inferior to white

2154
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:51,440
genes, and to believe that is what racism is.

2155
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:55,160
You're you're adding the word inferior that I don't think is necessarily

2156
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:59,720
necessarily implied if you like that you're even if you don't think it's inferior.

2157
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:00,520
He didn't say.

2158
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:06,560
Just to think that that you, for any reason, do not want other races,

2159
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,480
genes to be mixed in with the white people in your country.

2160
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,840
No, no, no, I don't think that's I don't think that's not even true.

2161
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,080
I mean, he would he was saying it's not true.

2162
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,580
Look, if it takes take Sicily, Sicily has an identity.

2163
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:26,380
Let's say that we add the population of Sicily only in Chinese people to Sicily,

2164
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:27,500
that we just do that.

2165
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,620
OK, Sicily is now changed.

2166
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:33,660
Is it OK to be like, damn, you know, I mean, I thought the people of Sicily

2167
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:35,140
like they were pretty cool the way they were.

2168
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:38,140
I mean, no, Nate, Nate, Nate, I'm talking about genes.

2169
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:39,860
I'm talking about genetically.

2170
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:41,260
That's what I'm discussing right now.

2171
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:45,540
Even though these Chinese people act the exact same way as the people in Sicily.

2172
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,220
Yeah.

2173
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:49,920
The only difference is that they now have Chinese genes.

2174
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:56,000
If you're not OK with that, that is what racism is the idea that you're

2175
01:54:56,240 --> 01:55:01,140
you're adding this not OK as in like think they're inferior or one

2176
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:02,940
can prefer a racial group.

2177
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:05,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2178
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:09,960
OK, OK, to prefer one race over another is what racism is.

2179
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,920
That's what I'm doing.

2180
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,200
I'm doing I'm doing a TV commercial.

2181
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:17,200
I'm filming in front of, like, a very dark oak-paneled wood panel.

2182
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:23,200
A person with black skin would be muddled into there, so it's not for a white person in this context.

2183
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,200
That's not the same thing as what we're talking about.

2184
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:31,200
Yeah, in one specific context is different from, like...

2185
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:35,200
Yeah, in that context, a white person will just pop off the background better.

2186
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:38,200
That's an aesthetic consideration. It's nothing to do with them as a human being.

2187
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,200
As is the population of Sicily looking like Sicilians as opposed to half Chinese half Sicilians.

2188
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:45,200
How is that a pragmatic consideration at all?

2189
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,200
It's not pragmatic at all. It's purely aesthetic.

2190
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:51,200
Well, the example you were giving there was a pragmatic consideration.

2191
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,200
There's a difference between aesthetic...

2192
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,200
Okay, in the case...

2193
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
Yeah, I mean, the pragmatism is the only difference.

2194
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:02,200
You don't think models are chosen for aesthetic reasons when they're doing different shoots?

2195
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
Nate, what the fuck? That's not even relevant.

2196
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:08,200
The difference is between the pragmatism and the non-pragmatism of the aesthetic consideration in this case.

2197
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:17,200
In the case of the wooden door, it's not your fault that a black person would blend in with the door.

2198
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:22,200
That's just the way that nature is, and you can't help it.

2199
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:29,200
There's nothing racist about not doing something that doesn't make sense.

2200
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:34,200
In the case of wanting the population to look a certain way,

2201
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:39,200
if you want them to look like a certain race, that is what racism is.

2202
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:44,200
If there was a button I could push to convert the race of every Chinese person to Mexican,

2203
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:47,200
I just wouldn't push it because they seem to be doing fine.

2204
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,200
I mean, why would you push it?

2205
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,200
Exactly.

2206
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,200
That would be game.

2207
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,200
That makes no sense.

2208
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:55,200
But if you did push it, like...

2209
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:04,200
This seems pretty steeped in the sense of you've grown up knowing that Chinese people from China look like Chinese people.

2210
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:10,200
If they were to change and then a plague hit China, all the Chinese people did,

2211
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:14,200
and then Mexicans came in and now Mexicans are Chinese people.

2212
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:17,200
That loads back in cultural issues.

2213
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:19,200
It's weird and strange and different.

2214
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:24,200
You don't have a preference for one or the other,

2215
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,200
but there's no need to get into this.

2216
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:29,200
I'm not making a case that any race is better than any other.

2217
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:33,200
I don't know, I'm just saying there are visual differences

2218
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:36,200
and there's probably some genetic differences on some level too.

2219
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:39,200
To care about that is what racism is.

2220
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,200
I'm not saying I want you to understand, Nate,

2221
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:43,200
because I know that when we say racism,

2222
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:46,200
it sounds like I'm basically accusing you of baby murder.

2223
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:51,200
I don't think racism is as bad as people make it out to be

2224
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,200
if it's not something you're actioning on,

2225
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,200
if it's just your feelings are racist.

2226
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,200
If you can keep that to yourself,

2227
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,200
go ahead and have racist thoughts.

2228
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,200
Just don't act on them.

2229
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:04,200
That is a racist thought to think like,

2230
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,200
oh, I liked it better when everyone around me was white.

2231
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,200
Now that there's a bunch of brown people,

2232
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,200
I don't like it as much.

2233
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,200
That is racist.

2234
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,200
Regardless of what the consequences of that may be,

2235
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:17,200
whether you really think of that as a heinous thing to think,

2236
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:20,200
it is racist.

2237
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:23,200
I was trying to say earlier, this question.

2238
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:26,200
Nothing about that necessarily implies inferiority.

2239
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,200
It doesn't have to imply inferiority.

2240
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:32,200
All it implies is that you prefer one over the other.

2241
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,200
You just prefer it.

2242
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,200
And if you have a preference, that is racism.

2243
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:39,200
I think what you're describing is the experience of every human being

2244
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:41,200
who's grown up in a particular community.

2245
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,200
Yes, most people are racist.

2246
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,200
Everyone's a little bit racist.

2247
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,200
Haven't you seen Avenue Q?

2248
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,200
Okay, so we're just taking the word racism,

2249
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:53,200
and we're just expanding it to just the average human

2250
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,200
feels that their particular group that you're up with.

2251
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,200
Almost everybody has some racism, yes.

2252
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,200
Everybody has some preference of race.

2253
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,200
If that's the definition you're using, fair enough.

2254
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,200
It's not like racism doesn't mean to be hate crimes.

2255
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,200
When you use the word racism, that's a very loaded word.

2256
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,200
That doesn't mean that it's not bad, though.

2257
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,200
I think it's neither necessarily bad nor good.

2258
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,200
It simply is.

2259
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,200
Well, it is bad.

2260
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,200
If somebody moves into a neighborhood

2261
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,200
where everybody else is a different race,

2262
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:26,200
they're going to feel a little naturally

2263
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:29,200
and understandably unsure about stuff.

2264
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:33,200
It doesn't matter what race it is in any situation.

2265
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:36,200
And the people who live there who are having,

2266
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,200
they see this new person, different race,

2267
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,200
they're going to think, hmm, I don't know about this.

2268
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:42,200
Then it's unusual.

2269
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,200
That is just what it is.

2270
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,200
I agree.

2271
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:47,200
So over time, both of them will get used to one another

2272
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,200
and he will just be a different race in a place

2273
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,200
and it will be fine.

2274
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:51,200
I agree.

2275
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:55,200
The thing that I was trying to pose a question is,

2276
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:59,200
if a lot of people in the UK are very, very scared

2277
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:02,200
of Muslims taking over the entire country

2278
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,200
and it's going to be a big old brown land

2279
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,200
and it's going to suck.

2280
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:09,200
There's been some terror attacks related to Muslim immigration, though.

2281
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,200
Nate, you've got to get off the fucking intellectual dark web.

2282
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:13,200
It's fucking you up.

2283
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:15,200
But I mean, that's literally true, though.

2284
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,200
Yeah.

2285
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,200
Nate, it's way overblown.

2286
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,200
It's way overblown.

2287
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,200
But I mean, if you could have a demographic

2288
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:25,200
that didn't have any of that.

2289
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,200
It's not that it doesn't happen.

2290
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:31,200
It's just that it, I mean, immigration,

2291
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:34,200
immigrant status is not that highly correlated with crime.

2292
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,200
It's not really.

2293
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,200
That is probably true.

2294
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:42,200
So the immigration is not necessarily the problem.

2295
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,200
I mean, well, if you could, if you had snapped your fingers

2296
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:47,200
and every person who had immigrated was Christian instead of Muslim,

2297
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:50,200
does that mean those attacks wouldn't have happened?

2298
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:55,200
Well, I mean, maybe not like the specific things,

2299
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:59,200
the specific things that happened might not have happened specifically in that way.

2300
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,200
Maybe other bad things would have happened or something.

2301
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,200
Maybe, I don't know.

2302
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,200
Well, fair enough.

2303
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,200
I lost my train of thought and I'm really annoyed.

2304
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:11,200
I haven't been able to say anything, so fuck it, let's move on.

2305
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,200
Shit, I want to hear your take.

2306
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,200
Well, I can't remember what my take is.

2307
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:19,200
It's just sort of like, I think deep down, people is the same.

2308
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,200
This is my world view.

2309
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,200
What a hot take.

2310
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,200
This is my world view philosophy.

2311
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,200
People is the same.

2312
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:26,200
People is the same.

2313
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:30,200
And like, stripped away from like,

2314
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:35,200
the unsureness of like, mixing with a culture that you don't understand.

2315
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:38,200
Given enough time, everybody can get along.

2316
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:46,200
And it's just, it seems, well, everybody who wants certain races to be not coming into like,

2317
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:50,200
yeah, it's just, I don't know.

2318
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,200
No, yeah.

2319
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:56,200
I don't know from what angle I'm supposed to be going at this from.

2320
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:59,200
I just think that things stupid.

2321
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:04,200
I mean, I think my take is that, all right, so you got like immigration,

2322
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:07,200
you got like, I think this is the thing.

2323
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:12,200
You got like immigration from a lot of like Middle Eastern and Muslim countries,

2324
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,200
you know, into America, but especially into Europe, into parts of Europe.

2325
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:24,200
I think that like, there have been, there's been crime, like there's been crime committed by immigrants and refugees.

2326
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:29,200
But I think that like, by and large, immigrants and refugees are like the victim of a lot more crime

2327
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:32,200
than they are the perpetrators of, like per capita.

2328
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:36,200
Well, that's not really, I mean, to the citizen who lives there currently,

2329
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,200
that's not, you know, particularly relevant to their interests.

2330
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:43,200
It's worth considering from a humanitarian perspective, of course,

2331
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:46,200
but that doesn't really impact the question of like, should they, you know,

2332
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,200
immigrate more people or whatever.

2333
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:53,200
Um, what do you, well, I mean, what, what are you saying?

2334
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:56,200
I'm saying that from the perspective, if you've got a country,

2335
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:59,200
if they're deciding to like, allow more people into the country,

2336
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,200
the question of like, the suffering of those people when they get there,

2337
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:06,200
isn't the concern of those people deciding whether immigration should happen or not.

2338
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,200
Their concern is, does this make the country better or worse for me?

2339
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:11,200
Well, that's, I mean, that's, I mean, that's like the whole,

2340
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:14,200
that's kind of the whole point of like, allowing refugees into your country, right,

2341
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:16,200
is that you want to alleviate their suffering.

2342
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,200
Um, well, that's the debate.

2343
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,200
Yeah, that's true.

2344
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:22,200
The debate is whether you care about that more.

2345
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:27,200
I mean, Destiny would also, Destiny also argues it from an economic perspective.

2346
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,200
Like, he's, he, I don't think he was always like this,

2347
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:32,200
but I think like, at some point he became like, fully like,

2348
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:37,200
full open borders guy on the basis that like, immigration is just like,

2349
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:43,200
immigration is like, just increasing the labor resource that's available to like, industry.

2350
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:47,200
And it's like an, like, immigration is like an economic boom.

2351
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:53,200
I mean, frankly, I think that the, I think most problems would be solved

2352
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:56,200
with changes in the education system, because like,

2353
02:03:56,200 --> 02:04:00,200
the biggest thing that people fear with immigrants is that they're coming in

2354
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:04,200
and taking the jobs of people who are already here because they'll do it for cheaper.

2355
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:08,200
And the bottom line is like, that's, that should be a good thing.

2356
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:12,200
It just should be that you can do jobs that they can't.

2357
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:17,200
Like you should be, if you are a naturalized citizen who's gone through the education system,

2358
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:23,200
you should be trained for something that an illegal immigrant wouldn't be able to do

2359
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:26,200
because they haven't gone through that training, you know?

2360
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:30,200
Or else, why wouldn't the corporations just use their labor if it's cheaper

2361
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,200
and they can do it just as well?

2362
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:34,200
Well, here's the thing.

2363
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:39,200
That's like all those, these like low skill jobs, they're all going to get automated away soon.

2364
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,200
That too.

2365
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:45,200
And that's why, that's why we're going to need that yang gang universal basic income dog.

2366
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:47,200
But that's not right now though.

2367
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:51,200
It's not right now, but like, it's coming sooner or later.

2368
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:57,200
At some point, you know, whether it's like 10 years or 50 years or 100 years down the line.

2369
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,200
I mean, even a small change makes a huge difference, you know?

2370
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:06,200
Like even just automating one thing is going to have millions of people do that thing.

2371
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:10,200
And like the first ones to go are going to be like the unskilled, you know,

2372
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:14,200
kind of jobs that like, you know, less educated immigrants,

2373
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:17,200
the kind of people they're like, oh, they're taking our jobs.

2374
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:23,200
Those kind of people, the kind of jobs that they're supposedly taking are going to get taken by the robots.

2375
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:25,200
This is this is true.

2376
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:29,200
Hence the bag McDonald's, automizing and whatnot doing the, you know, all that business.

2377
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,200
Yeah.

2378
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,200
And like self-driving car.

2379
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,200
Okay.

2380
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,200
Okay.

2381
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,200
Uber, Uber, right?

2382
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:37,200
Uber is a nightmare, right?

2383
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:43,200
Uber is like, is like the Uber is like the capitalist boogeyman.

2384
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:50,200
It is, it is like, it is like, there's no better example of a company that like simply exists

2385
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:53,200
off the back of exploitation of labor.

2386
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,200
Like that's all it is.

2387
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:56,200
It's like, they don't do anything.

2388
02:05:56,200 --> 02:06:01,200
They just have a fucking app and then they have this whole fucking network of people that work for like

2389
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,200
bullshit rates.

2390
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:03,200
They make shit money.

2391
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,200
Why do they do it if it's so bad?

2392
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:07,200
Because fucking the economy sucks, Nate.

2393
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:11,200
And people are poor because we have a huge wealth gap in America.

2394
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,200
Well, okay.

2395
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
So, you know, they do that.

2396
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:17,200
Well, I mean, it's also just ignorance to how bad it is.

2397
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Like, I don't think the average, I think most people are just viewing it as, oh, I can make some extra

2398
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:24,200
money without realizing the actual toll it takes.

2399
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:30,200
Cause like the real problems with doing Uber is that like it will destroy your car and like

2400
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:36,200
the amount you pay in gas and mileage and shit is going to, you know, it's going to counterbalance what you pay.

2401
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,200
Just wait.

2402
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:44,200
Like, like Uber is bad now, but just wait until self-driving cars show up and then suddenly,

2403
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,200
suddenly they won't have to pay anyone.

2404
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,200
They won't even have employees, right?

2405
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,200
They won't, or not even employees, contractors, right?

2406
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:52,200
Independent contractors, like they're currently considered.

2407
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:56,200
So they don't have to give benefits to any of the people that make their money for them.

2408
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:59,200
They'll just, they'll just like, no, they won't have it.

2409
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,200
They won't have any fucking costs.

2410
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,200
I mean, I guess they'll still have to pay for gas.

2411
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,200
They'll have to buy their cars.

2412
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:11,200
This automation revolution, and if UBI was included, would probably solve illegal immigration

2413
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:16,200
as a problem if you couldn't get that universal basic income without being documented.

2414
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:20,200
Cause there would be no reason to come to America if there's no unskilled work.

2415
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,200
I mean, there's no way you could get it if you were undocked.

2416
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:23,200
There's no way you could get it if you were undocked.

2417
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:24,200
Right.

2418
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:27,200
So it would just be like, hey, if you come to this country, you really don't have any

2419
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:32,200
opportunities except unless you are like able to, you know, either become a naturalized

2420
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:35,200
citizen or have a more skilled job.

2421
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:39,200
I think that in itself would probably be a huge fix.

2422
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,200
Maybe.

2423
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:45,200
Well, they might still, I mean, they might still want to come just because like, yeah,

2424
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:50,200
maybe they're not getting the bag, but there would just, you know, people would just have

2425
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:54,200
like so much disposable income that maybe, I mean, there'd still just be a lot more money

2426
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:55,200
to be paid.

2427
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,200
There'd probably be more charity going around, like probably more people who could take care

2428
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:58,200
of it.

2429
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:03,200
I mean, I'm, you know, I'm, I believe in the whole, I believe in the trickle up economics

2430
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:04,200
thing.

2431
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,200
Right.

2432
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:08,200
So I think like if people had more, no, people have more money to spend, there's going to

2433
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,200
be more spending.

2434
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:17,200
Therefore, there's more money to be made by, by, by like an enterprising person who is

2435
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:20,200
the opposite of trickle down is pump up.

2436
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:25,200
That's how I learned it in middle school anyway, but I lately I've heard it called trickle

2437
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:26,200
up.

2438
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:27,200
Whatever.

2439
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,200
Like pumping the tire up.

2440
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,200
Yeah.

2441
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,200
Like you pumping up the jams.

2442
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,200
I have to piss and shit.

2443
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,200
We should go to voicemails.

2444
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:34,200
Yeah.

2445
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,200
Okay.

2446
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,200
Yeah.

2447
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:37,200
I'm down.

2448
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:38,200
All right.

2449
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,200
So I can piss and shit while listening.

2450
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,200
Okay.

2451
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Well, I've got it right here.

2452
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,200
Let me see.

2453
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,200
Okay.

2454
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:49,200
This one is from, I swear this message will give Ben a boner.

2455
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,200
That's the, that's the one.

2456
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,200
Okay.

2457
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,200
Let's see what he's got to say.

2458
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,200
Go.

2459
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:59,700
So my mother told me something that she was going to be doing with her current boyfriend

2460
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:04,200
that really made me think of Ben.

2461
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:11,200
The both of them are going to do what I would say is the peak boomer thing this Wednesday.

2462
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:20,200
They're going to go to a new Costco that's opening to celebrate it like opening, but

2463
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:27,200
they're going to go the day before it is actually possible to purchase anything.

2464
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:34,200
Like they're literally going to browse the store and celebrate Jesus.

2465
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,200
Jesus.

2466
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:36,200
Opening.

2467
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:37,200
Like why?

2468
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:38,200
I don't know.

2469
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:44,200
It just made me really think like, wow.

2470
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:49,200
We truly do live in a society.

2471
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:57,200
I guess it just kind of made me think of like traditionalists and the plight that they're

2472
02:09:57,200 --> 02:10:02,200
in, given the like, I don't know what that's about.

2473
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:06,200
That we're in like they don't have any, what do you call it?

2474
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,200
Any rituals or anything to particularly hold on to?

2475
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:10,200
Oh, okay.

2476
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:11,200
So I don't know.

2477
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,200
I just found that interesting.

2478
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:16,200
This guy's, this kid's a fucking, this kid's a fucking psycho in the ass.

2479
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,200
This kid's got fucking brain problems.

2480
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,200
All right.

2481
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,200
Forget everything.

2482
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,200
Digi, right?

2483
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:25,200
You and me, we're talking, I think yesterday, about how kids these days don't understand,

2484
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:27,200
they think that we're the boomers.

2485
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,200
We're only the meme boomers.

2486
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,200
This people he's talking about, these are the real enemy.

2487
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:32,200
These are the real boomer.

2488
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,200
We have to keep, like you got it guys.

2489
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:35,200
You got to stay focused.

2490
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:37,200
Stay focused on the real boomers.

2491
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:39,200
Don't let them fucking smoke screen into thinking it's us.

2492
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:40,200
We're not your enemies.

2493
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,200
They are your enemy.

2494
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:45,200
They'll make fun of us millennials once the boomers are dead and gone.

2495
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:50,200
But for now, we have to focus on the fact that the actual boomers are still around

2496
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,200
and are still the problem.

2497
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:54,200
In spite of everything, they're still here.

2498
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:57,200
Don't lose sight of the real enemy.

2499
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,200
We're your allies.

2500
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:03,200
You can tell we're your allies because you just made an undertale reference on the slide

2501
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,200
in the middle of this thing.

2502
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:07,200
What could be more zoomer than an undertale reference?

2503
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:09,200
Come on guys, we're pandering to the kids.

2504
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,200
We're Pokemon going to the polls.

2505
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:19,200
Did you watch the Teen CP episode where the baby boomers, they just read this news article,

2506
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:26,200
this tweet where baby boomers were being given like university courses for like five bucks.

2507
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:27,200
Yeah.

2508
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:29,200
I've seen that going around.

2509
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:34,200
They could just wander around campus and learn and then die immediately afterwards.

2510
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:35,200
Yeah.

2511
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:38,200
The purpose of this for like new jobs?

2512
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,200
No, no.

2513
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:44,200
It's just like, oh, wouldn't it be nice if these old people could have the thing that

2514
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,200
all the young people actually need?

2515
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:48,200
Could just fucking occupy themselves with some shit.

2516
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,200
I see.

2517
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,200
That's pretty much what it is.

2518
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:51,200
So, okay.

2519
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:54,200
So I'm assuming that on the Teen CP, they read this article and thought they were like

2520
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:58,200
talking about us, talking about like 30-year-olds.

2521
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:59,200
No, they did not.

2522
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:04,200
There was a little video and they were like very old, very sleepy men.

2523
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:07,200
Well, that's how zoomers view us, the boomers to that.

2524
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:12,200
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't make the distinction.

2525
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:16,200
I can imagine them reading that and like maybe if they weren't watching the video,

2526
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:20,200
maybe if they just read it in text form, like they would picture me.

2527
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:22,200
It would be me on that campus.

2528
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,200
Yeah.

2529
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:24,200
Yeah, I'd imagine so.

2530
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:26,200
On death, on death's door.

2531
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:27,200
All right.

2532
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,200
Well, all right.

2533
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:29,200
Let's go to our next one here.

2534
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:33,200
We've only got three, by the way, because there were actually very few submissions

2535
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:36,200
and most of them were bad, but there's a couple that are funny.

2536
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:43,200
Oh, and I'll just say now, before I forget, that we got one voicemail from Quality Women.

2537
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:45,200
Quality Women called in.

2538
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:47,200
Buddy, you rambled too long.

2539
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:51,200
Some of the details were interesting, but like you bored me to tears, so work on it.

2540
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:56,200
But the gist was that he did fuck the milf, but he deeply regretted it.

2541
02:12:56,200 --> 02:13:01,200
And it got like weirdly relationship-y, I think, and it was like...

2542
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:03,200
Wait, how old did he say she was?

2543
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:05,200
I think he said she was...

2544
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:07,200
40, I think?

2545
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,200
Oh, okay.

2546
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:09,200
Or maybe 50.

2547
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,200
I don't know.

2548
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:11,200
Might have been older than that.

2549
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:17,200
I think I remember feeling like that was like a little too old to be cool anymore.

2550
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:22,200
He said that she was a very weird person to be around, and she would just like stare off into the distance.

2551
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:23,200
It makes me like...

2552
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:25,200
Oh my God, did she have fucking dementia?

2553
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,200
I don't know.

2554
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:27,200
Maybe.

2555
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,200
Fucking boomers.

2556
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,200
Oh, fucking boomers.

2557
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:31,200
Dude, he's literally fucking boomers.

2558
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,200
Literally.

2559
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,200
Yeah.

2560
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:37,200
I feel like she...

2561
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:42,200
I'm not trying to judge anybody, but like if you're like 40 to 50, you're on like an app.

2562
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,200
You should just die.

2563
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,200
You should just fucking die.

2564
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:50,200
Like a 20-year-old or a 25-year-old, I'm not trying to say you're bad, you can't do that.

2565
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:56,200
It's just like, I think that speaks to like what you've been able to accomplish with your life.

2566
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:59,200
Like fucking like some young stud, if you're like a milf, I get it.

2567
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:00,200
That's fine.

2568
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,200
Hey man, who can judge?

2569
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,200
Do whatever you want.

2570
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,200
Like is this...

2571
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:07,200
Like it sounds like she's pursuing a relationship with this guy.

2572
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:12,500
Shouldn't you be pursuing like some like, you know, self-made millionaire who's like spinning

2573
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:15,200
all these plates and has his shit together and will, you know...

2574
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:19,200
Well no, because that's a capitalist dog and who would want...

2575
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:20,200
He's a dog.

2576
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:21,200
He's a dog.

2577
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,200
Yeah, a damn dog, whatever it was.

2578
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:24,200
A damn dog.

2579
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:25,200
Thanks Grace.

2580
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:26,200
Thanks.

2581
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:27,200
Okay, well whatever.

2582
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:28,200
Rip.

2583
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:29,200
Rip.

2584
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:30,200
Rip.

2585
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:31,200
Rip.

2586
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:35,400
There's these guys who call in who think that we're like so fascinated with their story

2587
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,200
that will definitely play their voicemail.

2588
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:38,200
Oh.

2589
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:41,200
It still has to be entertaining or I'm not going to play it.

2590
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:42,200
Can I...

2591
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:45,200
Alright, this is fucking stupid but I want to do it anyway.

2592
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:46,200
That's just fine.

2593
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:47,200
Okay, there was one...

2594
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:48,200
There's one destiny debate.

2595
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:49,200
It is...

2596
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:52,200
Debate with a female Trump supporter, right?

2597
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:53,200
Okay.

2598
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:55,200
And it is so incredible.

2599
02:14:55,200 --> 02:15:00,200
It's like, it's like three hours long and she...

2600
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:01,200
Again, she...

2601
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:04,200
What if he grabs you by the pussy?

2602
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:05,200
Got him.

2603
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:06,200
Yeah, no.

2604
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,200
Good one, Destiny.

2605
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,200
That's right.

2606
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:12,840
So, but like, okay, she's like a junior professor or something.

2607
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:19,700
She has a PhD in some kind of social psychology or something and she doesn't understand the

2608
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:25,200
difference between anecdotal evidence and statistical evidence despite supposedly doing this for a living.

2609
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:26,200
Whatever.

2610
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:27,200
I see, I see.

2611
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:28,200
So she's really dumb.

2612
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:29,200
Like, she...

2613
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:30,200
She...

2614
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:31,200
For all kinds of reasons.

2615
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:32,200
I won't go into it.

2616
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:34,200
But she comes in and like, she's looking at the chat.

2617
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:35,200
She's getting real nervous at the chat.

2618
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:37,200
She's saying like, oh, oh no.

2619
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:39,200
Like, oh, your chat says they're going to dox me.

2620
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:40,200
Oh, I knew this was going to happen.

2621
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:41,200
I knew I was going to get doxed.

2622
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:43,200
Your chat says she's going to dox me.

2623
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:49,200
But she keeps going and then over the course of the whole thing, she keeps fucking vol...

2624
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,200
She says what state she's from.

2625
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:54,200
She says like what school she teaches at.

2626
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,200
She says like, yeah, she says like...

2627
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:00,200
She's like, oh yeah, when I was a kid, you know, I knew a girl.

2628
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:02,200
I won't say her name.

2629
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,200
Right.

2630
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:05,200
But she raped a boy.

2631
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:06,200
The boy's name was Trevor.

2632
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,200
The girl's name was Marianne.

2633
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:09,200
Right.

2634
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:12,200
She raped this boy and then he had to pay for her kid or something.

2635
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:17,200
Like, this is her anecdote story that's supposed to prove that like, that like men aren't...

2636
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:20,200
Like females aren't oppressed in society or something.

2637
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:22,200
And it's just really fucking great.

2638
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:25,200
It's really great and she's awful.

2639
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,200
Okay.

2640
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:27,200
That's all.

2641
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:28,200
That's it.

2642
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:29,200
I just wanted to tell her.

2643
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,200
I guess we really did make Donald Trumpf again.

2644
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:31,200
Okay.

2645
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:32,200
Let's move on.

2646
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,200
Oh God.

2647
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:34,200
I'm mad.

2648
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:35,200
I'm mad thinking about this person.

2649
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,200
Okay.

2650
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:39,200
Well, let's calm that with a nice soothing voice from our friend.

2651
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,200
I'm English.

2652
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:41,200
Okay.

2653
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,200
Go.

2654
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:43,200
Oh, hello.

2655
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,200
I'm an Englishman.

2656
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:45,200
And I attended the RSCK London event.

2657
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:46,200
I love the taste of cock in my mouth.

2658
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:47,200
Sick.

2659
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:48,200
Oh, yes.

2660
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:49,200
Damn.

2661
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:58,200
I'm dressing the chaps and buddies and my pals over in London the other week.

2662
02:16:58,200 --> 02:16:59,200
Yes.

2663
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,200
I can't believe it.

2664
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,200
It was such a good time.

2665
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,200
Yes.

2666
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:03,200
I'm blue.

2667
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:04,200
Okay.

2668
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,200
Dude.

2669
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:25,200
I bet that guys suck the dick in London and France.

2670
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:32,200
So I don't know if this is a hot take or not, but like, is this what we've come to?

2671
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:35,200
This is the quality of the voicemail that makes it onto the show.

2672
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:36,200
I thought that was hilarious.

2673
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:41,200
Do we not live in a society?

2674
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,200
I guess we don't.

2675
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:45,200
I guess fucking, oh God, what was his name?

2676
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,200
Hey, I like that guy.

2677
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:48,200
Who said that we live in a society?

2678
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,200
He doesn't afraid of anything.

2679
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:51,200
Agree.

2680
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:54,200
Who was the guy who said we live in a society just a minute ago?

2681
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:56,200
Like five minutes ago?

2682
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:57,200
That was his long name.

2683
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,200
I swear this message will give Ben a bow.

2684
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,200
Yeah.

2685
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,200
Well, I guess he was wrong.

2686
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:03,200
I guess his thesis was wrong.

2687
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,200
Okay.

2688
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:05,200
All right.

2689
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:07,200
Well, the good news is we've only got one more.

2690
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,200
Bottom of the barrel cast.

2691
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:12,200
This is from Koji Sama, apparently.

2692
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:13,200
Okay.

2693
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,200
46 seconds.

2694
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,200
Maybe I'll let people know the time so they know how long they have to endure it.

2695
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:17,200
But okay.

2696
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,200
Here you go.

2697
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:19,200
Go Koji.

2698
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,200
What do you got?

2699
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,200
I'm a pretty hydrated guy.

2700
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:26,200
So about every night around three a.m. as I'm sleeping, I wake up.

2701
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,200
I have to go pee.

2702
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,200
And the other night I did so.

2703
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,200
I went down and I went to the restroom.

2704
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:38,200
I didn't turn the light on because my eyes wouldn't be disturbed by it.

2705
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:43,200
And my dad, you know, the doorknob to the bathroom, you can pick it with a clothes hanger.

2706
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,200
So he did that and he got in there.

2707
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,200
Okay.

2708
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,200
He turned the light on and he saw me.

2709
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:49,200
The light was on?

2710
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:51,200
Because, you know, it's three a.m. right?

2711
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,200
Right guy.

2712
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:53,200
Yeah, right.

2713
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:54,200
Yeah.

2714
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:57,200
So the next day he bullied me for it.

2715
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:00,200
And I just wanted to know, do you guys think that's an important part of being a man, being

2716
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:01,200
standing up?

2717
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,200
You know, I still do it, but sometimes I'm just in the mood to sit down.

2718
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:06,200
What do you guys think?

2719
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:10,200
That is a vital part of being a man and you are not a man for sitting down.

2720
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:17,200
As a man you ever sit down to pee, I would advise you to once you're done, turn around,

2721
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:23,200
dunk your head into the pee toilet and hold it there until you don't breathe anymore.

2722
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:32,200
I mean, I feel like it generates a certain imagery of what he's like if the sitting down

2723
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:37,200
is worth the time that it takes to pee because you never pee for that long.

2724
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,200
Like sitting down would feel like a hassle.

2725
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,200
See, he was in there with the light.

2726
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,200
The light was off.

2727
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,200
The dad came in, picked the lock and turned on the light.

2728
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:47,200
He was peeing in the dark because he feels shame.

2729
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,200
He feels shame for what he's done.

2730
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:54,200
The reason that he was sitting down is because the light was off because he wouldn't be able

2731
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:58,200
to aim, so he's thinking, oh, I'll just turn on the light.

2732
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:59,200
Why didn't you turn on the light?

2733
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:01,200
Because he said it would disturb his eyes.

2734
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:07,200
I understand the logic of what this guy's doing, but I wouldn't do it.

2735
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:12,200
It's way funnier to just stumble around in the dark and pee on something.

2736
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:17,200
You know, just turn the fucking light on and just through my bleary damaged eyes try to

2737
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:20,200
aim my fucking flaccid tiny cop.

2738
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:27,200
Getting blinded with light when you're used to the dark is a unique feeling.

2739
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,200
I don't feel that often.

2740
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:32,200
But when I have an opportunity, I may as well blind myself.

2741
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:34,200
Put a fucking nightlight in your bathroom.

2742
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,200
That's a good idea.

2743
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,200
That's a good idea.

2744
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:38,200
Well, that would have taken pre-planning.

2745
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:40,200
The ship has sailed on that.

2746
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:43,200
We've got to deal with the world as we live in it.

2747
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,200
You'll never have to sit to pee in the future if you just put a nightlight in your bathroom.

2748
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:52,200
Maybe he can take something valuable away from his experience.

2749
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,200
True.

2750
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:58,200
But the real question is, is it a vital part of being a man to stand while you pee?

2751
02:20:58,200 --> 02:20:59,200
What's the answer to that question?

2752
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:00,200
Absolutely.

2753
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:06,200
I wouldn't say that one of the advantages is that you get the option.

2754
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:10,200
You don't necessarily have to close yourself off to either one.

2755
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:15,200
However, I do think it is a vital part of being a man that you do get to stand while you pee.

2756
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:21,200
I just can't imagine wanting to sit because it's so much more convenient and cool to stand

2757
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,200
and make all that noise.

2758
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:28,200
You can aim your piss at the edge of the sea so you don't make noise if you want.

2759
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,200
I think you have just insulted.

2760
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,200
It would just feel weird.

2761
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,200
You have insulted and alienated our diverse and expansive female to male trans audience

2762
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,200
by making this a male necessity.

2763
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:40,200
They can stand to pee if they want.

2764
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:41,200
Yeah, they can let it flow.

2765
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,200
They can let it flow, guys.

2766
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:43,200
They can have a funnel.

2767
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:51,200
I've seen illustrations of girls standing to pee, I think, and I can extrapolate from

2768
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,200
that that it can be done.

2769
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:56,200
Probably there's some technique involved.

2770
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:59,200
I mean, the girls literally can just stand and pee.

2771
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,200
Well, it's about controlling the stream.

2772
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,200
You're going to have a trouble with the urinal.

2773
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:04,200
They go straight down.

2774
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:08,200
I would think it would be easier for them, actually, because all they have to do is just

2775
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:10,200
spread their legs over the toilet and go.

2776
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:12,200
As a guy, the stream goes up.

2777
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:13,200
Does it go straight down?

2778
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,200
Just go straight down.

2779
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,200
What if?

2780
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:16,200
What if?

2781
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:17,200
All right.

2782
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:18,200
Let me just hypothetical.

2783
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:19,200
All right.

2784
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:20,200
Look, I'm not trying to trigger anyone here.

2785
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:21,200
I'm just thinking out.

2786
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:23,200
I'm just asking questions.

2787
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:24,200
What if?

2788
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:29,200
They reach down to their pubis mons and apply some pressure onto the skin and just pull

2789
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:36,200
up so that all the skin in that area is pulled up.

2790
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:38,200
Would that direct the stream forward?

2791
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:43,200
No, that's what I mean.

2792
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,200
That's what I mean.

2793
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:48,200
You can you pull the skin up to direct the stream forward so you can pee forward into

2794
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:49,200
the toilet.

2795
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,200
Surely one can simply angle their pelvis.

2796
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:54,200
From your girl urethra, a.k.a. the girl urethra.

2797
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:59,200
I'm just saying you don't even need to angle it forward because you can just spread your

2798
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,200
legs a little farther and go around.

2799
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:06,200
You're going to tell me that you're going to stand with your legs fucking spread eagled

2800
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:08,200
standing directly over the bowl.

2801
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:09,200
Yeah.

2802
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,200
Yeah.

2803
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:11,200
You might as well just say that.

2804
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,200
Yeah, that's right.

2805
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:14,200
In fact, I'm going to do that personally.

2806
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:15,200
I'm going to do that.

2807
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:19,200
I'm going to do that stand over the toilet and pee directly on the wall.

2808
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,200
Here's why.

2809
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,200
No, you'd have to fucking.

2810
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,200
Okay.

2811
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,200
To do this.

2812
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:26,200
Digi, I'm going to tell you why you're a fucking moron.

2813
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:27,200
All right.

2814
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,200
To do this.

2815
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,200
You would have to.

2816
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,200
You would have to pull your pants all the way down, right, like to your ankles to do

2817
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,200
this.

2818
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:35,200
Okay.

2819
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:42,200
And then you couldn't move over the toilet because the pants stretch between your ankles

2820
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:46,200
would catch on the toilet and you would have to take your pants completely off.

2821
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:47,200
Wait, wait.

2822
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,200
Okay.

2823
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,200
You could do some sort of squatting position where you angle your butt back while standing

2824
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:51,200
in front of the toilet.

2825
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,200
But then you can't see.

2826
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:53,200
What would you be?

2827
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,200
What would you be looking?

2828
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:55,200
What would you be looking?

2829
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:56,200
Looking through your legs behind you.

2830
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:57,200
You have to take off your shoe though.

2831
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:58,200
You have to take off the shoe for this.

2832
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,200
Looking through your legs behind you.

2833
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,200
Like, come on.

2834
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:01,200
That's just not realistic.

2835
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,200
Okay.

2836
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:03,200
Okay.

2837
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:09,200
We're never going to get to a conclusion here.

2838
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:10,200
We need evidence.

2839
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:13,200
We need people in the PCP viewer base.

2840
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:15,200
We need photographic evidence.

2841
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:19,200
Women, please try this, document the results and get back to us.

2842
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,200
Leave a comment.

2843
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:22,200
And then give us a voice mail.

2844
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
Am I the only one who when I take a shit.

2845
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:28,200
Send us a voicemail of you peeing unless you're underage.

2846
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:32,200
In which case, just make sure you don't say it and then we won't.

2847
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:33,200
Am I the.

2848
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:34,200
And then we're not legally liable.

2849
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:39,200
Am I the only one who when I take a shit removes all of my clothes completely.

2850
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:40,200
Yes.

2851
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
Well, I do that.

2852
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,200
I do that.

2853
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:44,200
On some occasions.

2854
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,200
I will.

2855
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:50,200
I will if it's like hot and like I'm sweaty or something, but not just like as a matter

2856
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:53,200
of course, like as part of the shitting process.

2857
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:54,200
Okay.

2858
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:57,200
If it's hot, like usually I like to squat on the toilet ball.

2859
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:04,200
I need to take my pants, my trousers, shoes, socks off, but also I definitely do not do

2860
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:09,200
this in public because the floor in a public bathroom is just gross and I don't want any

2861
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:11,200
of my clothes on it.

2862
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:14,200
Or the nightmare of someone opening the stall somehow while you're in there in public.

2863
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:17,200
I mean, that's a, you know, it'd be over for you.

2864
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,200
Here's a question.

2865
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,200
Here's a question.

2866
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:25,200
I've been called out on this like people have bullied me for this lately and I need validation.

2867
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,200
Right.

2868
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:27,200
So you're taking a shit.

2869
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,200
Right.

2870
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:29,200
You're done.

2871
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:30,200
And it's time.

2872
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:31,200
It's time to wipe.

2873
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:32,200
Right.

2874
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,760
If the time, the time has come.

2875
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:36,800
Do you wipe still sitting on the bowl?

2876
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,600
Like are you still on the boat or do you like?

2877
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:39,600
No, you stand up.

2878
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:40,600
You stand up.

2879
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:41,600
Yeah.

2880
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:43,600
I've heard that it's literally 50 50.

2881
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,200
It's like one of those things that people are all of us.

2882
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:50,200
I like, I don't stand all the way up, but like I stand up like enough.

2883
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,200
Like I'm off the bull.

2884
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:52,200
Like my knees are still bent.

2885
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:53,200
Like I'm not like fully.

2886
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,200
Yeah.

2887
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:55,200
I stand.

2888
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,200
Yeah.

2889
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:57,200
I stand.

2890
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,200
Okay.

2891
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:59,200
How could you?

2892
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,200
What are you going to reach into the fucking bowl next to you?

2893
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:02,200
Apparently half of everybody does that.

2894
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:03,200
Literally.

2895
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,200
People have.

2896
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:05,200
I don't.

2897
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,200
That's insane.

2898
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:07,200
People have been telling me that I'm weird because I stand.

2899
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,200
And like, I think that's insane.

2900
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:11,200
Well, look, we all seem to be in agreement on this, right?

2901
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:13,200
Is it like fat people who can't be bothered?

2902
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,200
I have no idea.

2903
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:18,200
I just heard statistic that it's maybe there's a physiological difference.

2904
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:19,200
I don't know.

2905
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,200
Personally, I'm a standard.

2906
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:21,200
All right.

2907
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:26,200
Let's go full dick show now and ask you the other question.

2908
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:29,200
Over the waistband or through the fly for pissing?

2909
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,200
Depends on the trousers I'm wearing.

2910
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:33,200
Mostly through the fly.

2911
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,200
Through the fly.

2912
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,200
Mostly.

2913
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:36,200
Mostly.

2914
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:37,200
Mostly.

2915
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,200
Mostly.

2916
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,200
Yeah.

2917
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,200
No matter what.

2918
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:41,200
Well, I think, isn't that because you wear pajama pants and you don't have a fly?

2919
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:42,200
That contributes a lot.

2920
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:43,200
Well, they do.

2921
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,200
That's the issue.

2922
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:45,200
All my pants have a fly.

2923
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,200
I won't wear pants with no fly.

2924
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:48,200
Except for these ninja pants I'm wearing right now.

2925
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,200
But no.

2926
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:52,200
I mean, yeah, going over the waistband is definitely easier in pajama pants.

2927
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:58,200
But even in just regular shorts, I'll just undo the top button and go over the waist.

2928
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:04,200
If you undo the top button, well, I mean, do you unzip?

2929
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:05,200
No.

2930
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,200
No.

2931
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:07,200
You have to.

2932
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,200
Yeah, like surely you're undoing the top button.

2933
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,200
Wait, what about with jeans?

2934
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:15,200
Wait, so you're saying that you undo the top button and then you don't unzip the fly.

2935
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:17,200
You just pull it down.

2936
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,200
What?

2937
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:19,200
On jeans?

2938
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:20,200
I don't wear jeans.

2939
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:22,200
We're talking about shorts.

2940
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:25,200
Well, if the fabric is stretchy, then it doesn't matter, I guess.

2941
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:29,840
I mean, I would do this on any because to me, if you go through the fly, you have to hold

2942
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:32,000
your cock while you pee.

2943
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,960
If you go over the waistband, you just let it rest on the waistband and you don't have

2944
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:38,200
to touch your cock.

2945
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:39,200
I mean, if-

2946
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,200
I suppose.

2947
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:41,200
I mean, I hold my dick.

2948
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:44,700
I hold it every time just to make sure I'm, you know, getting everything going the right

2949
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:45,700
direction.

2950
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:50,240
It's like the waistband of the underwear to like prop up my dick so that it, like, you

2951
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:51,240
know, shoots out.

2952
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:52,240
Okay.

2953
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:58,720
Like none of the pants or shorts that I own would be comfortable to like pull down and

2954
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,200
go over the waistband.

2955
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:01,200
Yeah.

2956
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:02,200
I basically don't have a choice.

2957
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:05,520
And then, so even if I'm wearing like pajama pants, like I still go through the fly, maybe

2958
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:09,200
that's just out of habit because I do it in every other pants that I wear.

2959
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:15,480
I never really like going through the fly, mostly because when I do, it's because there's

2960
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:22,180
a, well, a lot of pants have zips and the zips usually get me and I just, I just rather

2961
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:23,180
would avoid that.

2962
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,980
I'm first of all terrified of the zipper getting in my cock.

2963
02:28:24,980 --> 02:28:28,660
And second of all, I don't want to have to like reach through the fucking steamy jungle

2964
02:28:28,660 --> 02:28:32,060
of my salty nuts to fucking get my dick out.

2965
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:33,060
You know?

2966
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:37,180
Why do you have to reach through your nuts to get to your dick, Gigi?

2967
02:28:37,180 --> 02:28:38,180
What the fuck does that mean?

2968
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:41,780
You have to open up the fly in your underwear where it's like the multiple doors.

2969
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:42,780
I mean, I don't wear boxers.

2970
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:43,780
I wear boxer briefs.

2971
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:44,780
Multiple doors?

2972
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:45,880
Oh, wait.

2973
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:46,880
I see.

2974
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:47,880
Like you got to go through the first fly and then the boxers.

2975
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:48,880
Yeah.

2976
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:52,280
The boxers have like the double fucking, you know, it's like two layers over your cock

2977
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:56,040
and like that area is fucking sweaty, all right?

2978
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:58,280
And maybe, and maybe your boxers have kind of twisted.

2979
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:01,080
So like if you got to go through like a fucking zigzag, right?

2980
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:04,440
Like you got to go through the fly and then like reach over and get to find the other

2981
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:06,960
one and then pull it over to the whole fly.

2982
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,280
You wear pajama pants a lot.

2983
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:09,280
Okay.

2984
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:10,280
You wear boxer briefs.

2985
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:11,280
You probably don't have this.

2986
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,280
I wear boxers mostly.

2987
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:16,180
There have been incidents where I like I rarely go out wearing like pajama pants, but I have

2988
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:20,140
done it before and they have like the open fly, like without even a button.

2989
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:23,780
There have been incidents when I'm out in public, my dick finds its way through both

2990
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:24,780
my boxers.

2991
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:28,780
That's another reason I don't wear boxers because of the fact that yes, I wear that's

2992
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:29,780
fair.

2993
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:30,780
I wear pajama pants.

2994
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:33,780
And yeah, if I was wearing boxers, my dick would slip out all the fucking time.

2995
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:34,780
Like it would be constant.

2996
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:35,780
It's happening.

2997
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:40,900
Like if you wear pajama pants without underwear underneath your dick will just be out.

2998
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:41,900
There is.

2999
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:43,520
100%.

3000
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,520
100%.

3001
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:45,520
Okay.

3002
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:46,520
Wait.

3003
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:47,520
That's fair.

3004
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:51,200
What is the difference between boxes and then like boxers that are not as big as other?

3005
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,200
Is it like boxer briefs?

3006
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:57,880
Boxer briefs are they they have they don't have like a button up fly like boxers have

3007
02:29:57,880 --> 02:30:01,320
a button up fly just like regular like like pajama pants.

3008
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:02,320
True.

3009
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:03,320
True.

3010
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:04,320
Okay.

3011
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:05,320
And they're much more loose.

3012
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:06,320
Obviously.

3013
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,320
Oh, I have legs.

3014
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:09,320
Yeah.

3015
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:10,320
Okay.

3016
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:11,320
I have I don't have those.

3017
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:17,340
I don't have like an in-between of briefs and boxes or whatever they're called.

3018
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:20,180
Boxer briefs are impossible to get your dick through the flat.

3019
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:22,540
That's exactly why I go over the waistband.

3020
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:23,540
It's impossible.

3021
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:24,540
It can't be done.

3022
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:25,540
I think we've cracked the code off.

3023
02:30:25,540 --> 02:30:26,540
I like it.

3024
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:27,540
It's never been done in the history of humanity.

3025
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:28,540
I like it.

3026
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:29,540
I like to be snug.

3027
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:30,540
That's fair.

3028
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:31,540
That's fair.

3029
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:32,540
I don't know.

3030
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,540
I've always worn boxers and I just feel like I always will.

3031
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:34,540
Yeah.

3032
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:38,260
I mean, I think it really just goes down to what you grew up wearing like my dad wore boxer

3033
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:39,260
briefs.

3034
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:40,260
Yeah, I think so.

3035
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:45,440
You know, like I share in my family, like every all the boys just kind of shared like

3036
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:47,240
a pool of boxer briefs.

3037
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:51,200
Like, you know, that was not like to nominate it like who's our which.

3038
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,440
It's just like everybody's wearing them because we're all the same size.

3039
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:56,720
You know, at some point I was doing a load of laundry.

3040
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,680
I don't know if they were mine or like I don't bend somehow it absorbed into my collection

3041
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:01,680
or if it's just someone else's.

3042
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:02,680
My box is my life.

3043
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:04,680
My box is just like quantum tunneled over.

3044
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:05,680
Oh, we know this one.

3045
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,680
We lived at parents house.

3046
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:10,200
Well, I don't even remember when it at some point.

3047
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:13,300
My history and I feel like it could have been from a complete stranger.

3048
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:18,460
One pair of boxer briefs entered my rotation of underwear and I do occasionally wear that

3049
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:22,380
after I came from, but it was like freshly from a laundry.

3050
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:23,380
I don't think so.

3051
02:31:23,380 --> 02:31:25,620
I don't think it was before that.

3052
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:27,260
So I have one pair of boxer briefs.

3053
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:29,900
I will wear on occasion and I'm not a fan.

3054
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:30,900
Not a fan.

3055
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:31,900
Speed.

3056
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,900
Digi.

3057
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:37,820
Do you have my slime corp tea by any chance because okay, I don't know.

3058
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:39,300
It's like gone and I can't find it.

3059
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:42,080
I have no idea where it could have been and I thought like maybe did I wear it to your

3060
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:43,560
house one time and leave it there?

3061
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:45,400
I probably would have found it when we were packing.

3062
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:46,760
So I would say no.

3063
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:47,760
Yeah.

3064
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:48,760
Okay.

3065
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:52,240
Well, this discussion has run its course and we are out of things to say clearly.

3066
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:54,200
So let's wrap it up lads.

3067
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:55,360

So if you're hearing this at Otacon for some reason, I'm there too.

3087
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:48,040
Hey, quick question.

3088
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:49,040
How fun.

3089
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:50,040
Wait a minute.

3090
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:51,040
Wait a minute.

3091
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:52,040
Most of us will be...

3092
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:53,040
Wait, is this...

3093
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:54,040
Yeah.

3094
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:55,040
Is it like this Thursday?

3095
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,040
What?

3096
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:57,040
No, no, no.

3097
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,040
No, it's the next Thursday.

3098
02:32:58,040 --> 02:32:59,040
Next Thursday.

3099
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,040
Oh, okay.

3100
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:01,040
Oh, God, few.

3101
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,040
Okay.

3102
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,040
Yeah, you're good.

3103
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:04,040
All right, okay.

3104
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:07,940
The PCP, we're all going to be at BronyCon, except Digi.

3105
02:33:07,940 --> 02:33:10,260
Well, a couple of people won't, but a bunch of us will be there.

3106
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:13,040
A lot of the regulars here will be at BronyCon.

3107
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:16,760
How do we do a PCP episode if we're all at BronyCon?

3108
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:18,640
I'm not going to have my computer.

3109
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:21,480
You could live stream it from a phone.

3110
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:22,480
Like on Friday?

3111
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:24,800
Well, but that's the next...

3112
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:29,200
Because it happens as a delay, so we have to live stream it the following Friday.

3113
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:31,840
Surely one of you is bringing a laptop, right?

3114
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:33,720
I mean, I wasn't planning on it.

3115
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,720
I don't know.

3116
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:38,240
I mean, we'll have to think about this at least a little bit.

3117
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:40,800
We could just live stream it from a phone.

3118
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:43,800
But that doesn't work, because we film on Sunday.

3119
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:44,800
Hold on.

3120
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:47,560
We just saved that episode and released that the next...

3121
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:50,800
Are you bringing a laptop give and take?

3122
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:52,280
I should be.

3123
02:33:52,280 --> 02:33:54,600
I probably will have space.

3124
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:57,360
I don't know whether I'm going to use it that much, but yeah.

3125
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:00,200
Sounds like we need to lock this down in some capacity.

3126
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:02,400
I just can't imagine traveling without a laptop.

3127
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:05,240
I don't know why anybody will not have a laptop.

3128
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:06,240
I got my phone.

3129
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:07,240
What do I need?

3130
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:08,240
Well, is anyone...

3131
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:10,400
I mean, nobody's going to be bringing like a digital camera, right?

3132
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:13,760
Like the only camera we're going to have available is a phone camera.

3133
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:18,480
Unless you have a laptop with a built-in camera or just like a webcam.

3134
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:19,480
I don't know.

3135
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:26,320
Every time I went to BronyCon, I had all of my mic equipment, my computer, like the full

3136
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:31,320
setup, like I would come with everything and never use any of it because we never had

3137
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:32,320
time.

3138
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,320
Yeah.

3139
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:34,320
Yeah.

3140
02:34:34,320 --> 02:34:35,320
I remember that.

3141
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:36,320
All right.

3142
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:37,320
Let's...

3143
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:40,520
Meeting place, the BronyCon Orgy.

3144
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:41,760
We'll livestream from there.

3145
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,080
We'll livestream the BronyCon Orgy.

3146
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,080
Yes.

3147
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:46,080
That'll be...

3148
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:48,600
Wait, are none of you all bringing like cameras for vlogging?

3149
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:50,040
Like couldn't you just film it on that?

3150
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:51,760
I'm bringing a camera for vlogging.

3151
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:52,760
The small one.

3152
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:53,760
Oh, wait.

3153
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:54,760
We've got the GoPros.

3154
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:55,760
Dude.

3155
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:57,640
We could wear GoPros on our heads during the Orgy.

3156
02:34:57,640 --> 02:34:58,640
I mean, true.

3157
02:34:58,640 --> 02:34:59,640
I'm bringing my phone.

3158
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:00,640
What do I need a GoPro for?

3159
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:01,640
Dude.

3160
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:02,640
It's all the video camera.

3161
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:03,640
I got a fucking...

3162
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:04,640
Dude, we should...

3163
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:05,640
Okay.

3164
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,640
We all got to bring our fucking GoPro.

3165
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:07,640
I mean, I'm going to bring mine.

3166
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:08,640
I mean, look.

3167
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,640
Okay.

3168
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:10,640
We can talk about this and discuss things or whatever.

3169
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:11,640
I forgot I even...

3170
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:12,640
I forgot I even have that.

3171
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:13,640
Okay.

3172
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:14,640
Okay.

3173
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:15,640
I got mine kicking around.

3174
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,640
All right.

3175
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:17,640
But that's it, everybody.

3176
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:18,640
Thanks for being here.

3177
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:19,640
We'll see you later.

3178
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:20,640
Speak Pipe.

3179
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:21,640
Patreon.

3180
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:22,640
Appreciate it.

3181
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:23,640
Twitter.

3182
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:24,640
You know what to do.

3183

3184
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:26,640

02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:27,640
See you next week.

3186
02:35:27,640 --> 02:35:28,640
Bye.

3187
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,640
Bye.

3188
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:30,640
Yeah.

3189
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:31,640
Bye.

3190
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:10,640
What the hell is wrong with me?
