00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Hey guys, Digibro here, coming at you from my bedroom. Just doing a little vlog update, you know, to tell you all about the new Procrastinators podcast episode that just came out.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,300
You probably know that, cuz you're watching it!

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,100
Hey, you better start believing in Procrastinators! You're in orbit!

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
Bestie boy, yeah.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,300
So anyways, you know, I'm having a nice day.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,700
When I stand on soap, I'm the slip-o-crit.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,400
He is drunk hobo, you know, in my room.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,400
You know, just making fun sense, throwing it out there, you know, just whatever.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,900
But, you know what, I'm not gonna hold up your time too much.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,100
Just subscribe to my Patreon, and give me money for my vlogs.

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,700
Another day, another dollar, another night to make a whole holler, a popper cherry, then I pop my collar!

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,700
So I can keep doing them?

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm a vlogger now.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,100
Send me money.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,300
The vlogging channel, over time.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,200
Well, you know, I've already revolutionized YouTube time and time again.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
I've already been the best.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,700
I decided it might be fun to take a stab at it.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,400
Yeah, take a stab at being the worst.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,900
Well, that's kind of what we're gonna discuss here.

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,000
Like, vlogging is something I think that all of us were kind of like, not at...

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,300
Like, we all sort of saw it as like a lesser form of entertainment back in the day, and now we're all doing that.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,800
I still do, but there's value in it as well.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,700
It's just a tool, it's one of your tools in your toolbox, you know?

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,800
It can be very good, but the only good one is his whole channel is gone, so nobody knows what good vlogging is.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
Which channel is gone?

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,300
This Fresnad is my favorite, he's the guy who got me onto YouTube because he was funny and he did vlogs.

28
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,400
And they were like comedy skit vlogs and they were great, but...

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Did he delete his channel?

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
He deleted all his videos.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,700
I think there's something to do with some weird scandal with Rapen.

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,800
I don't know.

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,700
I don't care.

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,700
I don't know whether he did it, if he did it, he cares.

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,400
He vlogged raping a woman.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,500
That's gonna shut your channel down, okay.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,600
Something happened.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,300
He was the coolest though.

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:30,600
I feel like, I personally feel like in a lot of ways, vlogging and long form content are sort of where YouTube is going right now.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:40,900
I think it's become a lot more normal to sit around and just absentmindedly watch fuckloads of YouTube in the way that people used to do for TV.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,900
And I don't know, I feel like we're headed in that direction.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,300
And you know, it's interesting, I totally agree, but it's interesting that YouTube provides such a variety of content.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,000
There's so much more that you can get at any time and it's all available instantaneously online.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,200
You really, you don't even need friends anymore in real life.

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,500
They're no longer required.

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,700
You can just watch PewDiePie or whoever.

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,700
There's so many little kids who are just like, PewDiePie is my friend.

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
Have you ever seen that comment?

49
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,300
That's like, be right back, PewDiePie, gotta go do my chores.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,500
And it replies to it, okay, I'm back.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,600
Yeah, it replies to it like, it's a live chat or a Skype or something.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,300
That is my favorite comment of all time.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,500
It is, it's great.

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,700
It's fantastic.

55
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,500
I love it.

56
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,300
That's YouTube.

57
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:40,600
But I think this is an interesting conversation specifically for us to have because Nate, especially you, were really down on like this kind of content for the longest time.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,300
And now you're doing it.

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,200
I still am.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I still consider myself a crusader for what I consider high art.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,500
And we've had our disputes about this for a long time about, I mean, Game Grumps was kind of the one thing because it's just guys talking about shit.

62
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,200
And you've always been of the opinion that quantity is a great thing.

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,900
And the more of it that you get, in fact, I was just watching your vlog about the anime seasons and how you're making an argument.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,700
Yeah, which, I mean, there's, I actually agree with a lot of that.

65
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:15,300
But just the fact that we're getting more shows and more of them are good kind of as a consequence of that, it's likely you're going to get more good stuff out of it.

66
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:25,500
But I have a different view where I prefer the like, I'm the, I'm the, you know, old school dude who's into like, like the bebop, you know, 1998, whatever.

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,800
It's got like the best shows.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,200
So, you know, like season.

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
That's value.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,200
Yes, I'm trying to think of how to say what I'm going to say.

71
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:44,900
Well, Game Grumps is a great place to start with this, because I think that it's sort of at least viewing it from our perspective.

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,600
I don't know if this is true for everybody.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:54,500
And, you know, there's other entire sections of YouTube that are probably completely divorced from everything we're going to say in this.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,900
But like, I think for us, especially, Game Grumps was like the beginning of the end for this trend happening.

75
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Like, it was the marker that this was coming, because we had like two creators who were mostly known for content that came out rarely.

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:19,400
You had, you know, Egoraptor, who did these animations that took fucking forever to work on, and these, these larger videos like Sequelitis,

77
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,100
which were like half animated, you know, filmic, fucking heavily animated videos, essays.

78
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,100
And then you had JonTron, who had, you know, the JonTron videos.

79
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,400
He's still doing that kind of content now that he's left Game Grumps.

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,600
But there are these, these, you know, videos that take like a month or more, sometimes multiple months to make and release.

81
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:46,600
And then both of them get together and start this channel that's two videos a day for a year, you know.

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,000
And the whole thing is completely unscripted, completely like almost unedited.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
It's just them playing video games.

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,600
And it kind of revolutionized YouTube in a way, like, or at least for this sector of it.

85
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,100
Well, it was just a super clear example of like how you don't have to do it, you know, the old way.

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:15,100
But it was just that these guys managed to be so funny that they were still able to build an audience,

87
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,100
even without having to do all the things they had to do before, you know.

88
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,600
And I think YouTube really incentivizes and rewards this kind of content, especially now.

89
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
There's no doubt about that, that's for sure.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,100
As it's moved into this rewarding, like, rewarding audience retention,

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
rewarding just the sheer number of views you can get.

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Because if you put out, like, if you put out one video every month and it gets a million views,

93
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,600
and then you start up a channel where you release two videos every day and each one gets a hundred thousand views,

94
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,100
you're still going to pass that million-view video in, like, no time, you know, and make way more money.

95
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:03,100
And so, like, this kind of fast, I've made a fuckload of videos, you know, as opposed to one amazing one content,

96
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
is, like, rewarded.

97
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,600
And here's the question I have, Nate, though.

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,100
Like, here's what makes it so enticing to me.

99
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:24,600
Is this idea that 90% of the effort you put into a video is really only worth about 10% of what's great about it?

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
What do you think of that statement?

101
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Um, well, that's definitely true.

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,600
You know, for me, just the way that I...

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,100
The kind of videos that I like best are sort of like the...

104
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
They're like stories in of themselves, you know?

105
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
They've got a narrative arc to them.

106
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:54,100
And so, I, you know, I'm always looking for that, like, that escalation and then the climax and then, like, the resolution.

107
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
That's what I like best.

108
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:02,100
And that really doesn't have to come in, like, a million-hour long video that takes months and months to make.

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,600
You're not getting anywhere close to as much out of that as you put into it, you know?

110
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,100
It's totally disincentivized and...

111
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,600
I don't know, man.

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I don't know.

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Ugh, God.

114
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
It's a struggle to admit, right?

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
It kills me.

116
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,600
It kills me that, I mean, it's entirely true.

117
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,100
You are in no way incentivized, and I've understood this now.

118
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,100
You're totally not incentivized at all to make long...

119
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,600
You're not incentivized to make the best video ever.

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,600
You're incentivized to build the biggest channel ever by producing the most content that people like in whatever way that you could do that.

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
And, uh...

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,600
The only other way that you can get big is being, like, the only guy making the best points about something, like, uh...

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Every frame of painting.

124
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
He doesn't post that often, but, like, his stuff is very good, so people still like it.

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
That's true.

126
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I mean, it's not impossible, right?

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Like, Jon Tron did it, and he's just a funny guy who made, like, one video a month, sometimes with much bigger gaps.

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Very near the beginning.

129
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah.

130
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Very near the beginning, it was a lot more, uh...

131
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
A lot more frequent.

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
At least, uh, one a week.

133
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I didn't see him in his early, early days, so I don't know.

134
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
What, a week, really?

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Oh, okay.

136
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
He started just trying to do it one a week.

137
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
It was, yeah.

138
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
But, um...

139
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,600
But, you know, with really the conceit behind my whole attitude here, and you guys will probably totally disagree on this, especially you, Digi.

140
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I, I have this idea in my head of, like, what will people, what is the most value for posterity?

141
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
What are people gonna, like, look back on and, and find the most value in?

142
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,600
And I think it's thing, like, like, you were saying, Digi, that this might be the best season of anime ever.

143
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:51,600
But, I mean, perhaps just by virtue of the market being so crowded, I don't think anyone's gonna look back on any show this season, including my favorite, which is the Iron Train thing.

144
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Right.

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:07,600
And, and think of it with any kind of reverence as much as, like, I don't know, even something like Lucky Star, which is starting to wane in popularity, I think will be, like, more fondly remembered, and have more, like, impact overall.

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I mean, it's really hard to say up until we get to that, you know, to that point, but, like...

147
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Mm-hmm.

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:26,600
If that is true, then it, it would have been true for, like, that year that Lucky Star and Girl in the Gone came out, where, like, in night, like, you know, in my video, I talked about how in 1998 we had, like, Cowboy, Bebop, Lane, and Trigun.

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah.

150
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
It's like these three shows that, like, really survived, and everyone still knows about them.

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Mm-hmm.

152
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
But then, 2007, you know, Girl in the Gone, Lucky Star, and, like, let's say, Darker Than Black, or...

153
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Yeah.

154
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Deno Coil, if you wanna talk about one that's not particularly popular, but really beloved.

155
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Deno Coil is a good example, yeah.

156
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Right.

157
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Um, but that season had more shows in it than the entire year of 1998, you know?

158
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Like, 2007, by then, we had, like, during the spring and fall seasons, we would have, like, up to 40 shows, and it was, like, half as much.

160
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,600
But, you know, to be honest, anime is a horrible example, because anime is so hard to make and takes fucking forever.

161
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Right.

162
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
So, like, really, it's not even relevant to, uh, to the point we're making.

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
No.

164
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Like, yeah, to get back to YouTube and to vlogging, like...

165
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Yeah.

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I think when you look at an ego raptor cartoon from the old days, like, you know, one of the just the awesome series, and, like, something like Awesome Reach, very quotable, very memorable.

167
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Yeah.

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Like, you've probably seen it a good 20 times.

169
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
And then, like, and so, it has that survivability factor.

170
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:41,600
But then, if you look at, like, a stretch of, let's say, let's say that Awesome Reach took five months to make.

171
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Like, just spitballing random numbers out there.

172
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I don't know how long it actually took.

173
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,600
In five months, you would get, holy shit, I'm trying to even math this out, because there's, like, 60 episodes of Game Grumps a month.

174
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,600
So, so you get, like, 600, no, 300 episodes, right?

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
In that span, I think.

176
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
I don't know, I fucking don't listen to my fucking math.

177
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
So, let's just say that number.

178
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You get a shit load.

179
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You get 60 a month, you get 60 a month, and that's times five, so 300.

180
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I mean, I gotta say, I don't really remember a lot of the ego raptor cartoons.

181
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I actually remember more, I more remember, like, perfectly hilarious games in Game Grumps or JonTron videos.

182
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I'm watching a very inspirational video on Facebook right now about a chicken that was born with no eyes.

183
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,600
And that, I think, has a lot more artistic worth than anything on YouTube.

184
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Any, any, all the videos, this is the greatest video ever made.

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
For what it's worth?

186
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
That video was probably of a chicken who didn't let being born with no eyes stop him from getting slaughtered and fed to the American population.

187
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Oh, dude, it's snuggling with a dog and a cat, it's really cute.

188
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
It's probably a YouTube video that was stolen.

189
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh, no!

190
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Holy shit!

191
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Oh, no!

192
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Anyways, in the span of those five months of Game Grumps episodes,

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I feel like you will ultimately get as many great things as you would have gotten from that three-minute animation.

194
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Where, like, I mean, if you were looking at, if this is the five-month span where all of Sonic 06 happened,

195
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,600
then the sheer number of great scenes and quotes from that, you know, the it's no use scene,

196
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
or the one where he just loses his fucking shit over Knuckles glitching out.

197
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Glitching out? Yeah, but what is this?

198
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Like, and I mean, those eventually became their, like, own works of art and that other people animated them and drew them

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
and they've been recreated a thousand fucking times, you know, and, like, been made into something else.

200
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,600
So, like, there's so much stuff that comes out of Game Grumps existence,

201
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
where there's so many animations and so many animators launching whole fucking careers out of it,

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,600
and, you know, and Egoraptor being able to use Game Grumps to fund other animations

203
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,600
and put the money into people who are doing more interesting shit than he is anymore, you know.

204
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I mean, don't get me wrong, I think Game Grumps has gone downhill and it's shit now, but, like...

205
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:11,600
But are you saying that, like, the YouTube as a whole is just going towards this whole quantity over quality?

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Well, not necessarily quality, but just quantity over not quantity?

207
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Here's the struggle that I'm looking at right now.

208
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Because I started suddenly, like, basically I watched all of Ethan and Ela's videos

209
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
and I really enjoyed that they put out, like, a video at almost every day.

210
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,600
It's fucking psychotic. It's like five times a week, at least.

211
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I think since I subscribed to them, they've almost had a video every single day, which has been like two weeks.

212
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
They had a goal a while back to do five a week, I think.

213
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Right. And they'll put out a video, like, every day, and they're basically just vlogs,

214
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
but they do have some editing, you know, some little jokes in there.

215
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Sometimes it's not that funny and I'm like, okay, well, you know, you could tell they made this in a day.

216
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
It's not, like, that thought out, but then sometimes they can be hilarious.

217
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,600
But, like, I was watching all those and then I decided to start vlogging just, like, every random thought that came into my head.

218
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,600
And so I've released probably, like, 25 vlogs in the last week and a half.

219
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Like, I've been releasing almost three a day, a lot of these days.

220
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,600
And, you know, I always had this mentality about, like, I felt the entire time I've been YouTubing, I've had one rule,

221
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
which is to never make a video that I wouldn't sit through.

222
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Like, that's my number one rule. It's just never...

223
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,600
And how's that going now? Still keeping that up?

224
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Yeah, it's still true. It's just that now I'll sit through anything, you know?

225
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Oh, yeah, right, right. I remember you making that point on Twitter or something.

226
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,600
It was really watching Max Landis' videos because that dude will fucking...

227
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Like, he vlogs all the time and the quality is garbage on his vlogs.

228
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Like, he'll just open up his MacBook and just rant into the built-in camera and it sounds and looks like shit,

229
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,600
but he'll make, like, an interesting point and, like, that's enough for me, you know?

230
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:13,600
And he's such a fun character to watch because he, you know, moves a lot and has a funny way of speaking.

231
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
What are you gonna say, something?

232
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
No, I was gonna say he's a crazy nigger.

233
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah.

234
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
In my, um, in my lost flow.

235
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Get a fucking haircut, Max! God damn it, your hair pisses me off so much! Fix your shit!

236
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Yeah, welcome to the Max Landis.

237
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I can't take you seriously.

238
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Max Landis has a stupid haircut podcast.

239
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm legitimately, I'm legitimately really fucking sick of it. It pisses me off.

240
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Look at him. I hate it.

241
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,600
I mean, I know it started because he lost a bet, but, uh, he seems to be maintaining it.

242
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Markiplier is doing the same thing.

243
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Alright, you lost the bet, Mark. You can shave your head and start over now.

244
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Just, God.

245
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
You look like shit! You look like shit!

246
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
He looks like a fucking...

247
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Come on!

248
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,600
He looks like a weird animal. He looks not like a person. He looks like, like, like, if you put him in a suit, you'd be like, why is that clown wearing a suit?

249
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
It looks fucking...

250
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
That's right. That's right.

251
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I hate it. I hate it. I...

252
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
He doesn't wear a suit.

253
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
He'll figure it out one of these days.

254
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
You

255
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You

256
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
You

257
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Not yet recording audio, interrupting everything, to tell you that the devil is coming, and the devil will be here.

258
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Back on the subject of vlogging now that we've been interrupted by the devil monster.

259
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Before I got interrupted by the Max Landis stuff, I was gonna talk about my, um, my last vlog.

260
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,600
I mean, I don't really do vlogs on Give and Take, uh, my other channel.

261
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
It's mostly just weird joke videos.

262
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
If you like that.

263
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
But you didn't happen to do one recently.

264
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Yeah, I walked through a park and I talked about things.

265
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:43,600
One of the things I was talking about was how I'm trying to get rid of, like, remove a time wasting, not time wasting, but just things that eat up my day.

266
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Like, podcasts and long form content that I do like.

267
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I just need to stop listening to it because it's just taken up, like, too much time and I've got, and I'm a guy who's got to make stuff.

268
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
So as a YouTuber, it's not good for me.

269
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I can't sit through all these didgy vlogs.

270
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I've got to stop doing it.

271
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,600
You know, you know, this is a little bit unattangent, but I just remember this thing that Jesse said a long time ago that's like,

272
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
when you're a YouTuber, you literally never have time off.

273
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
You're always forcing yourself to be doing something.

274
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
You always got to be thinking about your next shit.

275
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Man, it's so true.

276
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Anyway, I'm sorry, Gabe, go on.

277
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
No, that was it.

278
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Yeah.

279
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
That was it, okay.

280
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
You know what?

281
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
This sounds interesting.

282
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm going to be on this and I'm not editing it just because I made it complicated, alright?

283
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm editing it anyways.

284
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Good.

285
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Which I was going to edit the last one, but then Nate just kind of memed you into doing it and you accepted.

286
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Oh, really?

287
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Okay, I guess I'll never listen to Nate again.

288
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I should have known.

289
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Like, I was planning to just be the editor for these because I have the time to do it and then...

290
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.

291
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Here, get my headphones ready.

292
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Are you recording David?

293
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Yeah, I am recording now.

294
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay, good.

295
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Welcome in.

296
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,600
We're going to have Jesse edit in a rant as you for the part where you came in before.

297
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Yeah, it's going to be great.

298
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
It's going to be great.

299
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Why do you record some of it?

300
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I recorded some of that part.

301
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
And this is going to be the rant.

302
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Hey guys, it's me, the DeVoo.

303
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
This is my angry voice.

304
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Wait, why are you no longer the DeVoo Collective?

305
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
When I get angry, I sound like this.

306
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Of course.

307
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm going to dig me a hole in the backyard and make a signpost that says, I don't like my friends.

308
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,600
It's going to be PCP Vlogs starring the DeVoo...

309
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Jesse Englis Jess as the DeVoo.

310
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
DeVoo needs to record his own work on Friendship EP.

311
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
We should make a whole thing where we're playing each other.

312
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Don't you know that the DeVoo Collective can use the voice of anyone I've absorbed in the world?

313
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
That makes sense.

314
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Have any of you heard of the broken Friendship EP?

315
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
DeVoo, do you know about that?

316
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
I do not know what that is.

317
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Oh man, I'm surprised you don't know.

318
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I thought I would have brought it up in a podcast way back in the day.

319
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Now is the reason to listen.

320
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:11,600
There's a way back, I was hanging out with my friends and they were pranking me.

321
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I was trying to get to the car and they were pretending to drive away without me.

322
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
I've always really hated being pranked and stuff.

323
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I was pissed off and bitter about it all night.

324
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:33,600
We recorded a song together and I wrote these really emo lyrics about hating all of my friends and called it the broken Friendship EP.

325
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I continually would write songs of that nature about how I wish I didn't have to like people because then they just pissed me off and it hurts even more.

326
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:55,600
If I had to rank the top 5 things that make me mad the easiest, it's when I go away for one second and a million things have happened without me and no one even realized.

327
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
That's me every single night.

328
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
That is frustrating.

329
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
As soon as I go to bed, everything starts happening.

330
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Poor guy.

331
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,600
It was really funny because I was thinking like, I thought DeVoo was here a minute ago but then you disappeared right before we discussed the entire topic of the thing.

332
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,600
And then I was like, well, he probably doesn't care about vloggers anyways.

333
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Also, I just wanted to say, the first song that I ever created in my life was one time, me and my buddy John were taking Japanese in college and he didn't have his computer one night.

334
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:35,600
So we needed to use my laptop with its microphone to record this speech he had to give to his teacher, his sensei.

335
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:47,600
So the next day, when me and my buddies were hanging out, he was off in class, I remixed that speech into a song that I wrote which was just like, I just sampled like his voice and just repeated it over and over.

336
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Man, it was...

337
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
That means I am cunt baby.

338
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
It was the best.

339
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
All of this is on topic.

340
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
We're basically just vlogging in the middle of this vlogging podcast.

341
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
This is a vlog.

342
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Yeah, exactly.

343
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
No matter what we say, it's going to be on topic.

344
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
So what's been said so far?

345
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
That's the beauty of vlog.

346
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
What's going on?

347
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:22,600
We've just been discussing the idea that vlogging is taking over YouTube and basically all the stuff I said in my video about the future of YouTube.

348
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
But we're discussing whether or not that's a good thing.

349
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
It's a race to the bottom.

350
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Well, there's so many things that just don't come out well when you write it as a script.

351
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,600
If you're really good at it, talking naturally has its own values.

352
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Well, okay.

353
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,600
But if you're not good at talking naturally, which a lot of people are, especially at first, then it makes sense to...

354
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Then don't vlog.

355
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
But if you do, then do.

356
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Yeah.

357
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Well, that's why it's great.

358
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Vlogs are a great tool for people who are already popular or whatever because people just want more of you and they'll take whatever they can get.

359
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Exactly.

360
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,600
And that's kind of what I want to get into now.

361
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,600
And especially with Davoo here, it makes this particularly interesting because he's involved with my channel.

362
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Davoo's job right now is full-time editing for my videos.

363
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,600
And so I've been vlogging nonstop for the last few weeks and just pumping out all this content.

364
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
And the weird...

365
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Here's the weird conundrum of it, right?

366
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Like, those videos don't have the kind of guaranteed views that the stuff on my main channel does, even though a few of them have retarded extreme views.

367
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Like, the one about the most boring-tasted anime.

368
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Because of that sweet drama, baby.

369
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Oh my God.

370
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Ridiculous, right?

371
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
But here's the thing.

372
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,600
For a lot of people, like, the vlogs are now basically the...

373
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
This is like the main content in a way.

374
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I just saw on that, like, on your video, like, it was nice when Digibro was the main channel.

375
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Right.

376
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
No, he didn't say it was nice.

377
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
He just said, remember when Digibro was the main channel.

378
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
That's right.

379
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
You know the exact comment.

380
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Yes.

381
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
But, yes, it made me laugh.

382
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:05,600
But I thought it was interesting because for the people who are watching the vlogs, like, and who are into them, I've put out, like, hours of interesting topics in the...

383
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Even if only, like, one in five of them interest you, that's still five interesting topics, you know?

384
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:22,600
That, like, that maybe those videos aren't as rewatchable and they won't, you know, stand the test of time like you were saying that you, you know, want your videos to be able to do.

385
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Yeah.

386
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,600
But they will put interesting ideas in your head and for most people, they only watch YouTube videos once anyways.

387
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
For most people, YouTube's more of a transient thing.

388
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:41,600
I don't think there's as many people who obsess over it as an artistic medium like we do and, you know, revisit videos over and over again that we, like, feel something about.

389
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
But, like, and even then, there's some people who re...

390
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Like, I get messages all the time from people who say, like, I rewatched your insomnia analysis video ten times because I thought it was so interesting, you know?

391
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Like, for some people, what we might view as completely random bullshit that we just do together might just happen to resonate with them even more so than, like, the stuff we actually crafted and put work into, you know?

392
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Yeah.

393
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:17,600
But like you've said, I'd like to think that my stuff appeals to the niche of people that really appreciates it and then I don't give a fuck about the normies who don't even care about whatever, you know?

394
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Yeah.

395
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
But that's, you know, that's just not as a successful model, numerically.

396
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:34,600
It's just, it's really interesting to me to have, like, where the main, like, conversations that I'm having and, like, where, like, where, where the excitement is is kind of on the vlog channel where there's lots of content coming out, lots of discussion happening.

397
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:41,600
And the main channel has been these, like, you know, these, these well-crafted videos, but I'm not even the one editing them, Davoo's editing them.

398
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:52,600
So I feel, like, it's a little distant because it's stuff that I wrote a while ago, especially this month because most of what we've been publishing is stuff that I wrote, like, months ago that I just never got to edit.

399
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:10,600
So it's kind of like content that I'm not as invested in in the moment and that, like, you know, even though it is getting, like, a, you know, better viewership and expanding my audience, the vlogs are also getting a decent amount of attention.

400
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:24,600
So there's some kind of irony to the fact that, like, the main channel is, like, these, these more expensive, more high-effort stuff, and I say expensive in, like, a literal sense that I'm paying Davoo to edit them, and that those are the ones that are getting marked on Patreon.

401
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:36,600
You know, like, those are the career aspect, even though for some people, like, the vlogging channel is probably way more interesting right now, just because there's so much stuff coming out and, you know...

402
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
That's how Ethan and Hila feels, because...

403
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Yeah, I was gonna say it the same.

404
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,600
They've slowed down on their actual videos, and their...

405
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:55,600
You know, that would have been so true if they, like, didn't come back with anything strong, but then they just so happened to make their best video ever with the boy band one, which inspires confidence in me.

406
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,600
But still, Ethan and Hila is clearly where the more business is going down.

407
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Even though HDHD is, like, the main channel, but then the funny thing about it is, Ethan and Hila has, like, 700,000 subscribers.

408
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,600
They average close to a million fucking views on their videos.

409
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:24,600
So, like, on the one hand, you could still say HDHD is the main channel, but Ethan and Hila is also probably an even better source of revenue at this point, because it comes out so frequently, you know?

410
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
And I'm sure that was a large motivation behind doing it.

411
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Right.

412
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
You know, it just makes sense, fiscally.

413
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
But you know, it's really interesting.

414
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Having a game grown to them with games.

415
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
It's really interesting to me the pressures...

416
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Sorry, let me just finish this point.

417
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,600
It's really interesting to me the pressure that people seem to feel, and Ethan talked about this a lot.

418
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Like, when your channel gets big, there's this pressure, and I already feel it, even with a small channel, to, like, make everything on there perfect.

419
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,600
So you gotta make the second channel so you can just post whatever you want when you're just being a real dude, you know?

420
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Yeah, that's exactly how I am at the moment.

421
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Yeah.

422
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,600
The give and take stuff, I post stuff on there when I have, like, a dumb idea, but I know it's not, like, something that could be considered a good...

423
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Like, I mean...

424
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
In the sort of traditional sense that it's, like, a big video.

425
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,600
It's like your resume, and then your, I don't know, your real life, or whatever.

426
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Jochron does the same sort of stuff, except he's sort of doing the worst...

427
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Except that his one, like, vloggy video was the best one he's made in years!

428
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Well, not that.

429
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm talking about the fact that he's been deleting videos that aren't, like, up to his level of stat...

430
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Like, you know, the Sonic...

431
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
He's been doing that for a long time.

432
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,600
There's old Sonic review videos, all the Sonic T stuff.

433
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
The Sonic Team videos are the best fucking things on his channel.

434
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
They're all gone.

435
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
He deleted those, that fucking bitch!

436
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I know, he's a fucking idiot.

437
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Dammit, I hate, I hate John Trun so much, I wish he was dead.

438
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Historical revisionism.

439
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
At this point, he's only doing damage to his, his legacy.

440
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
He needs to stop.

441
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:49,600
And you know, I think, possibly, that a new great, like, one of the best forms of content is, is that they can go half-vlog, half-edited.

442
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,600
A lot of what Jesse makes is, like, done live, or done impromptu, and then, like, stapled together through editing.

443
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
That's kind of the best of both worlds.

444
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
That's essentially Frankenstein Monster from hell.

445
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
That's essentially what Ethan and Hila is.

446
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I don't think they're as good as Jesse just because Jesse's off the cuff is so...

447
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Like, even just the unscripted part is great, and then the editing brings it up to another level.

448
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Whereas, I think a lot of Ethan and Hila videos would not really be funny before the editing.

449
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Because, like, back when I was doing videos back in, like, 2008, which I've all unlisted, but you can find, but don't watch them.

450
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Your eyes will water from my voice.

451
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
It was all, like, live.

452
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,600
It was all just me talking into a microphone and then editing the audio and putting on visuals.

453
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Because I thought that will come out more natural than writing a script and having to make it sound good and feel good.

454
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
I didn't really know how to do that at the time.

455
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,600
But then when I got into videos, like, as a professional thing, I started doing pretty much the same format that Digi does,

456
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,600
which is just write the whole thing, record the whole thing, and then edit the whole thing as, like, a layered process.

457
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:05,600
But more recently, I've been getting into doing things more the way that Demolition D does or YMS does.

458
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Specifically with my debate with a commenter video, I just started, like, putting together individual pieces of that video

459
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,600
because I didn't really plan on what exactly it was going to be.

460
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I just started, like, I wrote some sections of it and then I impromptu, like, just started ranting about other sections in it.

461
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
And then I just did a whole bunch of editing that, like, stapled it all together.

462
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,600
And it has a lot of raw energy in it and a lot of natural flow.

463
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Is this already out? DeVille, are you still working on it?

464
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
No, my debate with a commenter video.

465
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Oh, that one. Oh, okay. I missed that.

466
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,600
It has a lot more of, like, a natural flow than a lot of other videos I've made have.

467
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,600
And that's obviously one- the best thing that Digi's vlogs have is that naturalness to it.

468
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,600
That a lot of- like, Digi, I want to bring up the whole voiceover conundrum that we've been having this month.

469
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Do you want to introduce that topic?

470
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Yeah, I've had to redo the voiceover on, like, most of the videos that we did this month because of the fact that I'm reading posts-

471
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Like I said, it's mostly been videos that I wrote months ago.

472
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:19,600
And, like, for me, it's really difficult to, like, recapture what I was thinking when I wrote it, you know?

473
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Because, like, every video I write is written in a certain voice.

474
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,600
There's, like, a certain rhythm to it and a certain cadence to it.

475
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Oftentimes, it's actually based on, you know, other YouTubers.

476
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Like, I'll have someone else's voice in my head and I never copy them in the actual voiceover.

477
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Like, because I just can't, you know, it naturally comes out sounding like me.

478
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Like, actually, one of the voices I get in my head the most is Hyperbit Hero.

479
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Like, the way he reads his- Shout out to my boy.

480
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,600
The way he reads his scripts when I'm reading back to myself, like, when I read through my script to myself, I tend to use his voice.

481
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Which is funny, because I actually don't really like the way he reads in his videos, because every sentence sounds the same.

482
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Dude, dude, hang on, let me cut you off.

483
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I love when he starts his videos with that, top of the morning to you laddies, this is Hyperbit Hero.

484
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Happy to bring you home and back to another video.

485
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
I love that, I love that.

486
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,600
But, like, he kind of, like- No, that's him.

487
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Every sentence he has has kind of the same lilt to it.

488
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Like, they always kind of have the same downward cadence towards the end, and it can get tiring.

489
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
But, like, for whatever reason, that's the voice I tend to read a lot of my scripts in.

490
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:30,600
And then, like, I just read them slightly differently when I perform, because I don't actually sound like Hyperbit Hero.

491
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,600
But, like, I very often have some YouTuber's voice in my head when I'm writing my script.

492
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Okay, so I get the point. So what was the problem with your recording? I don't understand.

493
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,600
That these videos were written so long ago that I don't remember what that was, like, about.

494
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
And it just comes out kind of awkward.

495
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Yeah, it comes out like, this show is like this, and I think that it's-

496
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,600
I have a kind of, like, a default, like, voice that I use, which is like the-

497
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Oh, we know it.

498
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You know, the, hey, everybody, I'm watching this show, and it's great.

499
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:08,600
And, like, so when I don't remember what the original, like, feeling was, then I just try to do whatever, and it comes out really awkward.

500
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,600
And so, like, almost every video, Davoo had to, like, send me a sample of what it was going to sound like,

501
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
and I've been like, no, that's terrible. Let me do it again.

502
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah, like, the ten directing tricks in Avangelion video, you used to just read it,

503
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,600
your first version of that video, you read it like a normal video, which was pretty fast,

504
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,600
and it was just too fast for a video that was that intricate, so you recorded a slower version.

505
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Well, you say first, but that's, like, the fifth or sixth different version, because I wrote that back in December.

506
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Yeah, voiceover is a total bitch, with my, like, two of my more recent videos,

507
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,600
I just spent days on the voiceover trying to get it to be pretty good.

508
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
It's so hard to get that to come out natural.

509
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,600
You know, I know you guys accuse me of slurring in my words, because I rushed too much,

510
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
but my voiceover has gone pretty quick.

511
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,600
I prefer slurring over sounding awkward. That was a decision that I made at one point personally.

512
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,600
I would prefer not understanding, like, 0.5% of the words that a person says,

513
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,600
in exchange for them sounding way more natural.

514
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Fair enough.

515
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I also do have a trouble with, like, the, when I write something,

516
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,600
and it's, like, months before I actually start recording, because I take months to write anything,

517
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,600
and I can't remember what, I mean, I used to not remember what I was going for,

518
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,600
but now I go into intricate detail in describing how I'm supposed to say the thing in the script,

519
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
when I'm saying it.

520
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,600
So I write down in a voice like this, like in brackets or whatever.

521
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Do you also paste links to relevant things that remind you?

522
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Yeah, yeah, all that sort of stuff.

523
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Just stuff that puts me in that, like, remember, like, makes me remember,

524
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
oh yeah, that's the sort of thing I was going for.

525
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Like, if I sued, like, an early tag, like, early John Tron voice or something.

526
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I'll figure it out, you know? It usually works.

527
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Yeah, so maybe we should start, Digi, maybe at some point we should start doing more videos.

528
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,600
They're just sort of like a bunch of stuff that gets stapled together and made good through editing.

529
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:13,600
The only stuff I've really done in that style is, like, the Migraine and Insomnia analysis videos,

530
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,600
where, like, I was copying Jesse's style, and those are just, like, I would record a shit ton of random footage

531
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,600
and then just, like, put them all in whatever order made the most sense,

532
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,600
which is usually pretty much chronological order anyways, but, like...

533
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Well, Nate, I appreciate what you said, how, yeah, doing it between two people over the internet would be impossible.

534
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
I agree, I'm glad you brought that up.

535
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Because go to digibro.com slash binstainpatreon to give him more money,

536
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,600
because, like, at the rate that he's making money, we'll be able to, like, work together in person

537
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
before much longer.

538
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
That's very true.

539
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,600
You can get his, like, his Patreon to, like, what, like, I don't know, a thousand or maybe twelve hundred dollars per video?

540
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Yeah, I was about to make it the, like, eleven hundred dollar goal that I will just straight up move you up here if we hit that goal.

541
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Yeah, and we can work in person. There'll be so many benefits to it.

542
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,600
We could do videos like that, we could do, like, videos about, like, video games more easily,

543
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,600
because we were about to do one, but we scrapped it, because it was just too hard.

544
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Alright, before we get to it, I want to talk about who...

545
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Well, just go to his Patreon, do it.

546
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:24,600
As usual, the person who I think is pushing forward the medium here is our good friend, Endless Jess.

547
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,600
And that's because of the way he uses Patreon, which really fascinates me.

548
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,600
And I've been trying to, like, figure out, like, debating with myself over whether I want to try to do the same.

549
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Jesse, do you want to talk about how you use Patreon? Are you still there?

550
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Yeah, what? How, I mean, what do you mean?

551
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,600
How you, like, in the last six months, you adopted this new method of how you post to Patreon.

552
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Like, it used to be that you would only patron, like, certain videos that you thought were, like, the best ones?

553
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,600
I would worry that, I would worry that, like, people would patron for a certain thing,

554
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:10,600
and my stuff is so all over the place that, inevitably, I would post the wrong thing on Patreon, and people would un-pledge.

555
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:17,600
So, to skirt that issue, I just started posting everything I do on Patreon,

556
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:24,600
but, like, in chunks of, like, three or four or five things at a time, so nobody can complain because it's just a shitload of content.

557
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Is it like a text post with links?

558
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes.

559
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
And you ask to pay for the post?

560
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, because I've been a Patreon of everyone else in this call, and, like, or this whole group,

561
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,600
and, like, for instance, Tommy Oliver, he was the one who actually started it first, but he started doing it by week.

562
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
So, it's just whatever he put out that week, that's what he would patron.

563
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:55,600
So, he has it set to, like, you know, a, like, because when you start a Patreon, you either go monthly or you go by each post that you mark.

564
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,600
And so, he would just make a marked post at the end of each week, and whatever came out that week he would mark,

565
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,600
and that way, he didn't have to worry about whether Tommy Oliver or Rebel Pixels was the main one, it was just both.

566
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:14,600
And then Jesse started doing it, so it's basically just whenever he feels like there's enough content that it's worth marking.

567
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,600
So, sometimes it'll be, like, eight fucking Blue Glow videos that all get marked at once,

568
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,600
and then sometimes it'll be, like, I made this cool music video and also here's one Blue Glow video,

569
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,600
and it just kind of always feels like, I never feel like I'm getting ripped off anymore.

570
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:35,600
It's basically just, like, once I pass the threshold of, like, okay, this is enough, this is worth it.

571
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
This is worth your fucking money.

572
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,600
And so, like, I was considering, like, because with all the vlogs I've done this month,

573
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:48,600
I'm like, there's no way this is worth less, like, altogether than one, like, fully edited video.

574
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Like, I've made fucking 30 vlogs, a lot of them are really interesting.

575
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Some people have been saying that they find them as interesting as my mainline content,

576
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,600
so, like, you know, I haven't decided, I want to warn my patrons first,

577
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,600
and knowing me, because I've always been really strict about what I patron,

578
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,600
I've even had, like, main videos that I haven't patroned before,

579
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,600
just because I didn't think they were quite up to the, you know, up to the standard that I set for myself,

580
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,600
but, like, at some point, there's so many fucking vlogs that it has to be worth it.

581
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Like, even if it was just once a month that I actually marked them, I mean,

582
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,600
because surely a lot of my audience isn't even holding me up to that high,

583
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,600
like, the standard I'm holding myself up to, you know?

584
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
For sure, yeah, definitely.

585
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,600
You know, my downwell video is, like, two and a half minutes long, so I didn't patron it,

586
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,600
and I'm like, well, as soon as I make another two and a half minutes long video,

587
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,600
then I'll patron them both, and I've been waiting for, like, six months to make a video like that.

588
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Yeah, I don't mind so much if it's short, if it's got a great point, you know?

589
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,600
We can ASMR fart video. Those are big these days. Just do that.

590
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Like, for instance, the ten directing tricks in Ava video, like, because of the way we edited it,

591
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
we slowed it down considerably, and it ended up being five and a half minutes,

592
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,600
but the original way I had written it, it was supposed to only be a four-minute video,

593
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,600
and, like, when I was trying to edit it myself way back, it was gonna be four minutes,

594
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,600
and I was like, I'm completely comfortable patroning it because it's fast, but it's incredibly dense with information,

595
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
and all of it's interesting, and it's exactly what people come to my channel for,

596
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
so, of course, it's worth patroning, you know?

597
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,600
But then with vlogs, it's like, it could be the most interesting vlog in the universe,

598
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
and I don't know if it's something people want to pay for.

599
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Like, it's the hardest thing for me. It's like, just figuring out, like, do people care about the editing,

600
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
or do they care about the ideas, you know?

601
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
And so, like, I've probably made...

602
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Yeah, that's fair.

603
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Like, through Ad Revenue alone, I have probably made $150 off of all these vlogs that I've put out in the last couple weeks,

604
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
just because there's so fucking many of them, you know?

605
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,600
So, like, they're definitely becoming, like, a second revenue stream for the channel,

606
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,600
but it's a question of, how far do I take that?

607
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Do they need their own Patreon, you know?

608
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Because I think that's...

609
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Well, I don't think anyone would protest paying for that, those secret pics of you as a loli showdown.

611
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
That was invaluable insight.

612
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,600
But yeah, like, I mean, obviously I wouldn't want to mark every vlog,

613
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,600
but I really feel like if I keep doing things this way,

614
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,600
like, if it gets to a point where this vlogging addiction doesn't go away,

615
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
and I'm still posting, like, even one vlog a day,

616
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,600
I would definitely like to adopt Jesse's method of, like, here's everything I put out this week,

617
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,600
and surely that's enough to be worth paying for, you know?

618
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Which has been working for Jesse.

619
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,600
His Patreon's been climbing back up after it was kind of falling from exactly the problem he was describing.

620
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,600
People not, like, you know, people getting things that weren't exactly what they wanted,

621
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,600
and now it's like, well, now you're just getting everything, you know?

622
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,600
And even for me, like, I reduced my pledge back when Jesse was doing that,

623
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,600
where sometimes I was like, I don't know if some of these videos are worth it,

624
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,600
but now that I get, like, 18 fucking videos at once,

625
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,600
then I really, like, one blue glow would definitely not be worth the money.

626
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
But ten of them I can't argue with.

627
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Like, there's too much of good in that number of blue glows.

628
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
And since you lowered your pledge,

629
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,600
that means you've been missing out on all the fantastic Patreon-exclusive $3 My Little Pony vlogs

630
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,600
that you find folk can see right now for a $3 pledge every single week.

631
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Since I'm the only one of these J-Brones who still gives crap about My Little Pony,

632
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
I'm watching that shit every week.

633
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm talking about all the cool fucking, talking about great vlogs, the best vlogs,

634
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,600
the only vlogs that anyone really wants to see or needs to see,

635
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,600
is fucking pony vlogs available only on my Patreon-exclusive only for patrons,

636
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,600
and nobody else can see them.

637
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
It's a secret to everybody. That's a video game reference.

638
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,600
I got all the references, motherfucker.

639
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
And it's great that those are only for patrons,

640
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,600
because you don't want the mainstream getting access to your opinions on pony episodes.

641
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
That's right.

642
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
They don't deserve it, do they?

643
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
The world doesn't really deserve it.

644
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,600
The patrons deserve it, man, because they fucking...

645
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Did you imagine if your most boring taste in anime video had been exclusive to patrons?

646
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
That would have gone over a lot better,

647
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
because only people who get where you're coming from would have seen it.

648
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
Yeah.

649
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Would you agree?

650
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
Uh, I guess so.

651
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
I still think it's worth being out there, just because it's...

652
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,600
It's also, like, on the one hand, while, like, the amount of drama it caused

653
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
was, like, ridiculous and stupid,

654
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,600
A, I made $60 off of it, at least,

655
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,600
and B, it's pretty fucking hilarious.

656
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Some men just want to watch the world burn for $60.

657
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I've been having some back-and-forths with people,

658
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,600
and one guy in particular, in trying to debunk your postulate there,

659
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
pretty much confirmed everything you said.

660
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
He was like,

661
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Well, you know, you should look at your tastes beyond personal enjoyment.

662
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Oh, yeah.

663
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
There's more to it.

664
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
There's more to just how much you enjoy something.

665
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,600
I'm like, all right, right there is a mentality that he was talking about

666
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,600
when he was talking about this boring perspective of media.

667
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,600
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

668
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
I think that was true for a lot.

669
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Like, there was a lot of comments that were...

670
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Because this video became, like, a meme on 4chan,

671
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,600
like, where the 3x3 threads have been infected with people talking about it for fucking days.

672
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Yeah, they saw that.

673
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
And, uh, like...

674
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
They're still doing it.

675
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,600
But the funniest part is, like, people who were saying, like,

676
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,600
this guy's just butt-hurt because people don't like...

677
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Like, people don't like K-On,

678
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
and so he's, like, defending it by, you know, insulting other people's tastes.

679
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,600
And, like, that is literally what I'm commenting on,

680
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,600
is that people don't feel like they can, like, you know, put a show like K-On on their list

681
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
because people have this mentality.

682
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
So, like, that's exactly what I'm saying.

683
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Yeah, I'm surprised they didn't understand your point.

684
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
I mean, you know.

685
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,600
You two commenters not understanding the point.

686
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,600
I don't believe you, sir.

687
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Fighting the ocean.

688
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Talking about the upper echelon of the intelligentsia.

689
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Yeah.

690
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,600
But, yeah, so, like, to some extent, it was, like,

691
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,600
it was fascinating and hilarious to watch it happen.

692
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,600
You know, like, there's two levels.

693
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
There's a level on which it's happening to me,

694
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,600
and that's annoying,

695
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
but then there's a level on which I'm standing back

696
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
and watching it happen and thinking it's really funny.

697
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,600
So, uh, yeah, I could appreciate it being out there.

698
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:26,600
But, yeah, speaking of Patreon, if you pledge to our Patreon,

699
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,600
me and DeVoo, we do this series of three-hour commentaries

700
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,600
on all the videos I've ever made.

701
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,600
That's what we're doing.

702
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Oh, yeah, which I've still never seen any of.

703
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Are any of those available as, like, a sample?

704
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,600
No, but I could make you one if you actually want to watch it.

705
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
I want to, like, end some video with a...

706
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
No, I figure you would.

707
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,600
I'm just asking for the folks back home.

708
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Yeah, well, I want to have some Digi video

709
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,600
that ends with a big promotion of all the Patreon rewards,

710
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,600
and it'll have a little couple minutes of sampling

711
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
or a couple seconds or whatever, showing what it's like.

712
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,600
That is a good idea.

713
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,600
It's the definitive insight to every detail about his content.

714
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,600
Yeah, it's me and DeVoo ranting about our videos

715
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
for hours and hours and hours.

716
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
Oh, just yours.

717
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
I mean, you know, the ones I worked on as well.

718
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Well, in the ones that we work, like, that DeVoo edited,

719
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
DeVoo does more of the talking

720
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,600
and is very proud of himself for all the things he's done.

721
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,600
I just find it really entertaining how, like,

722
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,600
how proud of yourself you can get in some of those moments.

723
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Well, at least in the Sword Art Online 2 ones,

724
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
where that was the ones where I put the most...

725
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
I blew the most time per second.

726
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,600
Yeah, when you edit a video, which I know a thing or two about,

727
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,600
you, like, every frame on screen comes with, like,

728
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,600
hours of thought, of concentration about choosing why you chose this one.

729
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,600
Man, if I did a commentary on my shit,

730
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,600
I'm just saying, like, I could talk about any frame extensively

731
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
as to why I chose that particular one.

732
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600
Yeah, I definitely believe that with you more than anyone else.

733
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,600
Well, I don't know, mostly just the Sword Art Online 2 ones.

734
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,600
Those are the most dense ones.

735
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,600
When we eventually get to the Astroscore videos,

736
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,600
it'll be a lot more sparse.

737
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,600
Alright, well, I don't know if anybody else has anything else to say about vlogging.

738
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,600
I just want to say I plan on doing more because it's really fun.

739
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,600
Yeah.

740
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,600
And I enjoy it.

741
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,600
I just kind of like, I like that this is where YouTube is going.

742
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
You know, it is kind of fun.

743
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,600
I enjoy the improv comedy of it.

744
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,600
Me too.

745
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,600
I like it as...

746
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Like, remember when that video when Ryuko fell down?

747
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,600
I didn't plan that shit.

748
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
That was hilarious.

749
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,600
And that was pretty funny.

750
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
That makes me laugh.

751
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,600
But that's the thing, and that's what people have to appreciate.

752
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
It wasn't just funny because she fell down,

753
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
but the thing you said was,

754
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,600
because you said, oh, she knew she didn't belong,

755
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
so she got out of here.

756
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,600
I thought that was pretty hilarious.

757
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
Yeah, right.

758
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,600
And you know, and this is going to be,

759
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,600
I'm going to drop a bombshell here for the end of this.

760
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
Okay, I'm ready.

761
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,600
So, I got to ask,

762
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,600
haven't we kind of exhausted the genre of heavily edited videos?

763
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Like...

764
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,600
No, you can never...

765
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,600
That's like asking if we've exhausted the genre of heavily edited movies.

766
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
The answer is no.

767
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
You can just make more.

768
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
What do you mean heavily edited?

769
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Do you mean like text flying all over the screen?

770
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
What I mean is like...

771
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
I know what you mean, you son of a bitch.

772
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,600
I mean, are we doing anything really that new and inventive

773
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:40,600
by making like, you know, another 40 minute video with like all the same,

774
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,600
and then we say a joke and cut to a big explosion.

775
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,600
Like, we kind of covered it at this point.

776
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
I'll tell you straight out, Digi,

777
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:54,600
I am not really concerned about being a genre trendsetter.

778
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
That is not my primary goal.

779
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,600
My goal is to make the videos that I would enjoy watching, probably.

780
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
And it's true, you do get burned out.

781
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Like even at John's heyday, I sort of was getting bored of them

782
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,600
because they sort of were just the same stuff repeatedly.

783
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,600
But I kind of think that's inevitable with all art.

784
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Like you've got to...

785
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,600
I'm sure one day, if I start doing this professionally

786
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
and I'm grinding away every day,

787
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,600
without a doubt, I'm sure I'll get tired of doing that kind of shit eventually.

788
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Digi, by heavily edited, you mean like demo, right?

789
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,600
Or like a sort of online...

790
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,600
You mean like comedy reviewer editing.

791
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Yeah, comedy reviewer editing is really what I mean.

792
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,600
I mean like, there was a time back in 2012...

793
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
I fucking hate demo editing style.

794
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
I'm so over it.

795
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,600
Over what? Over who's editing style?

796
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,600
That whole breakneck, everything's flying at the screen at once.

797
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,600
Every half a second, there's some non sequitur shooting out of the side of the screen.

798
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,600
Because like Nate, to be honest, when I watched the Undertale video,

799
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,600
it was really well done, but that video felt to me like,

800
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,600
this is the last one of these I need to see.

801
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Like from now on...

802
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600
For Undertale, that's absolutely true.

803
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:16,600
I mean, I'm excited that you're not going to keep doing videos that are that extreme

804
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:21,600
because I've seen this now enough times.

805
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,600
I got onto YouTube in 2012 through Sequelitis.

806
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,600
Sequelitis was my introduction to the idea of being subscribed to people,

807
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,600
to follow their content regularly.

808
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,600
I had the Sequelitis videos, I had the JonTron videos,

809
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,600
these highly edited jokes and gags thrown into a review kind of thing.

810
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,600
And back then, you needed all that to get people's attention.

811
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,600
And it was always like, I mean, those were all funny at the time,

812
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,600
but like the entire idea of that is like, I get it now, it's done.

813
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Like we've done all the fun.

814
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
I totally feel you.

815
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,600
And this is why it's going to be so important that people see my next video,

816
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,600
because I think you're going to see some things that are happening

817
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,600
as to my...

818
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,600
I've had a grand vision all along for what I do with these things,

819
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,600
but you know what, forget me, I want to ask you a question about this exact topic.

820
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,600
Why is it that...

821
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,600
Okay, I understand your point, but let me...

822
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,600
I just want to ask why knowing all that, feeling the way that you do about this stuff,

823
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,600
why is it that you're still interested to get a new Plinket video?

824
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,600
You know, what is it about that makes you want that?

825
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,600
I'm not that interested to get a new Plinket video, really.

826
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Well, in your other videos, you said like,

827
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,600
you know, we might not have gotten a new Plinket video,

828
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
but at least we got this guy ever...

829
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Well, that's the thing, that was before it was done.

830
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,600
Like, Undertale was the last one I ever feel like I need.

831
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Like, I don't...

832
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
Okay, okay.

833
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,600
Like, there was a point, like for instance, back when we did Pony,

834
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,600
like, you know, you love Anthony C's Cantorlot wedding video.

835
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
Sure do.

836
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,600
And when it came out, it was really big and beautiful and a great idea,

837
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,600
but then, with Anthony C, he continued to, like, you know...

838
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
He only puts out a video, like, every four months,

839
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,600
and it was always a 15-minute video, and it was always highly edited,

840
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,600
and I was always like, dude, I don't care anymore about the editing stuff,

841
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,600
like, because he would make a video where the point is, like, one minute long,

842
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
like, the actual analytical point he was making.

843
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Remember when he edited it in?

844
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
I don't know if you've been watching him recently,

845
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,600
but he did, like, this, like, musical skit in the middle of, like,

846
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
a review of, like, season five or something,

847
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,600
and, like, it was just like, can we please hurry this along?

848
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
This is so boring.

849
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Right.

850
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
That was...

851
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
You know what?

852
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
I think I know what it is.

853
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Super dense editing videos.

854
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
And no offense, Anthony, I love what you do,

855
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,600
but I think you could freshen it up a little bit, if you happen to be seeing this, you know?

856
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
Yeah, yeah, fresh.

857
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
Fresh is important.

858
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,600
You know, I think that super dense editing in videos is, like, super fast rapping.

859
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
That is a good comparison.

860
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
In rapping.

861
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Yeah.

862
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
It's like...

863
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
It's the best that should happen all the time,

864
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,600
and the whole song should be comprised of nothing but a twist of baby.

865
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,600
But, like, you know, if you have really conservative views of it,

866
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,600
sometimes you can use density to, like, make a point.

867
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Like, we sort of did that in part one of Digi's Nanoha retrospective.

868
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,600
At the very beginning, where he mentions that this is such a huge franchise

869
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
with so many different little facets,

870
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,600
I just showed every image of everything in it all at once really fast to make that point.

871
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
I think a better example would be...

872
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,600
I think, like, for me, like, going forward,

873
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,600
I think Asterisk War was, like, the perfect level of, like,

874
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,600
it wasn't about dense editing.

875
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,600
It was about making this point and always feeling, like,

876
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,600
like, what was on screen was, like, the amount that needed to be there.

877
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
It was...

878
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,600
Yeah.

879
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,600
There were times where I said, like, every A1 pictures show looks the same,

880
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,600
and we had to show 40 different pictures of someone's face that all looked the same,

881
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,600
and it was this really well-edited segment you put together,

882
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
and that was perfect for that moment.

883
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,600
But if there's a part where I'm just literally describing what's happening in an episode,

884
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
we don't need to show anything but show footage, you know?

885
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,600
You know, dude, I hear what you're saying, and I agree,

886
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,600
but, you know, I just don't think that my personal intentions are as...

887
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,600
are kind of... are the same old thing that you've seen in all these.

888
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I think I've got some new ideas people are gonna see, like,

889
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,600
like, when you did that McDonald's bit in your Asterisk War thing,

890
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,600
that was, like, the best part of the whole thing by a huge margin.

891
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,600
But that was just so fresh.

892
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,600
That was just a little segment, though.

893
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,600
That's, like, I'm saying that that's what makes this perfect.

894
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,600
That's right.

895
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
I think what...

896
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,600
I'm not saying don't do any editing at all in your videos anymore.

897
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
You want a variety in speed.

898
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Right.

899
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,600
That's basically it.

900
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,600
You just... you want to do...

901
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
You want to be using things that are appropriate.

902
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Like, if there's first things you gotta do, you gotta do them first.

903
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
I'm completely...

904
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
You need to slow down at some points.

905
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,600
I'm completely with Jesse about this whole Demolition D thing,

906
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,600
where, like, because what was so exhausting to me about his last video,

907
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
the one about Himoto Umaru-chan,

908
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,600
was that it was, like, every second of it was so dense with stuff going on,

909
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,600
and the subject of the video was so uninteresting,

910
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,600
that it was, like, why is this happening?

911
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Like, why are we...

912
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,600
Why are you putting so much into, like, this...

913
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,600
Like, every second of this, when half of it...

914
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
You're not even saying anything.

915
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,600
Like, he just...

916
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Well...

917
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Cut away constantly to make little...

918
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,600
There's always gonna be a place for stuff that's, like, really fast and flashy,

919
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,600
because kids just, like, seeing bright colors and...

920
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,600
It's not about kids.

921
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,600
Demo's videos are more...

922
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,600
Well, sometimes.

923
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,600
...flastic-jontron than they are, like, DigiBro,

924
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,600
or ReviewerX, whoever the fuck they are.

925
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,600
Like, they're about the spectacle of the thing, like, a little bit,

926
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
especially that last one.

927
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Like, the point of that video was that it was cool to watch,

928
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
that, you know, there was crazy stuff happening,

929
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
and then, like, also Himoto sucks, you know?

930
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,600
I don't find the spectacle of it impressive, though,

931
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
because, like, for...

932
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,600
For JonTron, the moments you remember are, like...

933
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Not that it was, like, every five seconds there was a gag.

934
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,600
The moments you remember were the big gags, the ones that, like, the fact that the...

935
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,600
Like, when Banjo3, like, takes over his shit and, like, the Eye of Sauron appears,

936
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
like, yeah, that was great.

937
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Like, the Banjo-Kazooie video is perfect because there's a long section in the middle of it,

938
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
where he's just describing the history of Rareware.

939
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,600
There's not, like, a ton of, like, stuff happening.

940
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,600
Like, there's one shot he lingers on for, like, a whole 30 seconds

941
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,600
of just a guy holding a controller in front of a TV.

942
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,600
It's, like, literally the Blue Glow.

943
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,600
Like, it looks just like Jesse's, uh, like, Blue Glow avatar thing,

944
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,600
but it's, like, a photo of just a guy sitting in the dark playing video games,

945
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,600
and he's describing the feeling of doing that when you're a kid,

946
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,600
and it's this incredibly long shot.

947
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
And then it goes right from that.

948
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,600
That's what I'm saying. It's the ebb and flow.

949
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,600
Well, it's the action and then the passivity of the thing.

950
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,600
Honestly, when you talk about the long shots, I think the long shots were because of budgetary limitations.

951
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,600
That's why they held on to 30-second shots without moving.

952
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,600
Oh, no, I just had to have John sit there for 30 seconds,

953
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,600
because he ran out of budget to film more footage of the Ava's punching.

954
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,600
But, yeah, like, in that video, in the nuts and bolts video,

955
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,600
the moment that you remember is when it all builds up to him,

956
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,600
cars, cars, and die!

957
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
That moment is so dense,

958
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,600
and because none of the rest of the video is that dense,

959
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,600
there's, like, you know, suddenly there's five layers of video on top of each other,

960
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,600
and he's screaming, and there's sounds and fire, and, like, it's intense.

961
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,600
And if Demo tried to put that moment into his Himoto video,

962
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,600
it would just be static, because the whole video's like that already.

963
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,600
It's all fucking shit happening.

964
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:34,600
Another great example, fantastic example, to go back to, is a horseshoe finale.

965
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,600
That video is like, I don't know, at least 50% like, guys sits in front of the camera

966
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,600
and talks a script.

967
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,600
But then there are, like, all these different moments with lots of original graphics

968
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,600
and an occasional moment and a bunch of fast editing.

969
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Yeah, if you're trying to make an argument for, like, a rising and falling action

970
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,600
throughout a video, then I couldn't agree more.

971
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
That's absolutely essential for a good narrative.

972
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
You've got to have that.

973
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,600
I think a perfect example of, like, a really fastly edited video

974
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,600
is another Jesse thing, it's the Madako Magica thing on my Japanese anime,

975
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,600
where it's just really fast, really, I think it's the fact that he's doing all the,

976
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,600
like, the Dr. Seuss rhyming stuff.

977
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,600
God damn it! It's not Dr. Seuss!

978
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,600
One more fucking person uses that analogy!

979
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:23,600
Oh my god, you're banned from my friends list, you're banned from the CCP!

980
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
What would you prefer if you referred to as Jesse?

981
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,600
I just fucking can't stand redundant, unoriginal fucking people who,

982
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,600
they see, like, the title of the Reddit post and they all got to say the same fucking thing.

983
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Like, God damn it!

984
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,600
The video was posted on Best Guy Ever.

985
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,600
Like, really? Is Dr. Seuss the only person you can think of in history

986
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:52,600
who ever came up with rhyme schemes or, like, a complicated fucking rhyme scheme ever?

987
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,600
You've, like, never heard of it?

988
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,600
I thought of it as more of a rap song when I first heard it.

989
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,600
Yeah, you know, there's this entire genre of music.

990
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,600
It's kind of like this huge phenomenon for the last, like, 35 years called rap.

991
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,600
You know? Oh, and there's this other thing.

992
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,600
You know, I think it actually existed before Dr. Seuss.

993
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
It was called poetry.

994
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
God, how long has that been around?

995
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,600
About 11,000 fucking years?

996
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,600
You goddamn simpletons! You rubes! You fucking idiots!

997
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Oh, man, he's like the Dr. Seuss of anime.

998
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Oh, man, Dr. Seuss, eat your heart out.

999
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,600
This guy's like Dr. Seuss.

1000
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,600
Monika, Monika Magica!

1001
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,600
More like Monika Dr. Seussica!

1002
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,600
Ugh!

1003
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,600
Fucking!

1004
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
Fuck us!

1005
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,600
Yeah, uh, I agree.

1006
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,600
I'm guessing, Hippo, that you didn't know that people constantly compare that video to Dr. Seuss.

1007
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,600
No, I did. I said it on purpose.

1008
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Oh, you son of a bitch!

1009
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,600
You activated his trap card.

1010
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,600
He's like a damn fiddle!

1011
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,600
It was him, Austin! It was him all along!

1012
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,600
You all bought it, hook, lied, and sinker!

1013
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,600
Your own family bought it!

1014
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,600
Why, Triple H, why? Someone tell me why!

1015
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
You know, that's a good point.

1016
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,600
You know, like, wrestling is mostly like, what, half scripted, half live?

1017
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,600
All those promos are like vlogs. There's no tight editing in the WWE.

1018
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:40,600
I mean, the entirety of reality TV is pretty much this, although that shit mostly sucks.

1019
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
But like, yeah, I don't know.

1020
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,600
I think that's the future we're going into.

1021
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:53,600
And I like it, and I like this idea of, like, longer content and not everything having to be as...

1022
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Like, if you go back and watch Sequelitis now, I promise you that as great as it is, as great as the points he's making are,

1023
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,600
there are ports where you're just like, alright, get to the point.

1024
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Like, if you watch it now, the flash is the least interesting element of it.

1025
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,600
The parts where...

1026
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Okay, but if you want someone to get to the point, watching like their entire Let's Play history is kind of the opposite of what you're asking for there.

1027
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,600
Well, the point in the Let's Play videos is chilling out and listening to people talk,

1028
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,600
and you don't really have to pay that much attention to it, you know?

1029
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,600
But like, I just think that if those, if the Sequelitis videos were made today,

1030
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,600
they would look more like a Mr. B-Tongue video, where like, there's jokes,

1031
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,600
there's stuff to make it flow in a certain way, you know?

1032
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:45,600
His videos all have, like you said, a rising and falling action, they feel like a story,

1033
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,600
but they also never waste your time.

1034
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:53,600
And there's no jokes that are just there because there had to be a joke there, you know?

1035
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
And I would defend...

1036
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,600
Anybody who puts a joke there that isn't funny, or is just like,

1037
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,600
now I've got to go from one paragraph to the other, let's put in a lame joke.

1038
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
Those people...

1039
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,600
Yeah, I can't stand that shit.

1040
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,600
They suck.

1041
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,600
They watch the Peanut Butter Gamer style of video.

1042
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,600
I hate you, Peanut Butter Gamer!

1043
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
No, he's just...

1044
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,600
Hold on, hold on.

1045
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,600
Don't be a hero to Peanut Butter Gamer.

1046
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,600
He's mediocre.

1047
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
You have to have actual points in between the jokes.

1048
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,600
It can't...

1049
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,600
Yeah.

1050
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,600
And some of the jokes have to be funny sometimes.

1051
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
Well, that's...

1052
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,600
That's for sure.

1053
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
I don't know, you know what?

1054
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,600
I'm totally willing to admit that a lot of this is just anger

1055
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,600
at people who are successful doing things that appear to me to be low effort.

1056
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,600
That makes me extremely angry.

1057
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,600
I want people to fucking work themselves with a bone

1058
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,600
and fucking be destroyed on the path to greatness.

1059
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,600
That's what I want people to do, you know?

1060
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Yeah, well, there is a lot of thought that goes into just editing footage,

1061
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,600
like all those videos I've done...

1062
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
Oh, no, I mean, if you're talking about somebody like PewDiePie,

1063
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,600
that's absolutely true.

1064
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,600
He edits the shit out of those videos, and it's usually pretty cool.

1065
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,600
I'd put PewDiePie significantly above Game Grumps, even at their best,

1066
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,600
in terms of what I, you know...

1067
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Well, you know, I think that there's certain people...

1068
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Like, sure, some people are famous, and it can be...

1069
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,600
Like, you watch their videos, you know, like, how the fuck is this possible?

1070
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
But, like, for people like Game Grumps,

1071
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,600
I thought their show was usually pretty funny,

1072
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,600
and they were always, like, they refused to ever be silent.

1073
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,600
They were always talking, they were always trying to make new points,

1074
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
up until more recently, where they've totally fallen apart,

1075
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,600
because they're not doing this anymore.

1076
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,600
But, you know, they always had stories, they always had stuff to do,

1077
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,600
and both of, like...

1078
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,600
When I say both of them, I mean, whichever combination you're talking about,

1079
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,600
they're comedians, like, they're trained comedians.

1080
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,600
They're people who've taken improv classes.

1081
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,600
They've all taken classes, they've all taken improv classes,

1082
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
they talk about it all the time.

1083
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,600
Oh, yeah, and I took Spanish classes in high school,

1084
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
and I can fucking speak that shit, like...

1085
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Like, Mocholoco, Spaniola.

1086
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,600
My point is, they practice at it, and they cared about being funny,

1087
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,600
for a long time, they cared about...

1088
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
They cared about at least being interesting.

1089
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,600
They don't care anymore, they're just in it for the money now.

1090
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Like, there was a long period where they cared about being funny and interesting.

1091
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,600
You know, DJ, I'm not contradicting you,

1092
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,600
I just want to say that the change that guys like you say

1093
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,600
has happened in Game Grumps that they're shit now,

1094
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,600
to me, I just don't see a difference.

1095
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
I don't see what changed.

1096
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
That's because you weren't here for the John stuff.

1097
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
That's true.

1098
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,600
Well, also, even a lot of...

1099
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,600
If I showed you one of the best episodes of a Dan Let's Play,

1100
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,600
and then a current episode, I think you'd get it.

1101
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,600
There's moments in Bloodborne where they'll tell a really compelling,

1102
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,600
interesting story about something they were doing,

1103
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,600
and now it's just nothing.

1104
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
It's literally nothing.

1105
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,600
They'll start up an episode like, hey, we're...

1106
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,600
Mario Maker Episode 725.

1107
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,600
This level was sent to us by this guy.

1108
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,600
I ate a burrito today.

1109
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,600
If we bring on Rob Schneider, that will make us relevant.

1110
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Yay!

1111
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,600
For me, again, my rule has always been,

1112
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
don't make a video, I wouldn't watch,

1113
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,600
and the only reason I do so many podcasts and vlogs now

1114
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,600
is that I feel confident that I'm fucking good at this.

1115
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,600
I've always been good at manipulating my voice,

1116
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,600
because it's just something I've been practicing my whole fucking life.

1117
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,600
I've always been singing, I've always been doing voices.

1118
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,600
My mom does voices, so that was kind of instilled in me at a young age.

1119
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
You still can't do an English accent, though.

1120
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,600
What?

1121
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,600
You still can't do an English accent, though.

1122
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Not well.

1123
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
Oh, I'm crikey, mate.

1124
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,600
I can do an English accent as fucking all day.

1125
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,600
You know what I'm saying, governor?

1126
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,600
That's my English accent.

1127
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,600
Well, if I was almost worse.

1128
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,600
I've got a lot of different types of English accents

1129
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
that I tried to do.

1130
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
That's cool, mate.

1131
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,600
At the L.O.L.S. which...

1132
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,600
I don't know.

1133
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,600
You've got to hold your nose.

1134
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Hello, governor!

1135
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Yeah!

1136
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,600
But yeah, like, for me, it was like Scotland.

1137
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
It's just I!

1138
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,600
Welcome to England!

1139
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,600
This is how we talk in the great L.O.L.

1140
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
where the English people live.

1141
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Who invited the bop-a-dook on this show?

1142
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,600
Get the fuck out of here.

1143
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
Um, yeah, so...

1144
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
But yeah, like, as I was saying...

1145
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,600
Wait, no, that was the bloody dead man.

1146
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,600
No, I don't know.

1147
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,600
I feel very trained, especially from the pub crawl.

1148
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,600
Because pub crawl was like two hours twice a week

1149
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,600
for fucking three years

1150
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,600
that I've just been talking unscripted forever.

1151
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,600
You know, and then doing Digi Bros.

1152
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,600
just, like, stacked on top of that.

1153
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,600
And if you compare, like, GameCube chats

1154
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,600
which was the Let's Play show I tried to do

1155
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
back when I first started, like, YouTubing,

1156
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,600
it was fucking awful.

1157
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,600
Like, none of us knew how to talk.

1158
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
None of us knew how to, like, you know,

1159
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
keep a subject going.

1160
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,600
I would edit those videos to, like,

1161
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,600
cut out all the boring parts.

1162
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,600
So they were completely incomprehensible.

1163
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,600
It's boring parts.

1164
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
So I would cut, like, I would just cut to the parts

1165
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
where we're talking.

1166
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,600
And it would be nonsense.

1167
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,600
No one knew what the fuck we were doing.

1168
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,600
So then, like, with Digi Bros.

1169
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,600
when we started it and it was actually good,

1170
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,600
it was like, oh, my God, this is watchable.

1171
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,600
Like, people will sit through this.

1172
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,600
I'll sit through this.

1173
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,600
And so, like, you know, like,

1174
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,600
even though I'm vlogging now

1175
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
and those vlogs may seem like, you know,

1176
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,600
just a low effort thrown together content,

1177
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,600
especially because I've got, like,

1178
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,600
what's what got me to start doing it

1179
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
is that I stopped hooking up a microphone.

1180
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,600
Because up until recently,

1181
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
I've been, like, such a stickler for audio quality

1182
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,600
that I, like, would always, you know,

1183
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,600
hook up my nice mic and everything.

1184
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,600
And, like, I'd have to move my whole setup

1185
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,600
and put everything there.

1186
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,600
And so finally, I just made the decision that, like,

1187
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
you know what, the camera audio's good enough.

1188
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,600
No one's gonna complain about it.

1189
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Fuck it.

1190
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
I'm just gonna turn on the camera

1191
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,600
and talk directly into it.

1192
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,600
So that's what all these vlogs have been.

1193
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
But, like, I think that at this point,

1194
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,600
I have enough camera presence

1195
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,600
and I can talk unscripted well enough.

1196
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,600
I mean, listen, I've been rambling for fucking

1197
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,600
seven straight minutes now and, like, uninterrupted

1198
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
with no pauses.

1199
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,600
I don't even think I've said um in, like, a while.

1200
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,600
So, you know, I think I have the skills to do.

1201
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
I'm not even here right now.

1202
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,600
My asshole is so itchy.

1203
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,600
It's, like, it's just white noise, you guys.

1204
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,600
I'm in a world of fucking...

1205
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,600
Of ass itch.

1206
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
Of just, like, please stop talking

1207
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,600
so I can get in the shower.

1208
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,600
Just share it, too.

1209
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,600
Let's all take showers and jack off at the same time.

1210
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,600
That's a good idea.

1211
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,600
We'll try to synchronize it.

1212
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,600
I think that's what killed the Ghostbusters

1213
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
jacking off at the same time.

1214
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Isn't that, that's what happened, right?

1215
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,600
If we can all come at once, we can close the portal though.

1216
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Yeah.

1217
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,600
We're not talking about, like, more basic editing styles,

1218
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
not having layers.

1219
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,600
Why has no one made that porn?

1220
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,600
Crossing the streams.

1221
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Holy shit.

1222
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
I think they have.

1223
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
Like, you know, making layer after layer

1224
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,600
of, like, editing and visuals going on.

1225
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
If you just, if you do just basic stuff,

1226
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,600
like cutting between footage or just having a few images

1227
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,600
at a time, there's a lot of craftsmanship

1228
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,600
that goes into that, too.

1229
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,600
And I think a lot of people are realizing this

1230
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,600
with people like Nerdwriter.

1231
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,600
His videos never have so many things going on at once.

1232
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,600
It's just he always, he obviously has memorized

1233
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,600
every friggin' Adobe Premiere filter.

1234
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,600
Yeah.

1235
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,600
And...

1236
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
Yeah, Nerdwriter and...

1237
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
What's that new guy?

1238
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,600
Captain Christian?

1239
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Oh, yeah.

1240
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Nice guy, man.

1241
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,600
Like, knows how...

1242
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,600
Like, the perfect sort of...

1243
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,600
His videos are so fuckin' pretty, man.

1244
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
It makes me mad how pretty they are.

1245
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
I've never made a video that was as pretty

1246
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,600
as I wanted it to be.

1247
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
One day.

1248
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,600
One day.

1249
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,600
The fact that Captain Christian can do that shit

1250
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,600
in two weeks, that right there is like...

1251
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,600
It's impossible.

1252
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,600
How is it possible?

1253
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,600
You know what it is?

1254
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
You know what?

1255
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I bet he is a professional editor who has decided,

1256
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,600
like, Jesus, I can just make YouTube videos

1257
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,600
and I'll do way better.

1258
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,600
He left a comment about that somewhere,

1259
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,600
that, like, he said he went to school for it,

1260
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
but he actually responded to Nino.

1261
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
Like, he said he...

1262
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
Whoa!

1263
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Because Nino was saying that, like,

1264
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600
sometimes people show up and they...

1265
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
You can tell that they've had experience with YouTube,

1266
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,600
or, like, that this isn't their first channel.

1267
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Yeah, yeah.

1268
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,600
And so he said that to, like, me, that guy,

1269
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,600
and someone else, might have been every frame.

1270
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,600
And he was like, you know,

1271
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,600
I know every frame is trained,

1272
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,600
but I don't know about Captain Christian.

1273
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
And Captain Christian said,

1274
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,600
I went to school for it, like, briefly,

1275
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
but I didn't learn as much as I learned

1276
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,600
from just watching YouTube.

1277
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,600
So, he's a really self-taught.

1278
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
He's a really self-taught.

1279
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Who we should all fear.

1280
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,600
It does sound like that's kind of genius level.

1281
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,600
Oh, wait, we need to make him a TPC member

1282
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,600
so we can absorb him before he goes wild.

1283
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,600
I'm fine with that idea.

1284
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Who was that?

1285
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,600
I don't know.

1286
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
I have no idea.

1287
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,600
The guy who did that X-Men video about the Coliseus.

1288
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,600
The Coliseus video was great.

1289
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
Yeah.

1290
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
Yeah, he's literally the perfect YouTuber.

1291
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Like, everything he did was perfect so far,

1292
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,600
and he's gained immediate success and fame for it.

1293
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Well, there's one big problem with his content.

1294
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,600
It's not a vlog.

1295
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,600
And with that, let's wrap this thing up.

1296
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
That's all.

1297
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
Yeah.

1298
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Let's all say goodbye now.

1299
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,600
Oh, wait, we've got...

1300
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,600
Let's say goodbye, but don't stop recording.

1302
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,600
Okay.

1303
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,600
Bye.

1304
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,600
We're going to say goodbye.

1305
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,600
Goodbye.

1306
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Okay, we're done.
