00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It is January 24th, 2021, and it's the new episode.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm Ben Saint, and also there's Gibbontake. It's been one week since the last PCP.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:39,040
I lost my watch at a party once. An hour later, I saw some guy stepping on it while he was sexually

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,920
harassing a woman. Infuriated, I went up to him, punched him, and broke his nose. Nobody does that

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:01:03,520
to a woman, not on my watch. YouTube.com slash Gamers Tavern Show. Tell your friends even if

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,040
they're imaginary. I didn't see that punchline coming, so I'll give you that one. I think I heard

7
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,640
that one before. I don't know where. Probably one of my videos. Maybe. Don't tell me you reuse

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,920
material. I would never do that. The greatest comedians tell a joke one time ever and then throw

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,240
it out and never repeat it under any circumstances. That's what the professionals do. I've been watching

10
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,000
these videos of Stuart Lee, this comedian. He's a British comedian and he's like,

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:50,800
I'd never heard of him before because he hates the whole TV scene. He just likes doing shows,

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,360
which means he's better because he's not stupid and lame and on TV and all that shit.

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:09,120
So what does he do? He sells DVDs of his clubs, clubs and stadiums and stuff. He's quite popular,

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,520
but he doesn't do the TV circuit of being on panel shows and whatever.

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,520
But I see sometimes, I see a bit of his where it's like, I know this bit. I've watched this bit in a

16
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,920
different video, in a different DVD special. I've seen this bit before. I think he sucks now. I don't

17
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
like him and in fact, I'm going to unsubscribe to this random YouTuber who isn't him.

18
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
Absolutely. So he reuses material too?

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,920
Yeah. When I hear a band play a song a second time, I'm like, that's it. You guys are hacks.

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,520
You guys are over. How can you reuse material? This is blatant. You're literally plagiarizing

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,880
yourself. Yeah. When I listen to an album, I'm like, I've listened to this part before.

22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,560
Skips to the new part. Skips to the new part. It's like each song is like a piece of thin ice

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,320
over a lake and you can skate on it like only so many times before it cracks and it's no longer

24
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,600
usable. You have to skate on other songs. Yeah. I need to get some new material because...

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,160
I have many people are saying this. I need to get new material because this cotton shirt just

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:33,840
isn't working out for me. I suggest Rayon. Big Rayon fan. Underrated. Underrated textile there.

27
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,280
Somebody messaged me after last week's episode to ask me like, hey, I loved your font recommendations.

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,760
Do you have any more fonts you recommend? And I was like, no. I named all the good ones.

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,320
You mean you were still doing that? There are no more. Because I think you were recommending

30
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,720
fonts on one of the last episodes I was on. I think we got a voicemail where someone was like

31
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,240
very pointedly asking about like, what are you guys favorite fonts? So is this going to be like

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,640
the circumcision thing? No. Font corner. I don't know. I don't think font

33
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,040
choice. I don't think things like kerning are like as emotionally charged as the circumcision

34
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,560
debate. Well, I don't know. Some people get pretty serious about fonts. What are the different types

35
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,640
of like, there's like the ones where the Times New Roman where the like a T has little bits on the

36
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:45,760
end of it. And then there's one's Serif and then non-Serif. Serif and Sans Serif where Comic Sans

37
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:55,920
gets its name. Yeah. Like where'd you fall on the Serif Sans Serif debate? Oh, I'm a big Serif guy.

38
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Big Serif energy over here. I always liked that as well. When it came to like drawing,

39
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,320
like if there was like a drawing I was doing and it involved letters, I would always do the fanciest

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,480
possible because then it would be like fancier. I mean, as many bells and whistles as possible.

41
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
If you're handwriting and you add Serifs, like that means you, that means you really gave a

42
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,320
shit. Like you were like, how can I up the presentation? Speaking of, oh my god, you know

43
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,080
what would be, okay, I actually received a handwritten letter from Christine Weston Chandler.

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:39,680
Whoa, that's a big deal. This is, okay, this is funny. I, okay, I mentioned in the PCP chat,

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,040
Gabe, I think you saw that like, okay, on, on Twitter, in Twitter DMs, Chris messaged me to say

46
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,680
like, hey, I bought this crystal. It's a piece of blue hemi-morphite from Arizona, basically

47
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:04,400
because like, oh, it's just like slime podrans from the Endless War, right? Yeah. And she literally

48
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,360
fucking sent me the podrans. She sent me the piece of hemi-morphite. It's sitting on my,

49
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,480
I guess I should probably post a picture of it.

50
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Dude, you're literally pen pals.

51
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,400
I guess so. So I told, I told Chris like, cool, if you send me that, I'll send you like some

52
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,440
pins and a slime coin. So I got to get that in the mail to her. But, but she wrote me a letter

53
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,320
and I actually haven't read the letter yet. So I guess I should, I think I'll just read it now.

54
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
Yeah, why not? Here it is.

55
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,800
To Ben saying, feel free to read on your next live stream or whatever. So I guess that's this.

56
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,680
Dear Ben, wait a minute, sorry, I'm mixed up because Christine is not Christine. Christine

57
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
is actually Sonichu right now. Sonichu is actually inhabiting the body of Christine while I suppose

58
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,240
Christine is in C197. When you got to get all the letters. So this is actually a letter from Sonichu.

59
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,760
So this is Sonichu's actual handwriting you have. Like this is literally, yes, I literally,

60
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:17,520
I literally holding in my hand a letter from Sonichu, of the Sonichu comic book fame.

61
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,520
What a world, am I right? That's quite an artifact you've got there.

62
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:32,000
It is. Dear Ben, here is a lovely chunk of hemimorphite, aka a podron of slime. Obviously genuine.

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,520
Purchase from the minerals and mystics, formerly crystal connection, of Charlottesville, Virginia,

64
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,920
mine from Arizona, in the vicinity of Nlacocam. And Christine has personally verified it as

65
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,640
1218's counterpart of a podron of slime. This podron has been near this body for a few days

66
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,880
so it is energized and blessed. Oh, it's been energized by Christine's body.

67
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Eminem also gave me a bit of a bit of stickum and a pedestal. Oh, okay. It's the thing that it's

68
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,880
like sitting on. Eminem also gave me a bit of stickum and a pedestal, which I felt would be

69
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,520
better off for and with you. You may even put your name on it. Ben quote, Ben Saints podron

70
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:26,800
or what you like. Enjoy it and stay safe and well. Sonichu, January 18th, 2021. And Sonichu is

71
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,880
written in a scribbly sort of lightning bolt kind of a script there. So bear it into your face.

72
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Now you're protected from COVID now.

73
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Well, in slime and punishment, in Christine's side pages, images of it,

74
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Chris Chan Sonichu takes the slime podron and I guess energizes it and gives it back to phantom

75
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,480
horn. And this is in the beta timeline. And in the beta timeline, phantom form is given this

76
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,000
energized podron and it causes him to grow a sort of ethereal quote unquote phantom unicorn horn

77
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,080
that he can use like some approximation of real unicorn magic through and in and in the image,

78
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
when Chris when Chris Chan is giving the podron back to phantom horn, the podron is blue, like

79
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
it's very clearly blue. So I was like, okay, she charged it up with blue energy, right? Because

80
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,280
recently she posted pictures of Sonichu and Chris Chan. But they since they've switched bodies,

81
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
they have like an aura energy around them. So Chris Chan's body has this yellow energy aura,

82
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
because it's got Sonichu in it. And Sonichu's got this blue energy aura, because it's got

83
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Christine in it. So it's like, okay, yeah, she put her fucking aura energy into the crystal.

84
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,720
So it's blue, of course. But then I reply to her like, oh, just like the the blue podron. And

85
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,080
she's like, um, actually, Christine simply use the wrong marker to color it. Make of that what

86
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
you will. And I'm like, oh, even Christine makes a mistake. So that was just a mistake.

87
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
So that's just a mistake, even though it just makes way more sense for the podron to be blue.

88
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, she said like, make of it what you will. So I'm just going to assume that yes, yes, it did

89
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,640
make the podron blue, because I literally had the pin manufacturers like manufacture a small

90
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,760
quantity of like alternate color blue podrons. So I just feel silly if that if that were a waste

91
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:31,520
of time. So I had like, I had like, I literally forgot that I got that until just now.

92
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,880
And that's pretty cool. You know, pretty, pretty cool. I guess maybe I'll hang that up.

93
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Maybe I'll tuck that in behind the, you know, the page of liquid Sonichu being or liquid Chris

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,440
being reborn in the fucking hell womb or whatever the one I have on my wall. So I guess you two are

95
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,720
on good terms again, because I remember a while back, there was like a bit of an issue

96
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,720
or something. She was, yeah, she she was, she was mad at me merely for reporting the facts,

97
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,960
which is that in Lockecom did in fact go to war with quick bill. Yeah. And that the casualty,

98
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,240
the casualties were immense. But Christine refused to acknowledge it. And I guess that's just the

99
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,120
quick bill party line is to just not, not admit that any of that happened, but it did. You know,

100
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,840
I was there. I posted pictures, there was video evidence. There was a whole, there was a whole

101
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,560
body of work done about it in the, in the RFCK server for the contest, the quick, the war on

102
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,400
quick bill contest. So like it's, it's, it's Canon. I mean, it's indisputable. A whole body of work

103
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,920
of all the dead bodies, right? Yes, that's right. There are, there are stats too. There are, there

104
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:57,120
are body counts. Astronomically high ones, of course. Oh, that's, that's fine. You should,

105
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
you know what, if you're sending the, the coin and stuff, you should do a handwritten letter back

106
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,520
and actually like get a rapport going with Sonichu.

107
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:15,120
Um, you know, I, I had arranged like a sheet, like a little piece, like an image that would

108
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,080
explain like what each of the pins mean, like what, what they are images of. And then my

109
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,840
fucking printer broke. So like I couldn't print it. So I might just like send her that image when

110
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,960
she gets it so she can see it or whatever. Cause like she's not going to know what like

111
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:39,360
goo girls limited is. For instance. She might be a bigger fan than you think.

112
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,400
I don't. You know what? Maybe you're right. I choose to believe that you're right. You know what?

113
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,560
You know what? I wasn't kind of a shitty mood, but that, that really, that really perked me up.

114
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,120
I'm feeling chipper now. You're feeling chipper and you're not even chipped from shipping downs.

115
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:12,080
Die. Die, Gamers Tavern. Die. Oh, uh, by the way, I, um, want to mention something on here.

116
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,600
Uh, you can, uh, you, you can both call me, uh, Krono with a K instead of Gamers Tavern,

117
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
unless you want to continue. Okay. Gamers Tavern is up to you.

118
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,600
Krono? Sure. Yeah. Uh, Krono is a real name, I guess. Yeah, you've mentioned that before. I just

119
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,960
was in the habit. I was just in the habit of calling you Gamers Tavern, like I was in the habit

120
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,840
of calling Gib Hippo. Right. Um, that's a, okay. Krono, Krono it is. I mentioned that off the air,

121
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,840
I think one time, but I want to take the opportunity to mention it on the air. So, uh,

122
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,960
everybody knows, I guess a couple of thousand people might listen to this.

123
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,840
That's a, an old username I used to use back in, I think I first used it in 2001.

124
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,720
So I haven't, I haven't used it much lately, but I'm thinking of bringing it back, you know,

125
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,600
because, uh, embrace tradition and reject modernity. That's right. The, the, the

126
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:17,920
the extremely modern Gamers Tavern brand. It's not old, old, old, good, new, bad. It is. It is

127
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:25,840
bad. So just keep as far back as you possibly can. But that's been my, my philosophy for pretty

128
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:38,160
much my entire life. Um, man, I've been, um, okay. Let me tell, I've been, I've been really

129
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:48,480
struggling with Noita. Noita is so fucking hard. And then I, I guess Vosh just beat it. Like, I

130
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,280
haven't, I haven't, I haven't watched Vosh in a while. I didn't know that he or anyone was playing

131
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
Noita, but I just see a, I see a, he, I just happened to see a tweet from him that's like,

132
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm really proud of my first Noita win. And it made me really mad. It made me really mad

133
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,040
that Vosh beat Noita before I did. Do you care to elaborate on what this is for anyone who doesn't

134
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,320
know? No, no, no, it's a, it's a roguelite or roguelike. I don't know. Yeah. One of them.

135
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
Yeah. You jump into a game.

136
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,600
I had a really good, I had Craig fucking die, Craig. You piece of shit. I had a really good

137
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,160
game like earlier today, where I had like a pretty good synergy going where I had, I managed to get

138
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,520
a buff that would like turn a project, when you shot a projectile, it would make the projectiles

139
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,320
shoot fireballs out to the left and right. And I put that on a wand that would shoot a like bouncy

140
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,440
projectile. So the projectile would go out and it would bounce. And so it would like persist for

141
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,120
a while bouncing around. And even after it was bouncing, it would still just keep shooting

142
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,040
fireballs that like, um, it was pretty fucking, it was, it was, that was pretty fucking good.

143
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,760
It didn't actually do that much damage, but it was like a lot of bang for your buck.

144
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,440
What an important thing is that it looked cool, right?

145
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,480
Uh, though, I mean, the cool looking ones just literally just kill you when you use them.

146
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,680
They just like fucking explode and you die. I had, I found one wand that had a spell on it

147
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,400
that I'd never seen before. And the spell was like, turns everything around you into blood.

148
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,880
And I used it and it literally just turned my body into blood and I died. My whole body was just

149
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,680
became blood. So it's like, I don't know exactly what these things are going to do.

150
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,640
No, you don't really know what the spells do until you use them.

151
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,920
They like randomly generated effects like they can stack and mix in interesting ways.

152
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
The spells are, there's a pre, there is a particular list of spells.

153
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,560
But you will, you find wands that have slots and the slots will have like

154
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,440
semi random spells in the slots and the slots, some, some wands are like randomized. Like you'll,

155
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,360
you'll shoot them and it will like pick a random slot to fire a spell from.

156
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,120
But some, some wands are non shuffle, which means that the spells progress in a linear fashion.

157
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,320
They go slot one, slot two, slot three, slot four. And so you can build things. So like,

158
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,640
you could maybe put a like modifier in the first slot that's like, okay, cast the next two spells.

159
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,200
But then, you know, and then maybe you put a spell, but then in the second spell that that

160
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,440
double slot cast is going to cast, you put like another modifier that's like, okay,

161
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,960
that one make it like a double branch spell. And then so that in that second pathway actually

162
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,360
branches out into two more spells. So you can build these like, these like logic

163
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
machines that like do like a chain of spells that all modify each other.

164
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,000
So spell slots is like a material, right?

165
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:05,680
Um, yeah, kind of. Yeah, yeah, more or less. But like the spells are on the wands. So like,

166
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,880
you're not you, you don't have mana that you cast spells with like the individual wands have like

167
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,960
a mana pool and like a mana regeneration rate. And like that affects like, like you might have

168
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,320
a wand that has like a really good fire rate and like, and stuff. And you put like a spell on it

169
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
and you're like machine gun. But if it's got like low mana or low regeneration rate, you like,

170
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,240
you'll run out and you won't actually be that useful, you know? So you kind of have to find

171
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,640
wands that work well. It's super fucking interesting. And it's so hard. I think I made it,

172
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,840
I think last night I had like one of my best runs yet. I made it to you start in the mines,

173
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,160
and then you go, no, no, you start in like the cab, the mines, and then you go to like the deeper

174
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,480
mines. And then you go to like this ice layer, and then there's a jungle layer. No, no, and then

175
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,680
there's like a vault, and then there's a jungle layer, and then there's like a second vault,

176
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,040
and I made it to that like the like second vault with all this high tech shit in it.

177
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,440
And I was like, this is only like a second time ever I've made it there. It was it was my best

178
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,880
run ever. It was pretty good. But I don't think I was even anywhere close to the end.

179
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:23,920
And it's very, very challenging. It's very challenging video game video game. Yes. The most

180
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,800
the most fun thing in Noida, in my opinion, is in the second level, the like the deeper mines

181
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,320
is if you get a spell that has the ability to like clear dirt or clear, um, yeah, like clear

182
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,920
materials out, and you just go around there and you look for like pockets of gold that

183
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,440
are buried in like the stone in the mines, and you can just like dig to them and just like

184
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,840
pick up the gold, and you just like go around and like collect as much gold as you can. So you

185
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,440
have a lot of money so that you can like buy better spells and like the in between zone like a

186
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:10,160
minecraft, right? Almost as if you are some kind of the minecraft. Yes. Dude, I've been playing

187
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,280
minecraft, and I've been playing minecraft as well as minecraft. Have you ever heard of

188
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:25,600
ever heard of X's adventures in minecraft? He was a let's play. Is X a person? X was his name.

189
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,760
I don't think his channel, his channel wasn't called that, but he is. I've heard of X's adventures

190
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,160
of whatever I've heard of Poo's adventures of. Yes, he's not winning the poo, unfortunately.

191
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,600
But he was like one of the first minecraft let's players that didn't take off

192
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,280
in like a gigantic way, but he's like beloved because it's like kind of the best when it was

193
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,440
new. You know, he was discovering the game and he was like learning and everyone else was like

194
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,720
learning with him, and so it was like a magical let's play, and it was really well produced.

195
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,080
He was a very thoughtful gamer rather than just screaming and jumping at stuff. He crafts

196
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,800
his let's play like it's a show that it's got narrative stakes, even though he is just recording

197
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,280
himself playing a game and he cuts it off at specific. It's just very well nicely made,

198
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,160
and he's been gone for 10 years. He has stopped doing minecraft 10 years ago, and people have

199
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:35,280
always wanted him to come back because I think the first playthrough, it got quite far, but then

200
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,280
he just sort of got bored because he died and it was far away and he lost a lot of stuff,

201
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,400
and he tried to look for it. That was just it? Yeah, I think it was before Beds. I think it was

202
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,320
before you could set your spawn point, so he was on a very, very long far away adventure and he

203
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,760
died and he lost everything. Just like real life? Yes, except he didn't in real life, he don't come

204
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:10,880
back. So real life is better? I suppose, if you die and lose all your stuff in real life

205
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,640
and you come back and you start again, you're like, I don't want to even think about that.

206
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,840
So this guy crafts his let's plays like that minecraft thing, right?

207
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,200
Oh yeah, he crafts it like a mine. He crafts it like a mine. Anyway, anyway,

208
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,080
he is cool and he's been gone for 10 years. He comes back very recently with Minecraft

209
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,000
let's play hardcore mode and he's doing it the same way as always and he was never like

210
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,600
a big speedrunner type gamer. He's always been sort of slow and methodical and a little bit

211
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,000
autistic in the way that he conducts his like, I noticed watching him, he's like,

212
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,720
he has to have his station, which always has like the furnace in a specific place

213
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,920
compared to where the crafting table is and the chest and then he like digs and it's very,

214
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,680
I don't know, soothing to watch. And I've been getting back into him

215
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,120
playing the game 10 years super nostalgic Minecraft let's play makes me want to play

216
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,240
Minecraft, even though at the time I was in a Minecraft binge, I was talking about Minecraft

217
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,040
not so long ago, doing a hardcore mode. Minecraft is so fucking good. I can't even imagine people

218
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:38,640
playing us a different game. It's so good. No, it is just Minecraft. No, it is just Minecraft

219
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,720
only instead of only each each individual pixels its own block. So it's better because it's more

220
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,480
granular, more blocks is more better. I guess that's that's more more blocks than Terraria then

221
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,800
because Terraria is blocks still have Terraria has multiple pixels in them.

222
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, much better, much better. It's much better than Terraria and much better.

223
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,680
Because I mean, think about it, right? Noida is only two dimensional. So, you know, theoretically,

224
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,480
the blocks, the small the already smaller and more granular blocks are only two dimensional. So

225
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,120
actually in a in a hypothetical 3d space, you could fit infinite amounts of them, right,

226
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,920
because they're infinitesimally small slivers of a three dimensional area. So there's actually

227
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,920
like infinitely better video game. Oh, yeah, that sounds like pretty solid logic. When they're not

228
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:40,480
Minecraft, I don't know. I think I think most games suck. It's fine. Some some people just like

229
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,640
less blocks. Some people just like fewer blocks. Some people are stupid. Yeah, good point. That's

230
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,360
okay. That's okay. You know what? Son, live and learn some some people live and learn.

231
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:05,840
Oh, see, Craig finally made it. Fuck you, Craig. Yeah, piece of shit. Well, I did upload a new video

232
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,200
recently. We mentioned that before. Did you crafted your own YouTube video? Yeah, exactly. Dude.

233
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:20,480
Oh, it all comes back to Minecraft. Everything always comes back to Minecraft.

234
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:31,200
Sure does. So what's the video? Your video was Mega Man zero four ending. You're like it was a

235
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,360
it was a speak video. It wasn't a let's play. Yeah, it's something new that I've never done before.

236
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm not sure if it counts as an analysis video or not. I think it sort of does. It's like a mini

237
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:52,080
video essay sort of thing. Here is why I like this thing. Yeah, I wrote a script for it and I

238
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,840
recorded it and it was pretty easy to make because I didn't have to tell any jokes. That's the easiest.

239
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,400
That's the easiest. It's easy not to have to tell jokes, you know, it's a weight off my shoulders,

240
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,280
but I guess it's maybe good or maybe not. I'm not even sure if I want to promote it because I

241
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,600
don't know if it's good. I watched it. I kind of liked it. I'd never heard of Mega Man zero.

242
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,480
What? I've heard of Mega Man zero. I've never played. I mean, never played any other. I mean,

243
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,480
I feel like they'll even played Mega Man one. Am I crazy or did didn't you talk about this video

244
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,720
like last time you were on? No, because the last time I was on the video didn't exist.

245
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,040
Or did you just talk about the ending to Mega Man X4, but not this video? Yeah, maybe I talked

246
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,000
about the ending. The last time I think we were in a stream that wasn't on the PCP.

247
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,440
Oh, that might have been it. Yeah, that might have been it. I really liked the ending to Mega Man

248
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,640
zero four. So I got the idea of making a video explaining why I like it. And I uploaded two

249
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,520
videos, one of just the ending by itself and the other one of me talking about the ending.

250
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:21,120
Yeah, okay. Okay, I see. Mega Man zero is a fucking cool. I don't know. It's like

251
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,520
Mega Man. Okay, Mega Man X is more of like a spiritual sequel to Mega Man. It has like some

252
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,040
lore connections, but it's like not explicit. And it's sort of like up to you to decide what

253
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,400
the relationship is there. Mega Man zero is like a, it's like a direct sequel to Mega Man X. It's

254
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,960
almost just like, I guess it's not just like a straight continuation because Mega Man X did

255
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,640
continue. Mega Man zero is canonically just like the future of Mega Man X. Like super future, right?

256
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,400
Like, like, every super humanity is not even slightly the same as it was in Mega Man one.

257
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,200
I don't think there are any humans left in Mega Man. There are cyborgs or something.

258
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:14,640
There are humans in Mega Man zero. The plot of Mega Man zero is that the humans hated the

259
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,000
reploids and they wanted to get rid of all of them. So they found a society called Neo Arcadia

260
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,160
and they're hunting down reploids. Cool fucking name. God, the aesthetics of Mega Man zero is

261
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,080
a fucking cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. So in the beginning, you joined the resistance group.

262
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Yeah. And in the resistance group, you're actually fighting against the humans to

263
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,000
defend the reploids or the robots. Right. Right. Because the humans are actually

264
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,160
the bad guys. Because the reploids are basically just people. The reploids are just like most people

265
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,680
in this world, right? The reploids are just robotic versions of humans, I guess. Or rather,

266
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,920
they're robots that have free will. I don't know if I ever mentioned this, but there was a,

267
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:15,120
okay, me and, me and Munchy and Kazzy one time went to, because their school had a like comic

268
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,320
book creators club. And Munchy told me like, this is bad. He was like, I went to this club

269
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,080
and it sucked. And I was like, that's funny. Let's go. So we went to a meeting. We went to a meeting

270
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,000
of this kind of this like these college kids who were all like talking about their comic ideas.

271
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,160
And it was very much like it was it was a lot of most of the meeting was like basically

272
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,880
people describing their like going around the table like describing their OCs and all these

273
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,680
cool ideas they have for their comic that they haven't started making it. But they will.

274
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I guess he's right. That does sound pretty bad. Yeah. It's, well, the funniest part.

275
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,640
And this was this was not the worst part, but it was probably the funniest. There was one guy

276
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,400
who is describing like the plot of like the comic series that he wants to make.

277
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:22,880
And he is like, okay, so it's set in the future. And you know, this technology is developed to

278
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,120
create this race of robots that have free will. And you know, there's tension between the sentient

279
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,880
robots and the humans. And some of those sentient robots decide that they're like robot supremacists

280
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,480
and they break off and they form like sort of a sort of a team of like renegades, you might call

281
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,400
them, you know, there's like a group that is like anti human. And then there's like, and then like

282
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,960
the protagonist is like, you know, a pro he's like a pro human, like he fights on behalf of the humans

283
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,200
to defend against these evil robots. And he's literally just describing the plot of Mega Man X.

284
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,400
And, and he's sitting there describing this, he's wearing a Mega Man X shirt. Like it's on his shirt

285
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,400
as he's describing it. And like, I'm just not gonna get we'll figure it out. Well, well, no,

286
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,320
I he redeemed himself a little bit because at the end, he he like he goes, he talks about all

287
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,440
this stuff. And then he's like, so you know, it's a lot like Mega Man X, like it's heavily

288
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,360
inspired by Mega Man X. Like, it's very simple to be obvious. So he like, he completely owned it,

289
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:31,360
which I respect. It's basically the same exact thing, except for one tiny detail that's different.

290
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,720
Yeah, basically, like, I know the feeling of like, like, I think sometimes like, ah, yeah,

291
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,520
I'm going to make this this thing. And it's it's basically like, exactly like home stuck, except

292
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,760
I wrote it. Yeah, yeah, basically, I can't think of anything I can't think of anything like it

293
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,800
would have in it. I just want to invent Riska myself.

294
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,680
Well, that's a noble endeavor.

295
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,000
Um, try to think if there was any other funny shit that happened.

296
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,520
No, that was the funniest part. It was I don't know. It was a bunch of crap.

297
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,440
But yeah, the Mega Man Zero series and X series are pretty cool. The stories of them are pretty cool.

298
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,320
But Mega Man Zero's story, I think is probably better and more fleshed out than X series.

299
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,960
Yeah, I mean, yeah, zero has zero is a little bit more plot centric. I think the X series,

300
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
you can play through Mega Man X and like almost not even notice that a plot is happening.

301
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,560
Yeah, the X series has pretty good lore, but there's not much plot to it.

302
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,040
Yeah, but the Mega Man Zero series has lore and plot.

303
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:58,400
It's very much like, okay, like I'm the fact that like, like the fact that it's called like

304
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,760
Neo Arcadia and like, I don't know, they talk about like this, like,

305
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,440
the place where like the humans like are like ruling from it has this sort of like weird like

306
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,560
religious aesthetic to it. Like it's like some kind of Holy Land or whatever.

307
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, definitely. And like,

308
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,080
If you get an S rank in Mega Man Zero, they call you the Redeemer.

309
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:25,360
So fucking cool. I have such a sucker for that shit. The final when spoiler, big spoilers,

310
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:34,400
but when you like, okay, so like X is the leader of these evil humans who are like anti-reploids.

311
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah, but it's not actually X. It's X's body, but the like X's actual mind now exists in the form

312
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,080
of like a cyber elf, which is the sort of like disembodied like program that is sort of like a

313
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,200
spirit or whatever. And you can use cyber elves to like enhance your abilities and stuff in the game.

314
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,720
But like the real X is a cyber elf, but his but X's body is controlled by some new AI who thinks

315
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,680
he's the real X, but he's this fucking like a like reploid genocide fucking monster.

316
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,320
And when you fight him at the end of the first Mega Man Zero, he turns into this giant fucking

317
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,640
like robot like angel wing creature and just is like fucking blah. Yeah, it's pretty great.

318
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,160
It's so good. The whole X series is constantly foreshadowing the big battle between X and zero,

319
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,080
which happens a couple of times in X series, but you can say the climax is in the Mega Man Zero

320
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:41,840
series when zero kills copy X. It's got it's got this whole thing where like these four the four

321
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:50,240
like guardians what is like Harpuya the grew the wind guy Leviathan the water girl shadow the ninja

322
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,240
And I think the fire guy is Fenrir, right? Fire guy Fenrir. Yeah. Yeah. They're like these

323
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,720
they're these like heroes of justice that like defend they like they think they're the good guys

324
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,480
and then like over I think it's over the course of the first game they learned that like no X is

325
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,440
the leader of like this evil fucking empire or whatever we're the bad guys and they all you

326
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,240
know become redeemed. But it's interesting because what a fucking game the New Arcadia is

327
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:27,760
seen as like the utopian city for humans but they their X is killing off all the reploids and

328
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,280
you're defending them and fighting against that. But it's just kind of weird because in the X

329
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,240
series you're defending the humans against the reploids but in the zero series it's reversed.

330
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,880
Yeah, because it's like um yeah because like if you imagine like the historical timeline like X

331
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,920
was known like in the X games he fights against the evil reploids because these maverick reploids

332
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,400
are more powerful than humans and they're they're like it's like um it's like Magneto in the X

333
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,400
men they're like well you know fuck the humans right like we're better than them. But then like

334
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,520
by the time I guess reploid technology was so successful that by the time Mega Man Zero happens

335
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,680
like reploids are they're they're like indistinguishable from people but so I guess like

336
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,320
because you know because this new X that thinks he's the old X is like yeah I fight the reploids

337
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,960
reploids bad so you know persecute them even though like now the tables have turned and like now the

338
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,840
reploids are the underdog sort of sort of you know except for the good reploids that like work for me

339
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,240
my fucking four like elemental champions or whatever and also me because I'm special because

340
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm because I'm the hero was he called himself he calls himself like the fucking hero of legend he

341
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,840
has some like I'm I'm like the show I think he calls himself like the chosen one or something

342
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,400
because he thinks like yeah X is this hero from history like he's the I'm the greatest fucking

343
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,760
reploid that ever lived like I saved the human race I can do no wrong. Yeah it's something like that

344
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,760
it's uh it's pretty freaking cool when you think about it um there's a lot of I'm getting I'm getting

345
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,480
fucking hype I'm getting excited over here I have a remembering I've never played really any Mega Man

346
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,480
except what the first one that I bought on the Wii store um and I've I've always been curious

347
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,720
because I know there's loads of spin-off series and I'm like looking at the timeline to see if

348
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,880
like it's a jumbled mess like Zelda but it seems to be just in order like Mega Man series is like

349
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,760
20 xx Mega Man x is 21 xx so that's yeah yeah it's pretty yeah because I mean later like

350
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,640
Mega Man zx uh century after the zero series Mega Man the legend several thousand years later

351
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,280
just keeps going whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa mega man legends is after zx yeah apparently

352
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,040
but that's what the whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what the fuck what the fuck is this

353
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,840
link link let me scroll uh yeah it's just it's just the um you see the that doesn't make any

354
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,760
fucking sense I'm I'm looking at it but it makes this is unacceptable makes sense if you're a big

355
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,440
Mega Man fan nerd like I am but um basically okay this is not this is not canon yeah it might not

356
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,720
be canon I'm not sure if it is canon or not but it's theorized by the fans that Mega Man legends

357
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,840
takes place after uh zx because in zx humans and reploids start to become almost the same

358
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,400
and humans start incorporating like cybernetic uh implants into themselves and in Mega Man

359
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,280
legends um I think in legends it's determined or confirmed that all the humans are basically

360
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:53,920
reploids by that point oh god okay but I thought that I thought that the Mega Man from Mega Man

361
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,640
legends just is original Mega Man from the Mega Man games just like in 3d uh no he's a he's a

362
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:10,240
different character he's uh I forget is I mean they're both called Mega Man whereas like Mega Man

363
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:17,200
X is called X well the um so I just assumed yeah but the one in legends actually his name is

364
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,320
Volnott or something like that or his last name is Volnott I think um my memories where's all the

365
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,680
like strategy like the small like um turn-based whatever games are they what do you mean the

366
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,600
rpgs uh the battle network series and oh battle network battle network's gotta be somewhere else

367
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,920
battle network's gotta be its own and that's just separate timeline timeline I don't know where

368
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,640
it no is it separate I would I would hope that it figures somewhere on the time I was really just

369
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,720
looking at like the beginning and then I was scrolling down to look at the specifics but this

370
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:58,160
is like how it's laid out at the top and I'm like okay so the series follow on like chronologically

371
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,040
yeah for the most part uh but then there's no mention of the uh I guess this is Mega Man

372
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:13,600
timeline classic oh god wait I'm looking at the I'm looking at the zero timeline which is that

373
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,000
that's just the image at the top I didn't really look at that yeah that's not the whole thing that's

374
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,760
just that's just between x and zero yeah but uh the battle network series takes place on its own

375
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,240
timeline or universe it's not related to uh the main timeline wait oh wait this is a comprehensive

376
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,200
timeline for classic mega man mega man x mega man zero mega all of these series occur in a timeline

377
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,880
that deviates from the timeline seen in the mega man battle network and mega man star force series

378
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,120
which are canon to one another but not the other series yeah the wait what was that second one

379
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:53,280
um you mean star force on something wrong uh yeah mega man star force series star force is a

380
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,560
the spiritual successor to battle network it takes place like I think a hundred or two hundred years

381
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,680
after battle network so it is a timeline that deviates so if if now I gotta look into this I

382
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,560
love I love like timelines I'm probably never gonna play any of these games I like figuring out

383
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,000
but the idea is that the main mega man's timeline is when robotics became the big popular thing but

384
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,000
the battle network timeline is if robotics didn't take off and instead like the internet became the

385
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:34,080
big thing so they they go into the web and they do battle network they do battles in online yeah

386
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,680
basically they they they they pull on each other digitally yeah I'm not um I'm not too big of a fan

387
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,440
of the battle network series but uh they're pretty okay if you like rpgs

388
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,360
series set in a parallel universe from the original meg man series where the internet has

389
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,280
become integrated with almost every piece of electronic equipment in existence from tv's to ovens

390
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,920
yeah so the what the oven gets like infected so it's just the real world yeah the oven gets

391
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,720
infected well I guess that is a virus and then it starts messing up your house and burning down

392
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,400
your house and stuff it's like I made a wooden television I made it like to combat the internet

393
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,360
I made a wooden uh something or other it doesn't doesn't matter and then um the main character

394
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:32,720
his name is lan as in local area network and um he jacks into a device with his little pda thing

395
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,760
he jacks into his little pp yeah that's what they call it in the games you you jack in and you jack out

396
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,120
and uh oh there's anime and manga yeah the battle network series was pretty popular and it had its

397
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,920
own anime and I guess it had a manga I didn't know that the mega man nt warrior manga authored by

398
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,880
what really bugs me what bugs me about this timeline is that I can't actually see any references

399
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:17,120
in mega man legends to like to like zero and zx like if there was any of that I would believe it

400
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,680
yeah I'd be willing to give it but like it's just fan I don't actually see anything it's uh I don't

401
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,760
think it's ever been confirmed to be canon that legends is related to um the timeline I would I

402
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,520
would need to I would need to be a list of like oh you know here in in this like room you can see

403
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,320
like an image that like refers to something that happened I mean legends never even acknowledges

404
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,360
the existence of zero I don't know this this just seems like some dumb but there there's a lot of

405
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:52,640
fan theories and fan canon stuff and um you know the the lore of mega man is pretty interesting you

406
00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:00,720
could probably do a lecture on it it just it just that's true that I'm sure is true actually actually

407
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,600
100 true I'm just saying this just seems like a big like what if like oh what if legends takes

408
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,440
place in the future after zx it could you can't prove it doesn't and like yeah you're right you're

409
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,120
right it hasn't been confirmed um there's like little implications or nudges but it hasn't been

410
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:26,160
actually confirmed to be canon it's um I mean I'm looking for implications and I'm not really

411
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,520
I found a forum thread tell me if this makes sense in the x series a space station called

412
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:38,080
Elysium is being built roughly in the year 50 xx and the master is at least 3000 years old when

413
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,360
he dies before the events of mega man legends meaning that 80 xx is the earliest the series could

414
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:51,600
happen wait so x so in x there's a space station called Elysium yeah and I assume Elysium is like

415
00:44:51,600 --> 00:45:01,840
an Elysium is or like something like that and Elysium is also in let in the legends okay okay

416
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,080
yeah it's um if there's a uh there's little hints like that but this still isn't a hard

417
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,800
confirmation that that's what I was looking for that's what I was looking for okay so

418
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,840
it's kind of like uh I mean I think there's nothing on the on the other hand only like little

419
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:26,080
on the other hand from other games I mean if them if if legends is like far future from

420
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,440
the original mega man then like they're not the same person but they had just have the same name

421
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,320
like it could just be a different thing that's also called Elysium like how mega man is just

422
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:44,400
also called mega man true but was there Elysium was there an Elysium in the original mega man ever

423
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,520
mentioned uh no it was the space station that was being built in the original mega man I don't think

424
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,920
so was the space station being uh mentioned in mega man x uh being named after an already

425
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,960
existing Elysium from legends who knows who knows which way around it goes uh oh yeah I honestly I

426
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,520
think that probably is true because like legends because like mega man x kept going even as like

427
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,480
the legends series was starting so like I would believe that like people making like later x games

428
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,040
might just name things after things in like the early legends game I think there's only like two

429
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,480
or three legends games there's only two and they were both but yeah yes one

430
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,640
yeah so yeah they they like the the the inspiration could have gone either well the

431
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:41,600
the x series was originally supposed to end at x5 and then Capcom made uh x6 without Inafune's

432
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,600
knowledge and he was quite upset about it when he found out that they made a mega man game behind

433
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:57,120
his back yeah it would be too this this could be a interesting video if if someone knew all the

434
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:05,360
stuff and they would you know would feel like you know like analyzing the truth coming down to the

435
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,720
I mean mega man doesn't have like kingdom hearts level convoluted lore but like there's so many

436
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,680
games that like there is a lot of it yeah like a lot of stuff has happened but a lot of the stuff

437
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,240
in games it doesn't really matter you know like a lot of it is pretty self-contained

438
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,720
that's just what they want you to think yeah but uh sometimes the most interesting uh stuff about

439
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:35,040
the lore is the fan theories as opposed to what is canon like um yeah there's a big fan theory about

440
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:43,280
Dr. Wiley's involvement in the x series and whether he was secretly controlling sigma or something

441
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:51,280
yeah and um yeah sure I mean this is a I've I think I've heard something about it but it's

442
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,600
it's not like I feel like there are some references to Wiley in x oh yeah there's there's definitely

443
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:04,880
some um like in um a mega man x4 uh spoilers uh the first cutscene when you play as zero uh it

444
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:13,520
clearly shows uh that Dr. Wiley made zero oh okay yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right

445
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,360
so like that's like fully canon like yes this is the future of the other game and then when you

446
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:26,800
get to sigma as zero there's another anime cutscene where it shows that uh zero was the first maverick

447
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:36,880
and he infected uh sigma and that's how sigma became okay I thought was that not the story from

448
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,960
the beginning I kind of thought that that was just like established in mega man x that like yeah

449
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:53,120
zero was the first maverick and he but he like got unmavericked maybe not maybe I don't think so

450
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:59,120
because in x4 they make it out to be like a huge revelation like it's a big plot twist maybe maybe

451
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,640
I just read that somewhere and then just like read that into the game when I was playing x because

452
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,600
as a kid I only play the original x like I played x2 and x3 a little bit however um this is foreshadowed

453
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,480
in x at the end of x2 when you kill sigma his final words or something like um zero you were one of

454
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,520
wily's last known he didn't he doesn't say why he said zero you were one of the doctor's last

455
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,080
creations why did you betray me or something like that so he he doesn't say who the doctor is kind

456
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:37,840
of implies that sigma is also made by yeah well sigma is not made by uh by wily he's made by dr

457
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:48,000
kane oh right right this is kind of weird but dr kane is an archaeologist and he discovered

458
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,360
x's uh body in a capsule and then he copies x's design and makes a bunch of reploids so he made

459
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:02,320
sigma I knew that so what I don't get is how does an archaeologist like learn how to build a robot

460
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,080
you know that's well he just copied the I mean he he didn't do it himself he just like

461
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,600
he found dr lights design yeah but dr lights design was like plagiarized it was the most

462
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:19,360
sophisticated robot design at the time and he just somehow copies it and and modifies it

463
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,040
it's like you have to know a thing or two about robotics to do that maybe he I mean maybe he well

464
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,040
you know he's probably just like Elon musk he doesn't actually do anything he just like hires a

465
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,800
bunch of engineers to like do it that's possible I never consider that possibility never thought

466
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,960
about it so everyone so everyone just assumes oh yeah dr dr kane did it you know it's his it's

467
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:51,680
his baby or whatever sigma more like sigma balls we're like leg good yeah okay yeah yeah you were

468
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:59,680
you were going there you went there mm-hmm I went there I'm not afraid snap snap snap

469
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,960
bass man I fucking hate video games yeah they're pretty bad awful oh dude speaking of video games

470
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,480
I've been replaying um phoenix right ace attorney trials and tribulations the third in the in the

471
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:21,600
first three games I played the first ace attorney game and I thought it was dumb I thought it was

472
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:29,600
bad well you're dumb instead because actually I mean I will say I will say that I think the second

473
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:37,360
and third games are much better with the with the um when it comes to like things coming out of nowhere

474
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,640
to save the protagonist that doesn't happen quite so often I remember like replaying the first game

475
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:50,800
it's like oh no there's absolutely nothing I can do then suddenly out of nowhere like the one piece

476
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,920
of evidence you need like you had no hand and you're getting that evidence for the case it just

477
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,240
sort of appears and then you can complete it and it's like okay that's just manufactured like

478
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:09,040
manufactured uh what's the word tension tension because like there's no there's no like ticking

479
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,480
clock you don't know that the thing you need is on its way but it might be late you just

480
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,400
think there's nothing gonna happen because there's nothing and then it's there were out of its house

481
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,280
but the second and third games are so fucking good I did um I guess you need to play you need to play

482
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,720
the third game to see Godot Godot is like the coolest guy in the world I did beat uh I think

483
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,240
all the ones in a ds except for I think the last one which was kind of like a weird action adventure

484
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,360
uh type of thing there's one where you walk around I didn't play that oh that's that's

485
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:49,120
those are miles edge worth investigations I think yeah that's uh I think the only one for the ds I

486
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,760
did not play such this is such nerd shit what's what's you just talk about mega man timeline

487
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,720
shit for ages I don't know mega man's cool mega man's about the horrors of war yeah Phoenix

488
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,920
right about the horrors of the law I mean this is just about this is just about the legal system

489
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,120
this is about being a fucking suit look I'm just saying there's a there's a lady called friend

490
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,800
Franziska von karma and she has a whip and she whips people and she's got a soft inner side

491
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,040
and it's so much my favorite type of character that I just can't help but love the whole game

492
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,440
it's that's uh that's anime stuff if you're into anime stuff

493
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,520
it's kind of like no no thank you to anime stuff it's not really like the way it looks the sprite

494
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:43,120
work is just good it looks like chunky and like more westernized than normal anime the the later

495
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:51,120
games like Apollo justice and some some other ones that I haven't played um that are built for the ds

496
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,040
where they they up the anime a little too much this is what happened to fire emblem as well I

497
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,760
fucking hate this as soon as they have more fidelity to draw things they hire artists that are just

498
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,520
two japanese and they ruin the style of the original games well fire emblem and ace attorney both went

499
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,600
down to fucking garbage as soon as they got too many pixels I wasn't talking about the art style I

500
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,760
just mean that's just that's the case with every game there's a critical mass of pixels that a game

501
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,400
just can't can't sustain and then it's bad forever that's why pokemon is bad once it went to the

502
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:29,760
fucking 3ds agreed I suppose too many poly too many polygons I kind of like they're just pixels but

503
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:37,200
I kind of like the the the character design of of pokemon sun and moon for like people

504
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,960
like it's it's not too enemy okay yeah that's fine but that's a whole that's a whole other

505
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,280
can of worms but um okay okay um okay my my my problem with ace attorney my problem with

506
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:57,040
his attorney was one uh it's boring two uh the actually the like the actual court

507
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,600
moments are like it I didn't really feel like I was like solving a puzzle I kind of just felt

508
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,680
like I was just going down dialogue trees um which sucked um and also okay and this one's

509
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,120
weird and this people probably aren't gonna agree with me on this one but like the fucking case in

510
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:20,720
the first game I don't know I didn't like the fact that you're like that you're like solving a

511
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,040
fucking murder case about like a woman who was just like fucking murdered in her home and like

512
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,240
had her head bashed in and it's got but like the proceedings as you try and discover who did this

513
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,920
is just like very kind of like it's only like sort of serious and kind of goofy and I just didn't

514
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,800
like it I just felt uncomfortable about like this is like gruesome like the crime here is gruesome

515
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,120
and like it's not being treated with the fucking uh uh gravitas that it deserves that might that

516
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,040
might be personal but I feel like the other two are objective criticisms that make the game objectively

517
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,760
bad uh why do you feel like it's not you're not solving a puzzle because I because part of part

518
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,600
of my my favorite thing is like listening to all the dialogue you know like investigating getting

519
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,720
getting the the the the testimonies and like checking the court record and seeing what information

520
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:16,320
I have to figure out who's lying and how that's that's like fun I guess I never I never felt like

521
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,560
I don't know it's been a little while since I played it but uh I I never felt I never felt

522
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:28,560
at all like I was in danger of like losing um it just felt like I just had to like

523
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:36,400
like I would win either because I not because I like to do something but because like I don't know

524
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,400
like there was like a really obvious hint that was like yes this is the option you should choose

525
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:47,280
right now or even if I didn't have that I could just exhaust every possibility then like maybe I

526
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:55,120
would lose if I really tried to but it just never felt like a real threat I mean I gotta be careful

527
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:03,200
here like it's it's not the hardest game ever it's just I think it's it's easy to like get there

528
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,960
by just clicking random buttons if you really want to play it like that but if you want to

529
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:14,080
figure it out the puzzle aspect is like engaging and fun well I well I didn't think so because I

530
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:23,120
didn't I when I found a clue I would just feel like it didn't feel like I had to okay it kind

531
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:29,360
of had the same problem but worse as like um what was that game um what was that game by the

532
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,920
papers please guy with the one where you're on a boat and you got to solve who killed who

533
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,160
I don't know something over a din I think over a din something

534
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,960
over a dean return of the over din um that one also kind of had this but not as bad where it's

535
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,360
like okay the clue it's not you you're not like looking at the scene holistically and deciding

536
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,400
like hmm what could this what could have happened here like what could be going on what are the

537
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,840
possibilities you're looking at it as though like this is a a clue that has been constructed for

538
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,800
you by a game designer and you are taking that hint you're like okay what hint are they trying to

539
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:14,560
give me with this uh okay they mean to tell me that like this is what happens I mean sure I just

540
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,160
I just like more inductive than deductive uh which is a problem a lot of games have that's not

541
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,240
unique to to reveal right sure it just it doesn't it doesn't feel like I'm solving a crime it feels

542
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:33,120
like I'm following a trail of breadcrumbs I think what helps me with all that is that I like the

543
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:38,480
the reward for getting it right is hearing more of like what the story and the dialogue and the

544
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,600
characters or all that stuff if you it's like um sure it's like a really good visual novel with um

545
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:53,520
yeah like a little bit of puzzle solving in like lore courtroom shenanigans and if you don't care

546
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,040
okay so much about like what the characters are gonna say like then the the puzzle maybe isn't that

547
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
incredible that bring okay I totally understand that um and maybe this is something that the later

548
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,560
games are better at than the first one but like that brings me back to my first point which is

549
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:18,800
that it was boring because like there was so much like clicking through stuff there was so much like

550
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,600
time-wasty stuff between the moments when you know you you put the clue together and then you

551
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,760
get the next piece of the puzzle but it just didn't I like it wasn't that engaging I mean I I will say

552
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,960
I will say the first game I I bet I bet the series gets better I bet the series gets better

553
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:43,680
replaying the first game it is definitely a little lacking in some of the the interests in like

554
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,040
dialogue stuff because they're just figuring out what these characters are like second game and third

555
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,080
game are like they really step it up on some of the cases definitely the third game I love a lot

556
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,640
well I um yeah I enjoyed the story of these games but uh I guess the gameplay maybe could be better

557
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,280
but I think um I think it's just inherently difficult to make gameplay for a detective kind

558
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,280
of thing like this I don't know if it's ever been done uh like completely successfully before

559
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:20,960
well I don't know about completely successfully I liked L.A. Noir that that was a good one because

560
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:27,120
you could miss pieces of evidence and go down a path and still complete the case and you would

561
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:35,360
just get the wrong guy what was that one what was that one like point and click detective game

562
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:43,840
and like Davoo made a video about it I don't know and it had like a very like sort of picture book

563
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:55,520
sort of was it a DS game I don't know let's go to divu.com hang on no I'm gonna go to divu.youtube

564
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:04,240
what it's the one where you're at like a swamp and you got to like solve an alligator crime

565
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,400
that sounds like my kind of crime I don't know um it does uh

566
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,160
uh never never call an alligator crocodile

567
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,760
why wouldn't would you because uh it's like calling a Chinese person a Japanese

568
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:31,120
I found it Detective Grimoire yes Detective Grimoire it's 11 minutes long I can't remember this

569
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,680
you know what I actually didn't play this game I just feel like I did play this game because I

570
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,160
watched this video several times and I feel like I know everything there is to know about it

571
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,640
and for I only just now was like wait a minute no I never I never played this game we go to

572
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,640
what am I talking about I think I saw my brother play this game it looks it looks pretty good I

573
01:01:52,640 --> 01:02:00,720
yeah but I forget what what about this is like good detective stuff so go watch the video everybody

574
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,480
fill in the gap in this conversation that are like it does some things pretty good but other

575
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,840
things it's just okay that's just every video about anything well into well well because we were talking

576
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:17,520
about like like in terms of like specifically how it simulates the like detective like

577
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,280
clue finding problem solving solve the crime sort of thing that's uh that's really hard to do and

578
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,360
I kind of wish they would have a game that does that well because I think that would be a lot of fun

579
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,320
I I mean the thing I was talking about last week or a week before I can't remember about like um

580
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:43,040
what was it pick cross which is like it's I feel like it's detective but like at the very basis

581
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:49,520
level where you are using the information you have to determine which blocks which squares are

582
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:57,680
colored in and which ones aren't and um if you make a mistake you are stupid yeah I guess that's

583
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,400
that's the sort of the the neural firing that I enjoy it's like I wonder hmm which is this the

584
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,880
way it is and then the answer is this is the way it is you were right and I was feel so smart

585
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:18,720
a lot of older rpgs especially for the nes and a bit era they uh they had a slight detective

586
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,360
element to them because in order to figure out where to go you need to talk to the npcs in town

587
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:31,280
and uh piece together like the clues and hints like uh because uh there would be no

588
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,520
no cutscenes to tell you where to go so you need to just talk to the random towns people and use

589
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:45,200
their ecliptic hints to figure out how to solve the problem of the town or whatever is going on

590
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,200
which which games you're talking about like like castlevania 2 you know I mean a eight bit rpgs

591
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,280
like dragon quest or dragon warrior and things of that nature I haven't played any of those extremely

592
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:05,440
old um rpgs and actually um played a remake of final fantasy one yeah final fantasy one is another

593
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:12,640
uh good example of that and actually the the original pokemon red and blue um they were heavily

594
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:19,200
inspired by those old eight bit rpgs because it was in itself an eight bit rpg if you remember

595
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:28,960
not like a two bit rpg um just just two just just one like like on or off like gameboy uh and also um

596
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,880
every game is a two bit game if you think about it like that well officially every game is binary

597
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:41,200
officially pokemon was inspired by uh final fantasy legend on the gameboy or as it's known in

598
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,760
in japan to saga series god there's so many fucking sagas so many fucking series of things

599
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:57,920
franchises what the fuck no thanks what were they thinking what no thank you i'll have none of that

600
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:05,200
please uh why am i scrolling through pictures of francisco von karma because you love her ben

601
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:13,600
no no you well that's true well i am yeah the reason why uh the reason why i like the

602
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:19,440
plots of the you know the phoenix ride games is because i'm a big sucker for murder mystery plots

603
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,000
even though it's pretty cliched i guess yeah that's the thing is like the butler did it like

604
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,080
murders is boring like somebody wanted someone dead you just got to figure out why and whatever

605
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:40,000
like oh the murder weapon oh i heard that before said the detective on the crime scene for the 100th

606
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,760
time oh someone's dead big surprise how cliche i said like putting the tape around the body

607
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,200
tell me something i don't know there's a fucking body whatever like it's it's like when it comes to

608
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:57,360
crime drama that is the the the most overused in media but it's obvious because it's like

609
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:05,840
higher stakes than a parking fine and i just saw a fucking detective crime game where it's like

610
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:13,040
who fucking who fucking hasn't paid their fucking parking tickets yeah a detective game

611
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:19,520
where it's just you go to see what car whether it has the the the parking meter like ticket if it

612
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:25,280
doesn't you give it a fine you just move on actually i want an open world game like that you

613
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,280
walk around entire city just giving out parking tickets well i'm sure that would be riveting

614
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:38,560
gameplay i mean you could you can make a good game out of anything you could you really could

615
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:44,000
make a good story out of anything stupid boring things that suck uh can be great as long as you

616
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,880
are yeah papers please papers please was a great game yeah that's what i hear because it was bad

617
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:57,360
you can make a good game about being being the coffee or the tea guy in a studio in a work

618
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,400
office it's like hey get the tea you got to make sure you get the tea before they're upset with

619
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,360
you what's what's what's that game on the nes where you just gotta fucking like give people root

620
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:16,240
beer you know the one oh something yeah i've seen it parody yeah you throw beer at people

621
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,800
but you always coming at you you go through sasperilla everybody's always uh rooting for beer

622
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,160
more more beer wait uh what does what does gaston say

623
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:39,360
but it's just like more than i can bear more beer what for i'm depressed and that's me in 2021

624
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,000
but uh i like i use beer and all of my decorating

625
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:52,560
i think uh the main reason i like uh murder mystery plots is just all the plot twists and

626
01:07:52,560 --> 01:08:02,640
surprise elements if if it's genuinely surprising that is and um i hate to be surprised no thanks

627
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:09,920
yeah i think that's right is it's pretty great like having having situations

628
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,080
that unfold in a way that you can't guess exactly what's gonna happen next and it's quite good

629
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,160
i always know that it's not obvious it's written really well yeah once the guy who made um the

630
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:29,200
first three he didn't do um miles edge worth investigations he there was a team of writers

631
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,240
that made what that one and apparently that one sucks hard that's a good thing i didn't play it

632
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,280
doesn't have his his his smart writing thought to like make everything fit together nicely

633
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,840
and that that that one video i made about professor leighton versus phoenix right um that

634
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,000
was also written by him and the creator of professor leighton so it was like doubly good

635
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,080
written that was such a good game oh yeah i i remember that video you made it was uh pretty

636
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:08,080
good from what i recall yeah it was before i i i didn't have and still don't know how to uh record

637
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:15,440
ds footage so i just don't it didn't bother i just pointed a camera at it well um i always like it

638
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:22,800
and murder mystery plots when the cop is turns out to be the bad guy or you know because that's

639
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,400
that's just real life yeah basically or you know when one of the good guys turns out to be the bad

640
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:35,840
guy because uh again it's kind of cliched but i uh i just love that betrayal plot point

641
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:43,840
and um do you remember i like to be surprised i like to be blind oh yeah i used to be a big fan

642
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:51,200
seemed like a look seemed like a little bit of it first series spoiler alert someone's a bad guy

643
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:59,440
nobody knows who it is no fuck someone's the bad guy what why would i want to watch a show

644
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:06,400
gib that has a bad guy in it i like good guys that would be an interesting experiment to have a show

645
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:14,240
where everything is just fine the whole time there's not even any problems hold no that's

646
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:22,000
that's just um isn't that just what like slice of life is well you know i don't think so because

647
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,160
like slice of life the problems they deal with are not big deals because it's usually from they

648
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:35,440
they have problems they okay okay they might have a problem or a conflict but like no one's

649
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:41,440
never like a murderer yeah it's always just like i mean maybe maybe sometimes there's like a

650
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:48,560
jerk late for the downside oh no how can i get to school that sucks how can i get to my first day

651
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,880
of school and eat my toast at the same time every story has a conflict no matter how small or big

652
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:00,240
it is no i'm gonna be i'm gonna brunch out i'm gonna break new ground i'm gonna have a story

653
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:06,000
when nothing happens at all nothing nothing happens a show about nothing that sounds quite

654
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,360
familiar to me nothing nothing happens maybe something happens on his way to work no nothing

655
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:17,360
happens it's just a shot of him driving for 45 minutes that's like uh that's like it's like

656
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,360
if you're murdered by a sign i guess that means you were sign found

657
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:32,880
oh god christ christ i'll fucking my sorry i um maybe i should tone it down from your honor

658
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,240
maybe you should fucking go to jail maybe you should fucking go to voice jail

659
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,320
this is the first time we ever put a guest in voice jail but there's a first time for everything i

660
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:58,160
guess uh so here's why i'm upset um i can't i can't get my gummies to be right oh i thought you

661
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:05,920
had the recipe correct no i can never i like i'll get it right one time and then i'll like try

662
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,600
and do it again and and then like it doesn't work like the last time i was like oh okay i wasn't

663
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:18,800
using enough pectin that's why they were coming out too like too too jello like and then i i tried

664
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,400
making some yesterday and i was like okay i'll use more pectin like i did last time so i used the

665
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,720
more pectin and they come out they come out like all fucking crumbly and gross and i'm like what

666
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,440
what did i do and then i go back to last and they come out gummy again i'm like it doesn't

667
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,400
work how are you measuring the same thing the input are you doing it very precisely i'm just

668
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,880
i'm just doing it with like a spoon you know with like measuring spoons oh okay i'm measuring

669
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,800
okay not like a spoon spoon no i really just remember like okay i use a tablespoon of this i

670
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:58,720
use a teaspoon of that um man man what about uh you know what you know what it is the the move

671
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,880
the move to corn syrup i don't i don't cook it i just like i just heated and dissolved it and

672
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,680
refrigerated the switch to corn corn syrup doesn't work that well honestly like the weird like

673
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:14,080
fiber shit the imo just worked so good it was so good and even though it's like it's like a weird

674
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:19,280
substitute for sugar but it's literally better than the real thing i can't fucking get a little behind

675
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:26,000
on the gummy saga what i remember you saying it's no longer keto gummies um what's the the sugar

676
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,920
thing is that part of keto you can't you can theoretically make them you can theoretically

677
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:40,480
make them with a like highly concentrated sugar solution in water but i decided to try making

678
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,760
them with corn syrup because corn syrup has a pretty similar consistency to the isomalt

679
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:52,560
oligosaccharide fiber syrup that i had been using for the keto variety and i just this is what i've

680
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,400
been this is what i've been trying to do and i just can't i just can't get it to be i just can't get

681
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:03,120
it to be both smooth and gummy like but also like have enough bite to it that it tastes like a gummy

682
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,640
and not just like a jiggler and i i i've made like three batches the last few days that have all

683
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:16,560
failed they're all trash um and it's annoying because pectin is expensive um like using a tablespoon

684
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:22,320
of fruit pectin is like well that's like several dollars worth of ingredients right there sure

685
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:29,520
blowing a lot of money on this uh project i'm think i can write it off i think i can write it

686
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,600
off as a taxable expense i hope well you talk about it i have probably use it as content as a

687
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,040
like thing to talk about on your on your income show that's that's what this is called the income

688
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:49,840
show i have probably spent possibly over a thousand dollars on like weird on like various powders

689
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:56,560
and like items and objects and molds and and liquids and ingredients and actually no i think

690
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,600
about it you've been doing it for quite a while that isn't that big of an expense if it's involving

691
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:07,520
like the equipment as as well well the i mean the equipment's not that i mean the molds were like

692
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:13,440
i don't know i probably like maybe like 50 or 70 bucks on all these different molds and so they

693
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,760
are not that expensive yeah but think of all the bitcoin yeah i think of all the bitcoin you could

694
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:24,400
have bought was that a thousand dollars ben oh man did i did i say last week that i'm out of the

695
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:32,960
bitcoin game you did yeah did i okay well i just i just want to say that uh i'm i'm you know i was

696
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,000
upset when i got out of the bitcoin because i had been up like a thousand dollars and when i got out

697
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,960
i had lost like 200 so like oh god but it could have been so much worse because it has continued

698
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:51,680
to go down since then i sold it at around like 30 35 k and now it is down to like under 32 so you

699
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:57,840
know i'm just glad that i sold when i did because it seems to be the the market has turned bearish

700
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,600
as they say i've got something to mention about coinbase specifically because that was the thing

701
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:11,840
i was using um apparently you can't take money out like in in in normal currency you can put

702
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,320
money in and you can trade the bitcoin for different cryptocurrencies but you need a different program

703
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:28,960
to turn it back into real money um so yeah my brother he he tried it as well and he found that

704
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:37,680
it was like like not good so don't get coinbase i guess i still look at how everyone says to use

705
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:44,800
coinbase yeah how's how's your one pound doing uh 83 pence right now it's actually gone yeah

706
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:51,520
since a little while ago so yeah it went really far down like yesterday it was down yeah yeah yeah

707
01:16:51,520 --> 01:17:01,200
around uh around midnight on around midnight on uh thursday it was down to like under 30 k

708
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,560
it's bounced back a little bit yeah i noticed it went down a lot but i don't know i just used

709
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:14,880
that opportunity to buy more did you actually yeah because in theory it should go up eventually in a

710
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:21,360
future at some point hopefully okay but did you but did you actually did you actually buy so yeah i

711
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:27,520
did buy someone it went down it hasn't really gone that far down if you look at the old time

712
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,520
yeah it's it's not really enough for me i would i wouldn't want it to get like i think i think it's

713
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,600
gonna go fresh and then i'll be like yeah but i think it's gonna go down further yeah i think it's

714
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:44,480
gonna go down further and settle it might i think it might settle around like maybe 25 or maybe 20

715
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,880
or maybe even lower i don't know and then it'll probably just hang out for a while and then maybe

716
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:57,200
it'll have another fucking boom or not another maybe it'll just dwindle to zero the bit the bitcoin

717
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,400
boom they're gonna have another with like one day like when everybody in the world owns bitcoin

718
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:08,000
and then the price goes to the moon everybody in the world will be a millionaire and everybody

719
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,880
will just start having babies left and right and that'll be the and that'll be the boomers

720
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:18,240
mark two the bitcoin boomers and that's why people have babies because of the bitcoin

721
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,400
because everyone i don't know when when good things happen people have babies and you can afford them

722
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,320
but that's a bad thing you don't want to have a bad thing to ruin a good thing

723
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:39,200
look i i don't know it's just when when babies is that's when well why do you think the first

724
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:44,640
baby boom happens because they died in the war and it's like we got to make more

725
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:53,440
no no you fucking weirdo it wasn't that like oh no everyone's happy that they're no longer getting

726
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,920
bombed so it's like yeah cool well was that plus the fact it was that plus the fact that

727
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,520
like the economy was going like nuts because of like the post war boom or whatever yeah like

728
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:12,560
now we can we can take all of germany's resources and yeah things are cheap hell yeah hell yeah

729
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,880
and like you know we i don't know we made like so we we made so much money on bombs or whatever i

730
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:24,080
don't know whatever the fuck it was whatever it was that we were doing that made our economy yeah

731
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:30,720
i i never really went back and learned more about world war two beyond documentaries that i

732
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:38,000
occasionally catch on tv and my school like education it's probably a lot more going on there

733
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,840
that like governments don't want me to know about probably probably yeah i mean i

734
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,560
surely everything's declassified now sure but like um my my specific like educate like i've

735
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:59,280
only seen documentaries broadcast on the bbc and my english so that's like that's definitely biased

736
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,480
perspective on exactly what happened i mean i don't know it seems like the bbc is a real piece of

737
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:12,960
shit bbc seems like it's a real fucking biased uh news yeah i i don't like like they're okay

738
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:19,280
for some things but i will never really forgive them for like ruining jeremy corbin's reputation

739
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,680
in that you know the whole anti-semitism thing which was stupid not even real

740
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,080
they just kept going about it until people believed in and he lost

741
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:37,520
great seems like it's a it's a little bit like it's a little bit like halfway between like something

742
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:43,280
like cnn and something like fox news which is like a really bad medium i don't know if it's like

743
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:50,080
that's not a good happy medium it's definitely a cnn like like similar sort of like liberal

744
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:59,760
not really yeah not the you know anti-socialist for sure yeah yeah sure okay so you're saying it's

745
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:05,520
just like just regular neolib shit yeah i mean i'm not like that you know i guess cnn i guess cnn would

746
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,640
i guess cnn would probably be similar like cnn is probably very much like hmm you know

747
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,400
are trans people corrupting our youth more at 11 you know give give both sides of the argument

748
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:21,680
or whatever yeah the enlightened centrist position like i could feel i feel like that would be

749
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:28,560
generally a normal bbc thought is like huh what if we yeah platformed both sides

750
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:42,320
hmm yes yes yes oh my god i saw um i saw i just happened to see a video of roosh

751
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:50,240
you know remember roosh uh roosh v who's that yeah roosh i think i heard of that name never

752
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:56,400
never heard of him i don't i don't you've never heard of him um well he used he used to be like

753
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:01,520
a pickup artist guy who i i kind of followed and i kind honestly i kind of liked him i'm

754
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,480
ashamed to say that now but like i'd like followed this guy and read his stuff and was like this guy

755
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:13,040
seems cool um and you know anytime he said like some misogyny stuff i was like haha that's he's

756
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,760
just joking about that well you know i know he's been really he's been really bad for a long time

757
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:25,040
but i saw him on like a live stream of him uh like that he did just like last week and he's talking to

758
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,760
some guy called he's called the muslim skeptic i think i don't know anything about that guy

759
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:36,160
but um he's like some muslim guy who doesn't i don't know that's literally all i know he's

760
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:42,000
a muslim and he's a skeptic um but i don't know roosh was just going he's just literally just

761
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,240
being like yeah you know hollywood's run by the jews you know they're all lying to you you know

762
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:52,560
they want to fucking do miscegenation to dilute the white race just on iran it's on iran so i was

763
01:22:52,560 --> 01:23:00,720
like i can't i can't believe it this this this guy used to be like this guy is like a hard he's

764
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:07,520
like a hardcore like traditional like uh like christian values guy now this guy used to be this

765
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:13,520
guy used to write books about how you could like um you know uh uh get one night stands with girls at

766
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:20,400
bars which is what i was here for well i mean in hindsight it doesn't seem that he's got a great

767
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:25,360
ridiculous that he would eventually he's got a great beard though strange he's got a great beard

768
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:31,840
he's gonna look great what looks fantastic a great beard spectacular i think uh this is what's

769
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:40,240
known in some circles as a grifter i don't think he is a grifter i think he's a genuinely a fucking

770
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:46,560
psycho i know i think he totally believes it he's he's i don't think he's just following the money

771
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:52,800
oh you never know it's tempting for some reason there i don't know i was just it was just

772
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,560
disturbing it's just disturbing because this is and and i met this guy i've probably said that

773
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:02,160
like i literally met this guy and hung out with him a couple times uh i have probably mentioned

774
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:09,040
that on here i met him i met him in poland this was this was before he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't

775
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,720
quite like this back then but that was what maybe like six years ago i don't know uh

776
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:22,720
so just so just unpleasant i was like i felt a little sick honestly hearing that well um this

777
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:29,920
is the perfect guy to get all your world world war two uh info from i think we gotta get ruche on the

778
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:39,040
podcast yeah please remind us about world war two who really was at fault how many how many i mean

779
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:46,480
you know hey six million that's like doesn't says okay well you know uh nobody is perfect not even

780
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:54,320
adolf hitler no yeah and and then all this time i thought he was but apparently apparently he's

781
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:59,200
cringe apparently he's said some cringe things now he's canceled yeah everybody makes mistakes

782
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,480
couldn't even you know what we should we should couldn't even finish the job

783
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:12,320
um sorry let's move on i don't even know why i don't know why i brought this up that letter

784
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:18,080
from christian i felt chipper now i'm depressed again oh just bring up the christian thing again

785
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:23,200
you'll be chipper all over oh yeah i'll just i'll just read the letter again i should i should

786
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:28,000
every time you feel down you just look at over at the podre and you're like uh yes

787
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,800
i think this is good nothing brings the mood down more than holocaust

788
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:39,280
it's it's actually it's actually pretty ugly honestly it's actually not a particularly

789
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:44,400
attractive rock uh this little bit of a hemi more fight it actually just looks like mold

790
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:53,040
um i i i'll show a picture in the in the podcast i wish i had a picture on like you

791
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:58,080
know i'll take a picture right now right fucking now a few moments later are you are you ready to

792
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:05,600
see this shit i'm ready uh no are you are you ready for the fucking to have your mind shattered

793
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:11,840
and your pelvis shattered uh here we go yes to the first part no to the second part

794
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,080
here we go yes to the second part podre

795
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,880
it looks like mold right it looks yeah it looks a little dusty like like it's something's growing

796
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,560
on it looks like uh yeah it's not like big chunks i mean it's not like big like crystal chunks

797
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:37,200
it's just like very small little like it's very small crystals just kind of like in like a layer

798
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:43,120
on top of this like geode rock or and that's what i was gonna say it looks like one of those georocks

799
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:50,000
or whatever they call it yeah i mean i guess it's not technically one it i don't or maybe i don't

800
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,320
know what if i don't know what specifically makes a geode geode ben do you have the capability to

801
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:04,320
make like a silicon mold like by by pouring it over this and make a podrian uh gummy

802
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:14,560
uh i would find a better rock to do that i guess i'm trying to think of ways this could be interesting

803
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:24,160
um man maybe shine ultraviolet light on it i've talked before about how cool it would be to have

804
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:31,200
like 3d molds of like rfck things like the various fruits and vegetables and a podrian too would be

805
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,600
cool and just make make gummies out of that once i once i had the perfect recipe and could actually

806
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:46,880
get my hands on the fucking ingredients i found a new flavor company though the new the new flavors

807
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,880
that i bought make the old the old ones were like bad like some of them were just terrible the new

808
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:58,720
ones incredible the new watermelon i got beautiful perfect guava love it strawberry decent cherry

809
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,960
pretty good this is a big step up from what it was so uh when you're gonna start selling these gummies

810
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,560
i don't know maybe never maybe never i don't know gotta make some money ben uh

811
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:22,320
maybe maybe i don't know you live in a capitalistic society you need to sell everything you make

812
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:30,320
it would take it would take a lot of um i would have to build up a bunch of infrastructure for that

813
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:35,040
i would have to i would have to have a lot of things in place that i don't have like a store

814
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:42,560
front and and molds and like a slightly more like a more a more steady supply of stuff and like a

815
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,560
settled upon recipe that i'm like this is what it's made of this is how i make it which i don't

816
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,520
really um i don't have any of that can't you just sell it online or something

817
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,120
well yeah but what about all that other stuff i just said uh step by step

818
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:09,120
i don't know i'm still gonna have a fucking etsy page i don't know whatever whatever uh sounds

819
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,200
complicated sounds complicated and like a dozen people would buy them and then

820
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,440
well that's even the point i mean what's the what's the point of anything you know

821
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,680
we're all just gonna die you know and soon too very soon that's a good point yeah the thing with um

822
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:30,640
like selling food products i think would be like much more complicated and annoying

823
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:38,320
like mailing them than it would probably like you would need to be a local like label

824
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:45,920
seller you'd have to go to the market i would at the very least have to like label them and get like

825
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:55,120
you know ingredient like they have to be labeled for sale yeah yeah yeah um food would be fun it

826
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:02,960
depends on how perishable they are if they go bad quickly then it's pretty difficult here's i mean

827
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,680
the thing about it is that like i don't expect to ever make any money from it so if i do it it'll

828
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:14,640
only because i think it would be fun and cool uh and i would just be and i could and i would

829
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:23,760
amuse me uh so if i ever do it that will be why yeah or maybe uh send it to people on on your

830
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:36,400
patreon as a patreon bonus no no anything but that no no i don't i don't want to i don't want to do

831
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:42,480
like monthly like i think like tom does like monthly or bi-monthly or whatever like care packages

832
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:47,760
i think maybe did she does i'm not sure she used to i'm not sure if she still does

833
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,600
yeah but i don't want to do that i feel like yeah like that would be you need to be making

834
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:01,680
uh like all of this extra stuff and then sending it in a little envelope on a usb stick or whatever

835
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:08,960
yeah which i kind of already do well i kind of do that just well because every now and then

836
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,520
somebody buys some more like pins or whatever so i'm kind of doing that but like those are just

837
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,480
one-time transactions it's not like it's it's not i don't i don't want to like set myself up with

838
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:25,600
any more like monthly or weekly responsibilities i mean to me that the idea of like setting up

839
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:32,240
things i mail to people makes less sense because the majority of like english speaking

840
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,440
viewers of things are gonna be from america which means a whole lot of bullshit shipping

841
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:45,120
oh that's true yeah that's a lie true it's always gonna be a hassle i could say europe only and

842
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:50,720
much less like things would happen yeah that's that's a good point it's just it's just gonna be

843
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:56,160
like inherently more expensive for you to do it oh and now because of brexit even europe is gonna be

844
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:06,560
fucking annoying nice god nice damn it awesome really uh you're really lucked out man europe's

845
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:13,840
so fucking cool like you know not england anymore no but it's it's it's so it's so fucking cool that

846
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,560
they just like decided like hey you know our borders like fuck them let's just set up like high

847
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,120
speed trains that just go everywhere between our fucking countries and they just did that

848
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:30,400
yeah that's so great i mean and then you you people just threw it in the trash well i mean the

849
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:36,640
train can't go over the water you personally ruined it you ruined it there's no point anymore

850
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:42,960
just throw it all away just i was there i was there in the shadows like climbing down like a

851
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,280
little rope and then whispering into the ear of the prime minister at the time whoever it was

852
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:54,640
saying dude brexit like that will be a cool title you know catchy slogan why didn't you just say that

853
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:01,520
and then they did and then you did well brexit does sound pretty cool it was really funny

854
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:10,160
you know the the word the name the name brexit so i can see why i cut on it's yeah it's catchy yeah

855
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:17,520
it's catchy annoyingly people are good at making things sound good even though they're bad

856
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:28,720
um i feel like we should have something to say about like the new president but like i don't

857
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:36,000
like nothing happens nothing's happened with that he's undone some some trump things immediately

858
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:44,800
which is like yeah sure a bare minimum so far cool i guess kids kids still in cages that's fine

859
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:54,320
that's good uh isn't that something that's been around for a long time um it would like the the

860
01:33:54,320 --> 01:34:02,000
centers were like built by obama they were used under obama trump like they've been used more

861
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:07,280
under trump but they could be does they could literally be dissolved and like emptied out like

862
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:12,320
under executive by executive order like anytime yeah but what i what i mean is it just seems like

863
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,480
we could literally just stop doing that any time it seems like that goes beyond the administrations

864
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:26,560
for whatever reason uh it doesn't it's like why would so many uh why would so many presidents

865
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:34,480
from different parties continue to do the same thing because they're all the same they're even yeah

866
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:39,040
that's right this is the only way you get because they're mostly they're mostly the same that the

867
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,680
only way you can get to the top is by appeasing the largest number of people which means you have to

868
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:49,760
have no morals no fiber no no character no character development that's right nothing you have to be

869
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:55,600
at an empty shell or otherwise uh a freak a ghost in the shell wait wait wait i'm writing all this

870
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:06,640

the podcast guys so endless jess digi bro don't like mumpkin jones they hate him right uh best

guy ever would rather not associate with him good thing all those people are never on the fucking

882
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:36,160
podcast anymore so this is not the first person to propose jones as a guest uh and then and then

883
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:40,800
more people would watch the podcast and it wouldn't be dead anymore uh what would you guys think this

884
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:46,720
is not the first time this has been suggested i mean is is monkey even like hot shit like he used

885
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:57,040
to be anymore i mean like i i i i literally propose this but but like yeah it wouldn't it wouldn't

886
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:01,920
revive it wouldn't revive the podcast to have mumke yeah mumke's not that hot shit mumke had a

887
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:08,480
moment there where he was like he was the he was the uh the the free speech uh uh you know help

888
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:15,360
i'm being censored guy du jour um and then and then and you know and then that came and went

889
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,880
and then he had his cringe arc and i was like he had his cringe arc which is pretty funny it was we

890
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:29,200
all had we all had a lot of laughs uh i mean yeah we could i guess i would say we could do that

891
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:34,960
and i wouldn't even be that opposed to it but it's not gonna revive the podcast like give me a give

892
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:43,520
me a break yeah i agree that's not gonna revive anything but um why not absolutely i mean yeah i

893
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:49,040
mean it's i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i think mumke's kind of an asshole but like whatever

894
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:54,480
like we had we had fucking we had more logic on so like whatever we it's not it's not like we have

895
01:37:54,480 --> 01:38:04,560
standards uh i guess so well um but whatever like i don't really care um okay the next the

ben saint is not a bad person wow three two one go you see ben isn't a bad person he isn't even a

916
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:49,600
stupid person he's just like his his worldview is all twisted up from all the lies he's ingested

917
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:58,640
honestly i think he could benefit from some form of formal re-education encampment of some kind

918
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:05,360
pony hypnosis teach him you know like facts and logic and stuff i love facts nobody loves

919
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:11,760

920
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:22,800
no no no education ben don't throw those out of the pram they go down the pram they stay in the

921
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:29,920
game it's pretty critical no i don't want to learn anything no i hate facts so much

01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:39,280
we're learning uh learning kind of sucks i'm not i'm not you know i'm just i'm just flawed you

923
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:44,640

924
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:53,280
lovable is that i hate the truth and i love uh lies next one don't we all

926
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,920
listening i'm a few episodes behind and i'm listening to gib talk about how she likes fire

927
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:17,920
and ben was like oh yeah fire's cool i guess but i'm not super stoked about it and nobody

928
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:26,960
no one recognized the pun what the fuck sorry i didn't even notice i mean you see if i was there

929
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:32,400
things would have been different yeah you would have said instead i mean yeah i mean i just i

930
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:41,440
say stoked as a matter of course so yeah wait was that accidental i think so yeah lol and then it

931
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:47,360
doesn't count that's just that's just a phrase that i use so yeah no it's gotta be on purpose

932
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:58,160
yeah but what so uh good good catch good catch uh the next one is called um the next one is called

933
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:04,080
uh my mic is bad sue me why would you title your voicemail that why wouldn't you title it about what

934
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:13,360
what the voicemail is actually about okay three two one go i cannot believe that you wrote off mr

935
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:19,120
boop's ending as an even gillian reference it is the ending spells out the running theme of the comic

936
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:25,040
a critique of escapism the characters return to the place of origin leaving alex head cannon as he

937
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,760
accepts that reveling in fantasy can never be a replacement for the real world it's beautiful

938
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:36,880
and it's great and thing you've made me so mad that i'm gonna go fuck my wife lisa simpson

939
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:44,880
but on the episode where she's an adult so it's not weird i mean i i did catch the whole like you

940
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:55,120
know that okay i just i just thought the ever thing was ever thing okay it didn't need the ever

941
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,000
music but uh whatever doesn't really matter here's what i think here's what i think um

942
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:07,520
i i disagree i know this is a joke voicemail but i'm gonna respond to it as though we're serious

943
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:15,280
which is a bad habit that i have um uh i i disagree that one of the that the theme that a theme of

944
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:22,640
betty of mr boop is like that like reveling in fantasy is bad that's like entirely an

945
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:29,920
a seat and act for thing like there's no there's nothing about that in like the first three acts

946
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:36,240
that's just like a sort of like last minute like twist at the end that gets added and it's not

947
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:45,840
relevant before that so i suppose i mean the joke seems to be that the the comic is is it looks like

948
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:53,280
a four panel punchline comic and there's no punchline all the time it's just like the the author

949
01:44:53,280 --> 01:45:00,240
is so stupid that he's just drawing about having sex with betty boop all the time and he's so brazenly

950
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:07,760
like unapologetically like making her love him over and over again so much that that is like

951
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:14,400
meta funny it's the author that we're laughing in the early acts yeah it's the it's the author the

952
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:20,240
idea that this guy is drawing about his his life and how everything's so fucking sick even though

953
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:26,720
it's clearly it's not quite as sick as he's trying to portray it is okay okay hold on

954
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:35,600
are you are you saying are you saying that like we're meant we're meant to read early mr boop

955
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:42,640
and read into it we're like the punchline of the early ones like is the hypothetical author

956
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:50,640
that is making the comic because like yeah because it's like ha ha some it's so weird

957
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:58,800
that some person drew this comic okay it's it's funny multiple levels but ultimately like the

958
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:05,360
punchline is about the author having drawn it like like ones where he's like you're never gonna

959
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:10,880
leave me right ha ha and she's like no i'll never leave you like that's never gonna happen ha ha

960
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:16,800
yes i love you so much in in fact it's it's like i'm gonna cry with how much i love like it's

961
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:24,800
there's there's elements of like unsureness in the way that he's like displaying affection

962
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:30,240
and he's drawing like it's it's multi-layered like i think the joke seems to be how soon does that

963
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:34,800
start to come in quite soon i think it's even before bugs bunny appears

964
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:42,400
hmm how the fuck is it is it boop.net is it sounding a lot like uh tails got trolled

965
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:51,040
uh a little bit a little bit like that um superficially yeah i mean sort of it's got some

966
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:58,640
it's it's uh tails gets trolled with boop characteristics um fuck uh

967
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:06,000
i mean it's similar in that it is a story which pulls all these fucking dudes together into

968
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:13,280
why can't i fucking find the website i can't believe far down when i when i click mr boop on

969
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:20,480
google does the webtoon comes up first and the fucking tv trips thing um oh god it's been

970
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:26,480
pushed so far i just want to look at the fucking website okay it's mr boop.net okay i found it um

971
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:37,520
okay so the first okay my wife is betty boop um okay even okay even in the second the second

972
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:45,920
comic is like i'll never get a divorce yeah and then it's the sort of the the the sure the the the

973
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:53,120
cocksuredness like like oh this is absolutely perfect but the cracks are so obvious and he's

974
01:47:53,200 --> 01:48:00,320
still drawing about them it's like it's it's funny for that sort of reason okay okay but is the but

975
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:06,320
is the message there that like i don't think no i don't think living living in living in a fantasy

976
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:12,560
is bad sure okay okay okay but what i'm saying is like i don't know if i don't know if you can

977
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:19,040
say that like yeah the ending which is sort of like the in which like the fantasy finally crumbles

978
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:26,640
is like oh yeah that's like the culmination of the theme of mr boop which is about like you know

979
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:33,840
how retreating into fantasy is bad and like this is this is the the result of it because i i don't

980
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:41,600
like the tension like the tension in the early comics yeah is about this like this like total

981
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:48,560
cocksuredness about like like being married to mr the total like like the totally sincere way in

982
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:56,320
which the character and i guess you one assumes also the author is like being married to mr boop

983
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:01,360
sure is to betty boop sure is great but then all this yeah all these cracks are showing in that facade

984
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:08,960
and i guess i guess it sort of depends on if you imagine that like within the diocese that the

985
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:16,480
comic is being made by the fictional alec who like real who is the one that you see in the videos

986
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:22,640
who is like yes i invented the comic mr boop it's a comic about how i married to betty boop i married

987
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:32,640
to betty boop you know you know like fuck i feel like i've sort of been like i guess i i read it

988
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:37,280
as like like it's a comedy right like it's jokes and it's meant to be funny and it's being made by

989
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:42,240
someone who thinks it's funny for this character to act this way but i think no you're supposed to

990
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:48,640
assume that that the what that the alec making these is not the real alec but the alec that we see

991
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:54,880
in the videos who is sort of subsumed by the fantasy yeah i mean i'm not sure how early on

992
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,560
you're supposed to feel that because if you just read the comic and don't see the videos

993
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:07,280
i mean yeah like are you supposed to to to read the comic and assume that the author doesn't know

994
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,960
what's going on like that they are a tales gets trolled or sonichu

995
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:17,360
author like they they actually think this is like good because the whole website is like that

996
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:27,360
it's like shitty website um like 90s i mean bad uh you know all that all that i think what do you

997
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:35,920
call it i can't think of the word to describe but it sounds a lot like my content i think that

998
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:42,480
i think that this is a failure of the series because i think that the series assumes that you

999
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:52,640
sort of are on board with thinking that the author is sincere right i guess i guess it's not

1000
01:50:52,640 --> 01:51:00,000
because like he made the video spelled out pretty clearly that's like you should assume that okay i

1001
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:06,720
i yeah i don't know how early is the is this the first like video that's what i know because i i

1002
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:11,440
i because i feel like that video is what established it was it was tongue in cheek

1003
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:17,200
like i could tell pretty quickly it wasn't like oh this is similar to sonichu and that the person

1004
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:22,480
making it has no idea what's going on and they don't realize how funny it is but it's very clearly

1005
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:29,840
obviously like constructed to be the way it is yeah yeah but it's still funny like like you

1006
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,840
can buy into the character once you know it's a character that's deliberately the author is one

1007
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:38,560
of the characters and he's playing it in a video that's like oh wow he's going to such lengths

1008
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:47,440
to tell this joke okay i mean at some point at some point the comic itself starts commenting on

1009
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:57,200
the fact that like alec in the comic draws these comics and like talks about himself drawing the

1010
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:06,880
comics but i feel like that's like act no no that's that's even in book two even by book two he's

1011
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:14,000
doing that damn okay okay so i think these themes are kind of established a little earlier than

1012
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:28,240
maybe i thought but but but but oh my god maybe maybe maybe maybe this maybe this voicemail is

1013
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:33,440
right maybe i am the fool maybe i've been under arresting any mr boop this whole time maybe it is

1014
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:42,640
a a a unified thematic hole shit i mean it could be i still i still feel like the presentation

1015
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:47,760
with the ava probably read it maybe i haven't watched ava in a while i forget whether the theme

1016
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:53,600
is exactly the same i i still feel like the ava reference doesn't add a lot this is a mr boop

1017
01:52:53,600 --> 01:53:03,360
podcast now i love mr boop everyone should read it and it's finished and it's not a lot

1018
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:07,680
everybody everyone who's a coward who says oh home stuck one piece they're too long i can't get

1019
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:15,200
into that this is very short so you have no excuse okay okay all right i guess my my central

1020
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:23,440
question then is for about the ending being good like is the the the ending is like the crumbling

1021
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:28,960
of this like fantasy so is are we meant to be thinking i don't know if we're meant to be thinking

1022
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:36,800
about the like i don't i don't know if we're supposed to think like oh this character has

1023
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:44,240
is like living in a fucking like unhealthy fantasy world that i don't know maybe we're supposed to

1024
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:50,240
but i i didn't i didn't start to think about that stuff until like way later maybe i might

1025
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,960
fuck i might go back and reread the whole thing like knowing like knowing how it ends and stuff

1026
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,520
so i can just so i can really have like a really well-formed opinion of like how thematically

1027
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:06,960
consistent is this well i should uh that's right yeah i should read it too so um if i'm on here the

1028
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:16,720
next time then i can contribute more to this uh discussion uh yeah if you yeah you should i mean

1029
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:21,760
yeah i don't know why i don't know why you wouldn't have already read it since it's the

1030
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:27,920
fucking breakout hit of 2020 probably the best thing that happened in 2020 was mr boob

1031
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:31,920
i'm feeling a lot more confident about being married to you now

1032
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:38,240
which if she leaves me i'll threaten to kill myself i'm just kidding i know that's this is

1033
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:44,960
later right like this is book three uh i don't know this is after he comes out of the coma this

1034
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:55,920
is like number 33 so this is not uh the mrs boob that i i remember this is book one apparently

1035
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:09,280
what yeah this is only number 33 fascinating okay all right enough enough boob talk enough boob talk

1036
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:17,040
uh it's time for act it's time for boob action when you when you step on a goomba that's a boob right

1037
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:22,560
well the sound it makes it no it's a it's a it's a it's a

1038
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,760
yeah i guess it's it's a foot stone it's a boop

1039
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:39,840
uh next one next one is called twitter warning funny joke okay three two one go

1040
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:47,040
uh you guys are all like i don't like twitter but uh have you ever tried shitter

1041
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:56,960
no no he was right uh it was pretty funny thanks for thanks for the voicemail

1042
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:10,400
okay next one next one is called an asian query so okay three two one go how long is a chinese name

1043
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:19,920
oh i get it oh i get it yeah it's just a statement

1044
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:29,040
uh it's not even well he said it was a query so yeah it was it was a it was a facade it was a

1045
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:35,120
it was a one two punch i need to get to this been going on you need to get your voicemail

1046
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:46,400
people to write one of my videos dude that should be a bonus episode where people like send in uh

1047
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:56,080
what literally what we're saying we just read it we just read the script oh god no well you know

1048
01:56:56,080 --> 01:57:02,400
what that would it would become just like just like two people would be the ones that ended up

1049
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:08,080
writing like most of it you know it would be like a handful of people might send like a little like

1050
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,200
little snippets and then like two people would be like ha ha and they'd write an entire script

1051
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:21,200
it would be horrible it'd be a nightmare no no unlike all of our other uh bonus episodes that

1052
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:26,720
would just make for terrible content so it's something acceptable i did kind of seriously

1053
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:33,520
consider doing that idea having somebody script one of my videos for me and i read it but uh i

1054
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:39,760
think that's not a very good idea yeah but would you outsource that to just a a gang of hooligans

1055
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:50,320
yeah that's that's probably okay yeah maybe okay okay next one is called and woo hussy ooh

1056
01:57:50,320 --> 01:58:02,000
woo uh three two one go there seems to be some confusion about us homestuck is my intellectual

1057
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:11,440
poverty and mine alone all of my head canons are 100% legitimate whereas yours are waffa

1058
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:19,600
way fake there is no room for interpretation whatsoever in homestuck not even a little bit

1059
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:26,240
to claim otherwise is hella c and also in violation of my legal rights as an artist

1060
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:35,760
i hope this quills things up ooh woo thanks hussy i didn't know you were such a fascist uh yeah

1061
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:41,600
oh that reminds me um last time there was that that talk i don't know actually we if we talked

1062
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:48,240
about it on the show but like the the thing you brought it up and the the hussy maybe being the

1063
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:55,360
problem behind yeah yeah yeah our gentleman situation i read that whole thread oh god

1064
01:58:55,360 --> 01:59:04,080
can you summarize for me i can the summary is that uh it's likely that it could be both of

1065
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:11,840
their fault and it's not just they fucked him over like he he uh implied in the thing that he leaked

1066
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:19,440
because the the the non-disclosure agreement for the whatever means that nobody can talk about it

1067
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:24,960
but he did leak something to someone who then made a post about it which is where everybody

1068
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:30,640
heard about it and then that was taken off but of course once it's out there it's out there um

1069
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:36,800
but the odd gentleman haven't said anything on their end and it was it was this guy basically

1070
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:42,720
going through you know somebody gave him a tip-off that hussy may have been the problem

1071
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:49,440
he took all of the statements and he cross-referenced it by talking to people involved uh seeing what

1072
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:55,200
was absolutely false and none of it was absolutely false nothing could be disproven

1073
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:03,440
which was uh curious and things seem to line up very very neatly um but the i think the the the

1074
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:10,960
main thing that seems pretty likely is the odd gentleman were uh they were waiting around for

1075
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:17,200
hussy to create the document that they could like the the the bible the the pitch bible the

1076
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:23,040
the thing of this is what the game has to be please make it um they were waiting for him to

1077
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:27,600
write a lot of stuff to to make that so that they could get started on developing the game

1078
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:34,880
and um he took a really long time with that and in the interim they were like okay we need to

1079
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:39,680
be making something so they started work on a different project which was the king's quest

1080
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:45,840
thing with the idea that since that's also a point and click they can use what they build

1081
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:53,680
with that for the hive swap thing later um but when hussy was ready he went to the odd gentleman

1082
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:59,360
all allegedly by the way that i'm saying um don't actually have any proof of all this

1083
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:05,920
but the idea is he well then it's proof we can just keep we can just keep repeating it

1084
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:12,000
as though it's true and then it will be well i i i want people to read the the the big post

1085
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,920
because it's quite extensive and it goes into a lot more detail than i'm going into so don't get

1086
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:22,800
the wrong impression but this is what i've gleaned from it is it's likely that they were working on

1087
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:29,520
king's quest because they had to wait for a while hussy did finally get him the thing but by that

1088
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:34,000
point they were already working on a different game and they said okay we have to finish this first

1089
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,760
because of contracts and stuff we'll get to hive swap afterwards and hussy was like furious and he

1090
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:47,040
like canceled the whole thing and then set about making like having his game be made in house with

1091
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:58,480
his own studio and then everything changed sounds like uh some hot goss that makes i mean if we only

1092
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,800
ever heard hussy's side of it before then i guess it's not surprising that the takeaway of it was

1093
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:08,240
it's their fault yeah there was lots of little bits where he's like making people believe that they

1094
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:12,880
were so unreasonable but like the more i think about it and the more i read about this thing i'm

1095
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:20,480
like what are the chances that this company of people are all fucking assholes and andrew hussy

1096
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:26,080
just happens to be like yeah and they literally just like took they literally just like let someone

1097
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:30,160
pay them a ton of money to make a game and then just didn't make it like that doesn't seem like the

1098
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:34,960
kind of thing you can get away with yeah and then the fact that there's a non-disclosure agreement

1099
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:41,600
with a with a settlement to like i don't know it's it's fishy which is why it's worth looking into

1100
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:50,560
and yeah you know like i said nothing is like absolutely provable but nothing that this this

1101
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:59,680
tip-off suggested is like like false necessarily like it's not you can't prove that it isn't true

1102
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:04,720
i guess that's the the the curious thing about it um we should have a link to that

1103
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:10,880
in the description well the the truth is usually somewhere in the middle with most things

1104
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:19,360
that's why you gotta have this why you gotta have jk rowling on the bbc to explain why trans

1105
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:27,920
people are a menace to society versus anyone else that says something else by the way that i hear

1106
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,200
both sides of the argument all of that said about andrew i don't necessarily think it makes him

1107
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:41,120
like a demon devil man it just it's like yeah like business is like complex and if he was handling it

1109
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:56,160
know i still like what he's made generally speaking you'd like to you think you'd chalk it up probably

1110
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:01,840
more to incompetence definitely more to incompetence than malice yeah sure no thanks like like his

1111
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:06,320
like i don't know i mean i don't really know what he's like as a person too much

1112
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:11,280
aside from his media that he's made which is like assuming you know what a youtube is like from

1113
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:20,480
watching videos of them well uh nobody's perfect not even adolf hitler yeah he all comes back to

patreon no five dollar months here oh god i get the bonus episodes again all of them

1142
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:40,800
they're great i'm listening to them no i'm listening to them on youtube please no not the ideal

1143
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:47,600
audio player uh true but you know what i'll accept it okay so the bonus episodes

1144
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:51,600
unlisted youtube videos and what do i hear

1145
02:08:51,840 --> 02:09:00,160
no okay maybe but it's not my fault

1146
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:08,480
it's a video thing's still going is that it is that it wait what was that last but he said

1147
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:17,360
he said something at the very end uh why why is it my fault um if there's ads on the if there's

1148
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:21,920
ads on the okay first of all there there should really be mp3s are they're not mp3s of the bonus

1149
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:26,800
episodes they're supposed to be they definitely should be there isn't so we should we should we

1150
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:32,400
should we should update that we should do that um thank you for mentioning it the ones on the okay

1151
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:38,240
the ones on youtube okay if there are ads on them i have personally removed ads from a lot of them

1152
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:43,200
if there are some on the new ones youtube might have just automatically put some no no youtube now

1153
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:49,600
they just put ads no matter what it's it's only whether like you having the um

1154
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:55,440
the uh you need a certain amount of subscribers to get monetization you can turn monetization on

1155
02:09:55,440 --> 02:10:02,800
and off but ads are like always on they've changed their their how that works so we definitely definitely

1156
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:09,440
sucks and we should make i thought they were mp3s there were there were of the there are

1157
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:14,560
out of the old ones maybe whoever has been supposed to do that has not been keeping up with it but uh

1158
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:20,640
okay well i guess uh you're gonna have to use ad blocker i mean it's not like i mean it's not

1159
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:25,280
like we make any money from ads on the bonus episodes it's not like i would put them on purpose

1160
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:29,280
because we would we must have made like less than a dollar on all views across all bonus

1161
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:38,080
episodes if that were the case um so you know nobody wants that the ultimate betrayal true

1162
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:46,160
youtube betrayed us keep keep your remember who your true enemies are okay next one is called

1163
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:54,880
setting the record straight for ghost stories three two one go i gotta set the record straight

1164
02:10:54,880 --> 02:11:00,240
about ghost stories being a shitty anime made into a gag dub because that's not entirely true

1165
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:05,680
it was based off a book series basically like anime goose bumps and was decently popular in japan

1166
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:11,840
it just wasn't amazing the main problem was that yokai watch wasn't invented yet so american

1167
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,280
didn't know what a yokai was and instead of trying to translate everything they just kind of went

1168
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:24,320
whatever so we got the masterpiece that the english dub is today i don't know this is referring to

1169
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:32,240
okay um we're i've heard you know the anime ghost stories nope yeah oh okay well it's long story

1170
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:39,040
short it has it has one of those gag dubs in english like the dub is not faithful it's just

1171
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:46,720
like deliberately stupid um oh and okay yeah and um okay so we said it must have just been a shitty

1172
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:51,120
anime that got a dub and i guess it's no the answer is no it wasn't necessarily shitty it just

1173
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:56,480
was not localizable so they didn't like try and do a faithful localization

1174
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:01,520
okay i mean whatever i don't care i don't care if ghost stories is a good anime or not

1175
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:08,720
well i guess that's why uh you should always go subs over dubs right um no because the

1176
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:15,280
fucking i i'm not gonna if it were if it had been dubbed faithfully it would have no value to me

1177
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:20,080
or to anyone i think well man i don't know whatever i mean i wouldn't care about it if it were just

1178
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:29,520
if it were just normal i like that it's weird shit and schlock and and goofy ass bullshit um

1179
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:38,800
okay next one is called wait a minute which one did i just yeah okay next one is called

1180
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:48,560
monstrous usurper three two one go do you know who henry jay waterness is no henry jay waterness

1181
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:57,520
is the right for the ceo of monsters incorporated during the movie salivan stills the company and

1182
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:09,920
becomes the new ceo he just ceases the power that's not right what the fuck uh he's talking about

1183
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:19,440
ink yeah but why um i guess the transfer of power was like he kills he just banishes the

1184
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:25,200
the spider man by pushing him in the door and it becomes the ceo i mean i assumed he was like

1185
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:30,880
like everyone thought he was the coolest guy that's vote for him to be the new guy you don't vote

1186
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:36,080
you don't vote i don't think he well i don't know how it worked i just i never thought i never

1187
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:41,040
thought it was like oh salivan just is the strongest so he rises to the top and he's now

1188
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:47,600
in charge who who cares why are we even talking why are we talking about monsters incorporated

1189
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:54,560
isn't that what uh isn't that what you did with the pcp ben yes it's it's no it's the exact same

1190
02:13:54,560 --> 02:14:01,120
it's the exact same thing became the ceo no no i'm the king i'm not mike wasoski in the situation

1191
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:07,600
that can't be the thing it cannot be the case i just what is the what is what is there

1192
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:15,520
is it so so this guy's asking is it is it fucked up that uh salivan like killed the ceo and took

1193
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:22,000
over the company uh i guess i didn't even know that i've never seen salivan's a good ceo so it's

1194
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:29,440
all fine there's no way to improve the only way the only way to beat a bad ceo is with a good ceo

1195
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:39,440
that's true i thought all these guys are bad though no not if they're nice not if they

1196
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:45,760
not if they have like fun sense of humor post uh things on twitter that are very funny

1197
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:52,640
it's good it's good when it's good when one guy owns everything honestly that's the way he's

1198
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:58,160

1219
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:36,400

or two but that was uh that was some quality this guy should be in this should be in voice

1221
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:49,600

1222
02:17:49,600 --> 02:18:01,760
three two one go i'm calling you out ben saint yeah catch up on one piece okay thanks you're right

1223
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:06,960
that's true how can you call you out if you don't if he doesn't even have a phone

1224
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,720
it just keeps getting longer it just keeps getting longer and longer and there's more

1225
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:20,000
like my dick make just like when i read it when i see corona pretty soon it's gonna be so long it's

1226
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:29,920
going to have a two piece when i i just how am i how am i how can i possibly stay current with one

1227
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:34,400
piece when new chapters just keep coming out like it's it's fucked up it doesn't make any sense

1228
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:41,520
i don't i don't understand uh i'll read game of thrones once it's finished yeah that's like trying

1229
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:48,880
to get up to date on penny arcade anyone remember penny arcade yeah sure sure but why would you

1230
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:55,840
ever want to be current oh god why would you ever do that it's funny because when i first started

1231
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:02,400
reading penny arcade it was back when they weren't around uh long enough to have too many

1232
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:08,400
issues so i actually went back and read all the issues they they published and i i actually did

1233
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:14,720
mean the comics right yeah it's comics but obviously now that that would be basically impossible

1234
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:22,480
there's just too many i mean they put one out like three times a week right um maybe i don't

1235
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:29,040
remember uh the schedule anymore all right i think funny i think i'm funny i'm pretty sure

1236
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:35,200
this is wrong but is penny arcade control alt delete or is that completely different

1237
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:40,560
no they're different you thought they were the same thing i thought they were the same thing in my

1238
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:44,960
head when i hear penny arcade why would they be the same thing why would the why would they be

1239
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:52,400
the same thing when they have our two different names i don't know penny arcade was the control

1240
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:57,440
alt delete is a subsidiary of penny arcade i don't fucking know no no they're they're literally

1241
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:03,760
bitter rivals they're bitter rivals um okay maybe that's why i've associated the two and then yeah

1242
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:08,960
yeah like a lot of people associate the two mostly it's to say like oh control alt delete is trash

1243
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:14,720
penny arcade is like that but good but like it's really not like penny arcade is also trash it's

1244
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:20,240
maybe slightly less trash but like penny arcade but it's just it's just been more successful

1245
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:26,640
penny arcade started in 96 i think and uh control delete started in the 2000s maybe

1246
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:34,000
early 2000s wow this is exactly the same as control delete it's not the same i mean it's bad

1247
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:40,000
and different i'm looking at it this is this is more sweet bro and hella jeff than then

1248
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:46,080
that i mean that's true that's true well i i think probably was inspired by penny arcade

1249
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:52,320
i don't know how i've never seen these characters i think i've seen the guy with the brownish hair

1250
02:20:53,600 --> 02:21:00,720
uh nowadays everybody associates control delete with the miscarriage comic yes meme

1251
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:10,640
loss yeah um penny arcade is is like the worst thing that penny arcade does i've said this before

1252
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:15,120
but like i like a lot of their like other like side projects that they've done over the years

1253
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:20,080
the comic is like unreadable it's i don't understand why they keep doing it i don't

1254
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:26,480
know anyone who likes it um i don't know why anyone would it's if it's a nightmare one thing that it

1255
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:33,920
always uh annoyed me about their comic is that um a lot of times you don't get the joke unless you

1256
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:40,800
read taiko's uh blog post about it yeah 100 you read the comic and you just be like uh i have no

1257
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:47,360
idea what they're talking about you know okay a couple things first of all gabes art style has

1258
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:53,600
like melted over the years and like i'm fine with him being more expressive but like it's really

1259
02:21:53,600 --> 02:22:01,200
it's gotten really weird looking like it just looks weird nowadays um and yeah the comic okay

1260
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:09,600
i used to i've listened to every single episode of the um of the dlc podcast which is the podcast

1261
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:14,960
that they would record like as they were writing the comic and it's literally it's them like riffing

1262
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:21,120
as they come up with the comic and i love that podcast it's great the comics are dog shit not

1263
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:27,280
a single one has ever been funny didn't they do videos of that podcast or something because there

1264
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:32,400
were video yeah there were some video episodes i remember watching the videos and uh those are

1265
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:39,840
pretty good i mean i've watched i've i've watched a ton of like side of like penny arcade side

1266
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:46,240
content and like penny arcade adjacent stuff like i watched um like i've i've i've watched i've

1267
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:53,680
listened to a lot of their old like um dnd uh uh groups and stuff like the c team mostly and uh

1268
02:22:54,800 --> 02:23:00,560
i mean i went to i went to pax that one year which was pretty great um what was that oh yeah

1269
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:05,920
and the strip search strip search was was the best thing we ever did and they never did it again

1270
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:11,360
because they're hacks because they're cowards wait uh that's the reality tv comic thing right

1271
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:17,840
yeah strip search i remember watching that it was really it was really good i mean it was kind it was

1272
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:23,840
kind of crap actually but it was kind of crap in a way that i liked and appreciated it's a reality tv

1273
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:31,760
what can you expect yeah i mean exactly um i i think control of delete is better than penny

1274
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:38,960
arcade just because it has loss and penny arcade doesn't doesn't have anything i'm looking around

1275
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:45,920
the closest thing the closest thing that penny arcade has to loss was the dick wolves comic which

1276
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:51,680
caused like a in hindsight like very minor and nobody actually gave a shit sort of like

1277
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:59,600
political correctness oh yeah i remember that scandal um but like at the time it seemed like

1278
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:04,640
a big deal but like nobody cares anymore and it's and it's honestly not even that funny and it's

1279
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:10,000
like not even worth explaining penny arcade is like um penny arcade is like the gaming equivalent

1280
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:17,680
of a garfield comic i think i i think i think you're giving it too much credit because it's

1281
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:23,600
not just like it penny arcade is not something that is just like a simple like you know relatable

1282
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:28,880
little like gag about something that's like oh ha ha i hate mondays oh ha ha lasagna no it's

1283
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:36,800
actually it's hyper specific about like whatever is like the fucking gaming news du jour of the

1284
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:42,000
week or whatever that like like you said you have to fucking read the text post that goes along with

1285
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:47,440
it and even then it's still not funny it's just like oh okay i guess i get what they were trying to

1286
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:52,400
say and the other thing about it is that like half of them are not even about like being gamers

1287
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:56,560
anymore not that this is necessarily bad but it's not really like even a gaming webcomic

1288
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:04,880
entirely it's a lot of it is just about like being dads which is fine um but i don't know

1289
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:12,320
it's not well i never um it's weird i honestly never was that big of a fan of the comic i mostly

1290
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:19,920
went to the website to read tyco's blog posts yeah it was a big inspiration to me as a writer

1291
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:27,920
back in the day what are they what are they what are they doing now are they just like

1292
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:33,760
streaming shit on twitch uh i don't know seems like that's most of what they do nowadays like um jerry

1293
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:42,400
has the um jerry has like a a twitch show about like beer brewing or something and then they have

1294
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:47,760
like a dnd group that also drinks the beer that they brew and they have a couple of like other

1295
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:55,440
sites i think see i assume c team is still going i assume the comic is still going yeah of course

1296
02:25:55,440 --> 02:26:00,000
the comic is still going the comic will go forever even though it's like no even though nobody wants

1297
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:08,160
it just just an uninertia it will continue until we're all dead um man penny arcade is such a

1298
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:16,720
fucking bizarre you know honestly lecture idea is like the penny arcade diaspora because it has

1299
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:22,560
like it spawned so many like weird things that have just like spiraled out into his whole little

1300
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:27,680
universe like the whole the whole child's play thing it's like it's like a big or was like a

1301
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:34,400
really big thing for a while um yeah i remember that yeah i mean i assume it still goes on but

1302
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:40,400
what always surprised me about penny arcade is uh how he got so popular that they started their own

1303
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:46,240
gaming convention and now it's like one of the most popular gaming conventions almost up there

1304
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:53,680
was a three it's it's wild and like the comic did not deserve any like it like it's not good enough

1305
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:59,680
it's just it's just doesn't deserve all of this shit that like was created off the back of this

1306
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:05,600
shitty gamer webcomic but i guess because the like the only alternative was control alt elite which

1307
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:15,040
people hated more like it had to be these guys i guess i don't know oh my god man nice image

1308
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:25,760
resolution i i can't find a bigger nice image resolution you got there god god all right

1309
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:33,440
this this has um that guy with the glasses energy this whole thing that comic or like the

1310
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:37,920
comic no no the yeah the things i'm looking at all of all of these panels and things are just sort of

1311
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:44,400
like early internet but like would never thrive today sort of feeling

1312
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:56,960
yeah they i mean i mean that's that's where it came from and like they have like to their credit

1313
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:02,480
like they have used this platform to like delve into all kinds of other weird shit like

1314
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:07,040
like side comics and like you know they've made like you know

1315
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:13,600
pen and paper rpg modules and they've done like twitch shows and they started conventions and

1316
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:18,160
they still these other projects and they do all this other fucking shit and like that's all well

1317
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:23,120
and good and i think that's pretty cool it's just really funny that like the the content that spawned

1318
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:29,200
it all is like totally unworthy of any of it it's i think maybe um i think maybe the only reason

1319
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:34,880
they got popular is because they were one of the first ones probably yes yes usually how it is

1320
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:42,400
yeah of course and i was one of the first uh retro review websites and i never got popular

1321
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:47,440
so it was it was the fucking wild west back then the

1322
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:58,000
oh god the trenches is still going i think i remember what that is but i forgot i remember

1323
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:06,160
but i forgot i just who who reads the trenches who is this for christ

1324
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:13,840
honestly when i see this like gives me a sort of like terror like i'm imagining that there's like

1325
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:20,560
there's some contingent of people out there who do who actually read penny arcade for the comics

1326
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:27,920
keep up with the comics read fucking the trenches read um um what's the other one that uh

1327
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:36,080
i don't know vg cats like i'm just thinking of like other things that have like i don't know

1328
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:41,680
anything else that fucking like scott curtz does you know and then like i get it i get like the

1329
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:47,680
heebie jeebies when i think it's it's almost like i'm staring like into like the deep like the ocean

1330
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:52,080
and it's like some like i think i just uh for some people it's lovecraft it's lovecraftian it's

1331
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:57,040
feels lovecraftian that there's like a whole there's a whole there must there must the existence

1332
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:03,280
the continued existence of the trenches implies to me that there is an entire universe of like

1333
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:07,520
people and culture out there that is totally alien to me who i can never understand and they

1334
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:12,560
will never understand me and i'm afraid of them i think it's just uh for some people it just

1335
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:19,440
becomes a tradition you know you just yeah don't stop that's true i guess that's true i

1336
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:25,840
guess that's true and i have done that before i have like read stuff like just out of tradition

1337
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:31,200
just like but i have i have long since abandoned all such traditions i don't keep up with anything

1338
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:40,640
anymore uh i can't relate to anyone that does uh i don't know all right you move on to the next

1339
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:49,760
voicemail yeah many do we have left uh it's not that many uh we have um what was that that one was um

1340
02:30:52,800 --> 02:31:01,680
one two three four we have seven left okay so it's oh my okay lol hopefully they're all short ones

1341
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:09,840
that was the most paramount of reminders so the next one is called wait um the next one is called uh

1342
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:19,520
last year on the pcp three two one go oh and while i'm here apologies for the ass phone mic quality

1343
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:24,720
i'm in my bed didn't feel like getting up i don't care another thing you guys uh still don't have an

1344
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:29,200
about section on your channel it still says under construction don't know if you guys want to do

1345
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:34,240
anything about that but i thought it would be a good reminder to us all that the channel's got

1346
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:41,200
hacked about a year ago um it didn't used to say under construction i know that it says under

1347
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:46,720
construction i think like i asked Nate about that at some point and he said that no that wasn't

1348
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:52,640
because of the hack but i'm not sure maybe it is i don't remember what was there on that before i

1349
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:58,080
don't really look at the channel itself the about page but i guess we could fill it in with like

1350
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:04,480
pcp is a thing under construction is like a pretty cringe thing for it to say honestly

1351
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:09,200
yeah that's the kind of thing that websites from 2001 would have on their front page

1352
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:15,920
was it was it a year ago that it got hacked was it that long i think so

1353
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:25,440
hmm wow i'm trying to think of the the situation because we got the channel back or like some of

1354
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:31,360
the channel's back so it was like not all of once that it was resolved and garlach house still

1364
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:46,640
the physics sim is called a powder game oh it is on the gamble website and there's also a mobile

1365
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:53,760
version i highly recommend it because it's fucking free and uh it's great to pass time if you're like

1366
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:58,240
the what what i used it for is i would be sitting there are other watch lecture there are variant

1367
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:03,520
versions that other people still and listen to somebody talk even if i am paying attention to

1368
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:08,480
what they're saying so i would just pull out my phone or my laptop because you can do that in

1369
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:15,360
college and i would just set up some metal bowls and put water that would infinitely

1370
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:21,840
respawn at the top and just watch the water eat through the metal bowls by resting them

1371
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:30,080
and that's just watch that the whole time and uh and i barely passed my classes that semester

1372
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:38,320
so maybe i'm not as good at multitasking as i thought okay but uh i had fun i guess this is

1373
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:44,080
not this is not the one i was thinking of i have seen others that are different from this one this

02:35:54,800 --> 02:36:03,200
maybe there's like a pixel limit okay i'm gonna reload um okay s ball oh it's super bouncy ball

1384
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:08,400
oh whoa look at it go oh can you uh can you actually learn physics with this

1385
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:21,360
no no definitely not definitely not oh oh dude put some gas and then light it on fire

1386
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:30,080
there's another one that is like a bigger screen and it's like it's got materials in it that are like

1387
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:36,880
like you know uranium and like plutonium and you can you like electrons and positrons and like you

1388
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:42,880
know neutrons and stuff and and neutrinos and uh and there's like mystery materials that will do

1389
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:50,160
like weird like rainbow explosions and stuff if you combine them in certain ways uh oh firework oh you

1390
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:56,400
put oh you put down some firework and then drop some magma on it that's pretty cool that's pretty

1391
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:05,360
cool right there oh the pump is pretty cool it drags things along its thing okay now we're just

1392
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:13,280
playing a video game yeah now we're yeah yeah yeah this has become a let's play okay i yeah i think it

1393
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:18,080
i think it just um there's like a limit for how many things you can put on the screen and it

1394
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:25,920
eventually just like stops you from putting more so that explains uh everything okay yeah yeah enough

1395
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:33,360
enough but anyway uh was it called powder game yeah powder game that's one of them anyway um

1396
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:46,320
next one is called uh Tommy J Ben's physics sim game thing ps uh wait there we go okay three two one

1397
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:54,000
go forgot to mention a powder game is the browser version is not in flash it works some other way

1398
02:37:54,640 --> 02:38:04,560
so it still works it is not broken even though flash has died kind of based based based it works in

1399
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:16,400
some other mysterious manner uh maybe it's html maybe it's html uh next one is called gas lighting

1400
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:19,440
more like gas lighting but to gas means fart now

1401
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:30,640
there it is okay three two one go why is it called gas lighting like i i know what it means and i see

1402
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:36,080
it all the time but like i have to manually reach into my brain to find the definition every

1403
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:42,320
single time i see it just because like i the name and that definition i think it's i think it's from

1404
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:49,280
like my head because like what why is it what's just have is to have some analogy with like physical

1405
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:57,760
using gas no to light something how am i supposed to know how that works i'm an e-boy in the age

1406
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:05,840
we need a new gas lighting that is just the same thing but with a different name for the new generation

1407
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:11,120
sending this voicemail was a really roundabout way to just google it but uh from wikipedia the

1408
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:17,840
term originated from the british play gas light 1938 performed as angel street in the united

1409
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:26,880
states and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations um term originates in the systemic psychological

1410
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:33,600
manipulation of a victim by her husband and patrick hamilton's play gas light in the story

1411
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:38,480
the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane the play's title

1412
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:44,240
alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home while pretending

1413
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:52,320
nothing has changed okay so in the in the play this is a lay epic reference oh that's that's very

1414
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:58,720
oddly specific in the play he tries to convince her she's crazy by doing some weird shit with the

1415
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:05,920
lights and so that's where the play gets its name from and the term gets its name from the play so

1416
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:12,320
there you go so the the term references a play that nobody has seen in modern modern times

1417
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:19,440
probably more people know it from the term probably by a wide margin i would think

1418
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:29,920
oh but that's okay sometimes things are just like that uh okay next i'm stretching okay next

1419
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:39,440
voicemail is called um tommy j ben's crush three two one go yeah i hope i'm not the only one who

1420
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:46,960
caught this uh ben is like trying to explain all these stupid little like running voicemail gags

1421
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:55,200
and stuff like that to fucking this double cast person ben you're just like me you're the cute one

1422
02:40:55,200 --> 02:41:02,320

1424
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:17,120

1427
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:36,720
trying to that i'm like explaining something that i'm like interested in i guess that would make

1428
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:45,920
sense but this voicemail is called ben's crush who's my crush is in double cursed i guess i don't

1429
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:54,960
think so maybe it's crushed as in you were crushed you think he crushed me with this voicemail

1430
02:41:54,960 --> 02:42:02,960
and he crushed you with facts and logic hmm hey fuck fuck you tommy j i'm not the cute one

1431
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:10,320
i'm not a cute one i am that's like the second voice that i've been crushed by facts and logic

1432
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:16,640
a couple times in these but this is the last one by the way this is uh the last voicemail we

1433
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:28,960
is called tommy j why is education a cable package um okay three two one go why is college a cable

1434
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:35,040
package why do i have to take fucking art classes and history and shit i mean the classes didn't

1435
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:39,920
suck or anything but they weren't i wouldn't have bought them on their own because i can just

1436
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:46,560
look at the internet and learn things like i mean the history class it took it's kind of cool

1437
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:53,040
i read a bunch of fucking primary sources which never did in high school that's like awful that the

1438
02:42:53,040 --> 02:43:00,560
only primary source you read in high school history class is like the constitution and the declaration

1439
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:07,600
and maybe the guettysburg address and that's like it like they talked about fucking magna

1440
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:16,000
card and shit all the time in high school i don't know a single word of that thing that's kind of

1441
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:22,960
bad why is education a cable package why do i have to buy all of this shit that i do not want

1442
02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:30,320
i want the fucking database classes and the fucking software practice and uh operating

1443
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:38,240
systems i do not want fucking um music theory the music theory class is fine too but i would not

1444
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:47,600
have fucking paid for it on its own um and then and then communications and gender still

1445
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:57,600
wasn't as bad as i expected it to be but it just it's just why why okay first off i feel like you

1446
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:01,520
went a little off the rails there first you're like why is it a cable package why do i have to get all

1447
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:09,280
this other stuff and then you're like oh but they didn't teach me about the magna carta well so i mean

1448
02:44:10,160 --> 02:44:16,160
it sounds like so you want your education to be broader but ignore ignoring that um okay like

1449
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:22,720
without without defending like the business model of private universities too hard i i will defend

1450
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:30,480
like okay if you just want to understand like operating systems and databases i feel like there

1451
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:35,760
are like degrees and certifications you can get like an associate's degree or or some kind of

1452
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:42,640
certification course for that uh you can go to a career school they have schools for that yeah if

1453
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:49,920
you're if you're um if you're going to college for your bachelor's degree like that is a like yeah

1454
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:57,760
you have a like a focus you have a major or whatever um but like the point of a liberal arts

1455
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:06,400
education is not just i mean you know just despite what people say right i know some people are like

1456
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:11,520
uh you know fucking oh this fucking uh bullshit liberal arts stuff like oh gender studies like

1457
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:17,280
whatever you know despite all that like the point of a liberal arts education like a bachelor's degree

1458
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:24,080
is to like create like a well educated population and to give you like a broad education like the

1459
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:28,720
point is to make you a well educated person in general not just to prepare you for the workforce

1460
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:36,080
and i know i know that it's kind of fucked up and to make you well rounded i think is what you mean

1461
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:42,560
yeah i know that it's kind of fucked up because like even just for the purpose of getting a job

1462
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:48,720
you're expected to have this like broad education this bachelor's degree or whatever that includes

1463
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:54,320
all this like tertiary liberal arts stuff and like yeah i agree that that's fucked up but like

1464
02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:01,840
in in theory that's what the purpose of a degree like that is and so i understand it uh

1465
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:10,000
uh it's uh it's a weird it's a weird sort of the wires that get get crossed there where like

1466
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:18,080
jobs jobs require this like jobs expect this like broad and non-specific education

1467
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:26,000
and therefore and therefore job seekers get this broad education but then people are like oh this

1468
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,160
education is too broad because we don't need it to get a job but like it wasn't meant to be for

1469
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:38,400
the job in the first place but it like became that due to like cultural expectation and the

1470
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:44,080
fucking private university business model i don't know i think uh most of college is just a scam to

1471
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:51,440
get you pay money but um well the weird thing is uh because you mentioned private universities but

1472
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:55,760
the weird thing is even public universities feel like they're just trying to scam you into

1473
02:46:55,760 --> 02:47:06,880
getting your money a lot of the time i mean yeah okay yes you have to spend hundreds of

1474
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:12,640
dollars on books that don't shouldn't cost that much and then spend like a hundred and fifty

1475
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:18,640
dollars on a calculator from texas instruments because that's the only calculator that your math

1476
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:27,440
class is going to accept i mean true uh yeah i'm not trying to i'm not trying to defend any of that

1477
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:37,200
yeah i mean there's a whole lot of bullshit with it but like okay if this question is about like

1478
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:43,760
why do i have to study all this other stuff in addition to what you know i want to get my degree in

1479
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:51,040
that's why it's because like i don't know i think the answer is pretty simple was originally intended

1480
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:57,440
to be more than just a a specific a job specific like training program i think the answer is pretty

1481
02:47:57,440 --> 02:48:04,240
simple it's uh money they want you to spend money that's what it comes out my answer is my answer is

1482
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:16,000
better my answer is more cynical yeah it's shorter and but i'm i'm trying i'm trying to see uh

1483
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:23,520
don't don't cast me don't cast me as the as the as the as the fucking private college

1484
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:29,760
apologia guy that's not where i want to be don't make me defend these monsters but that's like

1485
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:36,640
where the idea comes from yeah but maybe that idea was manufactured by them just to make you spend

1486
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:46,000
more money no it's it's older it's older than that it's an older idea than that it comes from like

1487
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:52,320
it comes from like old ideas of like what a classical education should be and the you know

1488
02:48:52,320 --> 02:48:56,880
you know like the kinds that like fucking like aristocrats would get not because they need a job

1489
02:48:56,960 --> 02:49:00,320
because they don't need a job because they'll just fucking live off their family holdings

1490
02:49:00,320 --> 02:49:06,400
or whatever just based on like i don't know Hellenistic ideas of like truth and beauty and

1491
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:11,200
shit you know but doesn't that still come to the whole rich versus poor thing

1492
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:21,520
i mean that is a a thing maybe it's just an invention of the rich from the very beginning

1493
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:36,400
huh what my answer is who cares i fuck you fuck both of you i was playing powder game

1494
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:39,760
it's so much more interesting i'll fucking kill you i'll fucking kill you

1495
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:44,960
dude i've i've i've planted seeds oh no they're burning

1496
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:49,600
i i didn't realize scenes what is this uh animal crossing

1497
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:55,120
fuck fuck powder game i'm gonna go play the better version of powder game it's called noita

1498
02:49:55,120 --> 02:50:02,560
because it has like machine gun ones and spells and and bombs and shit and laser beams um machine

1499
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:12,240
gun ones then i have to play it for sure it goes yeah it goes um i'm gonna play a better version

02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:19,520
of that which is phoenix right no please oh we all we all know that phoenix is always right

1501
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:29,440
die all right i fucking hate i fucking hate the pro crassonators podcast patreon.com slash the

1502
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:36,320
procrastinators pro crassonators podcast we we should get uh i'm gonna complain i'm gonna

1503
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:41,840
complain in the general chat about who should be making these fucking mp3s that's elisar's job

1504
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:46,400
right is it i don't know if it is it might not be um but i'm gonna tell elisar the better

fucking do that or i'll kill him uh and then we will get we'll get a fucking mp3s for your bonus

1506
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:57,680
episodes you don't have to watch them on youtube uh and hopefully we can get that ad-free experience

1507
02:50:57,680 --> 02:51:06,560
i think i'm on the latest bonus episode right yes at least until oh my oh my god i've made

1508
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:12,240
like a stable vortex i don't even know what's going on that's actually pretty awesome this looks

1509
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:19,360
like a scene of a murder crime mystery a murder crime as opposed to a different type of murder

1510
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:26,960
you are on the latest bonus episode at least until elisar gets that uh that the bonus uh

1511
02:51:26,960 --> 02:51:31,920
content cut content episode done i thought it didn't make sense but murder crime does make

1512
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:38,480
sense as a thing to say this looks very rsck this looks very rsck core what is all that green

1513
02:51:38,480 --> 02:51:45,040
shit it's it's like i put seeds and then ants and the ants built from the seeds and they built in

1514
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:51,200
all directions and then something caught fire and now there's a vortex swirling of the the vines

1515
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:56,560
are constantly growing and the fire is constantly putting them out and flying up so the green

1516
02:51:57,200 --> 02:52:05,840
so the green is vines the red is ants the red is magma or something or fire okay i thought the

1517
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:14,720
green was slimes i mean i wanted it to be but i guess it's seeds well i put seeds and vines

1518
02:52:14,720 --> 02:52:21,440
and then ants and i guess the vines constantly grow so they like nobody this is like a stalemate

1519
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:27,680
entropy will run out in the end no one no one can win in this in the battle in the battle of war

1520
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:36,240
