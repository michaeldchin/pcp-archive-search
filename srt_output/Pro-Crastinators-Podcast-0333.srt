I was, it was a nightmare.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Uh, tell me, Ben, what convinced you about the big lie?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Um, why do you now believe in the big lie right now?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Um, it's just because women wouldn't date me because I was a conservative.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So to open up my dating pool, to get those blue-haired sluts, I had to, I had to get the jab.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Nice.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,840
away with it if there's one thing you can't take away from the Chinese is

Gremlins movie I'm described I haven't seen Gremlins you haven't seen

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,320

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Chinese family wait there was the guy who had the he had the the Gremlin the

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,920
the ancient Chinese guy with the gremlin and you mean Billy Peltzer no it's

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,720
like the little little boy goes into this this ancient Chinese gift shop and

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
there's a gremlin in there and he's like oh don't feed it right that's what

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,080
happens don't think that's the plot of the movie yeah and how I understand it

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,880
he says don't feed it and the little boys like why and then he then the guy

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,600
says oh because he's currently working it's not his lunch break can't eat right

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
hmm

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:57,760
um iconic scene the the China what do we try I think China thumbs up okay hey

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,000
political news Liz trust is dead yeah finally let's trust is cute I think she's

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,640
cute I like why did you put why did you do that why did you think she's cute

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,520
I like her I mean if she were if she were like if she were like 20 years

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,120
younger she'd be she'd be assault she'd be a solid a solid six out of ten which

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,360
is a 10 out of 10 in my opinion why why would you say it why would you do that

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,040
why would you do this like her face just like her face look I've never heard

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,800
her speak I don't know anything about her that would ruin the illusion if you

69
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,960
just think I just think she's I just think she's neat I just think she's

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,640
cute confirm something for for us before you continue all right if less

71
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,320
trust was a POC women would she still be attracted to you attracted yeah so

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:06,280
trust was it was a POC was a POC woman yeah I mean it would change it would

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,640
change her appeal would change her appeal that's very diplomatic way of

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,800
saying that insane very very political answer and the topic is politics after

75
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,200
all so you're not you're not off topic but you might be off you might be off

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,840
colored in other words you know really much another that I have to say about

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,240
the Liz trust thing being gone it's just that like some last episode of talking

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,480
about it and then I think even before the episode came out she was gone so it

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,480
was out of date yeah so someone I saw a tweet that was like as an American the

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,480
concept of a politician resigning because they fucked everything up and

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,200
everyone hates them is like completely foreign and that's that's exactly how I

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,120
feel like wow she left just because she failed and ruined everything like what a

83
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,840
what a concept yeah amazing it's it's I mean I don't know why it's different I

84
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:16,560
think it's like you can resign whenever you want but like to save your political

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,680
future like you can get bullied out by say by all the other politicians saying

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,680
yeah we're gonna we don't like that and what future do you have what what

87
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,880
political future do you have when you take over the part of the as prime

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400
minister and then you're like oh fuck I have to stop being prime minister

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,040
immediately is a prime minister like the endpoint you know everyone's trying to

90
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,840
be prime minister or something you know it's pretty good yeah get big money you

91
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,640
get big money for it even after you she saw the view from the top from the top

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,120
of the world she's like never mind I like it here I think the only reason she

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,680
stayed as long as she did was because of like ego like it was like oh but I'm I

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,400
would do such a good job if only everyone in the entire world would just agree

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,840
with my idea it's that scene from the beginning of Dark Crystal when the

96
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,960
emperor is dying and the Chamberlain tries to take his staff or whatever he

97
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,960
said I am still emperor and then he crumbles to dust kind of like that scene

98
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,800
at the beginning of the Dark Knight Rises where Bane steals the plane Liz

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,760
Truss is the plane in the scenario exactly yeah exactly right because I

100
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,960
haven't seen that one actually you haven't seen the Bane movie no I haven't

101
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,360
seen the Bane movie just watch the first five minutes and that's like the best

102
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,600
part of the movie yeah the first five minutes that plane seemed iconic can't

103
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,720
believe they whitewashed Bane it's okay so mad look so mad that they erase a POC

104
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,880
voice yeah exactly that's true I've heard I've heard people say that he's like

105
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,200
Mexican right he's original or yeah he is Mexican look I remember reading that

106
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,160
comic like years ago you know what I'm you know what Bane's like original like

107
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:20,440
origin story was I forget it was um he was born in a prison and then he I mean

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,360
that kind of happens oh he was born in darkness molded by it well he was kind

109
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,920
of there was like a there was like a teddy bear that told him that you should

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,320
kill Batman and he's like oh okay I'll do that I'll go murder him right now I see

111
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,000
and he and he devised a team of other a very diverse team and there was a guy

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,480
with a lasso on his team that was very important he had a guy with a lasso on

113
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,880
his team to confront Batman because you know that's amazing in case Batman

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,080
through he can't get away he's in ropes and my understanding is what you're

115
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,280
telling me that his origin story is that as a child a teddy bear told him that

116
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,880
he should he should assemble a team to kill Batman kind of it's a very I'm

117
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,560
giving you a very rough version but I know at one point his teddy bear told

118
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,680
them was it the teddy bear from Dengan Rompah yeah he was a big anime like all

119
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,440
Mexicans persona five or three like all Mexicans Bane was a really big anime

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,080
and he modeled he modeled his like that's why he got all swollen he saw Goku he's

121
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,800
like oh I gotta get big and then he's like and then Goku he fights strong

122
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,320
opponents and Bane was like I gotta fight the biggest guys around and who's

123
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,200
bigger than Batman Superman yeah but you know you gotta start you gotta start

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,040
somewhere you know right had a sensible goals if you were to you know yeah you

125
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,440
gotta take on all the justice like you gotta start with Batman first he is he

126
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
is human after all

127
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,200
yeah exactly he just has gadgets and if you have a guy with a lasso on your team

128
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,600
you could like catch his batarangs in midair hmm yeah right easily it's the

129
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,880
effectiveness so now it's like rock-paper-scissors lasso beats

130
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:19,160
batarang right right right you guys um you guys up for a quick for a quick

205
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,920
obvious I don't know why I thought whatever oh they kind of reminds me of

206
00:17:52,920 --> 00:18:00,760
the twig from Animal Crossing oh it's because he's like gay it's like that

207
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,880
fin boy bunny it's um it's funny when people draw the whole like thick Animal

208
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,000
Crossing characters when they all just have like like oval bodies no one really

209
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,660
has like so no one really has like defining like body types in Animal

210
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,440
Crossing well you mean like when they draw like the characters torso it's just

211
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,800
like the cutesy animal crossing shaped torso but then they have huge thighs and

212
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,880
a butt yeah when they um when they gave a like on the fat pussy with a fat butt

213
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,480
or the fat tits the rest of herself is just sort of like cartoon yeah you got to

214
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,360
give it up to the Japanese they really like made objectifying women into an

215
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:52,640
art you know hell yeah somebody had to do cuz here and I'm here in the West like

216
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
when we objectify women it's like oh she's got fat tits fat ass and she's like a

217
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,000
sex sex slave and she does she does anything you want her to do right but

218
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,720
in Japan it's like oh this woman was turned into a like a flesh light and

219
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,240
she's slowly losing her like consciousness as you're fucking her I don't

220
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:21,040
wait I don't get it what was your first statement related to that sound pretty

221
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,600
similar no and no no and one and sure and one she's like one is base she's

222
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,440
being degraded and the other one she's literally turning into an object and like

223
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,000
in a way like in a way like dying but in a like almost like existential like

224
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,920
abstract way wow like that yeah it's horrifying they're like I really get

225
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,760
upset when they do the thing where it's like haha she's having so much sex and

226
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,360
now let's cut her arms and legs off is not when do they do that when the fuck

227
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,720
do they do that like oh like get get her just so that she's just a torso and

228
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,240
you can fuck it I'm like why would you do that I don't I don't I don't know

229
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,320
the bed you ever I mean I like I never I like never see that I've never I mean I

230
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,560
can imagine it but like that upon it often enough to know that it is

231
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,600
definitely a trope a trend yeah I see that I see that before too I mean

232
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,800
upon some gross stuff usually it's not like that it's not like like gore

233
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,760
sometimes it's like oh I have like attachable legs and arms I can take

234
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,880
them all off haha and like their stumps now it's my hentai that happens in

235
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,640
clown milk but now no one will know isn't clown milk isn't clown milk still

236
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,640
available by special order it's available and pre-order you can get

237
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,240
pre-order right now gamers the yeah the the the the clown milk the clown milk is

238
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,400
real tell tell us tell us what you've learned tell us what you've learned from

239
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,320
your Kickstarter experience yeah let me out before before anyone rushes to point

240
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,320
out every little thing that I could have done and yeah in retrospect let me I

241
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,280
already wrote down a list of things and if I then list something down you tell

242
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,800
me later as I go through the list of things but oh but the most I mean yeah

243
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,400
I'd like to hear what I'd like to hear your observations well first first and

244
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,760
foremost everyone wants me to kill myself that was that was mistake number one

245
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:39,320
obviously I could have told you that I think number one was promising people

246
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,920
three thousand dollars that's probably a big mistake eat the artist hang on

247
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,400
yeah when you say I mean I mean I mean I would phrase I would phrase that

248
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,080
differently it would say I would say like the goal was too high the goal was

249
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,120
too high I do agree and yeah could have been there should have been a deal about

250
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,200
like percentages or like oh we'll get to I mean the thing is that nothing was

251
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,600
like ridded and stowed and it's all like good faith among like three friends you

252
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,920
know yeah really I mean ultimately if I if I pulled like a dick mood and didn't

253
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,040
get it no one paid you know that would reflect poorly on me and what like if

254
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,960
you just if it if it had hit the goal and then you had just like skip town well

255
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,200
yeah and in a way right that would you want to make sure that the artists were

256
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,360
paid and that was like a big part of yeah yeah yeah yeah and I think it's still

257
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,120
a good thing I think it's just sort of like maybe it was like like what was

258
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,600
would that be like a normal paycheck for the work they do I was that a higher

259
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,040
paycheck I hear that like cuz I'm like in the industry like in the big two I

260
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,680
think three thousand is not like too much I think like people get roughly paid

261
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,040
more than that yeah it in the indie stuff no one's ever paid like three

262
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,960
thousand up front right and I was talking to I was talking to my buddy Eddie

263
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,280
Adams creator of pinky and pepper forever and he was telling me that yeah

264
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,080
straight up like I've never been paid three thousand up front and I'm like okay

265
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,880
well that was kind of high and I mostly picked that number because I was I was

266
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,680
talking to a buddy about joining the anthology before they they couldn't and

267
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,600
I asked him like let's say like I was commissioning you for a comic how much

268
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,840
would you charge for something in between like 15 to 20 pages and they said

269
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
three thousand and I was like oh well they want three thousand dollars for a

270
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:50,440
15 page comic 15 to 20 that's like that's like isn't that like $200 a page you

271
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,520
ever made a comic I mean some people are worth that much I mean when it's like

272
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,960
when you're paid to do something I mean that the thing is like I would probably

273
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,060
multiple pages is a lot of work yeah it's really good art because it can

274
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,680
cost a lot because I'm also asking you to create I'm asking you to create a

275
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:13,720
original story too right and that's like a whole other thing right I mean yeah I

276
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,280
understand that if you're talking about like in turn like an hourly rate yeah

277
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:24,280
sure you could easily spend 10 or 20 hours drawing a comic page if you wanted

278
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,680
and then it's like well $200 is like that's $10 an hour it's not that much

279
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,240
and like yeah true but also like you said like no like no indie comic artists

280
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,080
is commanding numbers like that right right yeah yeah it's too high agree but

281
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,200
also a part of me was kind of like seeing it as a gamble because think of it

282
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,320
like this I mean I know it's failed now but let's say there's an alternate

283
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,160
universe where it did succeed right and let's say like the numbers of like how

284
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,560
everyone like paid for it were like just like just like good you know like there

285
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,040
was never like everything like lined up good and everyone got there like 3,000

286
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,120
that would like yeah that would look imagine being the guy who was able to

287
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,640
get people $3,000 right you I mean you would be the guy people you I mean you

288
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
would be the guy that people would want to work with right because like oh like

289
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,040
cheesy has gotten people $3,000 before I want to work with that guy right sure

290
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,240
right sure yeah ambitious it isn't it is ambitious and I mean it bit me in the

291
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,480
ass and I bit that I mean here's I guess here's what I think about that it's

292
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,040
like you know obviously in hindsight we can say the goal was too high I think I

293
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,320
think for an all or nothing I think the all or nothing I know that's kind of

294
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,680
just how Kickstarter is but I think I think going for like okay we're gonna

295
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:04,560
make costs plus $3,000 per artist or or nothing is like kind of a mistake yeah

296
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,760
yeah I agree with that I agree with that yeah luckily for me I never like signed

297
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,440
anything or never told them that like yeah I'm gonna get you the 3,000 with

298
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,120
like one at once you know they're they're still gonna get the 3,000 is

299
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,560
just gonna now gonna take like a year what do you mean they're gonna get the

300
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,440
3,000 there's like so as because I'm gonna be selling the book like the book

301
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,360
could could still be sold how are you how can you how can you guarantee how

302
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,560
can you guarantee that that those those guys will each get $3,000 in sales

303
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:49,400
residuals because I'm just gonna sell the book you can't what what are you

304
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:57,760
talking about I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna give the 3,000 at once I mean

305
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,920
sure I mean sure like if you were to say at one point the book like I can't

306
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,480
guarantee that the book will continue to sell and that I reached 3,000 right it's

307
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,240
like what you're saying yeah yeah okay okay I mean I mean to make that to make

308
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,600
that happen I mean I don't know how much you sell them if you sell the book for

309
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,720
$20 then you would have to sell you know to make $6,000 to give these other two

310
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,120
guys 3,000 each you have to sell 300 copies and that's if you had no take

311
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:40,280
for yourself or to cover your own costs is that where you're I'm well you know

312
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:48,960
mine I'm also like this is gonna make it I'm just gonna make it seem even more

313
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
impossible is that I'm also like getting a cut like it's getting like three ways

314
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,160
you know yes I know I was very conservative in my S right right right

315
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,640
now I get you I think it could be done it just has to be like cuz I have I have

316
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:12,720
I have plans I have plans and people in places what does that mean I got trust the

317
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,480
plan then where we go one we all then yeah I mean now I mean my language I mean I

318
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,480
respect the the dedication I guess to pay the artists for the work they've

319
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,120
already part of a part of me doesn't want like I hate the idea of like oh you

320
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,360
remember when I promised you guys this much well not anymore it's like well are

321
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,680
you are you so hang on here's here's what are you saying that you told these

322
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,400
guys that you would pay them $3,000 if they drew like a 15 page like a 15 to

323
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:51,040
20 page comic for this anthology yes why cuz that's what one guy asked for and I

324
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,480
was like oh to make it fair everyone should get that amount I mean I mean make

325
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,640
sense at the time no it didn't I think it did I mean how could you you it had to

326
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,480
make sense at one point for me to agree to it okay hang on okay so you're so

327
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,880
you're saying what I'm saying you're saying that you have an agreement with

328
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,880
this guy that you now owe him $3,000 for this comic that he drew for this

329
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:26,760
anthology and it will be well both of these guys but okay I mean I'm gonna I'm

330
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,400
gonna be perfectly honest okay if if that's I mean if that's the deal I think

331
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,960
that maybe I think maybe the thing to do is cut and run I think maybe the thing

332
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,040
to do is call it a sunk cost and cut and run I don't think I could I could do

333
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,760
that maybe I could lie I mean I could potentially I mean I'm talking to them so

334
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,240
you owe this so you so you told this guy you get him $3,000 but not but just at

335
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,080
some point in the future well not all at once and like you know segment they're

336
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,080
getting like once all these pre-orders are done they're all getting like you

337
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,640
know they're part in it it's not gonna be three thousand three thousand but

338
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,160
gonna be part of three thousand so you're just gonna owe them money until it

339
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:19,640
you sell all yeah so it's all paid I guess I would have added a stipulation in

340
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,680
the original agreement but if the Kickstarter doesn't do it you have a

341
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,000
different arrangement ready yeah but I mean there was there's no there was

342
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,800
never an agreement to like that they would get that the green ones that'll

343
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,360
get three thousand and never said like that they that they wouldn't get it in

344
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,640
parts

345
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,240
sure but like there should have been like if the Kickstarter doesn't succeed

346
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,960
you can get like a percentage of the sales of however many we end up selling

347
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,680
boy I thought that's gonna happen that's what's gonna happen with the pre-orders

348
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,160
they're gonna get a percentage of the we're gonna like it's gonna be sweet

349
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,880
three ways but you're not also you're not also owing them like a an ultimate

350
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:16,280
like some right and I guess that sucks a little hope you get enough orders I mean

351
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,840
I guess in theory well the thing is I'm not I'm not gonna die when the pre-order

352
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,320
deadline is is up you know I'm not gonna like be murdered unless I am and this is

353
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,720
like the last recording of me in okay first I mean three three thousand seems

354
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,320
like a lot in but in in theory I guess if you if you manage to make if you

355
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:47,800
manage okay how much you planning to sell the books for 30 okay 30 right well

356
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:55,960
how much okay just how much is how much was like for one book how much is the

357
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,120
cost to print one book and then ship it to someone that orders it just for the

358
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,760
one would be like just yeah just like her book last quote okay so I'm not

359
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,200
ordering in bulk is what you're saying I'm just ordering one well you would all

360
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,680
I am I assume that you are gonna print in bulk the price the price goes down as

361
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,760
you order more I mean but you already know yes yes so okay but you okay but

362
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,480
you're saying that you but you haven't printed them yet so you don't know the

363
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,240
yeah I don't know can you okay can you give me like a rough ballpark I mean I'll

364
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,760
tell you I'll tell you how many pre-orders you got so far sure okay look at

365
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,800
the Google form okay we got four we got no we got 40 pre-orders I remember one

366
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,280
guy canceled and it had to refill up we have 40 orders so far right and if I go

367
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:56,240
to if I go to my printer and I type in like how much that's gonna be Lincoln

368
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,000
we'll put a link link in the description for anyone that pledged to the

369
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,800
Kickstarter or who wants to get the book by the because it would you have like a

370
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:09,280
hundred or you have like a hundred and something pledges right to the key to the

371
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,760
Kickstarter we have like I'm gonna check that too I think it was like under

372
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:26,760
was it okay yeah maybe a hundred bucks no I wouldn't have been that I think it's

373
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:34,200
a hundred bucks fail it was only a hundred bucks if all my friends is donated

374
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,000
$1 hmm okay I'm gonna I'm getting the quote right now okay no it was 91 90 91

375
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
backers so if I look if I order if I order 40 books that's gonna be around

376
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,880
like 264 okay so that's what like I'm so and I'm like I'm like six like six six

377
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:05,720
dollars a piece to print $5.15 okay and so let's call it $5 and what about

378
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,800
what about shipping what about shipping what's the cost to ship

379
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,880
domestically inside the US I mean it's it's gotta be five bucks five bucks all

380
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,800
right let's okay so let's say 10 let's just say $10 ship printing and shipping

381
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:26,720
so out of that $30 10 that's $10 goes to cover costs so you got $20 profit

382
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,200
leftover and then splitting it I mean let's let's assume assuming that you

383
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,520
don't take any additional cut other than what covers the cost of printing

384
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,320
that's let's say that's $10 a piece to each of these other guys so so you've

385
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,720
got to sell 300 so 300 copies will make the the 3k that you owe these two guys

386
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,480
and I guess if you could do that then thereafter then thereafter you own the

387
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,840
anthology and you don't have to pay any additional cost you could like continue

388
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,600
to sell it right um a part of me like because the thing is they still own the

389
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:14,080
rights to their story why they made a story I'm gonna lose my mind you pay

390
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,000
them $3,000 and you don't even get the rights that's just for their work oh my

391
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,840
god I the thing is like no this is under a fucking contract so I don't like pay

392
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,520
them right the fuck away you know I just think it's all really like what's the

393
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:43,560
word like a verbal cons a verbal contract a verbal verbal agreement yeah and

394
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,720
like I don't have to pay them all at once listen let me let me just let me

395
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,400
ask you okay let's say let's say a year from now a year from now you've sold

396
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,560
300 copies you've paid you've paid each of these guys the 3k that you said you

397
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,600
would pay them for their for their work and then you're like okay cool done I've

398
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,200
paid down I've paid down Tom nook for my house you know my my dad is covered

399
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,440
then the next day you go to a con and you sell some more and you sell some more

400
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,600
copies you sell some more right copies of of clown milk what do you do with the

401
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:25,160
profits I mean if I haven't like bought the stories off of them I would split

402
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:32,000
it like three ways with them still that just seems like you're really getting

403
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
screwed here sure but I'm not too worried about it because I have my own

404
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,040
comics you should be worried about it you should be worried about getting

405
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:55,640
screwed I mean okay I'll tell you this if I were to do this all over again I

406
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,680
wouldn't I wouldn't set up these parameters I mean sure right right and

407
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,440
the thing is that like I think the one thing that's not making me freak out is

408
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,680
that there's no deadline for the 3,000 yeah I mean like that's that's good I

409
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,600
mean it depends on how these two that's why I like about about that I mean are

410
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,480
they free if they like freak out I mean none of them have freaked out on me yet

411
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:27,800
yeah right they're very super chill about it and you know like they both are

412
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,680
very like chill about it and have other ways to make money I don't think they're

413
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,640
worried about like I mean they told me that like they put the fucking what what

414
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,960
what's that crazy shit that people do with their houses like oh yeah mortgage

415
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,760
they put their houses up they flip their house upside down and they're like

416
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,000
she's I put my house upside down to get that 3,000 like down screwed now the bank

417
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,360
is coming after me yeah I just think that like you're you're gonna split the

418
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:10,640
profits three ways from the pre-orders until all three of you get 3k and then

419
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,520
the profits will if they continue you'll split it three ways as well it just

420
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,840
sort of feels like there is no 3k it's just sort of like the profits will

421
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,600
continue from whatever you sell you just split it three ways that's that's

422
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,880
ultimately like if I keep ever decide to keep selling the book after we reach

423
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,080
the 3k I mean there's no reason why not right I mean the most of what I'm aside

424
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,320
from the labor you have to do to me the fact the fact that you you know agree

425
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,200
there was an agreement with these guys like I will give you 3k to produce a

426
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:53,480
comic a work of intellectual property I feel like what then is like okay you

427
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,160
paid me to make this thing now you own it because you commissioned me to produce

428
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,880
it for you I have done labor to produce a work that is now your property like

429
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,560
there's no obligation unless you've mentioned in your like verbal agreement

430
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:20,800
there's no obligation that they get like residuals beyond 3k so you don't have

431
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,960
to I mean a part of it's kind of like what if like what if like the right

432
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,800
push the right person pushes the book at the right time and then it starts

433
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,400
selling gang busters and like after I don't know the 3k right and then what do

434
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:44,280
you mean then like what if the book just becomes extremely like popular after

435
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,640
you mean like if one of these get if one of these get are you are you saying

436
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,880
that you want these what if the book makes way more money have an incentive to

437
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,640
push the book I mean that could be a way that's the way to like to look at it I

438
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,840
mean mostly because I think like you know I I feel like it's fair that they

439
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,160
keep getting a share you know well I don't I mean I would want people like

440
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,880
cuz the thing is like if there was a way where I mean they just keep getting

441
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,800
like royalties off of it and they get like passive income I think that's great

442
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,040
you know I mean sure but you would need a higher cut because you're also the one

443
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,640
organizing the printing and sending though of them and they just they've drawn

444
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,640
it they don't need to do anything more so like beyond the 3k you should be

445
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,560
getting a higher cut for extra labor in the process of continuing to sell the

446
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,040
books I was originally the Kickstarter because the labor costs was gonna go to

447
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,400
me and me and my partner because we're gonna be the one who was actually gonna

448
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,760
like put the books in the envelopes and like print out the labels and whatnot

449
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:03,800
right so I was ultimately gonna get like a bigger cut I mean no I mean I get

450
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,760
that I get that I mean like yeah that's a yeah I should be getting a bigger cut

451
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,520
for like sending and shipping it out but I think I'm think right now I want to

452
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:22,200
like just focus on just getting the the books out and like getting the word out

453
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,080
you know I've like little I've like little things I've like little things to

454
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,240
kind of like I guess the idea is to like because you know I've done like

455
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,360
pre-orders before and when you do like a pre-order for the same book again in a

456
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,880
couple of months you usually don't sell too much like you did in the first run

457
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:47,120
right yeah so like I have um I have little little ideas little plans in

458
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:57,480
place to um to keep some momentum going you know okay I mean I could I could see

459
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,280
like if you table that a con or something I could see selling selling some

460
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,800
copies at a table I do have I do have like I do have a con lined up like okay

461
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,760
yeah there's there's a con that's gonna happen where like I could sell the book

462
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:18,640
at so yeah that's a that's a that's in mind I think I'm just not too worried

463
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,000
about the one thing that's making me not worried about like the 3000 and why I

464
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,680
don't really I'm not that freaked out about it is because ultimately there's

465
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,200
like no deadline right I understand that right as long as like I mean up with me

466
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,280
as I feel as long as they're getting the the money in a reasonable amount and

467
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,080
in a reasonable like you know yeah an amount like over a course of time then

468
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:50,480
it's not it's not like too worrying you know I wouldn't want like oh by 20 by

469
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,960
20 30 finally they all got in the 3k you know I wouldn't want that but like you

470
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,680
know I feel I feel like it could be possible by next year I feel like it

471
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,880
could be like I really do have that much faith they buy next year they will all

472
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,600
get their money that was originally promise what if what if what if you what

473
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,000
if you just don't what if you just don't sell that many books I mean I'll just

474
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,920
find other ways to pay them my pocket see yeah here's this is like this is like

475
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,600
you're like you're the one shouldering all the risk I mean I hate in this in

476
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,000
this situation you're the you're the one shouldering if I mean they've received a

477
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
promise of financial compensation you're the one who is running the risk of what

478
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,520
if I have to pay out of pocket if like sales don't cover the cost that's why I

479
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,440
feel like it's fair for you like once the fee is paid you own the rights that's

480
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,960
the risk versus reward calculus I mean that could be an agreement I

481
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,240
talked to them about well no it's too late

482
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,120
nothing nothing in stone it's always like just what do you mean there's

483
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,240
nothing in stone I'm gonna I'm gonna throw myself on a fucking way for the 3k

484
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,440
nothing's like in stone what what what do you mean a side of the 3k that's

485
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,880
that's the whole deal I don't get why you're mad I'm the one who's gonna get

486
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:28,000
anything why are you mad I'm the one who's got to pay them 3k I each I just

487
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,360
don't understand I just don't understand okay well I just don't understand

488
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,200
what's going on here and it makes me angry when I don't understand things all

489
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:45,040
okay all right well I I just I just I just okay I guess on the one hand they

490
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,920
do they do they do they do run the risk of like okay this guy wants me to draw a

491
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,040
comic I'm drawing this comic with an agreement of future payment and there's

492
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,120
a chance that this guy will never come through and I will not ever be paid for

493
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:04,000
it that is that is a risk so on their end on your end if if you are if you are

494
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,640
committed to falling through and paying the 3k that was agreed to then then the

495
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,200
risk is is all on you like what if what if the book doesn't sell and I have to

496
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,800
cover it myself so on that end it's like well there's there should be some

497
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,760
reward on your end for for risking that I agree with that I agree with that I

498
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,920
mean I'll talk I mean that's a good that's fair point I'll bring that out

499
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,240
but I'm just saying at this point at this point it seems too late to call it

500
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,960
like if you if you said hey man what are they go galactic be and who's the other

501
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,960
one super spell super so on galactic be if you if you call them up you bring them

502
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:50,520
up on the telephone you say hey galactic be so I know I said that there was a

503
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,880
through there was an agreement of $3,000 in exchange for work you have done the

504
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,840
work now I owe you the $3,000 now hey what if instead of you can what if instead

505
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:10,240
of you continuing to receive residuals what if instead of that we didn't do

506
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,960
that I don't know like what what what are there what are their expectations do

507
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,040
they have expectations do they know what's going on yeah they know what's

508
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:26,840
going on okay do I mean do they do they expect to continue to receive

509
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,200
residuals into the indefinite future no I haven't told them that part exactly I

510
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,880
mean I'll say that much I'm told that part okay so they don't expect anything

511
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:49,960
in in addition to the 3k so why would you give them any more than that I mean I

512
00:46:49,960 --> 00:47:00,680
think I just I mean nice person yeah I mean nice person shut the fuck I'm just

513
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:06,000
it's I mean I don't know there's being a nice person and then there's just and

514
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,600
then there's just shooting yourself in the foot I don't know I just I just feel

515
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,720
like there's no you know this is a this is a business arrangement that you

516
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,840
entered into here and so I feel like it's it's everyone everyone it's kind of

517
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,960
everyone's individual responsibility to max to max to maximize their own profit

518
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,760
and if you're do if you and if you're like well okay the expectation was that

519
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,600
I would only pay them $3,000 but I can meet that and then I can choose to

520
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,080
exceed that if I want to I mean that's just charity I just paying for the cut

521
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,080
like you know for like you know no the three thousand was their cut no the

522
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,400
agreed the agreed upon 3k was their cut you'd be paying extra money anything in

523
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,440
addition to that is literally just you giving the money for free that's

524
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,200
royalties no it's not royalties royalties are agreed upon no royalties

525
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,920
would be a royalty agreement would be I won't pay you anything upfront but if you

526
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,720
make this if you make this work and I publish it in this book I will continue

527
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,160
to give you a cut of future sales into the indefinite future that's royalties

528
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,760
yeah you could you could pay them a fine and then they get also royalties like

529
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,480
that's why option cheesy I here's it here's I just feel like we're approaching

530
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:31,160
this I okay I think I understand okay that you value the idea of paying these

531
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,120
guys more right and that's and that's admirable okay I understand you I

532
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:43,360
understand the appeal of that however I just think you should be focused on like

533
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,200
your own bottom line first here and I really think that yeah I really think

534
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,360
that you have a reasonable expectation that like these proceeds should belong to

535
00:48:52,360 --> 00:49:00,720
you and and I don't understand why you seem to want to be rid of them I I guess

536
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:08,320
cuz like I mentioned before there's no like that line to it and I would

537
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,240
understand okay I would be mad if I would I would probably be very upset with

538
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:21,000
myself if this was if my Twitter like handle wasn't like working on like five

539
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,640
other if I didn't have other projects to like that like that's not that's not

540
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,200
about your overall thing it's not what I'm talking about the agreement you made

541
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:38,040
did not include royalties so you have no obligation to do that that's what I'm

542
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,560
saying that's what I'm saying it sounds yeah there's no obligation for such a

543
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:48,120
thing okay I mean I guess it just wouldn't kill me to do royalties it

544
00:49:48,120 --> 00:50:01,280
wouldn't like end my life this is so I I don't I don't get it yeah I mean by

545
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:08,240
that logic I mean anything you make in excess of like what you need to like pay

546
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,360
rent and buy food it's like well it wouldn't kill me to just you know give

547
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:36,640
it to someone give it to whoever I what I give help please I think ultimately

548
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:44,520
the goodwill I get off of that's gonna be more valuable to me I don't know all

549
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:56,720
right I'll tell you what okay here's what I think I think I'll just I'll just I'll

550
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:03,240
I think if I'm if I'm one of these guys and I'm like I agreed to do this work in

551
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,960
exchange for $3,000 to be paid in the indefinite future and then maybe a year

552
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:15,720
or whatever from now I received the $3,000 I'm like yes and then and then the

553
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,120
guy who gave me the $3,000 like hey by the way I'm gonna give you even more I'm

554
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,560
just gonna keep giving you even more than that like it's like I don't know to me

555
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,760
that doesn't earn you any goodwill that just makes you look like a sucker like

556
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,560
you wouldn't you wouldn't what do you I would I would appreciate I would

557
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,640
appreciate the money and I would shake my head and think what a sap why is this

558
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:47,760
guy still paying me I'll mean I'll take it but I don't respect it that's just me

559
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,400
though you don't you don't think so yeah do you feel that would you think I'm

560
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,360
as if I kept giving you money after like a comic like would you would you think

561
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:02,520
I'm sort of fucking sad I don't know if I 100% I think I think when it comes to

562
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:08,160
like respect and goodwill honoring an agreement is like that's good yeah like

563
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,080
if you eventually get these people the 3k they should be happy with you honoring

564
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:21,080
your the agreement you had extra money is just sort of like oh cool like I

565
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:26,280
wouldn't really I don't know whether it would be like oh my god she's so

566
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:35,720
cool yeah you are giving me free money but like I think on some level I repeat

567
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:42,240
work would feel more right like oh cheesy follows through on promises they get

568
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,960
you the money they promise you so I'll work for them again the extra money I

569
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,440
don't think is like a necessary part of that it maybe it's nice maybe maybe if

570
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,480
there was like if a network executive calls you up on the phone one day he's

571
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,480
choppy cigar and he says hey I got to get this cheesy manfredo guy on the

572
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,960
phone we got to make a clown milk Netflix adaptation we got to get him if

573
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,000
that if that happens then and you make a million dollars and you receive a

574
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,480
residual you and you receive a million dollars in your bank account then I

575
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,520
could maybe be like you call up these guys and you're like hey guys I just got

576
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,760
like a huge windfall from this work and like as a token of goodwill I'm gonna

577
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,920
give you each like ten thousand dollars or something here you go God bless like

578
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:36,800
something like that I think would be understandable I just I just wouldn't

579
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,400
feel good about you like selling yourself short in a sense I feel yeah I

580
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,160
feel like you're selling yourself you should you should like if it's not in

581
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,640
the agreement like you don't you shouldn't feel the need to do extra yeah

582
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,120
just do what you said you did you would do and that that should be enough that

583
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:05,720
will be enough well I I mean it wasn't kind of the whole goal with the

584
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,040
three thousand dollars didn't you want to give yourself like three months to take

585
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:17,400
off of work so that you could just draw instead of working right right so yeah

586
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:26,680
I mean there you go money is time so you should you should you should you should

587
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,520
you should want to hoard as much of it as you can to use on doing the things you

588
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:38,640
want to go that's it I don't say I'm not like I'm just not freaked out about it

589
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,600
it doesn't I don't know because ultimately I mean these guys are like my

590
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,680
friends too and if I could like I understand like do you would you not

591
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,000
want your friends to have more money like I don't like if they thought well sure

592
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,200
I will share I want my friends to have more money but I'm not digging into my

593
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,520
pockets to like shovel it out to them but I don't want them to have more money

594
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:07,120
more than I want to have money myself I mean we can I mean the thing is that it's

595
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,000
all just like still for one I could talk to them about it right because like

596
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,800
there's some things in this conversation that are making me rethink some some

597
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:23,840
approaches about it right okay okay that being said it's not the worst shit ever

598
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:29,040
you know that it's not the worst shit I just talking about I think that it's not

599
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,840
it's what are you talking about I'm not like very like very least the barest

600
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:40,100
minimum is that beyond the 3k you definitely get a higher cut if you

601
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:46,220
continue to pay them like you get I don't know half of it and then well wait

602
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:50,180
how'd you split it this three I don't know I can't know I can't numbers but

603
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,260
you do it more so that you're getting more out of it after the 3k that you've

604
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,660
promised them because it's you didn't promise them anymore and if you want to

605
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:04,460
give them something that's you know you are in with it within your rights to do

606
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:09,700
so it's just you're the one doing the extra work by continuing to go to the

607
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,100
printer and print them mail them out so like the very least you need a higher cut

608
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:19,980
I think it I think that's get give you know what you're you're you're

609
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,620
negotiating with the terrorists right now you're giving you're giving too much

610
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:31,660
I really think so give what you there's no like you did you did a chapter you

611
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,700
did a vaporette for Vapor 2 if I go to if I go to a con and I sell I don't know

612
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,780
20 copies of Vapor 2 I'm not I'm sorry I'm not I'm not giving you any of that

613
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:48,940
I already paid you sure yeah that's that's your prerogative yeah yeah that's

614
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,060
your prerogative right but think of it like that's fucking right it's like

615
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,780
fucking prerogative think of it like this think of it like okay but like let's

616
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,020
say um I don't know let's say um you're you're you're you're you're an artist

617
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,420
right and then uh then Ben saying approaches you for a vaporette and I

618
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:09,980
call I duck under my table I call the police yeah let's say let's say it's

619
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:14,180
like oh you want to you do a vaporette but then let's say cheesy Manfredo comes

620
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,820
in and is like oh you want to do you want to do a clown milk story ultimately

621
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,700
which which job are they gonna take which one seems like you're gonna pay me

622
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:29,420
more well here's the thing right even though you may if you do the residuals

623
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:34,220
thing you may have like a history of going beyond the agreed upon amount of

624
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,300
money that doesn't necessarily mean that every time a great an agreement is

625
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,300
made you're going to go beyond I mean like let's say like I would say there's

626
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,300
a good one the agreement to be like you know the amount I expect let's say

627
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,060
maybe hope yeah I could hope that you would give me like residuals even though

628
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:56,260
you didn't say you would but like that wouldn't really influence my future

629
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:01,100
decision-making on who I would like to be working for when it should go back

630
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:06,340
to the company that keeps paying you more well only if it yeah but like there's

631
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,460
no guarantee like if it's not in the agreement if you if it's in the agreement

632
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:16,580
that you give residuals beyond a paid thing then I'm like oh that sounds like

633
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,740
a better deal the only thing in this situation is that the agreement didn't

634
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:32,100
involve that and you're doing it anyway yeah so so like as a as a as a decision

635
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:38,420
making factor if I see the agreement like say both of you have identical

636
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:46,660
agreements for a number of pages and a payout and cheesy may like is likely to

637
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:52,860
or potentially could give me extra money on top of that I just I don't know I

638
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,180
don't think I would like that would sway my opinion yeah you don't think so I

639
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:03,220
think I just I like things in writing I like things to know exactly what I'm

640
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:09,940
getting myself in for I to me it seems like oh this oh this cheesy manfredo

641
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:17,340
guy he just gives free money over and above well he's he's gonna he's gonna

642
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:21,060
go bankrupt his business is gonna go under he's gonna he's not he's never

643
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:33,060
gonna make it in this town he's NG yet he's NGMI because he's sucker not I

644
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,660
want to work for this guy because he pays more this guy's this guy's sunk

645
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:43,460
because he he can't because he because he's just bleeding money I know that's

646
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,100
nice to be nice to your friends but like in a business arrangement it's it's a

647
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,020
little different I mean I'll tell you I mean I mean most like the most I could

648
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,340
tell you is that I'll continue to talk to these guys and we'll arrange some

649
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,420
arrangements like I'll tell you that much right what what what arrangements oh my

650
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:09,540
well I will fucking like what we'll talk about like how residuals will work you

651
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:15,420
know like I got there are but okay but there is no expectation I have to I mean

652
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:23,740
yeah but there could be but why would you want there to be like I like I want

653
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:28,700
them to keep getting paid like what's what's wrong with that like I don't

654
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,980
fucking I there's I can't I can't do it there's just no there's that we've made

655
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:38,660
no progress we've made no progress here I I mean I don't I don't I don't want to

656
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,820
tell you I mean I'll talk to these guys and that's between me and these two

657
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,340
other guys right I don't have to expel every single little thing I agree with

658
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:51,420
these guys on this podcast unless I have to unless you were expecting me that

659
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:59,300
like to go for every little fucking little what give help give help you

660
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,220
already you already said it was like a verbal agreement yeah right and then

661
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:08,740
there's no deadline yeah exactly um that's why I'm not fucking worried if it

662
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,500
seemed if it seems like it was fucking ruining me yeah I'll talk to them I'll

663
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,300
rearrange things but it's not ruining me well of course it's not really cuz you

664
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:24,500
haven't given you haven't paid them anything yeah what's going on I don't

665
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:30,980
tell you even even if I like I don't know I even think I don't know I don't

666
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:40,460
tell you I been seen breaks down on the idea of not looking out for number one

667
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:50,460
but fucking fucking Ben sell Ben sell break seeds at the idea of your cheesy

668
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:54,580
your NGMI okay I'm sorry be your NGMI okay that's that's that's that's that's

669
01:01:54,580 --> 01:02:04,980
my takeaway okay well I'll I'll end GMI here let me right I have no I mean I

670
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:16,340
have no I have no power to compel you to do any anything I don't know yeah that's

671
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,540
nothing more to say at this point I think it was a little bit of a sloppy

672
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:27,460
initial promise that relied on and it's like it's causing problems down the line

673
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:31,900
but if you're not worried about it then I guess we can just move on a different

674
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:37,860
topic yeah I'm not worried about it I mean in retrospect get the fucking

675
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,260
Kickstarter work as a pretty decent advertising for the pre-order it's

676
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:49,140
right yeah everyone loves everyone loves a comeback I'll tell you that much you

677
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,500
know and that's so that's that's the first thing on my list of what I did

678
01:02:54,500 --> 01:03:00,780
wrong wait I have to pee I'll be right back I want to hear I do want to hear

679
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:06,620
the rest of this but I gotta pee I also gotta pee I'll be back all right okay I'm

680
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:16,780
back yeah what's what's up gamers are you sound excited just to hear from me all

681
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:22,860
right are we on to item number two give us not back yet oh where'd she go she

682
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:31,260
want to go she went to the where they call it there she went to the Lou oh she

683
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:44,140
went to the short to the crapper good I guess okay how can I take this only take

684
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:47,980
this opportunity how can I get through plot plot plot twist turns out big Twitter

685
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:52,340
artist guy too nice too nice for this world

686
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:58,500
and back yeah all right all right all right let's let's all right number item

687
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,900
number two let's go let's go I should have done way more promotion for the

688
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:09,940
comic okay okay yeah sure yeah like a lot of stuff could be um like could have

689
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,420
been a lot of stuff that I did later down the line I should have probably done

690
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:19,060
earlier the whole you mean like the the clown girl ads and stuff oh well I mean

691
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,900
here's the thing that maybe that probably wasn't the best thing for me to do

692
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:30,020
because um why cuz I cuz like okay so on paper like oh I have like a clown

693
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:36,220
milk like a porn comic I have a clown porn comic right I have that yeah who

694
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:41,740
do I get to promote this well oh there's clown girls out there that have only

695
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:47,700
fans I get them to promote yes right that seems to make sense on paper right

696
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,540
cuz they both have clown in the word right but the one thing that I kind of

697
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:56,260
noticed is that like every time one of these clown girls would make a post like

698
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:00,700
the pledges never seemed to jump like I didn't seem to get more pledges after

699
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:06,100
their posts right and that could be like okay it could be like one maybe it just

700
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,180
wasn't enough clown girls maybe I should have gone with a couple more right maybe

701
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:13,540
five because that's kind of like the thing with advertising you gotta see

702
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:19,020
something at least five times before you like give it a chance right that's that

703
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,180
a thing that's what I heard that it's gotta be at least five times get seen at

704
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:26,620
five times before you really consider giving it a chance okay like you know

705
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:31,980
before it breaks you down right or two makes make sense the people that kind of

706
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:37,780
like drawn like clown porn aren't the same kind of people who want like IRL

707
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:43,220
clown porn you know yeah maybe yeah that's cuz it could be a disconnect there

708
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:52,260
too right and even though like there's like a klusi means a bound doesn't mean

709
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,500
that like necessarily it's popular it could just be um what's the word for it

710
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,940
when something seems more popular than actually is

711
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:12,900
I'm not sure but yeah basically so the fact that a paper tiger clown paper tiger

712
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:19,900
like like like mate because I remember like a couple podcasts ago you mentioned

713
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:24,780
something about it seems like the clown real stuff is popular right now but I

714
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,500
could just because I follow cheesy man Fredo and he's the one mostly retweeting

715
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,780
right yeah it could just be that you're just following me and it seems like it

716
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:39,460
right it could have been I feel like there was that that ace attorney character

717
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:46,700
that just blew up and I saw everywhere mm-hmm yeah yes yeah it could be it could

718
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:50,940
be it could be that or it just could be that maybe these people just didn't make

719
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:55,340
maybe seem like the major the people just didn't like gel well with like my art

720
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,460
style I know like I had someone tell me that they didn't they didn't like my

721
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,340
art style for when it comes to porn so that that could be a more common take

722
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:08,980
with a lot of people I mean that's why there's like different artists on the

723
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:12,740
project right not not much you can not much you can really do about that right

724
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:19,540
you know let's say I get better at drawing porn but easier not not easier

725
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:26,100
done but that takes while before you know so so what's the takeaway if you did

726
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,620
it again would you not do any clown girl ads would you more clown girl I think

727
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,060
what I what I what I notice is that because later in the middle of the

728
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:40,980
Kickstarter I had the idea of like there was like a handful of people there was

729
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:48,020
two there was two like NSFW artists who I talked to about making like like if you

730
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,140
could draw a piece of art that promotes the Kickstarter I will just send you a

731
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:57,300
free copy of the book right and I noticed that when they drew their pictures

732
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:03,820
there was like a boost in pledges right which makes me think that it's the

733
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:08,620
audience that like enjoys like cartoon porn is more close to what I'm hitting

734
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:15,500
than the audience that enjoys like IRL clowns right yes yes so I probably make

735
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,700
sense to me yeah I probably would have gone more that route I would have probably

736
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:25,460
talked to way more like NSFW artists about doing promotion for it right yeah

737
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:32,140
yeah like maybe like maybe at least like 10 figures some sort of deal out with

738
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:37,660
right I think I feel like maybe this got discussed in my discord at some point

739
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:44,100
but like if you had maybe yeah done like instead of instead of IRL like only

740
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:48,860
fans girls if you had gotten like NSFW artists to draw like pieces for the

741
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,300
comic and like you could put them in the comic but you could also they could

742
01:08:53,300 --> 01:09:00,140
also serve as like ads right now that makes yeah that makes sense right so

743
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:05,820
because yeah I mean it's it's a little like weird intricacies of marketing you

744
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:10,140
know like I mean like you know oh they both say clowns there must be an

745
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:16,660
overlap like oh well potentially like not really maybe right mm-hmm yeah yeah

746
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:22,180
that's I mean that yeah next time just do way more promotion or like really

747
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,620
think about who who's the kind of person who's consuming this right like you

748
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:33,060
know cuz I think only a handful of people that are like fans of my porn

749
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:38,380
stuff are like very clown centric and the majority are just kind of like oh I

750
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:43,300
like seeing drawn just humorous just humorous right exactly that's fair like

751
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:47,860
cartoon right but you target the coomer market the coomer market is bigger

752
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:53,140
than the clown market because the classy mark that's true so you are not so if

753
01:09:53,140 --> 01:10:00,300
yeah it's reasonable okay okay that's yeah you got an item number three okay

754
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:10,020
I remember three is probably should have gone with more special rewards right yeah

755
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:17,280
I'm gonna kill you about the reward no that's not true I had some I thought the

756
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,540
rewards were a little weird yeah they were I thought that I thought that the

757
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,500
Commission tier was very strange I mean I the only reason why I set up the

758
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,620
Commission's like that because I asked like these guys how many commissions are

759
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,140
you willing to do for the Kickstarter yes I understand right this number should

760
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,820
have been zero because it doesn't make any sense what about it doesn't make any

761
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:42,740
sense well I mean if someone wants a commission they can just they can just

762
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,860
commission them to draw something yeah instead of instead of what does it have

763
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,740
to do with the Kickstarter right exactly what is yeah what it was after

764
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,500
the Kickstarter so what you're saying is okay the Commission should have been

765
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:58,340
lower no there should not there should not have been a Commission tier it's a

766
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:04,420
nonsensical tier like if it was lower that incentivizes you to like want a

767
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:08,300
commission out of here I mean it should have been I can't I can't believe how

768
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:13,140
much you're misunderstanding what I'm saying right now like the idea of rewards

769
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:20,820
is that you add value to the product that already exists and you charge higher

770
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:25,140
than the work you need to put into it so that you actually like make money off of

771
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:32,740
it mm-hmm so like a signature doesn't take really any work at all and it can add

772
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:40,020
value like and it can make like individual pledges a lot more an entire

773
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:44,900
commission is like work that costs a lot yeah that's yeah that's the thing it's

774
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:51,380
work it's like it's it's like it's additional work for the artist on top of

775
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:56,020
what was already done to make the product and so if it's like a bad it's like a

776
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:01,220
bad value proposition for for you the person behind the Kickstarter yeah

777
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:06,260
because you can't charge the whole price of an entire commission on top of all

778
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,380
of that because it then it might get too high for people to actually want to

779
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:13,620
pledge so you'd have to make it like a cheaper alternative but then the work

780
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,580
still needs to be done so you're losing money ultimately

781
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:25,460
mm all right I hear you that's why on the Lord of Ghost thing I would do I would

782
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,580
do doodles but they they're not like supposed to be good they're just sort of

783
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:32,500
a little asset they're not take too much time out of you right yeah I've heard of

784
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,420
I heard a very similar thing I just I guess in my head it was like oh you know

785
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:42,660
it's better than a doodle commission right and then it made sense then but now it

786
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:49,860
I mean from the point of view of you in this position of like I need to make this

787
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:55,380
Kickstarter hit its funding goal it does make sense right to offer to offer the

788
01:12:55,380 --> 01:13:00,820
work of these to offer commissions from these other guys as as rewards as a way

789
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:07,300
to like artificially boost the number but I mean but like to me that's that's

790
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:12,100
what that is I'm bullying you cheesy I'm bullying you all right okay

791
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:21,060
why is too nice cheesy I like that about you it's nice definitely 100%

792
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:30,980
yeah so yeah that that's what I'm saying I from that angle I understand the desire to

793
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:38,260
do that understand the the the purpose of it but uh yeah um that's all I want is

794
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,140
understanding I just want people to understand where I was coming from you

795
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:46,500
know I don't want to be a thing I'm in a way I do in a way I do um but uh yeah I

796
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,140
think like kind of the point of the Kickstarter is that you've already done

797
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:57,460
the work and you are selling it now and you don't and you don't want you don't

798
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:02,420
really want uh reward tiers that incur a lot of additional work for yourself so you want to do

799
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:08,420
things yeah think things like paper crafts bookmarks posters stuff that stuff that you

800
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:15,300
can mass produce and include in the package you can put lipstick on and kiss each book or something

801
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:24,420
right I um but um there was one tier in the in the rewards I don't know if you saw it and I

802
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:28,260
mean I didn't really talk about it much was that one of the tiers was getting a video from pasta

803
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:35,140
the clown and he'll monologue whatever you want I did I did see that it's it's an interesting idea

804
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:39,940
it's kind of got the same problem as a commission in that it sort of involves the whole separate

805
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:46,660
production it the the the thing is that like um it's actually not that hard to think I mean yeah

806
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:51,060
you could you could mass produce that would not be like do all the makeup and set up the camera

807
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:56,180
but then you can do all of them at once right and yeah exactly yeah boom boom boom right right

808
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:02,500
after right so it's not that hard actually and I and I like and I love I I'm talking I love I gave

809
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:09,620
me an excuse to put on the makeup please well fair enough but did anyone go for that tier uh no I

810
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:14,340
didn't really talk about it I guess I didn't really talk about it because like I felt I felt I felt

811
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:21,860
sad I did you felt sad I felt sad why why did you feel sad because the Kickstarter was failing

812
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:29,940
that's okay but um sure um yeah I mean like I probably could have like lowered that tier

813
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:39,700
I want um here's the thing I oh I was like 200 okay um I think also I mean someone like mentioned

814
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:44,420
I saw one comment like in one of the videos a couple of videos ago where someone said that

815
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:51,220
she's gonna have enough of the reward between like the the physical book to like a commission

816
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:59,060
yeah new new made a comment yeah yeah and and a part of me like is like well I mean a I wanted

817
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:04,020
things to be simple and in retrospect that it's like shooting myself in the foot and I get that

818
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:10,900
but but then B is like a part of me is very much like I don't like doing that like I don't like

819
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:18,020
I don't really like fuck with like buttons or like or like kind of like making stickers and

820
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:26,740
shit like that you know and like uh I get it I get that it's a hassle but I I do think that's

821
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:32,500
like that probably would have helped me right yeah a little little like stuff like stuff like that is

822
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:38,340
stuff like that is I is good I mean I mean I got I got to thinking and tell me if tell me if you

823
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:43,380
agree with this um that like the people that when you do that you're I mean you're like you're adding

824
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:49,940
more value to the thing right yeah right because like well the thing is people don't and you and

825
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:58,180
you do that because like you know people don't value you too much right or like what wait hold

826
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:06,900
what do you add you add the extra value because you need it right uh sure I I guess right because

827
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:11,300
that that implies that they that they don't value you too much right because if you need to add the

828
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:16,180
extra value they don't value you I think it's just a little extra because like like people did buy

829
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:24,100
my comic without the pen because it's like they wanted the comic I mean people got like my comic

830
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:32,260
without the um it's it's it's not necessary it's just like you can you can you can I um

831
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:40,020
like the pins very cheap to mass produce they don't actually add as much value as I charge for them

832
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:47,540
so they're like they're like a very easy simple little way to like make a lot of profit out of

833
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:57,860
out of a little thing and it's I I feel like I feel like it's like um every person that comes to the

834
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:04,420
campaign who is interested in getting whatever the product is they've probably they've probably

835
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:11,220
got sort of like a soft limit for like how much they're willing to spend on this thing and stuff like

836
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:19,940
you know uh posters uh bookmarks pins you know little bonus value editions are basic are basically

837
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:25,940
they're basically just an excuse for them to like justify spending as much as they want to spend

838
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:33,220
on this thing yeah right like it has to be in small enough increments if you go from like 10

839
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:39,700
to 50 to 200 then like people are not the people who could who would be willing to spend 35

840
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:43,460
would just spend 10 because they don't want to spend the whole 50 you know

841
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:51,220
right yeah like you like you want you want like at the $20 tier for someone who just wants the

842
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:55,780
book and they've only got $20 to spend but for someone who's got 50 bucks that they're willing

843
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:03,300
to spend you want yeah if you don't have the $50 tier then they're gonna go for the $25 instead of

844
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:12,580
the $100 so you've missed out on the whatever they're low-key excuses but like um they're

845
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:16,260
they can be nice i think my little ghost pin is really cute

846
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:24,420
they're they're i mean they're excuses but i mean they it's they're not i mean they're they're um

847
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:31,460
like the pin is not i don't know how much how much extra did it cost to get the pin from the

848
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:37,780
lord of ghost kickstarter like 10 extra bucks or something like that like i can't remember i it was

849
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:45,860
really low to to have like 100 or 200 something pins sent to me it was it was yeah probably around 10

850
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:55,380
10 pounds 10 pounds uh right but i mean i think people know people understand that like this pin

851
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:00,180
was not did not an individual pin does not cost like the 10 pounds to reduce they're not really

852
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:05,300
getting like 10 pounds worth of hard value from it but it's the fact that it's associated with this

853
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:11,620
like exclusive timed event yeah and also the whole thing of like technically anybody could go to

854
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:16,820
like a pin manufacturer and get whatever pin they want but like it's a big hassle to do that and

855
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:23,460
if they just receive a little funny thing with their thing they buy and it's like ah cool there's

856
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:28,180
the the value of the exclusivity of the item there's the value of the fact that you're just

857
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:34,580
they're just supporting an artist that they like is yeah yeah so even though you might not fuck with

858
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:40,420
bookmarks uh it doesn't hurt to add them right it's got there's gotta be a way for me to circumvent

859
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:47,700
books it's gotta be a way i mean i am anti bookmark i like all the bookmarks what's what else i mean

860
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:52,820
what else was there something else you would you would do instead um fidget spinner um i would

861
01:20:53,620 --> 01:21:00,660
i would um and i would say maybe at $50 you get a music stand with your copy of clown milk like

862
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:06,100
i'll send you it a music stand yeah yeah music stand like where you know where you put the sheet

863
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:12,100
music on isn't that like a big bulky thing am i having a stroke wait wait hold on wait i'm not done

864
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,980
so you get the music stand right and you put the book there making it easier to masturbate to the

865
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:24,100
while you're reading and that's a funny idea but that okay like buying music stands it was a joke

866
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,940
it was a joke i'm not it was a joke i'm not gonna fucking do that what the fuck are you crazy you

867
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:33,940
think i want to get a motherfucker music stand you insane you think i'm crazy you think i'm making

868
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:39,060
insane decisions you've lost it you've lost it you've lost the plot you think this is a psycho

869
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:44,980
you think i think you're a little bit of a jester you think you think i'm a funny little guy you

870
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:50,580
think i you think i'll pull a little clown maneuver like that maybe should i just should have

871
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:56,020
done the music stand tier like higher you should get like a at 300 you get the music stand you

872
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:03,060
should call it like a masturbation a masturbation yeah yeah yeah if that's the point or you could

873
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:09,140
you could have like a special tear where you cram the comic into a tiny car a tiny clown car and

874
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:15,540
send that and then you open it up and this like all crumpled and ruined but it's inside a clown

875
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:21,700
car so it's funny if the if the if the if the uh the campaign hits a hundred thousand dollars we

876
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:26,820
will invest in a clown car that will go door to door across the country and stop at every

877
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:35,620
individual backer's house and uh clowns will will pile out of the tiny car deliver their order yeah

878
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:43,540
i think it i think it could work fuck it we'll go we'll go we'll go um international too and

879
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:48,660
then someone orders a copy in ukraine you gotta take the clown car all the way in ukraine

880
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:58,580
is there a big red target on the fucking map okay so item number three is more more tears

881
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:04,500
more moichindizing i am moichindized yeah yeah is there is there a fourth is there an item number

882
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:13,220
four um i'm looking at what i listed as um potential items number four uh they're not like

883
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:18,180
they're not like major issues just kind of grievances or things or me retrospective grievance

884
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:24,260

885
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:29,540
say i'd like to say a handful of people i realized like didn't really have my fucking back on this

886
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:36,340

893
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:17,780
probably mentioned this before but fucking uh i ghosted me there this whole thing like um because

894
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:24,100
um so basically he has he has a podcast right and it's it's doing pretty good actually he's doing

895
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:29,860
like pretty good in numbers and it's a really good podcast like i've never considered being a

896
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:36,500
patron of a podcast until this podcast now mm-hmm right uh their podcast which is a really good

897
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:42,420
podcast and um they he and they have mentioned me on the podcast before like casually like almost

898
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:48,580
every other episode they just casually mentioned me right so i i dm them saying about like it's

899
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:54,740
basically the whole proposition of like if you guys could just promote um clown milk i will send

900
01:24:54,740 --> 01:25:01,780
both of you guys like a free copy right okay and he just didn't reply back to that email right

901
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:09,780
yeah and then and then um i um i dm them on like uh twitter like a week later

902
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:15,860
right and about like hey did you get my email and he's all like oh we got a lot of emails um

903
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:20,340
well which one was yours and i i reiterated the offer to him and he just didn't he just didn't

904
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:27,380
say anything to it right yeah and then like then like another week later i tell him like look dude

905
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:32,820
the kickstart is not doing so well can you at least like retweet it and he he just didn't reply to

906
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:39,060
that and i i don't know why i don't know why and i mean this might just be a paranoid but it feels

907
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:47,140
like they're not like casually like mentioning me anymore on the podcast right uh and i i i don't

908
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:53,860
sound like they just this is not a not a good value proposition for them i mean if he if he told me

909
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,020
that if like because i didn't i mean i did offer him money like do you want do you think you need

910
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:03,940
to get paid for this because like i'll be down just like you know maybe buy some number because i

911
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:10,260
told him that like that that i could pay him um but like he just i guess they just were interested

912
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:17,380
i mean um if i were to kind of like guess why is because um they're about to shoot their own

913
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:22,980
patreon and i guess they didn't like want to ask their fans for money for another thing

914
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:29,380
and then they're gonna drop their patreon you know yeah kind of kind of makes sense

915
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:36,500
i could i could explain it i yeah or i mean another thing that could have explained it was

916
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:42,500
then maybe someone else like has um tried a proposition to him about like promoting something

917
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:50,820
and he said no to that and to be consistent he has to say no to me maybe maybe it just feels so it

918
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:56,260
just feels just so it just feels so weird like i don't know why because he's promoted my other

919
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:00,180
stuff before like i've asked him like it because this wasn't this isn't like the first time i ever

920
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:06,580
asked him to like can you retweet like a thing for me right so in this case like i just don't

921
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:10,740
know what the deal was and it's not like he is not like he's he's not the kind of person that's

922
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:15,620
scared to retweet porn because like he's like commissioned porn artist and he's posted it on

923
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:24,980
his like twitter right so it doesn't like i don't know it doesn't like um it doesn't like

924
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:32,500
make sense you know and it i don't really yeah it's hard hard to hard to say hard to say and

925
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:37,060
i'm not gonna lie because like i thought i was like decently close to this guy you know and i

926
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:41,780
was really bothered by it like like no joke i wouldn't like stop thinking about like what

927
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:47,460
was the deal like why like like like you think you think you got you think someone's got your back

928
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:56,340
and then it's like i don't know that sucks i mean i guess i guess you you were just i don't know

929
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:01,460
asking for more than he was willing to give you i guess i mean if he told me that i wish he would

930
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:06,260
just told if that was the case i wish he would have just told that they're like hey yeah i don't

931
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,580
know is he uncomfortable the thing is i've mentioned clown porn to him before and he's like oh let me

932
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:16,580
see that i'm sure i'm sure he's not i'm sure he's not like has an issue with clown porn i'm sure

933
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:24,500
that's not it i i just don't know i just don't know what the what the deal is you know i and i wish i

934
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:28,100
knew i wish he would have told me right because i because it's not the first time i just been

935
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:33,540
ghosted by someone and it's not like he unfollowed me on on twitter any like he so follows me but

936
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:38,580
it's just so like well what what is it like am i do i just pretend that this didn't happen the next

937
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:44,740
time i you probably there is going to be a next time i would say the Kickstarter was going to fail

938
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:56,900
like i give help i i don't know i mean i guess there's the there's technically room from just

939
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:03,540
have not noticed every single time that that could be it yeah you should mention it to him at least

940
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:09,700
so you know for sure if you want to talk to him again about it i mean i mentioned like probably

941
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:14,660
like i feel like i'll mention it when i'm in a better headspace about it i think because right

942
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:20,660
now i think you should probably assume that he did see it and just didn't feel like it and then

943
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:24,820
i'll just i don't know part of me just feels kind of weird pretending it didn't happen you know

944
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:32,260
i mean i i mean is it is it now that okay just don't ever ask for this don't ever ask anything

945
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:38,740
from this guy ever again like don't like don't ask for maybe because because i would hate like i

946
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:43,380
i would hate like if i like because i have like other Kickstarter plans and other projects and

947
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:50,180
it'd be i'd be kind of weird if like he like now i like see him retweeting those and then it's like

948
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:59,140
okay well what was the deal then you know i don't know i just i just uh i i don't want to come

949
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:06,420
i mean you're not i mean you're not you're not owed you're not owed or retweet yeah i i agree

950
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:13,380
i'm not owed anything but like you you know like i i that am i friends and did i think i'm

951
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,500
did i'm fake i'm more friends with this guy than i actually am

952
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,940
like that could be a thing but like i don't know the guy's been on my podcast twice

953
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:27,220
yeah like he seems to like like my shit i drew a picture from one of his like cards

954
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:34,180
right yeah i did oh i didn't know that like for the first wave i drew a picture of one of

955
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:41,060
it one of the cards like he asked me to huh yeah so what card um i did a big homo

956
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:48,420
oh well it's weird i haven't i haven't i hadn't seen that okay that's really yeah well i don't know um

957
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:54,420
i don't know maybe he just maybe just maybe he just wasn't a fan of the project for one reason

958
01:30:54,420 --> 01:31:01,860
or another and who knows i maybe has beef with the two other artists that i have on it i don't know

959
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:07,700
i don't know it could be that's a there's something i'm kind of like

960
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:11,540
realizing more and more about myself and this should have been more obvious is that um

961
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:18,260
like it's it's not normal for people to go into other people's DMs and ask for retweets

962
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,980
that's not a normal thing apparently um

963
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:26,900
because i think more people are i think more people are scared about doing it

964
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:32,980
like it's it's a very scary thing we would do it's not normal but i mean it's not really normal

965
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:41,220
to be like a content creator with like a product to market yeah if you are that then i don't think

966
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:50,660
it's like particularly shameful or problematic to to do that i i think it's um i just i guess

967
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:54,100
because in the back of my head and i guess not everyone sees it this way and i still don't get

968
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:59,460
why no one still sees it this way is that retaining something does not take anything away from you

969
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:07,300
yeah ultimately you know but it feels like people think it does like they lose a little bit like

970
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:12,340
either their finger breaks pressing the retweet button or they lose a bit of their soul they're

971
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:20,260
well i mean you retweet a lot yeah i do retweet a lot right i think well i mean i think if a if a

972
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:28,820
twitter feed is like a if a twitter feed is like content then you you want to retweet

973
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:35,940
the the fewer things you retweet the more like a spotlight you put on each individual thing

974
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:44,820
true but i still gotten like my personal stuff like blown up outside of the concert retweeting

975
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:51,140
right yeah and and the thing is like i feel like people will still see the same number of like

976
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:59,860
tweets even if you didn't retweet so much you know maybe i i haven't like seen an argument like

977
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:07,300
against that i think that i think there's an argument to be made that like every every every

978
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:12,340
retweet you do sort of like takes a little bit of value away from all your other retweets if

979
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:17,300
someone like actually like brought it like down to me and told me this is like this is the deal

980
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:21,940
like this is how many like retweets and then i don't think like twitter is ever gonna say that

981
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:27,540
because it's the thing about they don't want someone to like perfectly game the system right

982
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:32,260
because that's like what youtube does as well they don't tell you exactly what are the things

983
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:37,620
or you do or not supposed to do because then like that's how you get like the else of spider man

984
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:43,940
videos well i mean they i don't think there is like a formula i think it's just like depends on

985
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:50,100
what people are looking at i because i also saw people say that like you know how they say like

986
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:54,820
oh if you if you add like a link to like a patreon or kickstarter commission in your tweet

987
01:33:55,540 --> 01:34:00,980
it like makes it makes your twitter tweet seem like you get less people looking at that tweet

988
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:05,140
yeah yeah yeah yeah right but then i hear people say that that's not true like that's just

989
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:11,620
yeah people it's not it's not true it's mostly just people hyper focusing on that tweet so

990
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:18,420
they notice when it doesn't like i yeah i i think the the experience of using twitter generally

991
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:23,300
is just scrolling down and occasionally slowing down when you see something that's interesting

992
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:30,180
and so like the amount of retweets it only really becomes like apparent when you're on

993
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:34,980
that person's page but most people don't go to a person's page they just go to like twitter home

994
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:42,420
and they scroll down i feel like most people click they go to media tab first if they click on your

995
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:51,700
page uh yeah if you if you make like knowings yeah yeah if you yeah yeah that that is always

996
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:55,460
kind of a thing where it's like oh this artist made this really good thing i want to see what

997
01:34:55,460 --> 01:35:00,100
else they do i click on their thing it's like 90 percent retweets of like memes i'm like okay i go

998
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:06,100
to the media tab and it's also got memes in it and i'm like i just want to see what they do

999
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:12,660
that is a frustrating thing if you're if you're an artist with a twitter you probably i can

1000
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:18,340
understand why you might have like an an art account and then like a personal account because

1001
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:22,740
like yeah if you want to see someone's art and you go to their twitter and you don't see the art

1002
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:33,780
it's like well what's the point it's it's a balance to strike i don't think uh i don't think um it's

1003
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:40,420
necessarily wrong of somebody to not want to retweet something for any reason i just think it

1004
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:45,540
should be more normal to say no i don't want to do that instead of ghosting instead of saying nothing

1005
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:51,540
saying nah nah i don't i don't want to clutter my page up with that like it that should be more

1006
01:35:51,540 --> 01:36:01,540
normal just admitting that that you don't want to do something i i mean i think it's um i mean

1007
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:11,380
i think it's fine if people say they don't i just they fuck my body's stopping me from saying

1008
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:17,220
like i think it's fine if people say no to a retweet my body is my body is physically stopping

1009
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:23,860
me from saying that your mind understands but your heart can't can't it's process like okay

1010
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:30,260
if someone like the thing is like i i feel like any if any mutual goes into my depending on like

1011
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:34,580
i mean depending on what they want me to retweet i would say yes to anything like to any retweet i

1012
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:39,940
don't care right yeah i'll retweet like there's there's people who are like former mutuals who

1013
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:45,300
don't fuck with me and don't like me but i still retweet like their stuff specifically like mission

1014
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:53,140
sheets because like they they need money like shit like i don't fuck with you anymore i mean if they

1015
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:58,580
really like if they really like piss me off then i won't do it but if like they didn't if they're

1016
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:07,220
the one who ghosted me like you know hmm right me i'm not gonna stop i'm not gonna stop retweeting

1017
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:15,380
because i do think they're fine sure right sure i mean i usually just i get that i usually i i

1018
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:20,740
never really think to like go to somebody individually and say hey could you retweet

1019
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:27,060
this thing i usually just post and hope that it gains traction naturally because i i'd rather

1020
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:33,220
i'd rather not converse with people i would do that i would maybe do that if like

1021
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:40,420
i would do that if i was like doing a kickstarter or something i would maybe reach out to like

1022
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:48,420
people who i know on twitter and be like hey you know i'm doing this thing like if you would uh

1023
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:54,020
that's uh that's a little bit more time sensitive you know yeah yeah i didn't do that for my

1024
01:37:54,020 --> 01:38:00,500
kickstarter i maybe i should have it's the thing is it really doesn't take anything out of people

1025
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:07,300
i was in um i was in this one discord server and um one of the one of the people that runs

1026
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:14,260
that discord server like posted like two pieces of art in one day and they asked like they asked

1027
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:18,820
like a more popular person there if they could retweet they asked them to repeat retweet the

1028
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,500
first one and then when they posted the second one they asked they could do retweet the second one too

1029
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:28,340
and this this person was really like he said like he he was like oh come on dude i already

1030
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:34,260
like i already retweeted the first one and it's like it doesn't break your fucking arm like i was

1031
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:39,620
about to fight this guy too i don't know i was like i was like i was an absorber about it but

1032
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:44,420
like i was i was willing to like fight this guy on this but it's like why he gave he gave a retweet

1033
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:49,780
the second retweet doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt you doesn't break your fucking fingers

1034
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:57,380
well so what the guy wasn't obligated to do the first one and he's not obligated to do the

1035
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:02,580
second one either but but but if they did the first one and like the second one shouldn't have been

1036
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:07,300
that big of a fucking problem oh come on like if it's your buddy like if it's your friend

1037
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:16,980
yeah i i if your buddy is like i don't see how this would be like okay i mean if this is a

1038
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:21,300
total stranger and this is a total fucking i get if it's like a mutual you've never talked to before

1039
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:27,060
and the first thing you when you pop into their dms is this that you know i get that

1040
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:32,260
but this is like this is someone you talk to back and forth you're super casual and friendly

1041
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,820
you're like why not like you know it doesn't fucking

1042
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,980
it doesn't you know the fucking like end your life i understand i understand i kind of understand

1043
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,020
and wanting to keep your feed clean

1044
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:55,060
because if you're if you're if your feed is if your feed is content you want the content to be

1045
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:03,780
good or you want or you want it to be uncluttered you want it to be focused i i understand i i mean

1046
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:09,380
i would i would retweet i would retweet stuff that a buddy made i would definitely do that

1047
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:14,580
but it doesn't mean i'm gonna retweet everything that they make i'm gonna do it if like i think

1048
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:21,700
it's something that they would appreciate it enough that it's like okay the cleanliness of my feed is

1049
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:30,420
not so precious that i won't do this for a guy i i get it if you're the kind because there's some

1050
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:36,100
artists out out there who just never retweet anyone else they're just like constantly reposting

1051
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:41,620
their own work yeah like i get that because there's no point in asking those people to retweet

1052
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:47,860
something because they just don't yeah right yeah um but if you're not that kind of person and you

1053
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:53,540
are like i mean the thing is like if you're willing to retweet uh a picture of someone who you're just

1054
01:40:53,540 --> 01:41:01,060
a fan of right like i i feel you should take the the offer for the retweet is is usually more inclined

1055
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:10,660
because it's a buddy you know i mean sure yeah i am if if a buddy you know remember remember when

1056
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:17,540
uh remember when nate wouldn't post the newest pcp on his channel uh even though like he like

1057
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:22,020
got our channel hacked remember that gib uh yeah why did we end up putting it that would

1058
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:27,060
that was i think i think trixie might have put it on her channel i think or something

1059
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:33,140
uh yeah i remember yeah i i thought it was pretty i thought it was pretty uh stupid that

1060
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:38,180
nate was like no i won't uh i won't host an episode of the pcp on my channel because like

1061
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:47,780
the cleanliness of my feed uh lamal but uh so i mean i kind of get it i don't know there was

1062
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:56,020
she was embarrassed about the pcp yeah probably i mean i don't know that was a joke i don't know

1063
01:41:56,020 --> 01:42:03,860
how true that it is but i mean like i i get it when it's like your brand or whatever it's like

1064
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:11,060
high quality videos very infrequently and then to put a podcast on there it'd be like oh you're

1065
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:19,060
doing these now like maybe some viewers would be turned off by that um i mean if you just what it

1066
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:26,100
was just one episode right it wasn't like and it's your pot it's your podcast it was it was yeah

1067
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:30,100
yeah i feel like it wouldn't have been a problem but like i can see the the mindset that would

1068
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:37,780
lead you to i could i could see like feeling i feel like see i wouldn't have put it on hypocrite

1069
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:42,100
but i'm totally fine putting it on gib and take because gib and take is just a grand bag of stuff

1070
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:51,540
you know sure right i guess i guess um checking the general real quick

1071
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,940
why am i looking at this

1072
01:42:56,340 --> 01:43:00,420
that's what that's what happens when you retweet something so when your big art is

1073
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:07,300
that's what happens to you uh you become like you become a moldy Voldemort sad but you become a

1074
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:15,540
little a little fried up fetus i think it's a banana or something it looks like as tea yeah it does

1075
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:22,980
look like it has teeth maybe it's like a little yeah it's the root is it like a root of a plant

1076
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:29,220
the legs look like banana peels almost like the leg i don't it kind of looks like maybe it was

1077
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:35,460
been edited because it looks like that little hands there is too much of a hand the hands on the feet

1078
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:41,060
look very like deliberate this is what a fetus looks like on the fourth month this is a banana fetus

1079
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:50,180
the banana fetus i call it i call it the fried fetus yeah i have to pee again and i'm gonna go

1080
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:56,420
do it no one can stop me you gotta go abort that fried fetus right now man all right um

1081
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:05,940
uh you got any more insight for me gib uh on on on what on retweeting whatever

1082
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:15,540
this is really sweet yeah sure uh well my policy has always been that i retweet things that i think

1083
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:25,540
are cool and that maybe my followers haven't seen so it's like do that too it's like oh

1084
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:31,700
this is a cool art and this is from this this cool art i have been notified because i follow

1085
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:38,420
someone and they liked it and it's got it's only got 12 likes um but this is really good

1086
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:45,140
so i retweet it and like it and be like i'm glad to share that cool thing with people i do occasionally

1087
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:51,860
do like the the sort of obligatory retweeting for awareness um even though it's like you know it's

1088
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:57,380
just sort of like a friend thing it's like oh it's a gotta let people know you know gotta let

1089
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:02,260
people know about this even though my followers aren't this is not that many of them uh like

1090
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:09,780
generally speaking i don't think it's i don't think i've ever really had like a problem retweeting

1091
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:15,780
something that maybe my followers are not interested in okay i'm back but i'm also not like that big

1092
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:22,900
of a twitter user like it like i don't have so many followers that i don't i probably wouldn't

1093
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:29,940
even hear about like negative feedback about a thing i retweet anyway so i don't know it's

1094
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:35,540
just sort of like a doesn't really come up my day-to-day twitter usage

1095
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:44,500
hey did you guys um you guys see that's the jorts the cat drama on twitter this week

1096
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:51,380
genuinely cannot comprehend any of it what the fuck are you talking about uh it was the

1097
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:56,340
word it was the word it literally the worst thing ever literally the worst thing that's ever happened

1098
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:03,060
wait is that the so angry that the grubhub one uh more or less yeah i think you're thinking

1099
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:07,380
about it you run that because i saw i saw you guys talking about it but i didn't read it because

1100
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:13,780
you guys were talking a mile a minute yeah uh all right i'll try and some i'll try and summarize

1101
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:20,420
uh and i'm gonna be as and i'm gonna be as neutral and i'm gonna be as factual as possible here

1102
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:27,300
all right so what what happened was this lady uh with a not huge account but like a big-ish

1103
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:36,260
account like 10k or something um made a tweet about how men can't shop and every time she gets

1104
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:44,340
a mail instacart shopper they fuck up the order so one time she tracked down the man that was shopping

1105
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:50,820
for her and found him standing in the aisle of the supermarket looking at his phone this was this

1106
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:59,940
was the tweet yes i remember that and this and this cat this gimmick he is apparently a pro labor cat

1107
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:07,620
this is like a cat account who retweets like union efforts which is great i guess

1108
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:15,220
this so this guy just so this george the cat gimmick account said idea get your own groceries

1109
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:20,740
or idea buy your own groceries now what do what do you think happened after after george the cat

1110
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:28,260
said this uh i know people got mad yeah that's all i know do you know why because he's a cat

1111
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:36,420
and cats can't be involved in human life because he's able is yes that's right

1112
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:43,220
see on the face of it that always seemed a bit silly because if she tracked him down

1113
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:49,780
she clearly went to the store and she's in front of the groceries which she could then buy

1114
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:57,700
yes it's not like she was unable in that instance to get the groceries she just like the convenience

1115
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:08,500
which is what the app is for that's right and then what happened i mean i mean that's the the the

1116
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:15,780
fear the fear was you know a lot a lot of accounts tweeted that george is ableist because uh because

1117
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:21,620
he said get your own groceries i thought that was and if and if you said that to a disabled person

1118
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:26,340
that can't get their own groceries that would be really bad but what if you said that to someone

1119
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:34,100
else and it was in a worse context maybe you think ever think about that i i i don't know i don't know

1120
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:42,180
um this listen i'm minimizing it i'm minimizing the the irreversible psychic damage that has been

1121
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:48,660
done to me this week i i will i swear i will never be the same this is this this this this has broken

1122
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:53,700
me this has tipped me over the edge i am less of a person now than i was before see i didn't look

1123
01:48:53,700 --> 01:49:00,420
into it but like it seemed like a huge deal i was sure there was more to it than the ableism

1124
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:07,860
that no it's it's literally like people it's it's literally disabled people said like

1125
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:16,740
this this is about me this is this would be ableist if you said this to me and now the fact that you

1126
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:24,420
said this to someone who isn't disabled is now people are gonna say this to me also and that

1127
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:30,900
and how could you do this to me george how could you do this to me george george the cat used to

1128
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:44,420
be an institution you could trust and now now that's been stained okay um uh it's just i i i just i

1129
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:49,220
what is the it went on for like two days people were angry at george george for being ableist

1130
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:56,180
for telling this woman and then like and then it kind of evolved because people people were

1131
01:49:57,380 --> 01:50:02,900
people were saying people were talking about how much they need instacart right and it literally

1132
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:08,020
is like totally beside the point because it doesn't matter how much you a disabled person

1133
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:14,820
need or rely on instacart literally irrelevant to to what happened and but people kept making

1134
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:20,420
these posts about how i'm disabled and i need instacart i'm disabled and i rely on instacart

1135
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:25,940
and if an instacart gig worker got my order wrong it would financially devastate me or whatever and

1136
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:33,380
like great first first of all i i use as someone who has used instacart i know that you can just

1137
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:39,460
fucking report a like wrong order and they will just refund it you can just fucking complain to

1138
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:44,340
them and they will give you your money back it's it's totally deranged to be like it would

1139
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:49,380
financially devastate me if my instacart shopper got my order wrong that would never wait wait

1140
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:54,580
whose side are they on then i thought they were mad at george for saying get your own groceries

1141
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:58,980
but they're also mad at the idea of a guy getting the groceries wrong there's there's two sides

1142
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:05,380
well yeah yeah yeah because because this woman because this woman is right to stalk and harass

1143
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:11,300
her gig worker because if she had been disabled and this guy had got her order wrong that would

1144
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:20,820
be abuse you see that would be abuse of the disabled it's it's the two sides it's uh it's

1145
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:26,420
the you know it's the people who like are mad at the grub hub worker keeps fucking up the order

1146
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:30,820
and then the people are kind of like if they keep fucking up why don't you just get the order

1147
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:36,740
and then i'm super abled that evolves into the oh well what if i'm disabled and i'm like what if

1148
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:41,620
the grub hub worker is disabled like what if the grub what if what if the shopper's disabled

1149
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:45,380
bro what if i what if the shopper's disabled what if i go into your house and fucking kill

1150
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:50,660
what if i slit your throat while you're asleep what the fuck about that people you never consider

1151
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:55,940
that as an option and people started posting their stuff and there were there were a few

1152
01:51:55,940 --> 01:52:02,180
very weird ones that were like i have adhd and therefore i can't shop in person therefore i have

1153
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:10,660
to therefore i need i need a gig worker to do it for me and and also i reserve the right to stalk

1154
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:16,500
them if they do it wrong i you know this woman was right this woman was right to stalk to stalk

1155
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:24,660
her her gig worker it's he was abusing her i know um what else did i

1156
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:31,940
i'm glad like i haven't really thought about it in the last couple days but like when it was going

1157
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:37,860
on this was like i was i was i'm glad i'm glad i have some distance from it let's just say i'm

1158
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:44,180
glad i have some distance from it because i could i could not deal with it yes it was so infuriating

1184
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:22,180
like beat top that it's sort of like you imagine somebody just posting a tweet saying i had a

1185
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:30,100
really good run today and then somebody said um i can't run so yeah that's funny this morning i saw

1186
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:35,300
people were reacting to like some lady posted about how much she liked sitting in her garden

1187
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:40,660
and how much she loved her husband oh yeah people were like um not all of us can afford gardens or

1188
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:52,660
husbands yeah or husbands yeah it's just sort of like okay i i you're reading into my non-tweet

1189
01:55:52,740 --> 01:56:00,660
like non position so many positions i have i have i like i have i and i and i don't think anybody

1190
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:07,380
has anything against like anyone who is disabled and relies on like a gig to like do their grocery

1191
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:14,740
delivery like it's fine and like literally nobody is mad about that but they they they they this

1192
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:21,300
totally unrelated thing a certain kind of person saw this as an attack on them yeah personally for

1193
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:28,900
some reason and made a big discourse about it that lasted like three days and i hated it

1194
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:35,380
was so angry it really it was like the worst it was it was probably the worst twitter discourse

1195
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:42,100
of 2022 if i had to if i had to put my it really had to gun to my gun to my head this was the worst

1196
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:48,020
i mean it's a funny thing to say because like twitter discourse is so vapid and so like nothing

1197
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:51,860
that i completely forget every single one of them i don't even know what happened this year on

1198
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:56,100
twitter i'll never forget i'll never forget where were you when george said get your own

1199
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,460
like can you even name a single other twitter discourse that happened this year

1200
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:08,180
there's there's so like like you know in the moment and they think is that they tend to repeat

1201
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:13,780
they do they kind of tend to repeat and go in cycles i am i started some discourse in in cell

1202
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:17,700
discourse men aren't men aren't having enough sex that one comes up every now and then

1203
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:26,580
nice um what else i don't know uh i don't know some careful careful shit careful um

1204
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:34,180
me when i when i decided to go after bendy and was labeled in ableist because it turned out

1205
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:44,100
bendy was disabled me no me oh bendy yeah oh that blue guy yeah blue guy was he disabled no

1206
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:48,260
who was like he was like in his thirties or something is that like the i guess we

1207
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:53,060
know that well that's that's a disability that's a disability yeah bendy the the

1208
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:59,940
fucking indie horror game mascot um so there's bendy the and the ink machine that's the video

1209
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:06,020
game and then there's bendy fan one two three or something like that he's like his bendy fan 1488

1210
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:11,940
on twitter bendy yeah and uh and i know i know the horror game you're thinking of but that's

1211
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:16,500
that's a different he was like uh he was like a adult larpy and i was like a 13 year old oh yeah

1212
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:22,340
bendy fan 13 i was and he was like oh wait i remember the blue yeah the blue guy yeah yeah yeah

1213
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:30,820
and like i went once it was revealed that he was like an adult and um had was posting such

1214
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:38,340
shit in in the week that he was active um i made a tweet like uh like shitting on people for drawing

1215
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:43,220
fan art of him because in my head i thought like okay well these things come in cycles right like

1216
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:48,180
people people love the guy and then everyone starts shitting on him so i'm going to jump ahead of the

1217
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:53,460
line on the whole shitting on him but no it turns out people still love them even though it was he

1218
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:59,540
was like i come i remember i'll be honest i never really saw that guy around i i saw like yeah

1219
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:03,220
but that's how that works always right like i never saw any of the george the cat shit

1220
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:08,820
it wait wait so you just you just decided to like get out ahead of like you were like this is a

1221
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:13,700
popular guy i'm sure he will eventually be exposed no he was already he was already exposed so i'm

1222
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:18,260
going to be the first hater i'm going to be the the primordial hater of this guy so when he

1223
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:22,900
eventually the community turns on him i'll be the guy that everyone looks to and be like this

1224
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:27,940
guy knew it this guy called it no no i he was already exposed by the time i made the tweet

1225
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:34,660
but i guess the news did not reach around that fast what was the expose what was he was he was

1226
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:40,260
just that he was older he was large his whole plan was that um he made this account where he was

1227
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:46,180
like pretending to be 13 and he would like draw his shitty like bendy oc's and he would like

1228
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:51,460
go around and like pretend to be a cringey 13 year old and then one and he would do the thing

1229
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:56,660
where it's like oh can you draw my character and someone actually did it and it blew up and he

1230
01:59:56,660 --> 02:00:02,100
became super popular really quick right because everyone was under the idea that he was just some

1231
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:08,260
13 year old like just trying to try and just trying to make it on twitter right and and just

1232
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:11,780
trying to make it but then people like trying to make and he's only been around for like that that

1233
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:16,820
guy's gmi yeah you should you should learn a thing or two from that guy yeah i should i should pretend

1234
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:24,580
to be 13 and then be like hey guys i started a cloud point kicks whatever um you're a minor uh

1238
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:51,540
and post it no it's not there's no law it's just sort of like it just shouldn't be encouraged i guess

1239
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:58,660
because the there'll be it's weird because they don't really know what they're doing it is very

1240
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:04,580
weird and but i feel like there's so many people out there who encourage it yeah i i see um i've

1241
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:09,860

1242
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:16,340
of itchy stuff though yeah um there's like a there's like a i don't like there's an art style to the

1247
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:43,780
hmm well there's one well there's there's one person who i thought was a minor who has a girl

1248
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:50,660
with crab claw hair and and he and he draws and it looks like it looks like uh frickin uh craig

mccracken cartoon but bad um but there's like butts this it's it's definitely it's definitely itchy

1250
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:03,940
it's definitely the most like the most like pop the most like fame infamous of the minor she drew

1251
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:12,340
porn was um ink plasm you know i'm praying you know ink plasm nope um no he kind of has this

1252
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:17,300
kind of like almost like imagine like adventure time characters but thicker like they have big

1253
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:22,740
hips and big tits that's kind of like the art style for the miners who draw porn if you're a

1254
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:28,900
minor you draw like that you probably draw porn like secretly oh i i've seen um this oc

1255
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:35,540
okay it's like a lizard girl anyway that guy yeah that guy would draw very suggestive things and

1256
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:39,780
people would get mad at him but he would always be like oh okay i'm just oh guys i'm just a minor

1257
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:44,260
guys guys i'm just a minor as i'm just a minor don't be mad but then it got revealed

1258
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:49,780
but then it got revealed that he he would secretly do nsfw commission it's like he would keep it under

1259
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:55,220
like like he wouldn't tell anyone yeah so he was doing that the whole time being a minor that got

1260
02:02:55,220 --> 02:03:00,980
him a lot of like negative attention but i mean but i mean why would you mention that he's not him

1261
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:05,380
that's gonna get in trouble for it wouldn't it be the people that are doing something wrong it would

1262
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:10,180
be the people commissioning him but he at the end of the day he's like a bigger name that them

1263
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:17,940
than them so he's gonna get all the attention for it right yeah yeah um yeah like i think i think

1264
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:23,620
you're a minor and i think there's just like very like what i mean people are really what are you

1265
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:32,100
gonna do the whole like call the cops yeah yeah he's doing it again he's drawing he's drawing big

1266
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:41,540
titty lizard girls yeah he's only 13 see 13 no no i'm joking but okay okay i i i have no idea how

1267
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:47,620
the guy was when i know he's like 18 now he's not he's not a minor no good for him so retroactively

1268
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:54,180
all the stuff he did was is a okay now it's all okay now yeah because now he's 18 it's all good

1269
02:03:55,460 --> 02:04:00,660
yeah it's just it's like a discussion to be had about like the prevalence of not safe work

1270
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:05,540
imagery on the internet and how easy it is to get but like i don't know how different that is from

1271
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:12,500
how it used to be it just sort of like now social media means that you you're more able and and

1272
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:18,580
encouraged to post whatever you make on the internet for everyone to see i i don't and people don't

1273
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:25,700
people if they can't tell based on your art skill how young you are you just get away with lying

1274
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:36,100
yeah i i don't i try never mostly to never follow any minors um because like i'm really like a

1275
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:42,420
pose of a minor being popular on the internet who needs that yeah like i i think that's i think

1276
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:47,380
that's not good for people and the minor if you shouldn't be popular and if you're a minor i think

1277
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:53,140
that fucks you up yeah you shouldn't be on the internet until you're 28 i yeah exactly i i think

1278
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:58,340
like you bird out a lot quicker if you're popular as a minor you know you know how people complain

1279
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:04,260
about how like oh because kids nowadays have easier access to like digital art program so they're

1280
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:11,380
learning art skills at a way faster pace that's why you get like minors who draw so well but but in

1281
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:17,860
retrospect um because they're minors and they're so so susceptible to like trying to be popular

1282
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:24,340
online they bird out quicker and they usually delete their account at a younger age yeah which

1283
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:30,660
is pretty base and then that leaves us the adults still around your mentally sound and be like ha ha

1284
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:35,540
minor minor couldn't cut it it's meant to be bad so they couldn't cut it stupid big baby you should

1285
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:42,740
have been so good at r u motherfucker i sure hate it when somebody young is better than me at something

1286
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:50,980
so i love it when they die yeah i don't die inside and i say grow up into a ball i say what the people

1287
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:55,060
want to say you know i i say the things people actually want to say you know i don't sugar

02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:40,660
nice you've been you've been getting better you've been getting better at art give i really

1295
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:47,300
thank you um i thought i thought you were gonna i thought you were gonna be uh working on Clarissa

1296
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:53,460
i am um it's actually it's funny i was talking to my therapist about like ah jeez these commissions

1297
02:06:53,460 --> 02:07:00,900
taking so long ah shit ah fuck and she was sort of like encouraging me to you know finish them

1298
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:08,900
and then like like do more because i was worried i was i was worried about like oh people was i took

1299
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:13,620
so long on those last ones what if people hate me and they'll never commission me again and so

1300
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:18,900
she's saying for you should you should do it again like for peace of mind see what see what

1301
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:23,540
happens because you if you worry about like potential bad things happening in the future

1302
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:30,020
based on like zero information um you're just going to be worried forever so like actually

1303
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:34,260
just do it and see what happens if people don't want to commission you anymore then you know

1304
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:39,860
you have more actual real reality information that you can base future decisions off so that's

1305
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:47,380
why i'm doing it it's like uh it's a it's a it's a i don't know testing the waters because i do

1306
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:53,860
worry about things without like like i think of the worst possible outcome and i worry about that

1307
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:57,460
when i don't actually know what's likely to happen because i haven't tried anything

1308
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:02,740
so that's why i'm doing it and i think it's gonna go well i've already started one

1309
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:09,060
and it's looking great i've been very more productive recently uh just good also on clarris as

1339
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:27,380
and we'll see if uh anything happens there and then we'll have and then we'll have the last laugh

1340
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:35,860
maybe what would you do ben if only one hair grew a lot and it was like a one really long curl at the

1341
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:42,020
top you would kill him i don't want to cut it what the fuck he would make a it would make a rope out

1342
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:47,620
of it to hang himself yeah what if he had exactly enough of the hair to make the Homer Simpson

1343
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:52,420
you were gonna say what if like there was one hair but it was like really thick like it was like a

1344
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:58,180
whole like inch in diameter yeah like like a twisted realm like a like a a rope that's horrible

1345
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:06,100
that's too scary to even think about um uh the the the what shit i feel like i'm gonna say something

1346
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:12,980
else about extra souls um the only yeah the only residuals i need are that executive producer credit

1347
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:18,740
just um all right just just print just print just print that print it with print it with executive

1348
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:24,740
producer ben saint and i'll be and i'll be more than happy it'll be on the cover and i'll be bigger

1349
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:31,380
than the title yeah actually actually instead of like a traditional cover just put the tie just put

1350
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:37,060
just in in times new roman right or in like in like typewriter font an aerial not aerial just

1351
02:12:37,060 --> 02:12:42,340
just have it look like a screenplay and just say extra souls executive producer ben saint and that's

1352
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:47,300
all and then you can have the cover page on the inside the title is gonna be ben saint presents

1353
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:54,180
a ben saint production a ben ben saints extra souls that's what's gonna be the title i just

1354
02:12:54,180 --> 02:13:00,980
realized i don't know what extra souls is what is this oh what maybe i know what that is is it

1355
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:08,100
do you want to explain it i'll tell it okay so extra souls is um it's a comic it's that i wrote

1356
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:12,420
based on a short film that i was working on years ago and i had to cancel

1357
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:19,540
and um i rewrote it as a comic and i've been talking to several different artists about drawing it

1358
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:25,620
and twice it twice it fell through like two artists couldn't like finish it they couldn't

1359
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:31,300
like they like lost their interest very quickly and then i finally um got me me already to do it

1360
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:37,700
and the plan was that like uh we would like do the whole pre-order things on the on the comic and

1361
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:45,140
she would get like 800 the first 800 would be hers by the fault um then i told ben about it and

1362
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:49,380
ben just offered to give her because well because maybe because mimi already said like she wanted

1363
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:55,300
to do it yeah but she like couldn't justify like taking the time to do it on like the promise of

1364
02:13:55,300 --> 02:14:00,820
future payment well she was gonna she was gonna do it she was gonna do it already before you came

1365
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:05,780
along it's just that yeah but it was like down the price it was like down the priorities list so like

1366
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:12,980
who knows when it would have ever actually gotten done right yes that's true so ben ben came along

1367
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:20,100
um executive producer ben to say um that's right came along and just gave her the 800 and she's

1368
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:24,580
been i just i just said i'll just i'll just pay it now i'll just pay it now so you can start doing

1369
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:33,300
it now and then you can when you sell the book later you can pay me back uh uh cool anyway i

1370
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:37,380
didn't hear any i didn't hear about it for a long time but i guess you asked her recently and she

1371
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:44,420
said she is back at it so that's cool yeah she it was like yeah because um she's just she kind of

1372
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:49,940
her life has kind of changed since like the last we started right i think she moved to whole new state

1373
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:56,740
and started a new job but um she's taking priority in the book now so she's still speaking of

1374
02:14:56,820 --> 02:15:02,900
speaking of speaking of uh comics i'm still waiting i'm still waiting for i think simsie has

1375
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:08,740
probably dropped that one page that he sketched i don't think he's gonna finish it at this point

1376
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:20,180
should i give him the clown note deal uh royalties forever bad no no um

1377
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:24,420
um kai kaiju asked me like a week or two ago

1378
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:30,900
he like asked what was left and i told him he's he he was supposed to draw the cover

1379
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:35,460
and there's like one other page he was gonna do and i haven't heard back from him but he'll

1380
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:42,420
probably get it done at some point and new new i know you're listening you sketched two you

1381
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:48,900
sketched three pages and then you finished one and i and i sorry i DM'd you back late but uh

1382
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:59,300
whenever you finish those uh i want those other two please do them thanks they look really good

1383
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:04,180
by the way the sketches look really good i think that's it and i i think that like

1384
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:10,420
like two more pages from new and like two more from kaiju and one that i think simsie was gonna do

1385
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:15,140
but maybe i'll have to find someone else to do it and like that's that's it for the the dojin

1386
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:24,420
crazy yeah i know new can do it i just offered him a comic for um that volume two and he says

1387
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:34,900
gonna take that who uh new new yeah uh well good for him uh well uh well nevertheless that's

1388
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:40,740
that's the plan the next week next time the next vapor's chapter comes out i'm gonna drop the next

1389
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:49,540
clown milk snatch up everybody for the minute did i um did i already say did i already say

1390
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:57,380
that i know i said last week that i might have the video done this week but this time i really

1391
02:16:57,380 --> 02:17:08,980
mean it guys like really for real this time uh yeah yeah well i'm saying it again um i i should have

1392
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:14,740
i had yesterday i honestly i like could have finished it yesterday but i didn't uh uh i like

1393
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:21,380
like like all i have to do for it to be like done is basically just watch it through and just like

1394
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:25,780
make and just like go into the file and make any corrections because like sometimes there's

1395
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:32,180
like a gap in the footage or sometimes like an image got like moved at some point and it's in

1396
02:17:32,180 --> 02:17:36,260
the wrong place and i have to just like find those and just move them back to where they should be

1397
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:45,700
and and um i'm like i'm like two hours through re-watching my eight hour video and uh it's

1398
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:51,860
hard and i don't like it i'm sick of looking at it i don't want to watch it anymore but i just have

1399
02:17:51,860 --> 02:17:58,260
to put like there's another i just have to get through it i have to get through it and then

1400
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:02,580
it'll be done and then i'm post it so i i'll probably post it this week i'll probably post it

1401
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:09,060
before this episode comes out so i hope it's out by the time this episode is is published and that

1402

it's it's 225 60 by 1440 so not 4k but it's like higher than higher than hd uh so that's gonna be uh

1429
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:38,580
that's gonna take like 60 fucking out so actually you know what i said the video would be out this

1430
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:43,300
week no it won't it'll be done this week but then it'll take an entire other week just to

1431
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:49,380
render the fucking video so uh sorry about that you should make a you should make a live feed of

1432
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:56,100
it rendering so like people could watch that yeah i wonder if anyone's ever thought of that just a

1433
02:21:56,100 --> 02:22:01,620
live feed of a video rendering just watch the bar i feel like it would slow down the render though

1434
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:07,700
having to process and then send out the footage of it so if you hate if you hate the person you

1435
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:18,260
will watch the stream to slow down their rendering um yeah so um the reason why i mentioned eddie

1436
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:23,380
adam's earlier is because i've been talking to him about him because eddie adams mostly publishes

1437
02:22:23,380 --> 02:22:30,180
stuff through a through a publication called silver sprocket and um they're pretty um there

1438
02:22:30,180 --> 02:22:36,660
there's they're like what i like is that they're like big enough that they can get like um their

1439
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:42,660
books like across like the country in different bookstores but also that they're small enough

1440
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:48,340
that they still look at like smaller indie people right yeah so i was talking to him about like um

1441
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:54,180
potentially getting extra souls published through uh silver sprocket and he laid it down to me and

1442
02:22:54,180 --> 02:23:00,420
it sounds um it sounds pretty it sounds very fucking doable it sounds really fucking incredibly

1443
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:06,020
doable um and i mean to just kind of give you an idea of like what kind of stuff they do um

1444
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:11,140
silver sprocket is the is a publisher that published the complete collection of mr boob

1445
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:18,420
so yeah yeah that's the kind of that's kind of caliber we're trying to get to you know

1446
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:26,020
and i feel like it's possible i feel like um we get um we get uh does um this remi boy del

1447
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:32,900
published through them too um i don't think so i think remi goes through image comics

1448
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:39,940
oh okay yeah or the i mean the pervert was publisher image comics i remember that

1449
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:46,260
okay um there's a handful they have a whole other website they have like the whole list of people

1450
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:56,660
they've worked with um you know i see uh yeah i mean i've heard of them i think i i mean they

1451
02:23:57,060 --> 02:24:03,220
mr boob is a good yeah yeah right we're gonna um we're gonna outshine mr boob we're gonna blow

1452
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:14,260
his ass out of the water hmm i think this will work oh my god new video by gibb and take video

like a stage outfit i just want to have clothing i want to look cool but i don't want to look like

1514
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:25,300
i'm trying too hard you know i spent i went to that uh i went to that vintage clothing store near me

1515
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:37,300
and i foolishly spent 60 on a like dark gray like lab coat i don't know it's like kind of a weird

1516
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:43,780
item of clothing i guess it was kind of neat looking it fit pretty well i don't know when

1517
02:31:43,780 --> 02:31:49,060
i'll ever wear it it's like a it's like it's not like lab coat fabric it's like a niceish fabric

1518
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:55,300
but it's a lab coat and uh i guess maybe i could wear it as part of some sort of halloween

1519
02:31:55,300 --> 02:32:04,900
get-up i don't know just wanted to break from rick and marty it's not the right color um i don't

1520
02:32:04,900 --> 02:32:09,300
know i just went in there and i was like i found something and i think i would have bought it no

1521
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:14,260
matter how much it cost because i just wanted to buy something you said you had a lab coat right

1522
02:32:15,460 --> 02:32:22,180
it that is the item i described yes okay well obviously there's only one carry there you should

1523
02:32:22,580 --> 02:32:31,460
there's one character that ben shank ben saint should obviously be and this is a throwback

1524
02:32:31,460 --> 02:32:39,460
waiting for the punchline remember this character yeah that's right well as i have explained now

1525
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:45,620
multiple times that is a dark gray lab coat it is not white well i don't care just just one one

1526
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:51,300
say no okay fine i will even even if you even if you were to do an accurate doctor and say no

1527
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:56,020
outfit people would still not know who the fuck you are so it doesn't matter they can be well it's

1528
02:32:56,020 --> 02:33:05,700
okay yeah spoonie's got the got pretty nice teeth pretty pretty decent pretty decent set of teeth on

1530
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:21,940
live streams on his channel uh every so often more frequently recently i'm still subscribed

1531
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:30,420
i just never click on them because then they're very like low-key sort of streams nothing nothing

1532
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:37,300
like his over-the-top ostentatious like persona in his videos it's very very quiet very like a comment

1533
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:45,220
every so often it's like yeah it's not really for me no way antweiler is still uh his patreon is

1534
02:33:45,220 --> 02:33:55,700
still he's making silly videos 79 patrons 285 a month 285 they have that that's right it beats me

1535
02:33:55,700 --> 02:34:03,380
by a couple of a couple of bucks he's making bank true true you pay rent in arizona without money

1536
02:34:04,180 --> 02:34:14,580

1537
02:34:14,580 --> 02:34:20,820
and just hasn't thought about it but like it still references like projects he was doing in like 2012

1538
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:26,580

1542
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:56,180

02:34:57,140 --> 02:35:02,980
from the new video and like i'm offering some new i'm offering some new stuff on there in the hopes

02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:10,100
remember that snake of course this is a mash up of this snake i'm not gonna lie i would say like

1564
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:15,780
maybe like one third of these ideas are just like this is just a mario enemy i wish existed

1565
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:22,740
like i i think would be like interesting to have i'm trying to think of like looking at this guy

1566
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:28,820
like how how useful really is he as a predator having three heads what if they get distracted by

1567
02:37:28,820 --> 02:37:33,860
different mice what if they what if they go in different directions and they all pull and then

1568
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:38,420
like slam like that's how you stretch back and hit themselves in the head and they that's how you

1569
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:42,420
heard of that's how you heard of it that's how the boss fight he's one of those bosses where you

1570
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:48,900
have to make him hurt himself you have to spread gossip about one head shit talking the other

1571
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:53,540
and they bite each other yeah some of these um some of these are just like kind of like i i just

1572
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:59,620
think this would be an interesting idea for a mario enemy like this shy guy isn't really a mashup of

1573
02:38:00,180 --> 02:38:05,940
of any two characters is just like oh what if you just draw on the shy guy's face yeah like that

1574
02:38:06,660 --> 02:38:14,020
mm-hmm mm-hmm it's just it's just cute you know what if there was a shy guy but they had huge

1575
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:21,700
tits though whoa whoa calm down there buddy i'm just i'm just slow down slow down whoa what is that

1576
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:31,860
a fusion of um uh shy guy and the big booby that's not mario enemy uh you're you're thinking too

1577
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:39,460
limited you're you're stopping short of greatness with that with that attitude okay um people have

1578
02:38:39,460 --> 02:38:45,380
been asking me and by people i mean one person one discord server asked me to when am i going to do

1579
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:50,100
a bowser fusion and that's actually going to be the last one because i have a pretty i had a pretty

1580
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:58,100
good idea for a bowser fusion uh barrio will you tell us or is it a secret bower yo it's a secret

1581
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:06,820
um like they'll just say i i fuse bowser with um a very evil character ever a very uh like

1582
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:16,340
very malicious character is what a character that a character that that has um that predates

1583
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:25,700
the mario franchise but very evil uh bonky kong wait i know who it is i know who it is

1584
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:32,420
who do you want to guess you have to guess is it the villain no oh never does is it satan

1585
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:44,660
uh maybe maybe it's satan okay maybe maybe it's satan from from real life or from ghouls

1586
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:53,540
and goblins satan for real life you know satan by neighbor

1587
02:39:56,020 --> 02:40:02,820
huh what do you mean ghouls and goblins what are you talking about goblins and ghosts what's that game

1589
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:14,820
ghosts and goblins yeah yeah ghosts and goblins that's satan it satan is uh the final boss in that

1590
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:21,060
game yeah if you said there's there's bosses called the devil and then there's one called satan

1619
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:55,700
tom but some of the recent ones have been like way better about like topics i don't believe it

1620
02:43:55,700 --> 02:44:01,060
i don't believe it but like his a bunch of like i've heard i keep hearing him say like

1621
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:07,940
these bunch of little very stupid things all the time um he believes in the whole like twitter

1622
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:13,620
being the public square so you shouldn't ban anyone off of it which is the most dumb ass take

1623
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:19,620
ever heard it's funny how that's his take and he's a big destiny fan and that destiny is like

1624
02:44:20,820 --> 02:44:25,220
hate when people say that twitter's the public square and people shouldn't get banned off of

1625
02:44:25,220 --> 02:44:31,380
there turkey tom's a destiny fan oh yeah that destiny had been very popular with like reactionary

1626
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:42,820
types recently yeah it makes makes sense um man what's what's the point i mean i'm okay this the

1627
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:52,900
scandals of andrew tate uh roblox degenerates tarik nashid who who gives a shit man i i don't

1628
02:44:52,900 --> 02:45:00,740
care i don't like i don't like what i'm seeing um the disappearance of animated james how he makes

1629
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:10,820
so many of these they must be terrible because he makes so many they must be awful yeah i mean

1630
02:45:12,340 --> 02:45:18,340
it's it's one of those things where he pumps out like an hour long video of week they can't possibly

1631
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:26,980
be good i'm not i think there's something with like the subject matter being so negative like

1632
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:33,860
exposing a terrible horrible thing and that's all the content creator does put a soyjack on a

1633
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:39,300
roblox and then i'll talk about a bunch of how people oh really are people on roblox cringe

1634
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:45,380
are there like pedophiles playing this children's game oh i can't tell me more educate me i mean

1635
02:45:45,380 --> 02:45:50,660
people tell me about the pedophiles there's there's there's another channel that i've seen that is

1636
02:45:51,060 --> 02:45:58,180
so like overtly like negative like this just sort of focusing on like the worst things ever

1637
02:45:58,820 --> 02:46:03,220
and that's all they make it's just like exposing this and exposing that and i'm like

1638
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:12,420
sure you know exposing exposing things is like a good thing to do i guess but if it's your entire

1639
02:46:12,420 --> 02:46:18,340
brand and i just i'm just sort of put off hanging around there i don't like it

1640
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:24,340
yeah this is a whole this is a whole type of channel

1641
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:33,060

1655
02:48:10,740 --> 02:48:17,140
yep just push it i

1656
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:24,580
next one is called winging about a oh my god

1657
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:30,580
there's three emails and they're all over a minute long or voicemails

1658
02:48:32,020 --> 02:48:35,860
all right winging about a ir at part one three two one go

1659
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:43,860
well it's already monday so i'm definitely missing the next episode recording uh which

1660
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:49,780
has already happened by now but i just want to weigh in anyways on the whole a i art business

1661
02:48:49,780 --> 02:48:57,380
because the whole thing annoys me in general far too much to not open my big mouth so first of all

1662
02:48:57,620 --> 02:49:08,020
um it is not actually i think the main issue uh that a i art is plagiarism because that only invites

1663
02:49:08,020 --> 02:49:16,580
the counterargument like ben kind of uh intimated that um well artists also copy each other's styles

1664
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:22,820
and if an ai is just doing it more efficiently then that is not really um plagiarism that is simply

1665
02:49:22,820 --> 02:49:28,740
well you know the artistic process as much as you can argue about whether or not that's true

1666
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:37,300
like psychologically the real point is that it is wage theft and labor exploitation like a capitalist

1667
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:45,540
factory owner who uses his laborers labor and the value that it generates in order to buy machines

1668
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:51,780
that put them out of work the same shit happens to artists whose art is literally used to put them

1669
02:49:51,780 --> 02:50:06,580
out of work well yeah okay should i listen to part two yeah i i just think that like i agree with

1670
02:50:06,580 --> 02:50:11,540
this guy like it is wage theft i guess that's what i meant really when i meant plagiarism

1671
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:17,220
like like the the problem with the plagiarism is that the artist will get less work because of a

1672
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:25,220
machine the the problem is not trained to to come like to do their art can maybe make them lose work

1673
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:30,260
and they didn't get the the permission to take that art and put it in the machine

1674
02:50:31,940 --> 02:50:39,220
yeah it's the the problem is not simply that it can well i'm not sure if this is even true but

1675
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:46,740
if even if it were true that like the ai could just produce a better product than a human for less

1676
02:50:46,740 --> 02:50:53,780
money like that in and of itself would not be the problem uh the problem would be that it's doing it

1677
02:50:54,820 --> 02:51:00,820
yeah that it's doing it in a way that is uh it's basically stealing value from human artists

1678
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:05,220
that created the the the work in the first place okay anyway part two three two one go

1679
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:13,300
and then secondly uh as much as i agree with ben about the the idea that if something simply

1680
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:20,660
becomes easier for people to do be it creative or otherwise productive that that's a good thing

1681
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:30,660
in principle as much as i agree with that i do not think that ai quote unquote art is the actual

1682
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:37,540
answer to that or is actually a good development because of that the reason being that ai art

1683
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:45,140
eliminates like the most vital aspect of the artistic process and of what makes art valuable

1684
02:51:45,140 --> 02:51:52,980
in my eyes which is not in fact that it takes struggle or strife or pain uh and time to create it

1685
02:51:52,980 --> 02:52:00,500
but rather that it is created through an intentional process you know through both mental and physical

1686
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:10,900
faculties that you know actually gives rise to a person's lived experience in a very tangible

1687
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:16,340
and physical way that you can trace back to how they did it and appreciate that that's just

1688
02:52:16,340 --> 02:52:22,500
impossible with ai art it makes art into just product and it's shit it's garbage and i hate

1689
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:27,300
sorry i agree again

1690
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:36,420
um i remember the problem you had with like the show and tweet that it was like in your eyes um

1691
02:52:37,940 --> 02:52:49,300
uh glorifying hard labor for its own sake yeah and yeah i i think i think i think i was basically

1692
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:56,980
saying the thing i said before that like the artistic process is valuable um in and of itself

1693
02:52:57,780 --> 02:53:04,500
the end product is like one thing but like making it is valuable for the person doing it and

1694
02:53:05,300 --> 02:53:15,380
in context of viewing it no wrong i don't agree at the end of the day product is all is all that's

1695
02:53:15,380 --> 02:53:21,780
left uh all all that is all that occurs as a result of the artistic process is a product

1696
02:53:21,780 --> 02:53:28,020
and anything else that you think about it when you look at it is just is just uh is just fan fiction

1697
02:53:29,940 --> 02:53:39,140
yeah but like like but like if it is fan fiction in the sense that like once the art is made

1698
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:48,580
um you as the audience sort of create meaning from it however you interpret it yeah and i think

1699
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:54,100
knowing that an art was made by a real person with purpose changes the context of how you

1700
02:53:54,100 --> 02:53:59,220
interpret it so it's valuable in that way it's at least at the very least variety because if

1701
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:06,660
everything is made by computer you're like ah like you i think you would really just stop

1702
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:12,340
feeling anything because you you can't relate to any person or any experience you just know

1703
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:19,860
that a computer squished it together and maybe you like the look of it i think i see what you're

1704
02:54:19,860 --> 02:54:29,300
saying but i don't know imagine if you had like two identical paintings and one had been done

1705
02:54:29,300 --> 02:54:36,420
by an ai and one had been done by a human why why would why would the one done by the human

1706
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:42,820
be better just because you know that a human did it i don't even think it's about better

1707
02:54:42,820 --> 02:54:49,940
i think it's just about variety i i think i i would rather live in a world where i can get

1708
02:54:49,940 --> 02:54:55,940
lots of different things from art rather than what ai essentially does which is like

1709
02:54:56,900 --> 02:55:03,380
like builds various like samey things or like weirdo things i like ai art that's like insane

1710
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:09,380
that nobody would ever make because the computer doesn't know what is like expected of it i saw

1711
02:55:09,380 --> 02:55:15,220
i saw i saw a tweet this week that was like oh ai art doesn't understand doesn't understand

1712
02:55:15,220 --> 02:55:23,380
ramen did you see happen to see this tweet no well it was um it was four ai images and they

1713
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:29,540
were things like the girl it was an anime girl eating ramen and in one like she was like eating

1714
02:55:29,540 --> 02:55:34,260
it with her hands like her she was grabbing noodles out of the bowl with her hands and in other ones

1715
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:38,980
like her fingers like became the chopsticks that she was eating the noodles with and in other

1716
02:55:38,980 --> 02:55:42,580
ones like there were too many chopsticks like there were like four there was like a whole

1717
02:55:42,580 --> 02:55:47,940
like cluster of chopsticks in the hand that sort of became the noodles and then the fourth one

1718
02:55:47,940 --> 02:55:54,900
was a girl's like head in the noodle bowl and like her hair was the noodles and that was awesome

1719
02:55:54,900 --> 02:56:02,340
it looked so cool yeah it was great oh i i don't i don't ascribe like ai art equals bad stuff

1720
02:56:02,340 --> 02:56:14,900
it's it's merely the um i i i want like real art to continue to exist and in some ways this could

1721
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:21,860
push artists away from you know being able to to live off their work and so less of it might exist

1722
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:26,740
it's a lot of hypotheticals it just sort of it it it and creates a lot of like

1723
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:33,620
like like this shitty future in my head okay but what's shitty about it

1724
02:56:34,980 --> 02:56:40,660
because it's all it would be all the same at some point well that just seems like a

1725
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:46,580
that's sort of like a that's just a technical concern like what okay well what well what if

1726
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:51,700
ai art were more advanced and it could create stuff that didn't all look the same which it

1727
02:56:51,700 --> 02:57:00,340
kind of it kind of already does i think um since ultimately i'm the one who decides how i feel

1728
02:57:00,340 --> 02:57:06,820
about something you would need to change my mind about how ai art appears to me for me to like

1729
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:15,940
like be okay with a world exclusively of ai art that can completely like um like replace all human

1730
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:22,820
art okay but who i who is the sort of thing who is saying that ai art should completely replace

1731
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:29,780
human art no one but like that's the sort of thing that makes me dislike ai art on a like an

1732
02:57:29,780 --> 02:57:35,940
emotional visceral level i see things that are cool and then i see things that are like this is

1733
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:42,340
not weird and wacky and ai aesthetic it's sort of like this looks like some human drew it like

1734
02:57:42,340 --> 02:57:46,260
a really good human artist even though their hands a bit fucked up but it's like i could see i've

1735
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:52,180
seen paintings and drawings by people that look like this because they purposely made a thing

1736
02:57:52,180 --> 02:57:57,700
and now the ai art is so good at recreating human art that it doesn't have its own like flavor

1737
02:57:57,700 --> 02:58:03,860
anymore it's just sort of like doing human art instead of humans doing it and so i extrapolate

1738
02:58:03,940 --> 02:58:09,540
that idea further and it's like well what if all humans are pushed out of art somehow

1739
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:17,540
i don't like that it just sort of they won't be i mean they won't be but why are you so sure they

1740
02:58:17,540 --> 02:58:27,780
won't be why why would they be i don't i don't get it i forget the point that we were arguing ai can

1741
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:36,500
um i mean i mean look at what it's doing okay it can't like it can't but you you were the one

1742
02:58:36,500 --> 02:58:40,900
you said okay you're using you're using two you're using two separate arguments that are like

1743
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:46,980
completely at cross purposes with each other on the one hand you're saying that ai art can't be

1744
02:58:46,980 --> 02:58:53,140
like human art because it lacks ideas and it's not original but on the other hand you're saying

1745
02:58:53,140 --> 02:58:58,260
but it would be bad it's bad ai bad because what if it replaces all human art but like

1746
02:58:58,260 --> 02:59:05,060
if one is true then the other can't be true i don't get it i don't know what you mean if ai

1747
02:59:05,060 --> 02:59:11,220
art does not replicate the kinds of creativity that human art is capable of then it's like

1748
02:59:12,020 --> 02:59:20,260
it will then then it will never replace human artists yeah but like i'm also saying that

1749
02:59:21,220 --> 02:59:26,820
the knowing that something is made by a computer changes how i feel about it

1750
02:59:28,340 --> 02:59:35,940
i mean i get that hypothetically if if all ai art um does replace human art like in

1751
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:40,820
terms of quality or whatever you want a metric knowing that it's made by computer i will feel

1752
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:50,260
bad there's it's just an emotional response when i hear that i think oh so you would be okay

1753
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:56,020
with living in a future where all ai art where all art was generated by computers but they just

1754
02:59:56,020 --> 03:00:02,580
didn't tell you that that was true uh i guess hypothetically that could already be the case

1755
03:00:02,580 --> 03:00:11,300
so yeah right if i didn't know um it's like oh we're living in a simulation but nobody

1756
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:15,380
you there's no proof you'll never find proof is like oh i guess i wouldn't feel any different

1757
03:00:15,380 --> 03:00:26,500
because i it could already be the case okay i mean yeah okay all right that's fair um i just i just

1758
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:37,060
don't see it i just don't see my general point i don't i don't really see it replacing traditional

1759
03:00:37,060 --> 03:00:42,900
art sure yeah yeah i i don't i would want to live in a world where

1760
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:51,860
uh there's not like this there's multiple like conclusion like like main points and i'm not really

1761
03:00:51,940 --> 03:00:58,420
like making anyone at the say at the at this like there's the there's the capitalism problem

1762
03:00:58,420 --> 03:01:04,100
people losing work that upsets me just generally i don't like the fact that some artists could

1763
03:01:04,100 --> 03:01:10,420
have their work wage stolen like their their labor taken without their consent put into a

1764
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:15,700
machine and then the machine makes art that looks like their stuff that the machine operator or

1765
03:01:15,700 --> 03:01:21,380
whatever can profit from i or just or just like real lower the amount of profit that the artist

1766
03:01:21,380 --> 03:01:26,900
could make off of that same style that's one thing uh the other thing about like all i ai art

1767
03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:32,100
replacing human art is more of like a an existential sort of emotional response which is not really

1768
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:40,660
related and then uh then the other thing is that i prefer i prefer ai art that looks like

1769
03:01:40,660 --> 03:01:46,820
a weird dream nightmare and i don't like ai art when it's just normal i prefer it when it's

1770
03:01:46,820 --> 03:01:52,660
fucked up because that's funny and cool yeah this girl's head in the ramen bowl you know i mean

1771
03:01:52,660 --> 03:01:56,980
i think a human could have drawn a human could have drawn something like this yeah you would just

1772
03:01:56,980 --> 03:02:03,780
never think to i mean they could but you know in this case you in this case an ai came up with it

1773
03:02:03,780 --> 03:02:10,180
and like you know good good for good for them good for the the ai i guess i like it um the labor

1774
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:19,380
argument i mean yeah it's bad when people lose work but to me the like oh ai will cost artists

1775
03:02:19,380 --> 03:02:23,700
their jobs argument is an art is an argument against capitalism more than it's an argument

1776
03:02:23,700 --> 03:02:33,060
against ai in my opinion sure um as there are some people who wouldn't understand that but i

1777
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:39,300
definitely understand it's an anti-capitalism position as as for it yeah as for it replacing

1778
03:02:40,420 --> 03:02:49,780
like as for ai art like becoming the norm it's i just don't i mean in i think it might

1779
03:02:49,780 --> 03:02:57,380
in certain applications where we like wouldn't notice the difference and if we don't notice the

1780
03:02:57,380 --> 03:03:03,780
difference then like i guess who cares i mean the line has been blurred in certain fields already

1781
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:10,980
like textures in in like video game development yeah it used to be like photographs that you

1782
03:03:10,980 --> 03:03:19,620
would edit now like you can kind of just ai generate based on like a bunch of inputs google

1783
03:03:19,620 --> 03:03:24,900
images and then you can come up with things like that like simple things that you're not supposed

1784
03:03:24,900 --> 03:03:32,980
to look right at but they they're they're they're ways of like skipping ahead um in the process of

1785
03:03:32,980 --> 03:03:41,540
building something different or like uh you know you need a pose for a thing and you you want to

1786
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:45,940
you get some inspiration you want to get some inspiration and you want the ai to generate some

1787
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:52,100
like prototypes of a general like description instead of drawing them all yourself so the line

1788
03:03:52,100 --> 03:04:01,220
has been blurred already it's i don't know yeah yeah uh okay i think there's a there's a third part

1789
03:04:01,220 --> 03:04:05,620
so let's just let me just listen to the third part three two one go

1790
03:04:16,500 --> 03:04:21,220
okay i said i was gonna shut up but i thought of one more thing that might be important to say

1791
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:29,220
before uh that has to be explained by other people so yes of course you can use ai uh

1792
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:36,580
quote-unquote artists in a like not morally wrong full way like of course that's possible it's

1793
03:04:36,580 --> 03:04:43,220
possible with any technology but like that does involve like deeply changing both how it's how

1794
03:04:43,220 --> 03:04:51,620
like the ai works and is like made and how it is like employed so like of course like give kind

1795
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:57,540
of mentions in this episode like you can use it for ideation you can use it for just like spitball

1796
03:04:57,540 --> 03:05:02,580
and ideas and then just making your own thing based on that uh you can just use it for that which is

1797
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:12,020
fine and you can uh use it for like uh background purposes you know you can use it for at least

1798
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:19,140
producing art when you really only mean to create a product i guess uh but then it's still a question

1799
03:05:19,140 --> 03:05:26,740
of first uh addressing the whole database issue and the issue of what data what art goes into it and

1800
03:05:26,740 --> 03:05:32,580
whether or not yeah i mean i agree with the and it's just morally dubious to try an art like the

1801
03:05:32,580 --> 03:05:40,340
art of consenting artists professional artists who's you know the intellectual property is being uh

1802
03:05:40,420 --> 03:05:48,260
robbed did you see there was like a different stable diffusion but from music but they they

1803
03:05:48,900 --> 03:05:52,180
they explicitly said we're not going to put copyrighted tracks in there because we don't

1804
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:58,420
want the legal trouble which just goes to show that the music industry has ways of protecting

1805
03:05:58,420 --> 03:06:04,660
their artists but the art industry does not and so they feel totally fine with stealing art from

1806
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:12,180
every artist who posts their stuff online but um they're scared legally of of what the music industry

1807
03:06:12,180 --> 03:06:19,380
could do to them so it's like very obviously a problem there yeah that that does speak to like

1808
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:26,900
the fact that one is like more regulated than the other uh for sure hmm that's interesting

1809
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:34,980
i forget the name it was like stable dance or something i didn't i did not see that but uh

1810
03:06:37,460 --> 03:06:43,780
should we should we have a i mean

1811
03:06:47,860 --> 03:06:54,820
okay but i mean i those are is that what are they gonna put like you know un unlicensed like sound

1812
03:06:54,900 --> 03:07:00,500
like random sound cloud musicians in there like who's probably whose music are they gonna put in

1813
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:05,620
there that that's the thing it's like you know they're still they're still gonna steal the music

1814
03:07:05,620 --> 03:07:10,580
just not from anyone who can do anything about it that's like oh that's the track that fucking

1815
03:07:11,380 --> 03:07:16,340
i don't know who's a big studio atlantic records is the first thing comes to my head like oh they

1816
03:07:16,340 --> 03:07:20,660
take a fucking led zeppelin song put it in there and make something that sounds like led zeppelin

1817
03:07:21,220 --> 03:07:28,900
the lawyers involved will destroy the ai um company they'll be killed they'll be murdered

1818
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:38,580
in their sleep can't do that hmm i mean i guess a similar thing would happen if like

1819
03:07:39,380 --> 03:07:46,500
an ai started producing images that like were provably derivative of like i don't know

1820
03:07:47,300 --> 03:07:53,700
dc comics image stuff i guess or if it like

1821
03:07:56,340 --> 03:08:01,060
made jokes in the style of saturday night live or something

1822
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:10,740
we made an ai to steal jokes i saw a thread this is off topic but i saw a thread of um

1823
03:08:11,380 --> 03:08:14,980
it was from that twitter account called like weird medieval guys

1824
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:26,740
yeah uh i saw a thread of like medieval jokes they sucked they were bad they had bad jokes back

1825
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:36,820
then all of the jokes were like the punchline is like oh the priest had sex or like oh this woman

1826
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:46,020
her husband had anal sex with her or like none of them none of them had like a punchline that was

1827
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:52,260
like a subversion of expectations that was like set up in the joke all of their all of them had

1828
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:58,820
a punchline that was like it was it was it was a merely a subversion of like social convention

1829
03:08:58,820 --> 03:09:05,140
like one of the jokes was literally like a guy said like oh i'm going down to the whorehouse and

1830
03:09:05,220 --> 03:09:10,180
the other one was like oh say hi to your mom for me and like that was literally the joke

1831
03:09:13,380 --> 03:09:16,820
that was a good one trap good good one you got him

1832
03:09:20,740 --> 03:09:27,620
they talked funny back then how could you how could you definitely like explain that joke like as a

1833
03:09:27,620 --> 03:09:34,900
quip it was so wordy how could you do how could you do that joke in real time yeah well i mean

1834
03:09:34,900 --> 03:09:44,820
these were um these were trans translations into modern english uh yeah fucking um i mean here's

1835
03:09:44,820 --> 03:09:51,380
the thread here's here's the here's the thread and there's a bunch of um jokes or length here

1836
03:09:52,180 --> 03:09:59,940
let me read a piece of this shitty stupid this this is a joke a young florentine was going down

1837
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:06,500
to river arno with one of those nets in which they wash wool and metafrolics and boy who out of fun

1838
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:11,860
asked him what birds he was going to catch with that net of his i am going to the brothel's outlet

1839
03:10:11,860 --> 03:10:18,020
replied the youth to spread my net there and catch your mother mind you search the place carefully

as a reference to mario paint cool cool uh next one is called is your stuff cool three two one go

1899
03:17:52,420 --> 03:17:58,340
you know it's a much better cancel culture just never use twitter and if you ever meet someone

1900
03:17:58,340 --> 03:18:03,860
who uses twitter cut them out of your life it's so much more fun cancelled culture than being on

1901
03:18:03,860 --> 03:18:10,420
twitter all the time i'll be a much more interesting person i came i i i actually was like seriously

1902
03:18:10,420 --> 03:18:14,900
considering like do i want to just delete my twitter account this week i really was thinking

1903
03:18:14,900 --> 03:18:18,820
like i kind of think that twitter just makes me a worse person and it makes everyone a worse person

1904
03:18:18,820 --> 03:18:26,500
and uh i i think i'd be better off without it true so i agree it is it is a dangerous drug

1905
03:18:27,220 --> 03:18:31,940
yeah it's not it's when it when it when you get on the wrong side of it and you use it

1906
03:18:33,140 --> 03:18:39,620
in the way that like just makes you mad all the time i mean yeah the the stand the standard

1907
03:18:39,620 --> 03:18:45,060
response of using twitter is just being mad all the time so that's great and then i mean

1908
03:18:45,860 --> 03:18:52,020
worst case scenario i saw someone made a tweet that was like uh twitter twitter is like when you

1909
03:18:52,020 --> 03:18:58,340
post a take on twitter it's like you're pulling a slot machine but you can only lose like the only

1910
03:18:58,340 --> 03:19:08,500
jackpot you can win is like everyone hates you uh so yeah next one's called wakame three two one go

1911
03:19:10,900 --> 03:19:17,300
what's your opinion on portal it's the best video game of all time in my opinion however i think

1912
03:19:17,300 --> 03:19:26,100
portal two sucks um this is like a conversation that's been had on the pcp before probably remember

1913
03:19:26,100 --> 03:19:33,380
portal two is fine there's some sort of discourse around like how portal two is oh was this the one

1914
03:19:33,380 --> 03:19:37,460
where we talked about like the original and how i said the original is better just by virtue of being

1915
03:19:37,460 --> 03:19:45,380
the original yeah something like that because it's yeah i still feel that way uh i like portal one

1916
03:19:45,380 --> 03:19:50,900
i think i i think i appreciate portal two just because it's more fun puzzles and i like puzzles

1917
03:19:52,340 --> 03:19:58,260
yeah i mean i think most of what's good about portal two is the same stuff that's good about

1918
03:19:58,260 --> 03:20:04,660
portal one uh like the the the new mechanics they added are are fine and and good and all

1919
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:10,260
um but i don't really think they like improved that much on like the core formula of it

1920
03:20:10,980 --> 03:20:18,020
it's basically just more portal one so i wouldn't say that portal two sucks i don't think it sucks

1921
03:20:18,580 --> 03:20:25,620
it's fine nah um bands we clear reminder play delta room chapter two okay bands we clear reminder

1922
03:20:25,620 --> 03:20:30,500
catch up to one piece okay at this point they're not reminding you they're just sort of like

1923
03:20:31,540 --> 03:20:37,300
you don't even really think oh yeah i should do that you just see you see this again you're like

1924
03:20:37,300 --> 03:20:44,740
okay isn't uh isn't delta room chapter three out or am i crazy no not yet oh being worked on but

1925
03:20:44,740 --> 03:20:48,420
i don't know when it's coming out okay okay um

1926
03:20:52,180 --> 03:20:57,700
i will i will do both of these things at some point i promise you that much it will probably

1927
03:20:57,700 --> 03:21:03,620
not have anything to do with how often i'm reminded in the voicemails but i mean whatever

1928
03:21:04,420 --> 03:21:08,100
next one is called bayonetta three voice actors update three two one go

1929
03:21:09,780 --> 03:21:15,300
yeah i just you probably already know this but um with the bayonetta three voice actors

1930
03:21:15,300 --> 03:21:23,140
shit like it's sort of it sort of looks like she lied and shit and instead of being paid just four

1931
03:21:23,140 --> 03:21:30,820
thousand dollars flat it looks more like she wanted to be she was offered to be paid god damn it four

1932
03:21:30,820 --> 03:21:36,340
thousand dollars per session which looks to be about three to four to five different sessions

1933
03:21:36,340 --> 03:21:43,460
which comes out to a lot of money and that the actually the actual voice actors wanted uh around

1934
03:21:43,460 --> 03:21:50,900
six figures uh just for paying that and um so it so it looks like she was a little bit facetious

1935
03:21:50,900 --> 03:21:56,260
about that you probably already know this i just want to let you know um yeah and like in hindsight

1936
03:21:56,260 --> 03:22:01,140
thank you very much like you don't just get what jennifer hail is the actress for placing her in

1937
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:06,100
spainetta you don't just sort of just come across jennifer hail money if you're not willing to pay

1938
03:22:06,100 --> 03:22:12,100
someone four thousand dollars flat so it looks like she actually is just being facetious not to

1939
03:22:12,100 --> 03:22:18,420
mention that uh i don't remember her name but facetious actresses like a total like huge turf

1940
03:22:18,420 --> 03:22:25,540
and like a like a thin blue lion type of deal um or something like that so yeah it seems like she was

1941
03:22:25,620 --> 03:22:31,700
sort of sort of lying about that trying to trying to use the fans saying to boycott the game even

1942
03:22:31,700 --> 03:22:36,900
though it was all bullshit anyway i'm gonna go jerk off to uh the last was part two uh sex scenes

1943
03:22:37,620 --> 03:22:46,660
so bye all right good boy smell um uh i did not hear about the like that she may have lied about

1944
03:22:46,660 --> 03:22:55,780
the number i did hear that she's a turf uh fuck it yeah i don't know i mean i just fuck it i mean

1945
03:22:55,780 --> 03:23:02,180
i'm not i'm she did ask the six figures you know what based um the everything after that is not based

1946
03:23:02,180 --> 03:23:06,740
yeah i mean uh people should be paid for their work that's good people should not be turf said

1947
03:23:06,740 --> 03:23:14,020
should not be thin blue line that's bad however those are two separate issues but uh yeah i don't

1948
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:20,420
know i don't really care about bayonetta honestly uh so i don't give a shit about any of it

1949
03:23:21,060 --> 03:23:28,020
other than in general i think work should be compensated uh whatever fuck it not interested

1950
03:23:28,020 --> 03:23:34,100

03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:23,860
minute on page four we're coming out of the main terminal but it's spelled like main the state

1981
03:27:24,420 --> 03:27:31,460
i don't know if that's intentional or not that's probably intentional it's pretty hard to misspell

1982
03:27:31,460 --> 03:27:42,020
main yeah i would think so um hell yeah i remember yeah error rari's voicemails they had

1983
03:27:42,020 --> 03:27:47,220
some of like weird characters with weird voices and the little bug thing is saying an autotuned

1984
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:53,780
lol because of the weird voice oh yeah i genuinely can't remember the storyline

1985
03:27:54,500 --> 03:28:01,380
i was beware the bear was that how it started yeah i and then it evolved into like

1986
03:28:02,100 --> 03:28:09,700
some incomprehensible saga carriage i think there were piggies involved yeah probably i remember

1987
03:28:10,180 --> 03:28:17,540
all the details it's hard to remember all the details though uh okay well good good stuff good

1988
03:28:17,540 --> 03:28:28,500
stuff uh next voicemail is ben gibb name your favorite clown have cheesy judge you i couldn't

1989
03:28:28,500 --> 03:28:36,820
name any clowns for you it's when it comes to clowns i really know like i know of some there

1990
03:28:37,300 --> 03:28:43,700
was a very there was a pretty there was kind of a there was kind of a hot uh uh only fans clown girl

1991
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:51,380
on twitter called bouncy clown so i guess i like her i feel like that big boobs i feel like that's

1992
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:58,100
like but she's not a real clown she didn't go to clown code she's just she's just she's just pretending

1993
03:28:58,100 --> 03:29:02,340
to be a clown she just put on the makeup she's she's just wearing clown face she's just wearing

1994
03:29:02,340 --> 03:29:09,860
clown face and it's offensive like when i think of clowns in media i'm thinking of like characters

1995
03:29:09,860 --> 03:29:17,140
from stuff rather than like personas online and i'm remembering like that weird clown in the dream

1996
03:29:17,140 --> 03:29:23,300
in the brave little toaster movie but he's creepy and he's ugly and i don't like him so i don't know

1997
03:29:23,300 --> 03:29:32,420
if i have a favorite clown the best clown is oh wait gamsy but he's a juggalo there's not really

1998
03:29:32,420 --> 03:29:41,060
a clown i feel like juggalo's i feel like it counts quackered quacker jack from dark wing duck

1999
03:29:41,060 --> 03:29:45,940
obviously quacker jack from dark wing duck is the best i guess he's more of a jester are jester's

2000
03:29:45,940 --> 03:29:54,260
clowns does the joker count as a clown i feel like yeah i feel like yeah the joker is a clown

2001
03:29:54,900 --> 03:30:02,180
joker is pretty good um what other what other clowns what other clowns um

2002
03:30:03,460 --> 03:30:10,180
there's the clown from steven king's it which i haven't seen oh you oh you mean it

2003
03:30:11,060 --> 03:30:20,020
oh you mean the titular it yes it no his name is penny wise penis wise yeah um

2004
03:30:25,860 --> 03:30:35,300
that's it that's all i got quacker jack wait um uh z from cycloneals she's pretty good

2005
03:30:35,540 --> 03:30:40,100
clown oh yeah there's a lot in cyclone there's a lot of good clown designs in cycloneals

2006
03:30:40,100 --> 03:30:45,780
this is my favorite clown in cycloneals i like the one lady it would probably be z honestly

2007
03:30:45,780 --> 03:30:51,380
i like z's clown face yeah it's pretty pretty edgy pretty cool but there are a lot of like

2008
03:30:51,380 --> 03:30:58,580
background clowns i like dance that's that's all right that's a good one yeah i could probably go

2009
03:30:58,580 --> 03:31:07,220
through and pick out some good ones if i wanted to but i don't uh cycloneals is pretty high-grade

2010
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:16,020
clown media i i feel like i feel like cycloneals deserve more attention than it got i feel like

2011
03:31:16,020 --> 03:31:22,980
it got like no fanfare at all and i feel like it deserved at least a little bit yeah it was it

2012
03:31:22,980 --> 03:31:32,500
was not bad it was i think just people assumed bad things for some reason yeah the the the the

2013
03:31:32,500 --> 03:31:38,500
disc the homestuck discourse has turned decidedly negative these days maybe that's just in the circles

2014
03:31:38,500 --> 03:31:45,860
that i'm in like i know i follow the i follow the homestuck hashtag on twitter like you know when

2015
03:31:45,860 --> 03:31:51,700
it says like um when they do like uh here's a topic you might be interested in you can click x

2016
03:31:51,700 --> 03:31:55,540
so just like okay we won't do it anymore i always click on a homestuck one because i want the

2017
03:31:55,540 --> 03:32:02,420
algorithm to show me pictures of homestuck as often as possible so i see fan art a lot

2018
03:32:02,420 --> 03:32:07,620
and fan trolls and stuff sometimes is brisker and that's great you know what i did that i did that

2019
03:32:07,620 --> 03:32:13,380
for mega man actually yeah i i got recommended a mega man tweet and i clicked like yes continue

2020
03:32:13,380 --> 03:32:18,660
to show me mega man stuff and i've been seeing mega man stuff so i mean i guess the system works

2021
03:32:19,540 --> 03:32:28,500
um yeah uh all the like youtubers that i'm aware of have nothing nice to say about homestuck and

2022
03:32:28,500 --> 03:32:35,060
like you know good for them i guess i don't know it's my favorite yeah i'll just keep saying that

2023
03:32:35,060 --> 03:32:40,900
because it's true it didn't change it's still the same comic i would i would i would i guess i would

2024
03:32:40,900 --> 03:32:47,460
consider myself kind of a homestuck defender even though i am like very much willing to admit that

2025
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:53,700
like actually most of homestuck is bad objectively it's funny because like that was always the line

2026
03:32:53,700 --> 03:32:58,420
it was just sort of like you know homestuck's trash right and the homestuck fans like yeah

2027
03:32:58,420 --> 03:33:03,700
and they continue to enjoy it that was always like the the funny like thing you would say yeah

2028
03:33:04,420 --> 03:33:12,820
like i love my trash comic um well now i mean now that it's done we can look back and be like

2029
03:33:13,540 --> 03:33:17,620
yes in hindsight most of it sucks

2030
03:33:21,300 --> 03:33:25,540
sad but true um but it's still what's good what's good there is really good and worth

2031
03:33:27,380 --> 03:33:35,620
deserves respect um next one is an image let's let's look at it shall we

2032
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:42,740
what is what is going on it's the pcp and there's mage in the middle

2033
03:33:44,660 --> 03:33:52,020
and mage is a huge brain and we are all huge brain we're all fucking around

2034
03:33:53,220 --> 03:33:58,500
and we're all dumb except for mage i guess that's me with the sonichu medallion

2035
03:33:59,060 --> 03:34:05,540
and the twitter and the patreon in your head oh it's all of us as um you know like the like no brain

2036
03:34:06,180 --> 03:34:08,420
soy no brain yeah yeah

2037
03:34:12,420 --> 03:34:19,620
i like that i'm the the one with the long neck you know that one and i gotta like i've got a

2038
03:34:19,700 --> 03:34:27,540
punk ducky oh oh yes the the long neck and the like gross like adam's apple

2039
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:33,540
yeah yeah okay i you can't really tell because like your ducky is like covering up

2040
03:34:34,900 --> 03:34:39,860
the neck but yeah i see it i thought the neck was going around maybe it's my arm

2041
03:34:42,100 --> 03:34:49,300
yeah it reads as an arm holding it to me i guess i'll post this here in chat i wonder if this guy

2042
03:34:49,300 --> 03:34:56,900
knows that that mage drew uh like i asked mage to draw a riska a not a riska a a punk ducky image

2043
03:34:58,020 --> 03:35:05,140
he did yeah we never made it into a pillow though for some reason it was something i think something

2044
03:35:05,140 --> 03:35:11,300
would like i was there was a time when like this company was saying oh do a small video and we'll

2045
03:35:11,300 --> 03:35:18,180
give you a free uh thing ducky macro i'm like hey free shit and that's cool i never had a ducky macro

2046
03:35:18,180 --> 03:35:24,100
before so i got a couple from that and i wanted to do another one i wanted to do a custom one with

2047
03:35:24,100 --> 03:35:30,260
punk but then that they didn't respond to that one even though they did the same thing like i will do

2048
03:35:30,260 --> 03:35:38,260
a video and uh and you can have the the thing they just never sent the the part of the punk one

2049
03:35:39,060 --> 03:35:42,500
so mage drew that and i still have it but never turned into a pillow

2050
03:35:43,060 --> 03:35:50,500
hmm is is that digi as the bong why why does it have blue hair

2051
03:35:51,780 --> 03:35:59,780
does she have blue hair no well let's see there's not like that kind of blue ever

2052
03:35:59,780 --> 03:36:06,660
there's cult corona there's tom there's nate there's devu on her head i i nate nate torso

2053
03:36:06,660 --> 03:36:11,460
head is great it's actually like very very good i think that's probably the best one although i

2054
03:36:11,540 --> 03:36:16,820
i like munchies face munchies like screaming oh that's munchie yeah i think so

2055
03:36:19,380 --> 03:36:26,740
so silly these are good these are these are good i've never seen the the soy jacks that some of

2056
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:35,380
these are based on but like it seems like they mostly are well i don't know i like it it's good

2057
03:36:35,380 --> 03:36:44,420
and i appreciate it let's move on to the next uh voicemail there's another image yeah hey hey

2058
03:36:44,420 --> 03:36:50,500
apple bloom going to the city that's fine just remember what granny said about them crime rates

2059
03:36:50,500 --> 03:36:59,700
never relax sis i get it racism racism racism big city racism

2060
03:37:00,020 --> 03:37:08,660
apple bloom remember we in the apple family are alpha males we're scared of big cities

2061
03:37:10,260 --> 03:37:18,260
won't even drive through them anymore crime rates are too high and so are taxes uh

2062
03:37:20,260 --> 03:37:25,140
next one last one is called we was poke tubers three two one go

2063
03:37:25,700 --> 03:37:34,740
hello ptp i was wondering do you think that pokemon scarlet and bile are gonna be good

2064
03:37:35,300 --> 03:37:40,900
no you think they're gonna be bad yes i was just thinking about how with the regional forms of

2065
03:37:40,900 --> 03:37:45,860
pokemon they never made one into a bug a type you know and i guess that kind of makes sense because

2066
03:37:45,860 --> 03:37:52,580
you can't like change the biology of something above why not but yeah why but now they're not

2067
03:37:52,660 --> 03:37:57,620
doing regional forms anymore they're they're doing two things one is they're doing like

2068
03:37:57,620 --> 03:38:03,380
if you if you saw wiggler no wiggle it wiggle it it's not diglett it just looks like daily but

2069
03:38:03,380 --> 03:38:08,260
it's an eel because you can't evolve into an eel from a mole and now they're gonna do that with

2070
03:38:08,260 --> 03:38:13,380
tentacle i to mark my fucking words they're gonna make tentacle into a bug type and it's not gonna

2071
03:38:13,380 --> 03:38:20,580
be tentacle it's gonna be some other shit um that's all i had to say i can't oh wait the other

2072
03:38:21,140 --> 03:38:27,060
the other thing they're doing is um future paradox and past paradox pokemon i'm gonna have i don't

2073
03:38:27,060 --> 03:38:31,460
know make of that way well um check out the pcp minecraft server that's all i wonder if i can

2074
03:38:31,460 --> 03:38:40,740
say it's got we got so much it it's really cool um come on down anyway have a nice day thank you i

2075
03:38:40,740 --> 03:38:47,060
love you and why that is true there's a lot of cool shit on the minecraft sir i know i have i have

2076
03:38:47,060 --> 03:38:55,860
not been uh we we we would we've been saying we should do another stream soon yeah and we will

2077
03:38:55,860 --> 03:39:04,580
i just uh finished my super video um what is it what is it about tentacle they're gonna

2078
03:39:04,580 --> 03:39:13,700
release he thinks he thinks they're gonna turn tentacle into a bug because of wiggler because

2079
03:39:13,700 --> 03:39:19,700
why did i i didn't make him think that because wiggler is not an evolution of diglett it's just

2080
03:39:19,700 --> 03:39:25,620
a completely different pokemon i guess i mean i mean the regional variants have always been

2081
03:39:25,620 --> 03:39:33,540
that like role picks ice version you can't evolve into a nine tails fire version yeah like it's

2082
03:39:34,900 --> 03:39:41,140
yeah yeah yeah like it's um a regional variant basically is its own pokemon

2083
03:39:41,540 --> 03:39:48,420
in all ways that matter i guess i would like a new i would like a bug tentacle

2084
03:39:49,540 --> 03:39:55,140
tentacle and tentacle are really cool designs or at least tentacle is i don't i don't really

2085
03:39:55,140 --> 03:40:01,780
understand what the like evidence for that claim is but i'll assume that it makes sense uh

2086
03:40:05,060 --> 03:40:09,780
oh did you see uh they're they're doing um first of all the game will not be good they

2087
03:40:09,780 --> 03:40:15,140
don't make good pokemon games anymore they're they're against sure that goes without saying yeah um

2088
03:40:15,780 --> 03:40:20,900
they're doing a they're no you're your your player no longer has a gender you don't like

2089
03:40:20,900 --> 03:40:27,860
pick boy or girl you just have your avatar and you can dress them boy way or girl way or whatever

2090
03:40:27,860 --> 03:40:34,580
yes i like that it's cool i think that's good i think i mean honestly even even in a even a even

2091
03:40:34,580 --> 03:40:40,020
in a non woke way right i just think that makes sense because like you have something the same

2092
03:40:40,020 --> 03:40:45,860
fucking model no matter what the like the base the base model of your character doesn't look any different

2093
03:40:47,060 --> 03:40:53,220
like you could just take the same uh a 3d model character and just give it different eyes different

2094
03:40:53,220 --> 03:40:59,380
hair just makes sense it's just it's just more it's more a sensible design why why do you have to

2095
03:40:59,380 --> 03:41:03,860
pick one it's it's more you could literally just change its hairstyle and like the difference

2096
03:41:03,940 --> 03:41:10,500
it's it's like same difference i think i'm i haven't played a pokemon game in a long time but i'm

2097
03:41:10,500 --> 03:41:17,940
pretty sure when you like in x and y or any other 3d ones uh the model between male and female is

2098
03:41:17,940 --> 03:41:23,300
more than just hair and stuff like is there like there are like different leg shapes and

2099
03:41:23,300 --> 03:41:28,340
noticeable breasts on the female ones because they're not like children unless they are are you

2100
03:41:28,340 --> 03:41:33,060
are you but are you talking about like the player character when you when you choose one or the other

2101
03:41:33,060 --> 03:41:39,940
that like the female one looks more feminine on a structural way in the 3d one too but yeah i think

2102
03:41:39,940 --> 03:41:45,780
so okay that might be true that might be true but i'm remembering like x and y doesn't need to be

2103
03:41:45,780 --> 03:41:53,540
the case at all no it doesn't yeah it it i mean it'd be cool if you could like you could like

2104
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:59,620
change body parts as well but like that's a little too involved for a child's game i feel like you

2105
03:41:59,620 --> 03:42:05,140
could put um you would i don't think you'd need to change the the body i think you could just pick

2106
03:42:05,140 --> 03:42:09,780
different outfits and different outfits could just have different shapes that could sort of imply a

2107
03:42:09,780 --> 03:42:18,900
body shape underneath and like that would be basically the same so yeah to to to me yeah to

2108
03:42:18,900 --> 03:42:25,060
me it's just like it's just like cleaner design to just have a base character who is not you don't

2109
03:42:25,140 --> 03:42:31,220
have to like lock yourself into one of two sets you just have a base thing and you can just make

2110
03:42:31,220 --> 03:42:36,580
it you can just uh have it wear whatever you you want just makes more sense um

2111
03:42:38,900 --> 03:42:44,020
uh but the game will still be bad in spite of that so it doesn't matter

2112
03:42:44,660 --> 03:42:53,860
yeah um yeah i think that was the last voicemail well thank god all right

2113
03:42:55,540 --> 03:43:01,780
i got a little frustrated i got a little frustrated today i was a little bit mean to our

2114
03:43:01,780 --> 03:43:11,860
guest uh and you know what but he deserved it so it's fine um uh i'm i'm i'm uh i'm in a dark

2115
03:43:11,860 --> 03:43:18,180
place but it's okay uh uh once the video is done probably i'll feel better i'm in that i'm in that
