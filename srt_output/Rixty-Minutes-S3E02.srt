00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I don't give a fuck, bitch. Welcome to episode 2 of Rick's D Minutes, the show where we talk about each episode of Rick and Morty as it comes out.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We had our first episode of A Distant Pilot as it was with the show itself.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, right.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And now we're here. The show's actually airing. I'm joined by Best Guy Ever here.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, and I'm Digibro. This is, you know, it's not on my channel, so I should probably introduce myself as well.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh yeah, good idea.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, this is fucking episode 2 of season 3.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's finally here.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The fucking warm-awaited.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We've been waiting for it and now it's out and I watched it and it was good.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And they put it right on adultswim.com so everyone can watch it, which I really appreciate.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, that's really cool.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, it's great.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's great.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I watched all of season 1 the first time on adultswim.com, but I don't think they were doing them like simultaneous release before.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This, I don't know if this was simultaneous, but it's the next day and we watched it there, so that's pretty cool.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm fucking adultwim.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's the way to go.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Any what's up.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, pretty cool episode, I thought, to start with.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, you think so?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What did you think?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was actually a little bit underwhelmed.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A little bit underwhelmed.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a little...

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I would say underwhelmed is a fair, compared to the opener.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That was so amazingly great.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, like obviously it was not as good as that.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, I don't know.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What do you think?

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Go on about your feelings in general.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright, well my big thing about this episode is that I feel like this, in some ways, is making fun of the biggest criticisms that this show has been getting.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You think so?

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, because what I see when people who don't like Rick and Morty talk about, particularly the fans of Rick and Morty,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
everyone makes fun of them for just claiming that the show is super deep just because it's nihilistic.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like the parody that I've been seeing around of the show is that Rick just goes,

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
nothing matters, blah blah blah, and the fans go, oh it's so deep.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And in this episode, it kind of lampshades that because that's literally what Summer does in this episode.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That is true.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She becomes this really edgy nihilistic edgelord.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And that's her whole character in this episode is that she becomes obsessed with nihilism and not giving a fuck and senseless violence.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And she just embodies all the criticisms people have about Rick and Morty.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And then the episode kind of looks at her and goes, yeah, that is shallow.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She's just acting out.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's so funny.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Before I watched this, I happened to be on TV.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was just looking for a download.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't find one, so I just went here.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But on the TV board, where I thought there might be one, it was just full of those.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was just completely full of that exact criticism.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's a big one right now.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It definitely is.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I mean, at least from the shit I was seeing, they were just taking that at face value and being like, lol, nihilism.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, and nothing beyond that.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And that's true that it definitely did lampshade that.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just didn't feel like it had any real counterpoint.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And not that the show really needs to defend itself on that front.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I just didn't find its argument.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like, what's the resolution there at the end of the summer?

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She's just like, eh, it's kind of like the exact same point that was made when Morty was like, yeah, blah, blah, blah.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nothing matters.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Come watch TV.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Just like, yeah, just don't worry about it.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You know, it's fine.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Things kind of matter.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Things kind of do matter a little bit.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, I won't say that this episode had a strong message.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't think it did an amazing job of proving the critics wrong if that's what it was going for.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But I feel like what this episode was trying to say is like, okay, that's not what this show is about, though.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Like, yes, we go over the top with edgy violence and dark brutal humor and nihilism.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And yeah, we know it can look goofy, but the show is about this emotional side.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, like, it's always been like, what has made the show so endearing and interesting is not that it's nihilistic and full of violence.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's plenty of shows like that.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I wanted that, I would have them make Corgath the Barbarian into a full show.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did you ever watch that?

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Of course.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was great.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like, yeah, it was just fucking violence.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know, that's all it was.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And it was a fun time.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But like, the reason people get attached to Rick and Morty the way they do is not because it is senselessly violent and nihilistic.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's because there's this more interesting human story going on underneath it.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And like, the fact that it managed to, what I was impressed with this episode, and this is the only thing I would consider like absolutely impressive about it.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Like, otherwise it's a pretty standard Rick and Morty episode.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But it's just the fact that it did manage to make like what the kids were going through and the wife feel like emotionally poignant on some level.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Like, yeah, they're going through this like, this hardship of the breakup and like, you know, their parents are getting divorced and they're really trying to deal with these emotions.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And like, it was believable from them.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But at the same time, managing to just shit on Jerry relentlessly.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like, everyone else, the way everyone else is dealing with the breakup is taken very seriously.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The way that he's dealing with it is just completely shit on and they don't care at all.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I thought that was like such a weird dynamic that worked really well for me.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I really do like the way they unequivocally accept the fact that Jerry's a fucking pussy loser and there's no redeeming qualities to him.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's just, that's not open for debate.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a closed issue.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That is not what these kids are hung up about.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Like, they're having trouble dealing with, like, in fact, what they're hung up about is that they're frustrated with him.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Like, neither of them is mad at the fact that their parents are splitting up.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They're mad that Jerry's not doing anything about it.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They're mad that he's hanging around and being a namby-pamby piece of shit and like trying to, and he's not committing.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's not fucking committing to shit.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's just being a little bitch trying to hang.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He's being a fucking orbiter of this family is what he is right now.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's very embarrassing and he needs to, to, to nut up already.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And I think that's a really kind of fascinating dynamic for a family breakup in a show that like,

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the kids are, like, they're mad at him for the same reasons the mom is.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And they're just like, dude, you need to either get the fuck out of our lives,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
or fucking nut up and do something about this, you know?

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And like, when they see that he's not gonna nut up,

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then both, their conclusion is, oh, I guess you are a huge pussy.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, you know, maybe stop hanging around us.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know, like, god damn, it's so brutal to Jerry.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It really is.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And the way that it delivers that to me through like, Morty's whole quest

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
of getting over the fact that his dad's a pussy,

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
like, I like all that stuff a lot more than I like those like,

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and I know it was obvious on purpose,

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but like the super on the nose joke of the like, you're a pussy.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Or like whatever that whisper was.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I get it, that's fine, but I'm just glad that we were away from that really fast,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
because it's way more interesting to explore the issue through the lens of the other people in his life,

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
specifically, you know, Morty and the gang, who are the interesting characters,

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
as opposed to Jerry, who we all know is shit, we all get it.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm satisfied with the amount of Jerry that was in this episode,

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because I expressed a very strong desire that now that we're kicking Jerry out of the show,

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
we commit to that, that he's gone, and we don't focus on him too much.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And like, the way he was presented in this episode,

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it felt like he was not really a main cast member anymore.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Like, it felt like he was just there, he was around a little bit,

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because we needed a little bit of him, but like, the show is unequivocally shitting on him at this point.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He is not a major character.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He is there to be shit on by the show, you know?

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm still a little bit wondering if that was like the gag of this episode,

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
to shit on Jerry intensely, and that there will be some change to that as we go on through season three,

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but you know, there's no way to know, there's no way to know yet.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So, how did you feel about the overall Mad Max parody world?

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I felt it was, you know, I really liked the Purge episode.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I thought that was a really great episode.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know, this was a fine like parallel for what they were trying, not a parallel,

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
but it was a fine, you know, representation of like how Summer was feeling

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
in the kind of world she wanted to live in right now, where she, I don't know,

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
where she like has control over things in her life, as opposed to her parents' life,

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
or you know, her parents' relationship, where she has no control over it.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So, here's her, and the same with Morty.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like Morty is able to find a way to have power over something in his life by coming out of this place.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You know, the setting itself was cool.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I like the characters that were there, I guess.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know, I didn't like Buckethead Man, just like, he was weird.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I didn't like his voice performance.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like, he felt he was weirdly in between trying to be like, I don't know,

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
like he was a little too deadpan almost.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like, he's saying all this shit that's like supposed to be this like, you know,

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
like he's supposed to be talking like one of the people in these movies,

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
but he's got like a totally normal guy voice,

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and they didn't like play it up enough in either direction for it to work for me.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was not happy with his voice performance.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
His performance here makes me terrified that there's intentions to make this character like important,

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
or recurring in some way.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, he'll never show up again.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know, man.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I hope that's true.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Like, the fact that nothing bad happened to this character at all in any way

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
makes me think that he's being set up to come back and just like, like, oh my God.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Honestly, this might be the worst scene in any Rick and Morty episode I've ever seen.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That like mustache conversation about the helmet.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Like, I know later on, it got to the point where like,

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
acknowledges that it's a shitty conversation,

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
but that was like a minute of my time being wasted on discussions about this fucking dude's hair

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and like the obvious relationship they were building up between him and Summer.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh my God.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like, that wasn't clever.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That wasn't witty.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It was just boring.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It wasn't that long, so I'm not going to like dwell on it ruining the episode or anything,

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but man, did I not give a shit about that scene.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I mean, that character to me, what I felt like while watching it was this sounds like an act.

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like, this is clearly a guest star.

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, exactly.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like, he had that guest star feel and I felt like this seems like a dude who probably like isn't in voice acting much.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like, this is a normal actor who's doing voice acting for the first time.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just looked it up and it's Joel McHale, the guy who played the main character in Community.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, there you go.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's the reason why he's so weird and sucks and filled up the script because he's a famous actor.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Great actor.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Great actor.

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Great in Community.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sure.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Not exactly known for his voice acting.

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He has been in Bojack Horseman and a couple of, he hasn't not ever done voice acting.

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, he could be the best voice actor in the world and the dialogue written for him was terrible because they were trying to fill space.

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And like, I know, okay, you know what?

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is good because it makes it seem less likely that it'll come back a lot, but it does.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like, this character was weirdly protected by like an aura of like, nothing bad's gonna happen to this guy.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I could just tell, I could just tell immediately from the way his dialogue was written that this guy was like special in some way and he didn't earn that or deserve it in any way.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was weird and uncomfortable and I hope they don't do it more.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I thought he was a boring joke.

204
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like, I got what the joke was and I thought it was boring and I didn't think he, he was definitely the weakest element of the episode for me.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I feel like this, the thing about Rick and Morty is that it does lots of parodies and it usually either does them in a way that's like, so, like, like they take the original concept and they do something even more inventive with it or take it beyond the impossible.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like when they did Inception in like episode two.

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
With, you know, the, like, the Freddy Kruger meets Inception.

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's genius.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Right.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You know, what if Freddy Kruger got into the Inception world?

213
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Like, that's a good idea.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Sometimes though, they do a parody and they like seem to deliberately half-ass it because they're like, look, we're not really here for the parody.

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Like, it's just, you know, it is what it is.

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's there.

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And sometimes that doesn't work as well for me and this is one of those cases where I was like, like, they didn't even, I'm glad they at least didn't like mention that it's a Mad Max world.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like they usually would.

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Like Purge Planet.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know.

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They continually are like, this is the Purge Planet.

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But that's what was so funny.

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like they just used Purge to describe everything in that episode.

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That episode totally worked.

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That was great.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm glad they didn't say like, oh, we're in Mad Max world this time because like it was such a boilerplate, like, Mad Max world.

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You know, like they didn't do much as a Mad Max concept.

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, that's the weird thing though.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was so obviously Fury Road that I felt it was weird that they didn't mention that specifically.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I felt like it's, it's, it's got literally everything that Fury Road had.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, it's got the, I mean, it also has the Thunder Dome.

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So that's Mad Max.

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Which is Mad Max in every way.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They did name-drap the Thunder Dome at least.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So, you know, which they say, oh, don't you mean the Blood Dome or whatever.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's like hilarious joke, guys.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hilarious joke.

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That was all right.

241
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But yeah, it, it felt like a, you know, like you said, this is a good idea for like taking

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Summer to a nihilistic world.

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah.

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That part of it's good.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like the world in itself, I felt like this was one of the weaker parodies that Rick and

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Morty has done.

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I agree.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Of like a, of a, of a world just because the characters didn't feel right.

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Dude.

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They didn't feel like, like the mustache guy did not feel like he was in a Mad Max world.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And like, I, the only part that I thought was genius was the very end when the, they

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
used the crystal stone and it becomes just modern society and it immediately ruins it

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
for, for Summer.

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That was good stuff.

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And that was the only part where I was like, oh yes, like this is a great idea.

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But they could have done that with other settings other than Mad Max, you know.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And you're absolutely right about that.

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But like, okay.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What was the, what was the deal with the fact that there's just a king in Mad Max world?

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like, how does that in any way make sense?

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
There's nothing about this that is at all reasonable.

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They're, they're just like, is a king who like, he's the same slave.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, he was the same.

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In Fury Road, there's a king.

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
In Fury Road, what's his face?

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Mortan Joe is like their warlord God King.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Like this is just some like, some like, oh yeah, that, what is that?

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Total, that was like total left turn.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Like they just went from Fury Road world into like medieval world.

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How did that happen?

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And why?

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And what the fuck?

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So it was that the arm that Morty had had a vengeance because it had, it had its village

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
burned down.

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Right.

277
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The behest of some king.

278
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And yeah, there's just like a king in a castle.

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like that was also really weird.

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know.

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I haven't seen all the Mad Max movies.

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know if that's a thing in the first one.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Like I've seen Road Warrior and I've seen most of Thunderdome and all of Fury Road,

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
but there's no kings in any of those, you know.

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm looking at the environments they're in right now and it's like just a fucking fantasy

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
castle place.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It just, it's so not Mad Max.

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Again, yeah, maybe I'm missing something.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe this wasn't a Mad Max, but it feels bizarre and weird and I hate it.

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That is a strange thing.

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, there's definitely elements of this episode that are less strong.

292
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It was just not.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, the king guy.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He didn't do anything with him.

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's, okay, but here's the thing, like all that stuff is kind of not that important.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You know, those are like, yeah, okay, it's not the best, you know, but it's fine.

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's serviceable.

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
One thing that did actually actively bother me throughout this episode is that the way

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
this plot played out should not be possible with Rick's powers.

301
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Like, there are so many moments he could have just shot a portal gun and it would be over.

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, yeah, I hear you.

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I hear you.

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Like, why does he need to hatch a scheme to steal this rock?

305
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They could have just grabbed the rock and left.

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Like, that's something, we just, in episode one of this season, Rick destroyed the world

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
government while simultaneously kicking Jerry out of his house, all in one fell swoop.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And he did it like, he's the biggest schemer in the whole world.

310
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And he has to like, fumble and bullshit his way through trying to get this rock.

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't understand why he didn't just kill everyone.

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Um, yeah.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Like, this is a guy who doesn't, he like, at the start of the episode, he's like, about

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
to leave a summer on the planet.

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And he tells Morty like, you've got infinite sisters, but you know, I don't want to hear

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you bitch.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I'll save this one.

318
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And then 10 seconds later, he sees like this big rock that he wants and he doesn't just

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
murder everyone and take it.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Like, really?

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That seems like something he would do, you know.

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Explain that away with the one line of like, there's too much heat on it.

324
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Uh, yeah.

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Pretty weak excuse.

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No.

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Pretty fucking weak excuse.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Too many, like there's, there's also a moment where they try to excuse where like, when

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
he's in the car with the other two and he says, you know, I've got a portal gun and

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I could just leave you guys here and I'm like, yeah, but you could also just shoot the, like,

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
couldn't you just teleport them?

332
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Like, I know you can use this for more than what you're doing right now.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,120
Like, it just felt very forced to me that Rick had to be in this scenario where he has

334
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,480
to like, oh, I got to sneak around and I'm like, you don't have to sneak around.

335
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,000
We know you don't have to sneak around, you know.

336
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,320
Again, I think everything in this episode is facilitating something that I do like.

337
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,500
I like the story with Summer and Morty.

338
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,540
I love the Morty's arm subplot.

339
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,140
I thought that was the best part of the episode.

340
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
That shit was hilarious.

341
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
Yeah.

342
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
I liked it.

343
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
I liked it.

344
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
Um, yeah, I don't know.

345
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,740
It was one of those things that I did enjoy it as it was happening.

346
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,220
It just kind of fell a little flat for me in terms of the humor.

347
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,740
This whole episode, I found pretty darn unfunny overall, like compared to a normal episode.

348
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
I don't know.

349
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,960
I felt like the wit was just dulled down in general, maybe for this like cameo of this

350
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,900
other character going on or something.

351
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,300
But I liked what they did with the arm.

352
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,820
I thought it was funny that there'd be a sentient arm that just goes on a rampage to

353
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,980
get vengeance for like it's burned family and I really like the way that like the relationship

354
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,340
between Morty and the arm develops and how it like becomes more and more.

355
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,420
Cause at first it's just like a gag that like the arm remembers fighting.

356
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,700
So it punches out Rick and it's just like a really strong arm and then it goes and just

357
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,180
murders everybody.

358
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,620
And then as Morty like comes to understand this feeling of brutality and like wanting

359
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,300
this as a way to vent, like he can communicate more deeply with his arm and then like the

360
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,180
arm goes on this whole journey to resolve its own conflicts that have been established

361
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:06,380
so who knows how long ago and like, you know, the scene where Morty drowns the king and

362
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,700
like he's just like talking to Rick while drowning the king with this big beefy arm

363
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,940
and the arm goes away cause it's satisfied, but it's not, he's not actually dead and then

364
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,140
Rick helps them to like finish the job.

365
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,300
That was great to me.

366
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
That was a good ending.

367
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:26,100
And I love the fact that this whole thing kind of hinges on this like incredibly vague

368
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,780
notion of muscle memory, which is not a real thing and like that's like the joke that this

369
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
is all propped on.

370
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,580
Now that's funny that I like a lot.

371
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,740
That's great.

372
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
That's my favorite thing.

373
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,900
The arm thing is the best part.

374
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,220
And again, I like Summers, I like the Summers development again, seems like an answer to

375
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,860
the criticism of the show that like, oh, it's just nihilistic bullshit and like that's

376
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,700
literally what she is and she just becomes this like total hard ass who's murdering everybody

377
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,700
and then like, you know, cause it felt like this is a natural progression for Summer.

378
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,620
We've seen her continually get more and more into this work, you know, but she's gotten

379
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,860
to a point where it's self-destructive and not really smart and you know, Rick is, Rick

380
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,500
is, will never take these two as actual pupils.

381
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,860
That will never happen.

382
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,780
He will give them advice along the way.

383
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,900
He will give affirmation when they do something that he thinks is cool and he will give consternation

384
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,420
when they're in his way, but he will never just tell Summer like, hey, um, you're acting

385
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,300
retarded act this way.

386
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,700
He'll just watch and be like, oh, she's going to get herself killed.

387
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Fuck her.

388
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,300
You know, like his attitude towards her is really funny to me that like when he sees her

389
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,180
like, oh, I'm going to hang back and fucking fight these guys.

390
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,660
He's just like, well, fuck her.

391
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Let's get out of here.

392
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,660
You know?

393
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Yeah.

394
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Classic shit.

395
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Yeah.

396
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,780
It's, it's fun.

397
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,980
This show walks such a tightrope for me where like, uh, I think I discussed this on the last

398
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,620
episode that like I'm not really big into like glib violence most of the time, but this

399
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:02,380
show manages to do it in just such a way where like, I don't know, it never like offends me.

400
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,300
Like it can be insanely turbo violent, but I always feel like there's something behind

401
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
it.

402
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,220
You know, it's a combination of, uh, you know, because this is a cartoon, I feel like

403
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
they can get away with that stuff.

404
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,540
Like I'm never like disgusted or anything on like a super deep level by the shit I see.

405
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,900
I mean, it's actually sometimes like, uh, like the, the rape of Morty, like that or

406
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,060
the almost rape of Morty.

407
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Now that's a disturbing thing.

408
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
But that's supposed to be disturbing.

409
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
And it was great.

410
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
And they did it just right.

411
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
It's not glib at all.

412
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Exactly.

413
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
It's almost the attitude.

414
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
It's the attitude that frames everything.

415
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
Yeah.

416
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,380
I don't think they've ever done a violent scene where it was like the wrong person dying

417
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,780
for the wrong reason, you know, like if, if they just, for instance, like had Jerry just

418
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,100
like blow up or something grossly like that.

419
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,820
And then everyone was like, oh, well, fuck him.

420
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
It'd be like, really?

421
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
That's how you're going to.

422
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Yeah.

423
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,380
But, but shitting on Jerry constantly is fine because like Jerry does deserve it.

424
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,340
Like he is a shit, you know.

425
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,500
So like there is satisfaction in watching the whole show piss on him, but it does so in

426
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,100
a way that's not like cruel and unusual.

427
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,020
You know, like the dog eating his welfare check at the end, like he gives it to the

428
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
dog.

429
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
That was funny.

430
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
That was funny.

431
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Yeah.

432
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
He just pussies out as he always does.

433
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Of course.

434
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,340
Like on the, if, if you're thinking of it like at first something, okay, this is like

435
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,140
cosmic level of like fucking with him.

436
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,140
But like then it's, it's him who ultimately does it.

437
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,660
Like if the dog had just come up and eaten the welfare check, it wouldn't have been that

438
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
funny.

439
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
It's just like, okay, whatever, we get it.

440
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
You're shitting on Jerry.

441
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
But the fact that he gives it to the dog, it's just like, what are you doing?

442
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,980
You fucking pathetic idiot.

443
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,300
I think about this a lot.

444
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,620
I think about the fact that I could totally stomp a dog to death if it ever attacked me.

445
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
I think about that.

446
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,220
Cause people always talk about dogs.

447
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
I love to do that.

448
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,420
I could, I love dogs and would never want to do it unless necessary, but I could totally

449
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
stomp a dog.

450
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I could, I could beat a dog.

451
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
I'm just saying.

452
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,580
Jerry, you could have beat that dog, you pansy bitch.

453
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,900
That was, he could have taken him.

454
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,140
I know he could have.

455
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,700
Yeah, that was, that was good.

456
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,340
That was good shit.

457
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,740
That was like, that was like the good answer to like the first joke that was like the little

458
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,900
you're a loser or whatever.

459
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
That didn't make me laugh.

460
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
At the end it did.

461
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
So you know what?

462
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,380
Even that joke, I suppose did have like a payoff to it at the end.

463
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,580
So fair enough.

464
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,300
I didn't completely understand the scene where Summer gave him the skull.

465
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Yeah.

466
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,340
I wasn't sure what they communicated to one another.

467
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,100
I didn't know what Jerry was getting at when he was like, like, why is he like, like, is

468
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,780
he just getting blackpilled by his divorce now?

469
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,300
And he also, yeah, go on, go on.

470
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,420
I thought maybe he just didn't understand and was just like, okay, whatever, you know,

471
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,940
but like, but then he said something like something was going on there.

472
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Yeah.

473
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
I didn't get it.

474
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
That scene was confusing for me.

475
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm legit.

476
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Yeah.

477
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,700
I watched it twice and I am baffled by what the fuck they attempted to communicate there.

478
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,860
Yeah.

479
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,380
So did you like the little robo morty becoming sentient and wanting life?

480
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,620
You know, that was pretty fun.

481
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
I like it.

482
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Yeah.

483
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,220
I like the, that's another one of those things that this show does an amazing job of, of like

484
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,980
just throwing in like high level sci-fi concepts that other entire shows would be based on

485
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,740
and just having it as like a one off gag in the background.

486
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,660
Like, you know, this idea that, that Rick's, which I mean, granted, they've done this exact

487
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,180
joke before when he built the butter passing robot.

488
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,180
Yeah.

489
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,620
You know, what is my purpose?

490
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,420
And it's like, you passed butter and that was probably a better executed version of

491
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
the joke.

492
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Better and speedier.

493
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Yeah.

494
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
But this was still.

495
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
All right.

496
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Yeah.

497
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,420
I liked it.

498
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,300
What I like about this joke is mostly the part when they all leave and then the mom's like

499
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,180
confused about the two different versions because she's like, why don't you go run

500
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
in a stream?

501
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,940
And he's like, no, what the fuck are you talking about?

502
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,180
I didn't like that.

503
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,580
And I, you know, I just feel a need to say like, okay, she's like, she's, she is, there's

504
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,700
something wrong with this lady that she's not asking questions about what's going on

505
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
here.

506
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,940
And I suppose that I, this, this has been well documented by now that she will just

507
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,220
excuse anything that her dad does, she just will tune that shit out.

508
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,580
She's, she's hashtag damaged for sure.

509
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,580
Yeah.

510
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
And she's an alcoholic.

511
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Well, that's true.

512
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm sure that's related.

513
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
Yeah.

514
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
Yeah.

515
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
I really love her.

516
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
I love her character.

517
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,580
I can't say that.

518
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I love her.

519
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
I want more out of her.

520
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,700
I, I like her in her position in the story as this like poor, poor woman who's been so

521
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,580
emotionally manipulated by her, her evil father, well not evil, but you know, basically

522
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,580
evil.

523
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Yeah.

524
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,580
I like that a lot.

525
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,340
But even Jerry, I think has more character to him at this point.

526
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,700
She hasn't like, like she's more character, but yeah, you know, he's always been like

527
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,660
the guy who you're like, oh fuck off, you know, you're right, you're right.

528
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,500
But, and I don't even know if I necessarily like want a character arc for fuck what's

529
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
her name?

530
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Uh,

531
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Slipping my mind.

532
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,020
Daughter, for daughter, whatever her name is.

533
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,300
I don't even know if I want her to have one.

534
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,380
I feel like she actually does belong in this story as the rock.

535
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,460
Like she's, she's something that Rick does seem to care about sort of and like at least

536
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,380
in, in the idea of her, he wants to protect her in general and, and that's good.

537
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,780
And then she can, you know, sit here while her family does crazy stuff around her and

538
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,300
be the alcoholic who's totally oblivious to the things happening.

539
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I don't know.

540
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
I appreciate it.

541
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,820
I feel like this show is in some way running into a danger of like this, because we are

542
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,500
presented with this idea that like, yeah, Rick will look out for her at least, but like

543
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,220
he has abandoned one of her in season one when he just like left that universe behind.

544
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,660
So like, I don't know, sometimes the show is fond of her.

545
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,420
He's like fond of her, you know?

546
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Yeah.

547
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,100
I feel like this show runs into problems with consistency on like what Rick will do or can

548
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
do.

549
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,220
Like the fact that he couldn't get them out of the situation much more easily in this

550
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,420
episode, especially when he seemed lucid.

551
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,540
Like there are times where Rick fucks up, but it seems like he's just literally like

552
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:10,860
in an, like a insane episode, you know, or like his mind has, is not working right.

553
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,980
And that's why he's not doing it.

554
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
And I'm fine with that.

555
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,380
I'm okay with like Rick's got space dementia.

556
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,340
That makes sense to me.

557
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,140
Or Rick is just a drunk, you know, or high.

558
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,380
I'm okay with that.

559
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,060
But when it seems like he's completely right of mind, he's in his normal good sense.

560
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,380
And yet he's like not able to solve what seems like a basic situation or like he's making

561
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,820
different moral decisions from what he did earlier in the episode.

562
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,380
It's just like, yeah, you're playing a little too close to the fire there, you know?

563
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,860
I hear what you're saying.

564
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,820
But like, so Rick has always had like, it's been his modus operandi to like involve Morty

565
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,060
on these like extremely like pedantic adventures to get like little knickknacks or whatever

566
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,500
the fuck that he's trying to do for whatever.

567
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,500
So like, you know, there's, there's, I'd say like last episode, there was an absolute

568
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:09,020
like power level spike in, in Rick's like mental abilities to like, like he's unmatched

569
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,740
completely on every level.

570
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,660
No one can do anything to this dude.

571
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,220
He just completely decimated the entire universe with sheer mental power.

572
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,620
And like, there's no way anything can compete with that, like if he stayed at that level

573
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,780
all the time.

574
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,660
So I think that the only way they could do that was to like elevate him to that status

575
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
for an episode.

576
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,220
And now we have to swallow a pill that like, okay, we're going to dial this back a little

577
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
bit.

578
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,300
I just think there's a way to avoid ways like there are stories you can write with him in

579
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,060
like situations where he just like, isn't aware, isn't paying attention, things like

580
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
that.

581
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
I think so.

582
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,940
Like, I mean, if you look at episode one, like in that whole episode, he's just fucking

583
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
insane.

584
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,300
Like he's, when he makes Ricky like, when he makes Morty wear them, he makes him wear

585
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,180
the boots, the gravity boots, like doesn't explain them properly and stuff like that.

586
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,620
You know, and like, there's, there's lots of times where Rick, like you said, pedantic

587
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:10,060
adventures, but usually it's like his inattentiveness, like in the big party episode where he makes

588
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,740
Morty go get the Klaxian crystals and he's like, Morty, you got to get these crystals.

589
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
It's super important.

590
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Morty has to go on this whole trick and he comes back and he just snorts and it's just

591
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,020
like, it's just crack, you know, with a fleeting high.

592
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,180
And like those moments sell me on like, Rick is just like on a different plane when it

593
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,740
comes to like how he thinks about like risk and reward, you know, this episode didn't

594
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,860
sell me on that.

595
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,580
This episode felt like Rick was completely in his right mind cause he was like the straight

596
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
man this episode.

597
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Yeah.

598
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,620
Rick was the straight man in an episode and he still fucks things up, you know.

599
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,340
Usually when he's the straight man, he's like completely in control and like, you know,

600
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,500
no Morty, I have a portal gun, dumbass, you know, Rick.

601
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,140
So basically, I guess there, there's sort of a rule, I guess, about that that like Rick

602
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,640
cannot be placed in a situation where he has a clear goal and clear methods of accomplishing

603
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
that goal.

604
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,520
He just, you can't ever put him in that situation because he should just be able to solve it

605
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,680
immediately.

606
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
It has to be vague.

607
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Yeah.

608
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
It has to be some like weird thing.

609
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,320
Like when he, when he had to build a business that uncursed items that were cursed by the

610
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,020
devil, like that's perfect.

611
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,520
That's exactly what this guy should be doing.

612
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,920
And the scene where he just like gets tired of it and burns it all down.

613
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Yeah.

614
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
That's a Rick move, you know.

615
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Exactly.

616
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,560
And I understand why it happened here is cause this episode's not about Rick.

617
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,240
This is not a Rick episode.

618
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,520
It's completely about Summer and Morty.

619
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,560
And so I understand why Rick takes a back seat, but I just think they could have done

620
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,080
it more carefully.

621
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,160
Like it was a little too blatant.

622
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,760
Like I'm looking too hard at Rick's plot line and going, what, why is this the B plot?

623
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,000
This doesn't make any sense.

624
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You know.

625
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah.

626
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I hear you.

627
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Um, okay.

628
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Hey, let's talk about, uh, how do you feel about like specifically the, the underlying

629
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,040
plot thread of the divorce?

630
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
You feel like that's moving along?

631
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,720
You feel like we're going anywhere with that in general?

632
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Yeah.

633
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,000
I feel like the kids resolved their feelings for it and maybe, maybe this is the last we'll

634
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,320
see of Jerry for a while.

635
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
That's what I was wondering.

636
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Yeah.

637
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah.

638
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,720
Um, it felt like a natural progression from the previous episode and it felt like the

639
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,760
show was really trying to reassure me that like, look, we have things to say about Jerry,

640
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,600
but we're not bringing him back.

641
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
He's not like still a major character.

642
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,960
It felt like they were bending over backwards to reassure me.

643
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,160
Look, this is just about the kids dealing with their feelings towards Jerry.

644
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,800
He is really gone.

645
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
That's really a thing.

646
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,280
Like, look, they're not trying to get him back.

647
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,920
They've all come to terms with me and gone, believe me.

648
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
He's not coming back.

649
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
And I'm like, all right.

650
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
All right.

651
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
You've convinced me.

652
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
I'm glad.

653
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I'm glad you've convinced me.

654
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
You know.

655
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,720
That farewell scene with Summer, I think if I understood what was going on, what was intended,

656
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,640
I think would have been a good sort of farewell scene for Jerry for a while and we can just

657
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,040
leave it at that for, for a good while.

658
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,520
Unfortunately, it was confusing.

659
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Yeah.

660
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,840
Tell me in the comments what the fuck they meant because I do not understand what was

661
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
going on.

662
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,880
So Summer gave a, you know what, never mind.

663
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Yeah.

664
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Just tell me.

665
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Just tell me.

666
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Yeah.

667
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,720
And there's plenty of moments at this episode that I thought were pretty cool.

668
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,040
Summer shooting the car and flipping over her and then Rick just being like, OK, that

669
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
was cool.

670
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Yeah.

671
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,200
I love when my favorite Rick moments are when he just appreciates the world around him

672
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
and what other people are doing.

673
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,120
And the ending scene again, like where the whole society turns into just like modern

674
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
society.

675
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,520
Now granted, I thought the actual conversation between Summer and Buckethead guy was weak.

676
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,040
Like I didn't think it was funny.

677
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,360
I got what they were doing, but it wasn't like funny joke wise.

678
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,720
But the entire scene as a concept was definitely a great idea.

679
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,360
Like I laughed really hard just when I saw her like driving up to the place and I was

680
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,680
just like, oh my God, they fucking did it.

681
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Yeah.

682
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,320
I think this, yeah, like that character really fell victim to is nepotism the right word?

683
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,200
I feel like because he's buddies with this guy, he gave him a role and gave him a whole

684
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,200
bunch of lines and made sure nothing bad happened to him and gave him a bunch of silly stuff

685
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
like, oh, you're mustache.

686
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,320
You're such a weird, quirky character.

687
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,440
Like that really kills a great actor.

688
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,320
But this character sucked it.

689
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Not cast Wells here.

690
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,280
He was written poorly and yeah, acted badly and everything about this character was really

691
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
annoying.

692
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah.

693
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,360
He, this character should have fucking died by the end or something.

694
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,000
Fucking Summer should have blown off his fucking head at the end.

695
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,640
Like that would have been, I don't know, cool or something.

696
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
That's a little unnecessary.

697
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
All right.

698
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
I guess that's unnecessary.

699
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,680
It was funny enough that Rick took the stone and damned that whole civilization back to

700
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
what it was before.

701
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,400
I'm just annoyed by the fact that nothing bad happened to this character and I could

702
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,520
sense that that was going to be him from the second he was like revealed to be, I don't

703
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
know.

704
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,640
He was just obvious that this guy was like above everybody else.

705
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
It annoyed me.

706
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,920
He felt protected by fucking plot armor.

707
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
That's what he felt like.

708
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,280
I felt plot armor on this character and it annoyed me because he wasn't funny and nothing

709
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,120
good came of him other than being married to Summer for that one joke that dragged on

710
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,760
too long and got annoying anyway.

711
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,600
Well that's about all I have to say about the episode.

712
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
You said all you had?

713
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I think so.

714
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,720
Overall, I thought it was good.

715
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,920
It was not like a great Rick and Morty episode.

716
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,000
It's not one that's going to keep me rewatching it the way the first three episodes of season

717
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,480
two did or the first episode of season three.

718
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,640
It's just one of those like, yeah, all right.

719
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,000
I won't skip it in a rewatch of the show, but it's not incredible.

720
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
I agree.

721
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,840
I think I like it a little bit less than you in general.

722
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,320
I really thought, I don't know, something about the humor wasn't doing it for me as

723
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,120
much as consistently and really all this is relative to Rick and Morty being the best

724
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
show ever.

725
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,440
It just didn't live up to that bar for me on that front the whole time.

726
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,800
Some of it was great, like we said.

727
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,680
I'd give it a okay.

728
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,160
It was okay to good, I guess.

729
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,200
A light okay, decent good, whatever, something like that.

730
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,040
All right, that's it folks.

731
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Come back next week.

732
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
See you then buddy.

733
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,060
Bye-bye.
