EVERYONE CAN BE SO D

EVERYONE CAN BE SO D

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,820
EVERYONE CAN BE SO D

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,820
EVERYONE CAN BE SO D

EVERYONE CAN BE SO D

EVERYONE CAN BE SO D

Hello, my honey, hello, my ragtime girl.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,900
Are you the WB frog?

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
Because that's what I picked.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,560
No, that's not his name.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,640
His name is, oh no, he's got a name.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Let me quickly Google Hat Frogs to find out what's his name.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Homestuck, Munchie.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,040
Oh no, it's Pepe, it's a Naga Hat.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Michigan J Frog.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,600
Michigan J Frog.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
Yeah.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
What?

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,120
Hmm, okay.

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Is that real?

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,800
Yeah, it's real.

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,640
It sounds ridiculous.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Michigan as a name, huh?

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
I wonder if the J stands for anything.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm going to guess that it's Jones because he was created

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,880
by Chuck Jones, but that's pure speculation.

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,960
Wow, what a character.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
What a powerhouse.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,440
He made that up.

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,720
Well.

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh god.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm just overcome with love for Michigan J Frog in this machine.

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
He's a maverick, you know?

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,200
He's out there living his dream every single day,

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,800
and who in their right mind would stand in his way?

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Michigan, Michigan.

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,480
Cursed with that forbidden name, unfortunately,

50
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,440
but other than that.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
It's all gravy for him.

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,720
Anyway, it's 2018, guys.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,240
What?

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
What?

55
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,560
This is important, shut up, the topic of his podcast.

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,160
This is the Michigan J Frog podcast.

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,280
In a clip from a DVD special, Jones

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,480
stated that he had come up with the name Michigan Frog

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
during the 1970s and was inspired to add the J

60
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,720
as a middle initial while being interviewed

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,040
by a writer named Jay Cox.

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Jay Cox.

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,920
He was thinking Cox would be a weird one.

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,880
So now I'm in question.

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,240
Now, does the J stand for Jay as in Jay Cox?

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
I mean, probably.

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,560
Like J-A-Y?

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Just like Homer Simpson.

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Homer Simpson's middle name is J-A-Y.

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,040
Oh, dude, they're related somehow.

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,240
They're related just like Monkey D. Luffy and Goldy Roger.

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
Well, pretty much.

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
The J. The J is the destiny.

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,520
Imagine if the D, it was just D-E-E for all that time.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,640
Dude, Michigan J Frog is a special person.

76
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,760
He's got the will of J.

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,280
What if a straw hat land takes place in the same world

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,000
as Kirby in the distant future where

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,200
King Dedede's descendants have all propagated and spread

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,440
throughout the land to overthrow the kingdom of heaven

81
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,480
started by the corrupt.

82
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
Wait a minute.

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,960
Original founder is Kirby.

84
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
That's the last you'll freak.

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,200
But wait.

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,840
King Dedede is an earth elemental lord of the dancing.

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,040
He will see his empire toppled.

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,600
And Dedede, in order to make offspring,

89
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,640
effect the year 2018.

90
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,320
So back on topic.

91
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
Now that it's legal.

92
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Now that it's legal.

93
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,120
King Dedede.

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,760
In Ohio, where I live, 16 is legal.

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,440
So just saying.

96
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,760
But in the UK, 16 is legal.

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Now I know why you guys live there.

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,920
I didn't think of that joke in 2016, but you know.

99
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,320
Did you ever see that meme that's like the Shaq euphoria meme?

100
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,160
Something like, I don't know, Massachusetts,

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
Age of Consent 18, Midwest, Age of Consent 16, Japan,

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Age of Consent 14 or 12.

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,960
And then I think it was like Saudi Arabia,

104
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,080
Age of Consent, none.

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,880
And it's just like exploding eyes.

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
It was one of those Middle Eastern states.

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,880
I don't mean to insult the good people of Saudi Arabia,

108
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,560
if I'm incorrect.

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,040
But anyway, here we are talking Middle Eastern politics.

110
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,680
On today's episode of the Procrastination Podcast.

111
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,080
Wait, I'm going to say I'm going to fucking be racist.

112
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,400
I got beef to pick with Saudi Arabia.

113
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,920
I strongly object to its people and culture.

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,600
And our oil prices, they're surging.

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
Please stop.

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,600
No.

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
Let me tell you why.

118
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,840
It's because I've met a couple of Saudi Arabians in my life.

119
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,280
And they've all been rich assholes

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,120
because they have government grants to go abroad

121
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
and be rich in another country.

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,320
So I'm sure not everyone is like that, but just the ones

123
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,000
that I've been like that.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Yeah, they have a literal aristocracy,

125
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,760
as I understand it, in Saudi Arabia.

126
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,400
Yeah, I'm sure the ones you run into in America

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,920
are mostly the rich ones that are like government connected

128
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
or whatever.

129
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,840
Indeed.

130
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,320
They're like Dubai, though.

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,560
I mean, that's the United Arab Emirates separate.

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,480
That's like a literal future.

133
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,720
OK, anyway, it is 2018, guys.

134
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,640
And we're here to talk about our plans for 2018.

135
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,120
Starting the year off with some good old fashioned racism.

136
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,200
It wouldn't be a PCP if we didn't have a little bit of that

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,720
mixed in.

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,040
Oh, don't say that word.

139
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,640
Don't say mixed here.

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,280
Oh, no.

141
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
We'll have none of that.

142
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,280
We'll have none of that.

143
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
All right, our first goal of 2018

144
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,360
is to help our bro, Richard Spencer,

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,120
start the ethno state clearly.

146
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,760
It's time.

147
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
The time is upon us.

148
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,240
But really, our first goal is to define what even is 2018.

149
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,720
What could this creature be?

150
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
So just for perspective, I went ahead

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,640
and we've got our friends at Urban Dictionary

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
have a definition of 2017 for us.

153
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Oh, you're going to like this one, fellow Redditors.

154
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,880
2017, the struggle for humanity.

155
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
Embarrassing, embarrassing.

156
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
OK, so that's what we've left behind.

157
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
Wait, all right, here's one thing.

158
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,240
I just got to say this.

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,840
I don't remember 2017 being bad at all.

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,680
I can't remember what happened.

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
But Donald Trump was president.

162
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
He was president at the end of 2016, wasn't he?

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,640
Only for a little.

164
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,320
Only for a little bit.

165
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,280
He was elected in 2016.

166
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,640
He was inaugurated in January.

167
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
This has been his year.

168
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
2017 has such highlights as the release

169
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
of our favorite video game, Undertale.

170
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,360
And many other excellent animes.

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,480
I just am not understanding the, like, oh my god, 2017.

172
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
Will you survive?

173
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
Like, what?

174
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,560
Nothing happened.

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,720
All to do with the Trump stuff, I'm pretty sure.

176
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
It was no 2016.

177
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,920
Like, 2016 was a real shit.

178
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,560
Everybody died that was cool.

179
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,440
That was a bad year.

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,040
I fucking died.

181
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,640
That sucked.

182
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
Wait, this year?

183
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,280
No, that was 2016.

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,920
Yeah.

185
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,360
He died.

186
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
God, I can't believe it.

187
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,840
It feels like it was 2016, like, a week ago.

188
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,600
Yeah, exactly.

189
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,720
2017 is exactly not a half-wall.

190
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Because we're closing it on 30.

191
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,280
So our perception of time is beginning to speed up.

192
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Soon it's going to be, I feel that,

193
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
decades are going to be a week ago.

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh, boy.

195
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,240
And we're just going to, like, jeez, Christ.

196
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,720
I better start some, like, Buddhist meditation or something.

197
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,360
That's a good idea.

198
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
So here's our definition of 2018 that we'll

199
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,720
be working off of for the rest of this.

200
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,280
I'm sure we will.

201
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,560
Something I hope won't be shit.

202
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,080
Thank you, fellow Redditors.

203
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,480
God.

204
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,880
Tipping my cap to you on my way.

205
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,720
In this trooper's opinion, 2018 is gay.

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,880
Let's just go on and define 2018.

207
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,640
Oh, I thought I saw a comic by our good friend Shen Comics.

208
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,960
And if I know anything, 2018 is a very buff naked man

209
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,640
who has a JoJo's-inspired outfit on,

210
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,200
ready to beat the shit out of you.

211
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,920
Is that the Shen Comics?

212
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Is that Bike Cuck?

213
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,040
No, that's Altered.

214
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Altered, the worst comedy game of all time.

215
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
No, they're the same thing.

216
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Altered is Shen Comics.

217
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,440
Yeah, yeah, that's OK.

218
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,920
His handle.

219
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,480
OK, there you go.

220
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,040
So, yeah.

221
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,360
Oh, Bike Cuck.

222
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Dude, he totally redeemed himself, though.

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,240
He's definitely making some strides.

224
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,600
Every now and then, I see one.

225
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,760
He memed, did you see how he memed on himself

226
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
when that new trial they got repealed?

227
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
It was fucking brilliant.

228
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,400
I think so, but I can't remember.

229
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,880
What was it again?

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
He did the exact same comic, but it was like,

231
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,680
net neutrality got repealed.

232
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm pretty sad about it.

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,960
But then again, maybe the people who repealed him

234
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,680
were having, then he just pops out of a port.

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,240
He's like, no, fuck you.

236
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
And just beats this shit out of himself.

237
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,840
Like, yeah.

238
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,320
OK.

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
That was a good way to meme on yourself.

240
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
Yeah, I remember appreciating that.

241
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,320
I appreciated that.

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,600
You know, I've been seeing these comics on Twitter lately.

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,480
They have some generic name.

244
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,280
And they're just drawn as blobs.

245
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,880
And it's like the most generic sentiment.

246
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,560
God, I think it's called webcomicname.

247
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeah, it's webcomicname.com.

248
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,720
OK, I get it.

249
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Oh, is it like a parody of all those people who do nothing?

250
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
Yeah.

251
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Oh, that's great.

252
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
But at the same time, it still manages

253
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,520
to get like the same message across.

254
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,680
It's like, this latest one is, my life has no meaning.

255
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,040
Maybe the meaning of my life is to make an offspring

256
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,080
with a meaningful life.

257
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,560
And then the baby is like, my life has no meaning.

258
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,680
And the parent is like, oh, no.

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
Yep.

260
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,800
Yep.

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,280
I really hate that sentiment about, I don't know,

262
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,480
does anybody else feel similar?

263
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,440
This is sort of relevant.

264
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,680
Try like goals for a new year, whatever.

265
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,240
I, whenever I see a parent who like defines their life

266
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,280
by like raising their kid right, it makes me real mad.

267
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Yeah, it's like, if everyone does that, nothing new happens.

268
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
It's just the same shit forever.

269
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
And I'm, I don't know.

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
Well, don't you find it weird that like parents would be like,

271
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm going to raise my child, right?

272
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,200
But then they raise them with the exact same like values

273
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
and goals that they had, which led them nowhere.

274
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,200
So it's just like, you're just pigeonholing your child

275
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,720
into being as MD and vapid as you are.

276
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,600
I've given up on the, on the hope that like,

277
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,720
I'll be a miraculously way better parent than like my parents.

278
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,400
We're like, what are the odds that I'm going to crack

279
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,080
the fucking code and be like a magically perfect parent

280
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,440
who makes the perfect kid?

281
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
Highly unlikely.

282
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,080
No, if anyone could do it, it's me.

283
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm a gambling man.

284
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
I, if I make a kid, I'm going to, I'm going to just go into it

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,360
with the, with the idea of like making them into somebody

286
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,000
I can have a conversation with that is not like,

287
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,640
uh, God, this fucking piece of shit.

288
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm not going to, you know, this isn't the parents.

289
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,440
Impossible.

290
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,280
Impossible.

291
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
Yeah.

292
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
There's a generational divide.

293
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,800
So from like, you know, like 13 to like 25,

294
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,480
they're going to hate you.

295
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,440
What I mean, what I mean by that is,

296
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,360
is giving them like the, the tools of like

297
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,240
figuring things out on their own.

298
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,200
So that they can be an interesting person

299
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
without doing what I do or like knowing what I know.

300
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
I don't know how to explain this,

301
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
but I don't want to talk about it.

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
I don't want to get into it.

303
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,280
Because that's, I'm not going to do it in 2018.

304
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,120
That's for sure.

305
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,840
The best, the best way to, the best thing you can do for a kid.

306
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,200
Give a man a fish, feed him for a day,

307
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,960
teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime,

308
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,440
teach a man to catfish, get him economically secure

309
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
for the remainder of his existence.

310
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,040
That's relevant somehow, I think.

311
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,080
So what do you guys got for goals?

312
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,320
You got any new year's resolutions,

313
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
any hot off the press kind of stuff?

314
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,920
People have been doing that a lot.

315
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,720
People have been doing that a lot around here.

316
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
I don't know, I don't really trust them.

317
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,960
I don't really trust them.

318
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,560
Like, I mean, of course I'm a gym guy.

319
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,560
So like every January, the January joiners flood the gym

320
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,400
and it's a nightmare.

321
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,840
Every, every workout guy goes, that's like the worst time.

322
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,760
The January joiners and it's bullshit.

323
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,480
Cause they, cause they flake out.

324
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
They flake out.

325
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,160
Cause if you're just, if you're just there, cause like,

326
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,920
yeah, like you're not, you're not gonna stick to it

327
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,200
based on like, oh, I can't let down my new year's resolution.

328
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,520
That principle is what, is what kind of turns me off

329
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,000
of new year's resolutions in general.

330
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,280
Don't get me wrong, any excuse to try to work on something

331
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,800
is an opportunity that maybe this will be the time

332
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,760
that you really stick to it.

333
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,000
And I'm all for that.

334
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,040
But like if your primary motivation is just to stick

335
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,380
to your own desire to stick to your new year's resolution,

336
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,660
to me, sounds like a, a rocky foundation,

337
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,700
but maybe you can build on it.

338
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,740
You know what they should do?

339
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,500
They should, they should have all the gyms in the world

340
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,220
have like a, like a four mile radius all around them.

341
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,620
And with like spikes on the roads that you can't drive

342
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,180
over them, over the border.

343
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
And you have to run all the way to the gym

344
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,980
cause there's lines and shit.

345
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,220
So if you manage, if you have like the, the, the tenacity

346
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,500
to run all the way to the gym to do your workout,

347
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,100
then you've proven yourself worthy to be in the gym.

348
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,180
It's like a Pokemon gym because you got to go through

349
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,580
the gym leaders minions before you fight the gym leader.

350
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,460
You got, you got to show that you can beat that diglet

351
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,300
before you can fight against Brock and his mighty Onyx.

352
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,860
That sounds like a dick metaphor if I ever heard one.

353
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,180
I don't know.

354
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,340
A dig, you know, diglet, Onyx, whatever.

355
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,060
Point is, I have no resolutions though.

356
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,060
I have been thinking about like fixing my diet forever.

357
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,620
That's, that's one thing I'd really like to do this year.

358
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,380
And like, here's the thing about me.

359
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,020
Everything that I should be doing, I'm already doing

360
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,300
in terms of finances economically because I recognize

361
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,140
there's no point in waiting.

362
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,900
You just got to do it and don't be a pussy.

363
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,380
But one thing that I am not really doing perfectly

364
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,660
is, is eating exactly as I would like to

365
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,100
for maximizing gains and maximizing health.

366
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,980
Not, not quite enough kidney beans these days

367
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,420
and not enough salads and too many carbs, far too many carbs

368
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,820
as everyone does in America.

369
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,340
Yeah, I want to, I want to knock that shit off.

370
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,580
So that's, that's something I'm kind of keeping.

371
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,020
Carbs, I hate carbs.

372
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,060
I, I've came to a revelation recently.

373
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,580
Yeah, for the last, well, here's the thing.

374
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,660
This is, this is the catch 22 or horrible situation

375
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,420
I'm in with carbohydrates because like you,

376
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,340
I've been trying to improve my diet.

377
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,060
So for the last like couple months from like,

378
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,060
I want to say August to probably the end of October,

379
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,980
I was having migraines all the time.

380
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,580
Like I have, I've had chronic migraines

381
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,700
since I was five years old, but like they were really bad.

382
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,540
Like so bad.

383
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,220
Like I was like, I don't know if this is migraine.

384
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,220
Like it's so much worse.

385
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,660
I went to the hospital like three times.

386
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,620
I was like, there's nothing wrong with you.

387
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,540
Like, you know, like you're fucked up.

388
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,780
And I eventually figured out the reason,

389
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,100
the reason that I was getting all these migraines

390
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,340
was because I wasn't eating enough carbs.

391
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,100
I was trying to lower my carb intake.

392
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,180
And because I wasn't having as many carbs

393
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,780
that like made my headaches worse.

394
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,700
And then I looked it up and like, yeah,

395
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,540
this thing kind of happens.

396
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,820
People have like chronic migraines.

397
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,860
Like you have to like carb load

398
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,260
to keep your headaches away.

399
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm like, whoa, I'm totally fucked.

400
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,020
Is that because you're eating far less

401
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,180
than the average person does?

402
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,500
Or because there's something about you

403
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
where you need more carbs than the average person?

404
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,140
I'm not sure.

405
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,500
It's interesting because I wasn't,

406
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,060
I wasn't having like no carbs.

407
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,740
I was just like cutting down on it.

408
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,380
And that was enough to like make like something that was like,

409
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,940
I'd get like three or four times a month

410
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,260
to be like three or four times a week.

411
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,380
And like made it impossible to function.

412
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,060
So my own body is deciding to fuck over my resolution

413
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,900
to eat better.

414
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,260
So thanks, thanks biology.

415
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,820
Where's genetic engineering?

416
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,660
Or even better, where's the robot bodies?

417
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,940
We need the cyber brains now, all right.

418
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,660
That indeed, indeed.

419
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,540
Okay, well, does that translate

420
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,900
any kind of resolution for this year?

421
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,340
Any plans for that?

422
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,940
Well, I want to try and find a better balance for that.

423
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,060
And I also want to start exercising a little bit.

424
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,860
I feel like if I go into,

425
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,820
if I turn 30 as a flabby fuck,

426
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm just probably just going to kill myself on my birthday.

427
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,660
Just like, can't let it happen.

428
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,340
Can't let it happen.

429
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,140
It's been too long, like I can't.

430
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,260
Okay, the best way to do that is set the date

431
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,660
that you know is the day that you're going to kill yourself

432
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,500
and break up all the time from now to then

433
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,420
into small achievable goals.

434
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,780
And so you can track your progress.

435
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,620
And even if you don't achieve all the way,

436
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,420
you'll have come a long way by then.

437
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,460
And if I don't get all the way,

438
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,620
I'll just like cut off an arm instead of just straight.

439
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

440
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,300
Your death will be proportional.

441
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,700
Yeah, consequences.

442
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,580
I'll just like poison myself,

443
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,820
so I'll die in like a few years, you know.

444
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,380
Okay, okay, if I hit it bit,

445
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,100
if I make a million dollars by the time I'm 30,

446
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
if I don't make a million dollars by the time I'm 30,

447
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,940
I'm going to kill myself.

448
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,180
But if I make say 500,000,

449
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,860
I'll just start smoking instead.

450
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,620
Yeah, cut off a proportional amount of your life

451
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,780
by engaging in bad activities.

452
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,140
Gabe, were you saying something?

453
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,180
No.

454
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,380
I don't know what this thing is.

455
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,620
I don't know what we're doing.

456
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,660
Are we just saying resolutions?

457
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,500
We're saying things we've got goals for 2018.

458
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,340
I mean, right now we're talking

459
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,260
about New Year's resolutions, basically.

460
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah, cause let me talk about anything here.

461
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,460
Because those are slightly different

462
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,220
in that they feel, even the word,

463
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,180
like it just feels like,

464
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,940
yeah, I'm not actually going to do that,

465
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,780
but I'm saying it.

466
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,620
Do you want to know why?

467
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,580
This is why New Year's resolutions are stupid

468
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,660
and why goals are good.

469
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,140
Because of resolution, you're just like,

470
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,420
oh, I resolved to do something.

471
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,540
This is something I'd like to do.

472
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,180
It's not committal enough.

473
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,580
A goal is when you're just like, okay,

474
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,540
I not only do I have something I've resolved to do,

475
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,500
but I assumedly have some sort of plan in place

476
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,620
to get there.

477
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,140
And so I can make these smaller steps to accomplish it.

478
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,980
That's the difference.

479
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,940
That's why goals are good and resolutions are bullshit.

480
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420
Because so many people are just like,

481
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,700
they have, you have your resolution,

482
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,460
like the day of like, you know, like December 31st,

483
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,940
like I'm going to go to the gym tomorrow.

484
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,860
And then like that's as far as you planned out.

485
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,780
That's not going to work, dude.

486
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,060
You got to have a system in place

487
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,420
or you're fucking yourself over.

488
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,900
I just, I can't respect someone who says,

489
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,140
I mean, I don't know if theoretically perhaps I could,

490
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,540
but it seems like a big bad mistake to be like,

491
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,940
yeah, on January 1st, I start going to the gym

492
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,500
and it's like, it's like the middle of December.

493
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,860
Like if you really are committed,

494
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,260
you'll start today or maybe tomorrow,

495
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
like, I don't know, whatever,

496
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,420
but you'll start now.

497
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,660
You won't wait until then.

498
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,580
That's, you know, it's the way to fucking do it.

499
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,540
That's the way to fucking do it.

500
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,180
I mean, my resolution or rather goal was,

501
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,460
I mentioned it in the last PCP of the questions

502
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,140
when we mentioned like plans and stuff,

503
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,380
but we're going to go more into it here.

504
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,340
I mentioned that I was going to make videos every week

505
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,300
and stuff.

506
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,980
And the reason I was going to start on January the first

507
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,820
was because I had work that I couldn't,

508
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,020
like I had to get done

509
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,120
and that I was stopping me from starting immediately.

510
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,420
So basically my goal was to finish what I had to finish

511
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,260
by the 31st of December,

512
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,060
which I actually on the last day of the year finished.

513
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,620
And I was like, oh, ooh.

514
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,620
And now I can just celebrate for a bit.

515
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,580
And then I actually, January 1st, I did work

516
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
and I was working.

517
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,780
And I was working the second day and the third day.

518
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,740
And this whole first week, my plan was,

519
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,540
well, my goals, my, yeah, my plan for 2018

520
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,340
was to make a video every week.

521
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,980
And as of the first week, I have done two videos

522
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,060
and I'm starting the third after I've finished recording this.

523
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,780
So it's going well.

524
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,420
And at the rate I am going, I can imagine,

525
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,340
like one week I can do two videos

526
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,220
and I have four videos per month, basically.

527
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,060
So by June, I should have the whole fucking year,

528
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,800
fucking dumb.

529
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Sick dog.

530
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,480
Yeah, I mean, that's great.

531
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,860
Yeah, I mean, of course, if you are just like,

532
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,660
if you're busy accomplishing other goals

533
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,700
that prevent you from starting until January 1st,

534
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,660
you know, of course.

535
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah, immediately means as soon as it's feasibly possible.

536
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,780
Not like. Indeed, indeed.

537
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,620
You're drowning.

538
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,580
It's time to start working on that video.

539
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,420
You know, if you're not starting right now,

540
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,980
trying to present yourself from drowning,

541
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,940
like I'm pretty sure you're a terrible person.

542
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,220
Drowning in footwear, though.

543
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,900
Oh, well, you know.

544
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
Got him.

545
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,580
Got him.

546
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,740
That's a realm I'm not familiar with, let me say.

547
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,620
That's a level of existence I can't fathom.

548
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,340
Ben, you got any resolutions for 2018?

549
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,420
Tell me them.

550
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,580
I guess, well, on a personal note,

551
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,540
I guess my overall, the thing that I'm aiming

552
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,380
to start doing that I wasn't doing previously in 2018

553
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,180
is start paying my student loans off.

554
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,020
They've been deferred.

555
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,500
Hey, glad to hear it, dude.

556
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,660
Yeah, they've been deferred forever, and that's bad.

557
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,860
I made a big payment on them a couple years ago,

558
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,500
and I'm pretty sure that a bunch of what I paid back then

559
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,700
has grown back to interest, which is very,

560
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,900
not all of it, but yeah, it's very frustrating.

561
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,900
And like, I don't know.

562
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,380
I have been roasting you, Ben, behind your back

563
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,820
for years about these student loans,

564
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,180
just so you know, roasting you like a Christmas goose

565
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,780
you were, and succulent, succulent,

566
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,860
the word I'd use to describe it.

567
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,060
Well, yeah, so I'm gonna do, and like,

568
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,060
I'm not hemorrhaging money anymore, like I once was,

569
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,220
so yeah, I can start doing that,

570
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,580
and I'm sure that will be a smart and I won't regret it.

571
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,420
Our dear departed papa would have been so pleased

572
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,100
to hear this news.

573
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,580
Good, yes.

574
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,620
I'm glad that he'll be happy, and I'm glad that he's dead.

575
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,460
Yeah.

576
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,540
Yeah, sick.

577
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,620
Is he actually dead?

578
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Ben, make the same joke in the drug cast.

579
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,580
No, you ding dong.

580
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,420
That was his ghost.

581
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,540
He drew a picture of his ghost.

582
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,380
Oh, I don't know.

583
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,380
I don't hear from your dad that much.

584
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,220
Is that true?

585
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,260
So, therefore, he must be dead.

586
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,540
A munchie, however, is in close communication

587
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,980
with everyone's dad, and is keeping tabs on all of them.

588
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,540
He's got the big map with all the red strings,

589
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,700
triangulating locations at any given time.

590
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,220
Right, anyway, is that everyone?

591
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,380
Has everyone said, I don't know,

592
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,700
we did resolutions, I do wanna talk about larger goals.

593
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,940
Goals are far more interesting.

594
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,940
Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I guess let's get into it.

595
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,180
Ben just basically said one of his,

596
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,860
but what's your big plan for 2018?

597
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,380
What are you gonna be producing

598
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,700
over the course of this year?

599
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,540
What'll be on the other side?

600
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,900
I have a few things.

601
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,780
My stupid fun little comics that I do

602
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,420
over on APSadventures.workpress.com.

603
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,060
What does that stand for again?

604
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,940
Adobe Photoshop Adventures.

605
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,460
Oh yeah, that's right.

606
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,660
Yeah, I did one during a stream,

607
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,340
like I drew a whole comic, and it was like,

608
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,700
ah, that's fun, I'll do it again.

609
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
I did another one, it's not finished yet,

610
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,340
but I wanna do more of that,

611
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,820
but that's obviously time consuming,

612
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,500
and it's fun, but it's not really a product

613
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,020
that I can be like, yeah, I could turn this into a real thing.

614
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,300
So I kinda just, well, I mean, it doesn't look very good,

615
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,660
and I'm not that good at drawing yet.

616
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,820
Just fucking print it as a zine.

617
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Oh, what's that?

618
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,940
It's a zine, dude.

619
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,900
What's a zine?

620
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,340
It's a zine, dude.

621
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,220
It's like a cheap fan magazine.

622
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,420
It's like a one man show, sort of thing.

623
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Yeah, you know, that 80s style Xerox grunge kind of aesthetic.

624
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,660
I mean, last year I had this idea

625
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,540
that I would make an album, a book, and something,

626
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,380
maybe a comic.

627
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,940
And a baby this year.

628
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,260
No, no, no, disgraceful.

629
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,660
I'm a baby, baby, it's you, it's you.

630
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,540
I mean, that is something, you know.

631
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,860
Not like making the baby,

632
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,900
but like getting the v-cards punched, that's something.

633
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,780
Yeah, oh, I'll give you a punch, all right.

634
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,100
Just come over to my crib someday.

635
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,020
You'll get that v-card abused heavily.

636
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,860
Yes, but like what I want is I want to continue doing

637
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,700
those comics to the point where I have so much of them

638
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,060
that I can actually release a big old book of them,

639
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,980
like just like Homestuck.

640
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,380
Just like Homestuck is in a funny book,

641
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,420
but it's not as good as like it's looking at it online

642
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,300
because there's so many flash pages and GIFs.

643
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
But I bought the Homestuck book and I'm reading it.

644
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,540
I'm like, this will be good to have one of these.

645
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,220
Hey, I've been wondering just about that book.

646
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,700
Ben has the first two Homestuck books,

647
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,180
but I read them, but I can't remember.

648
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,660
No, I don't think I have any Homestuck books,

649
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,980
but I have all the Problem Sleuth books.

650
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,940
Oh, shit. Yeah, those are good.

651
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,660
So like with the GIFs,

652
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,900
with like the high super fast GIFs of Homestuck,

653
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,380
I'm imagining that what Hussie does is on one page,

654
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,420
he puts the first frame, on the next page,

655
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,940
he puts the second, instructions are flip

656
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,900
at extreme speed back and forth between these.

657
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,140
Not actually.

658
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,500
I mean, it's a lot of the layout is kind of like terrible

659
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,260
because you can't accurately show,

660
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,060
because like a lot of the stuff in Homestuck

661
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,460
is like it moves across the screen real fast,

662
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,620
but what is moving across the screen

663
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,980
doesn't look like it's like drawn to be moving.

664
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
It's just a thing being dragged like really fast.

665
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,660
So it's like, it's great in motion.

666
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,060
It looks terrible like in what do you call them?

667
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Thumbnails.

668
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,380
It's like with those animation super sleuths,

669
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,500
do you have a frame capture on like one blurred

670
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,380
motion animation or like exposed.

671
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,060
This is a terrible anime, et cetera, et cetera.

672
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,780
Yeah, but yeah, I want to draw a bunch of comics

673
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,780
because those are more fun than trying to write a book.

674
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,620
I might do music as well, I don't know.

675
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,300
Basically what I want to do is I want to get

676
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,660
all hypocrite stuff done.

677
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,980
Hillary was the breakout hit of 2017.

678
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,780
Hillary was a pretty funny one,

679
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,260
but it's not that good to listen to.

680
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,020
And it was made in a day, that whole album.

681
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,540
If I make like, if I do like a month of like

682
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,020
doing a song in a day, that might be actually pretty great.

683
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,860
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,620
So, you know, I just, yeah, I just want to do

685
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,220
creative stuff that I like.

686
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,180
And in order to facilitate that,

687
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,180
I need to get hypocrite stuff done earlier

688
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,580
so that I have months and months where I can just like,

689
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,860
hmm, think about stuff and things.

690
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,980
Yeah, you gotta stick with this school.

691
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,780
My plan is to be creative and facilitate

692
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,580
the ability to be creative.

693
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,140
Respect.

694
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,340
The noblest of goals.

695
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,300
Yeah, that's just a good overarching life goal

696
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,960
to have that informs everything else that you do.

697
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,020
That's basically my life pattern for myself, more or less.

698
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,180
I'm sure you guys as well.

699
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,060
Like everything that I do,

700
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,180
every individual thing that I do

701
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,300
is done with the understanding that like,

702
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,700
this is a good idea, if and only if,

703
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,060
it in some way contributes to like,

704
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,060
that more of my future life will be spent

705
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,140
pursuing my own artistic endeavors.

706
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,260
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,540
And I mean, artistic endeavors, sure,

708
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,260
but I am always very conscious of.

709
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,500
Or just my own endeavors, like doing what I want to do.

710
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,580
Yeah, sure, sure.

711
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,060
I'm just very conscious personally

712
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,820
of I have a baseline economic reality I need to meet.

713
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,100
I need to achieve that.

714
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,300
And once I'm over that,

715
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,860
then I have a lot more flexibility to do whatever I want.

716
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,700
Yeah.

717
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,900
That's how I approach it.

718
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Yeah.

719
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,860
There's really no more like detailed,

720
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
I mean, I guess I could go into some details

721
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,940
of like some videos I plan to make.

722
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,780
If you want to.

723
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,300
But I don't know how long I could talk about that for,

724
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,140
because it's just.

725
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,740
You maybe take one that you want to share,

726
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,260
if you do want to share any of them.

727
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,740
Well, I don't mind sharing the ones.

728
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,180
It's basically I want to go over all the hypocrite videos

729
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,220
that were like the first in a series,

730
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,100
like Ratchet and Clank and Jack and Daxter

731
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,780
and Kingdom Hearts and stuff.

732
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,540
And I do the sequels to those.

733
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,420
So I would do GRPJ on Kingdom Hearts 2.

734
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,940
I would do a review of Rayman 2 and Ape Escape 2

735
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,420
and Ratchet and Clank 2 and Jack and Daxter 2.

736
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,860
And it'd just be like, I'm better at videos now.

737
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,540
And here's these popular games that everyone likes

738
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,380
clicking on.

739
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,220
And they'll all be good.

740
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,940
You need to release all those on a Tuesday.

741
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,420
Oh, whoa, that's a good idea.

742
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,700
That's a fun gimmick.

743
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,540
I might do that.

744
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,660
Excellent.

745
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,700
Yeah, all right.

746
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,540
That's cool.

747
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,380
I don't know.

748
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
I'm looking forward to it.

749
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,340
It's gonna be a good year.

750
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,420
It's gonna be a good year, I think, for all of us.

751
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,740
Ben's Kickstarter is wrapping up.

752
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,340
My Kickstarter. It's not done yet.

753
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,300
Oh, God, I want today.

754
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,620
Since you bring it up, I just want to say that today,

755
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,420
this very day, is the last day of my Kickstarter.

756
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,500
Oh, yeah?

757
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,060
When you, the listener, are listening to this.

758
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,020
So go to my fucking Twitter, link in the description.

759
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,460
We're fucking going for the final stretch goal,

760
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,660
which is that I buy a fucking Oculus Rift

761
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,380
and turn memes into reality.

762
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,780
Make the dream real.

763
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,140
Yes, make the dream real.

764
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,820
Send me surfing down the VR superhighway.

765
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Ben, you know, if you want to sell that

766
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,540
as something actually meaningful,

767
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,740
you know there's a VR program for Oculus Rift

768
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
where you can draw in VR and 3D,

769
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,060
so you can walk around the drawing

770
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,300
as you're drawing it and stuff.

771
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,700
I have seen it.

772
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,580
Yeah, I mean, if I get a,

773
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,740
I don't even know what I do with an Oculus Rift,

774
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,980
but I would, you can probably, you finally live.

775
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,100
You have just post photos on Twitter with it

776
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,380
and then mention, map every time.

777
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,820
I mean, I owe it all to him, man.

778
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,660
I owe it all to him.

779
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,660
He sparks the creative drive in you to get to the point

780
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,220
where you could buy an Oculus Rift.

781
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,060
That's true.

782
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,340
And they say capitalism doesn't work.

783
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,380
Yeah, excellent, excellent.

784
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,900
So Ben's going to get an Oculus Rift.

785
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,740
That's his goal for 2018.

786
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,060
Yeah, what I'm saying is that's my goal for 2018.

787
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,820
I can't wait for the Rowdy Funkers Cop Killers episode

788
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,380
all in VR. Oh my God.

789
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,700
Oh, the Oculus Rift theme.

790
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,380
Rowdy Funkers episode.

791
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,460
A five hour free video.

792
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,100
How could I not have thought of that?

793
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,700
Of course, of course.

794
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,860
Oh, that's the capstone of the saga.

795
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
Oh my God.

796
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,740
We got to get Munchy one too.

797
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,940
We got to get Munchy one too.

798
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,020
There's another special, dude.

799
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,300
We can fucking have VR adventures.

800
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,100
Guys, please get Ben this Oculus Rift.

801
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,220
So this can be real.

802
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,060
Please.

803
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
Yes.

804
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,260
I mean, this was just a fucking joke,

805
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,460
but now that we're talking about it,

806
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,100
the actual real world possibilities are just staggering.

807
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,580
Oh shit.

808
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
All this corruption will have been true all along.

809
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,500
This is all part of Ben's long game.

810
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,180
He's been playing the long con here.

811
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,420
I'm always playing the long con.

812
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,260
He's joking.

813
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
We all act like this is just spur of the moment,

814
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,660
but no, inside there's a calculated psychopath.

815
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,700
We just made those statements,

816
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,780
and then we didn't see, because we're on a podcast,

817
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,740
Ben, like it was a freeze frame,

818
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,180
but it turned red like death though.

819
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,940
And he's like, it's all according to plan.

820
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,020
I didn't have to say anything about the benefits

821
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,380
of the Oculus Rift.

822
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,580
They said it for me.

823
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,220
So I'm totally in the clear.

824
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,740
I don't look like the bad guy.

825
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,700
Dude, when Ben touches the Oculus Rift,

826
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,020
just like it does in all his memories,

827
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,980
he's come flooding back with his own plan.

828
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,740
But he's suppressed with his fucking mind,

829
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,380
and he's like, just as good as new.

830
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,540
Oh my God.

831
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,820
He's gonna be the god of the VR world.

832
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,740
Yeah, the god of the VR world.

833
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,700
Oh my God.

834
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,780
And Munchie's re-euk, right?

835
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh yes, oh it's perfect with his fat little body

836
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,180
with his little wings floating around.

837
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,900
Only instead of eating apples,

838
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,460
he eats a disgusting fast food food.

839
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,540
And it's, oh, it's whole pizzas.

840
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,060
Whole pizzas, oh, incredible.

841
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,540
You know, that just gets me thinking.

842
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,580
The wheels spinning in my head of like,

843
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,340
what we could do with that at a Radcon,

844
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,140
at a Radcon, at a place with the procrastinators.

845
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,660
That's sort of a goal

846
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,740
that is not like individual to any one of us,

847
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,340
but that's something that could like begin to,

848
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,180
I mean, I don't know.

849
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,820
We don't have like big plans.

850
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,860
That's the 2018 goal for all of you, the listeners,

851
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,700
to go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators,

852
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,020
give generously and make it happen.

853
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,860
It's true, man.

854
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,980
I want to meet up with my good boy, baby friends,

855
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,340
and suck everyone's dick.

856
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,620
That's what I want to do.

857
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,620
Indeed.

858
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,180
I think we're pretty firmly out of any Kickstarter jail

859
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,060
that we may have been in up to this point.

860
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,980
And I think that, yeah, man, the door's wide open.

861
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,060
And of course, not to mention,

862
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,380
like Digi's got plans to be moving sometime this year.

863
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,900
Things for me are looking way up in general

864
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,940
in terms of just like my YouTube success

865
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,780
and just like my economic stability.

866
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,860
Just getting closer.

867
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,060
I'm already above like technically a livable wage,

868
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,460
but it's lower than I'm comfortable doing at the moment.

869
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,700
So I gotta keep working, gotta keep grinding,

870
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,540
earn a little bit more,

871
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,740
and then once I'm at that point,

872
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,260
my student loans, they're getting way down there, dude.

873
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,820
They're way down there.

874
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,620
And they will, these will 100% be paid off in this year,

875
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,780
in this year without a question.

876
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,580
So that is very exciting for me.

877
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,020
I will no longer be a negative financial boy.

878
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,820
I will finally be positive.

879
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,660
And that's-

880
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,620
You'll finally be in the black.

881
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,900
Wait, what was the pause thing you just said?

882
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,740
Is that like that?

883
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,620
Is that that thing about like people who like to get aides?

884
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,460
Yes.

885
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,300
And it's like sexy for me?

886
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,140
Yeah, you're right.

887
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,980
That means you're, you know.

888
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
That's what I was saying.

889
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,020
You've got the gift to give.

890
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,260
I've got the gift, the gift, that's the one.

891
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,180
The gift, yes.

892
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,700
Well, the gift is the bug.

893
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,140
The two are one and the same.

894
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,980
Right?

895
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,060
God damn.

896
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,820
Degeneracy is really in a spiral right now in 2018.

897
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,420
It's the in thing to do.

898
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,500
The fact that it is the in thing to,

899
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,020
well, okay, I'm exaggerating a little bit,

900
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,580
but yeah, what the fuck, guys?

901
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,420
It's definitely you.

902
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,260
Please stop.

903
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,140
Let me see, what else am I doing?

904
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,460
Hey, I got plans.

905
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,820
I got some plans.

906
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,900
Weagua is proving to be a pretty strong success so far.

907
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,460
It's the content that I think I was more or less destined

908
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,140
to do, just some sort of regular content

909
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,340
to force me to make stuff.

910
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
Just, it's just like back in the T-Bap days.

911
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,180
I was forced to make an episode every week

912
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,860
and it forced me to get a little creative.

913
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,820
It's been really good for me.

914
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,820
So I'm gonna keep doing that for forever, for the next while.

915
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,780
And in the meantime.

916
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,300
Which ever comes first.

917
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,540
Indeed, indeed.

918
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,380
And just do it.

919
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,140
I don't know, for me, I'm pretty much staying the course

920
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,740
and just like trying to like grow

921
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,060
and everything's going very well for me.

922
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,140
So I'm just doing what I'm doing.

923
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,980
No surprises.

924
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,740
Though there will be surprises in terms of content

925
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,940
that people see for me in 2018.

926
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,720
Especially if I am able to go full time

927
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,820
and I'm finally set free to spend all my time

928
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,980
working on content.

929
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,660
Oh man, you guys don't even know.

930
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,700
I've been saying this forever.

931
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,460
The content that I work on every day

932
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,620
that is coming sometime soon.

933
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,680
When, when it goes to the show.

934
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,660
That is a good question.

935
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,500
Who knows man?

936
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,380
When it's one piece Nate, we filmed it like 60 years ago.

937
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
Oh shit, Ben was that, didn't even know that.

938
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,220
Ben helped Ben.

939
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,820
Dude, I got incredible footage that day.

940
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,100
You, we certainly did.

941
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,060
The footage was ridiculous. I did.

942
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,660
Yeah, Ben held the camera, Ben held the camera.

943
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,300
It was me.

944
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,660
Someday soon, someday soon everybody.

945
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,940
2018, 2018, that's something you can mark

946
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,140
on your fucking calendar this year.

947
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,980
A promise.

948
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,260
The whole year, mark the whole year on your calendar.

949
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,100
At some point.

950
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,660
Yeah, block out this whole space of time

951
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,860
from January 1st to December 31st.

952
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,540
You're gonna wanna have that time booked for me.

953
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,140
Cause I'm gonna be filling it.

954
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,900
Every orifice.

955
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,380
Just like your hero, Shadman.

956
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,740
Every hole is a goal.

957
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,940
Every hole is a goal.

958
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,660
You know, I respect Shadman as a businessman

959
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,420
and as a rebel and as an entrepreneur.

960
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,780
But his art is, I am growing a little bit out of favor

961
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,820
with the art itself.

962
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,420
Well, that's what he, you were just telling me

963
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,140
how he's your hero and your favorite person

964
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,980
you aspire just to be like him.

965
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,780
Because he has the audacity of hope

966
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,380
to quote my hero, Barack Obama.

967
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,900
Or was that Hillary Clinton?

968
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,860
I can't remember.

969
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,700
No, that was.

970
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,820
You know, he is a literal internationally wanted criminal

971
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,980
as I understand it.

972
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,820
Wait, what?

973
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,640
And he just doesn't give a fuck

974
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,940
and he just keeps drawing lolliporn.

975
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,220
Why is he an internationally wanted criminal?

976
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,500
Because he draws lolliporn.

977
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,460
I thought it was because he had a fucking scary skull.

978
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,340
They're cracking down on skulls in Europe

979
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,100
in a big way right now.

980
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
But yeah, he's just like,

981
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,540
if his identity was revealed, he'd be real fucked.

982
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,660
And I just, I don't know, he just has a passion

983
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,140
and he's uncompromising in his devotion to it.

984
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,500
And I really respect that.

985
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,420
That's all.

986
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,700
That's pretty neat, honestly.

987
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,940
Yeah, super neat.

988
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,500
And he carved out his own space.

989
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,260
Yeah, he's kind of a hero, kind of a hero.

990
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,740
But anyway.

991
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,420
All right, that's what I'm doing.

992
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,260
That's what I'm doing.

993
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,340
What about you, Tom?

994
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,940
I have a lot of stuff going on in 2018, hopefully.

995
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,860
I think the big thing for this year, like macro goal,

996
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,220
is just like focus.

997
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,820
Cause last year I did a bunch of things

998
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,020
and it was a clusterfuck and I hated it and it sucked.

999
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,340
So I just, I killed off one of my YouTube channels.

1000
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,180
I was running two of them.

1001
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,460
So last week, I put the kebab

1002
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,860
wash on Rebel Pixels cause I, it'd been like months

1003
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,780
and no one had sent me anything.

1004
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,020
No one responded to my emails.

1005
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,900
And it was just a distraction at this point anyway.

1006
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,660
Cause the Patreon never got any money.

1007
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,940
It was just like, it was a lot of time to make those videos

1008
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,020
and as informative and as helpful they were

1009
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,820
to thousands of people, they didn't pay me anything.

1010
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,580
So fuck it.

1011
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,420
So.

1012
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
Rest in peace, Rebel Pixels.

1013
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,980
So that, that went away.

1014
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,120
And I'm just focusing on 3D this year.

1015
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,180
So my old channel, which is not my new channel again,

1016
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,580
it's all about 3D.

1017
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,740
So I'm going to do analysis videos on 3D.

1018
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,580
Yeah.

1019
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,820
Your Berserk series is going along swimmingly as I saw.

1020
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,660
Yeah.

1021
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,860
I'm going to work on today on a, a, a interlude

1022
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,260
on land of the lustrous cause no one will fucking shut up

1023
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,580
in the comments about who built land of the lustrous.

1024
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,940
It proves everything you're saying.

1025
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,700
Oh, that's who's so sick, you know, Coney, right?

1026
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,740
That's, that's what that is.

1027
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,580
Yeah, right.

1028
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,420
So of course, like.

1029
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,260
I also just downloaded that today.

1030
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,340
It's, it's fucking amazing.

1031
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,180
I watched it.

1032
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,020
It's great.

1033
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,060
The month after I start the series, you know,

1034
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,500
Joseki Nocuni drops and like everyone's like,

1035
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,140
Oh, well now anime, 3D anime has always been amazing

1036
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,580
because this one show is great.

1037
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,740
And we never shit on it ever.

1038
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,260
Berserk just happened guys.

1039
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,500
Berserk just happened.

1040
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,340
Let's not forget.

1041
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,380
Well, the thing is like, I have like clips from like

1042
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,740
dozens of 3D shows that all have like the same like

1043
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,100
kind of weirdness to them.

1044
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,820
And then like the next part is going to talk about 3D anime

1045
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,860
and video games and how that's kind of looks weird sometimes.

1046
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,100
But this one show, of course.

1047
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,780
So I got to, I got to put the whole series proper on hold

1048
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,060
and be like, all right, you peasants.

1049
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,140
You know, I watched some of Joseki Nocuni just in clips.

1050
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,980
I didn't think it was like perfectly.

1051
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,940
It's still a little bit uncanny valley, but, but anyway,

1052
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,780
I'm sorry, I don't mean to.

1053
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,020
It's much, it's much, it's much better for sure.

1054
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,580
And I got some real laughs.

1055
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,940
There's, there's some good stuff in there for sure.

1056
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,860
It's, it's fucking great.

1057
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,420
So I'm working on that series.

1058
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,260
And then I'm also doing more animation,

1059
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
just like making 3D.

1060
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,100
So the whole channel is going to be on making 3D

1061
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,780
and talking about it and just enjoying 3D as an art form.

1062
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,740
There's one problem with your whole, a business model here.

1063
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,860
And it's that 3D pig disgusting Tom, 2D waifu for life.

1064
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,620
You need to re-configure your whole life.

1065
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,980
You know, I'm just like, like your hero, Shadman,

1066
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,020
I'm a disgusting degenerate with a mission

1067
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,180
and I'm just sticking to it.

1068
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,900
So respect my vision as you respect his.

1069
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,700
I'll try.

1070
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,540
I'll try.

1071
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,380
Do your best.

1072
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,220
I'll have to get some lollies in there.

1073
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,260
And that's how I'll gain your.

1074
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,100
That would help.

1075
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,940
That would help.

1076
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,460
Yeah. So I'm doing at least,

1077
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,940
I think I'm going to try and shoot for three more animations,

1078
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,180
short animations this year,

1079
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,140
kind of like her that I did the end of last year.

1080
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,220
I'm sure you've learned a lot

1081
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,940
in the process of making that first one, right?

1082
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,780
Hopefully faster.

1083
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,460
Yeah, there was, yeah.

1084
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,940
The next one I'm doing is a lot simpler.

1085
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,020
So I want to get the first one for this year

1086
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,220
done by the end of February.

1087
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,860
Then the next one will be much more complicated.

1088
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,420
And I want to try and end the year

1089
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,020
with like a full like music video,

1090
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,220
which will be like three minutes long.

1091
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,260
And lots of crazy fucking choreography.

1092
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,100
So I'm probably going to take an actual

1093
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,940
like online course on 3D animation.

1094
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,460
Watch out, Monty Ohm.

1095
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,660
There's another man looking to fill that grave.

1096
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,140
The only way I can live up to him

1097
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,700
is to clearly just kill myself,

1098
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,980
which might be the plan.

1099
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,380
If I don't, if I don't get swole by 30,

1100
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,580
I'll just have to like pick out a plot right next to him,

1101
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,540
just be like, buddy's in the grave.

1102
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,180
But yeah, that's also I'm going to be making

1103
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,340
just like more just models in general.

1104
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,780
I'll be, I just did my first live stream of the year

1105
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
yesterday.

1106
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,660
I'm going to do one every Friday this year.

1107
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,300
That's the plan unless like something really stupid happens.

1108
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,460
And just do 3D on stream.

1109
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,460
So I'll probably, I'm going to actually make a 3D model

1110
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,860
of Foss, the main character of second okay,

1111
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,340
that's going to be my next model,

1112
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,780
to get them clicks, get them Patreon bucks.

1113
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,060
That's the way to do it, that's the way to do it.

1114
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,700
But really though, why not?

1115
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,100
Why not do the thing that's popular

1116
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,780
if you're just going to practice anyway?

1117
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,980
It's certainly, yeah.

1118
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,700
I mean, that's kind of the idea behind it.

1119
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,340
So I'm going to do that.

1120
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,460
And then in the background,

1121
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,740
I'm just going to keep writing the script for Sorceloss,

1122
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,060
which is not dead, it's just,

1123
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,420
it went through a huge rewrite all last year

1124
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,900
and I finally figured out what to do with it.

1125
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,140
Tom, Tom, I gotta say, when I saw that update video,

1126
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,060
I forget what it was titled,

1127
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,020
but the one that was saying Rebel Pixels is dead.

1128
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,340
I thought that it was going to be,

1129
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,900
Sorceress lost is dead.

1130
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,860
Like that's what I thought you were announcing,

1131
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,260
but I'm glad that it wasn't.

1132
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,740
Never, it's going to survive for all time.

1133
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,020
No, actually the story,

1134
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,980
I just had like a huge change of heart

1135
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,820
with how I wanted to do it

1136
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,980
and it took all year to figure it out.

1137
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,660
And I talked to like a couple of my comic friends

1138
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,180
going like, what should I do for this?

1139
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
And then it finally clicked in like November.

1140
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,380
I'm like, oh.

1141
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,300
Now that's an up and coming female politician

1142
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,740
who was going to lose to the evil race realist,

1143
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,620
male supremacist.

1144
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,820
Now she's going to shatter that glass ceiling.

1145
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,820
It has nothing to do with real life events.

1146
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,380
Excellent, yeah, I look forward to it.

1147
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,020
I was really inspired by what happened.

1148
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,980
It let me figure out what's going to happen

1149
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,820
in my story.

1150
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,460
Like what if someone didn't pay any attention

1151
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,780
to US politics, but still read what happened?

1152
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,540
Is there anyone who's like done that?

1153
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,380
That'd be incredible.

1154
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,220
Yeah, me.

1155
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,060
Right.

1156
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,100
Me and you.

1157
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,940
That's true.

1158
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,340
So I think that's pretty much it is just.

1159
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,260
It's pretty full schedule.

1160
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,340
Well, also the whole like moving out thing

1161
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,260
I have to move out this year.

1162
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,220
So I don't know really what's going to go on to that.

1163
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,540
I'm either going to try and get like a small studio apartment

1164
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,820
or live in a car.

1165
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,380
That'll be fun.

1166
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,220
Hey man.

1167
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,820
Whichever feels right at the time.

1168
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,660
Yeah.

1169
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,220
Cincinnati, you get a decent apartment,

1170
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,820
you know, okay for 500 bucks a month.

1171
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,580
So it's pretty all right.

1172
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,980
So that's your horrible.

1173
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,780
But then again, if we're going to Boston,

1174
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,140
I'm already like right outside of Boston.

1175
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,540
So why would I go all the way somewhere else?

1176
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,380
Yeah, that's true.

1177
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,660
I'm kind of waiting on you and Digi,

1178
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,580
what you guys are doing.

1179
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,940
And I'll kind of plan appropriately.

1180
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,500
He's holding out for a hero, ladies and gentlemen.

1181
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,980
We'll see how that goes.

1182
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,260
Well, yeah.

1183
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
Hey man, run your own shit though.

1184
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,100
Don't wait too long.

1185
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,540
I don't want to fuck over your plans and whatnot.

1186
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,420
If there's nothing in place by like April,

1187
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,020
that's when I'm really going to start pulling a trigger.

1188
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,380
Because I got like $18,000 right now in savings.

1189
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,540
Hey, not bad.

1190
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,260
I'm just going to try and hit 20.

1191
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,820
And then I'm probably just going to like leave my job.

1192
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,820
And then because like I'm last.

1193
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,020
Yeah, it's fucking awful.

1194
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,180
I haven't, I worked six hours this week out of 40

1195
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,940
because like there's no heat

1196
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,300
and it's been like negative degrees every night.

1197
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,060
So I'm just like, well, I don't want to die.

1198
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,100
So I'm just not going to go into work, I guess.

1199
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,220
So my paycheck is going to be abysmal.

1200
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,460
But yeah, once that's done, like my student loans,

1201
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,900
I can pay with PCP money and then some.

1202
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,420
So that's not a big deal.

1203
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,140
I'm glad to hear it.

1204
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,540
And if the PCP keeps growing, then I won't need a job.

1205
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,420
And then I can just live in a car with.

1206
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,340
Oh, good.

1207
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,820
The ideal living situation.

1208
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,260
It's going to be great.

1209
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,700
Dude, there's a.

1210
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,580
Vlogs while driving.

1211
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,620
I mean, that's a thing people do.

1212
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,420
Didn't that guy, who was that guy who announced

1213
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,740
that he was going to be homeless and vlog homeless

1214
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,060
for like a full year?

1215
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,220
It was like one of the big reactor guys on YouTube

1216
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,620
who's dead now or something.

1217
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,260
Joey salads or something.

1218
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:18,860
I don't know.

1219
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,060
It was something like that.

1220
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,420
That sounds right to me.

1221
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,860
That sounds like that sounds like the name of a person

1222
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,700
who would do that.

1223
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,140
Good old Joey salads.

1224
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,140
That's a real name.

1225
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,580
That's a real.

1226
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,740
I know it's a real guy.

1227
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,860
I don't know God.

1228
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,380
I'm taking pot shots at him anyway.

1229
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,060
No, Joey salads is a real dude.

1230
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,540
He's actually pretty successful.

1231
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,980
He's a real person.

1232
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,420
Guys, please don't laugh at his.

1233
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,020
I can't I can't I can't it's not it's not acceptable.

1234
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,340
I agree.

1235
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,900
That name is not acceptable.

1236
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,420
No, it's pretty pretty bad.

1237
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,060
It's pretty bad.

1238
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,700
I scoff, frankly.

1239
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,900
Well, that's that's going to be fun.

1240
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,340
We'll see how that goes.

1241
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,420
Hopefully it won't go too bad.

1242
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,420
Hopefully, man, hopefully.

1243
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,980
Patreon.com slash save me.

1244
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,340
Give me money so I can make this stuff happen faster.

1245
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:18,340
Yeah, so I'm going to I'll add a lot of a lot of gold

1246
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,300
to give me an Oculus Rift, you know, I'll get an HTC Vive

1247
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,020
and then we can have a battle.

1248
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,500
Let's start a rivalry going on.

1249
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,540
Yeah, I'll have a mansion in VR.

1250
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,380
Let me tell you.

1251
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,900
Well, just like with D&D, just like me and Tom

1252
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,180
will just make opposing YouTube videos.

1253
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,420
I'll say why the Oculus Rift is great

1254
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,220
and Tom will say why it's shit.

1255
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,220
That would legitimately be hilarious.

1256
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,500
And I would totally do that.

1257
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,140
Looking forward to more of that.

1258
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,860
All right, well, Ben, did you want to talk more

1259
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,100
about your goals or did you I don't know, you said some stuff

1260
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,660
before, but I have I have I have a couple art goals in mind.

1261
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,300
I want to.

1262
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,740
OK, so I'm working on Vapors 3 right now.

1263
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,620
I'm hoping that gets done in not too, too long.

1264
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,700
Maybe like, well, I don't want to put a number on it.

1265
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,620
But like, yeah, not I'm not like six months or anything.

1266
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,540
Yeah, OK, significantly less than that.

1267
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,140
After that, I'm not quite sure.

1268
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,620
I think I think I'm going to probably do

1269
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,460
Champion Chapter 2 after Vapors 3.

1270
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,500
Unless maybe I have a great idea for Vapors 4

1271
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
and I just want to bang out another one real quick.

1272
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,260
But I'm also going to do another game.

1273
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,140
Like I'm going to I'm going to start Champion Chapter 2

1274
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,540
with another like game section.

1275
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,980
And I want to do that.

1276
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,140
I also want to I want to make a video.

1277
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,340
This is not like a big project.

1278
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,020
It's just a side thing.

1279
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,340
I want to make a video that's just me going through all my code

1280
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,500
in Game Maker and just explaining how the first game that I made

1281
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,980
works kind of as a kind of just as a little like blog thing.

1282
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,940
Like that sounds cool.

1283
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,820
I'd like to watch that.

1284
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,460
Yeah, yeah, just take a couple hours and like go through it

1285
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,700
and be like, this how did I do this?

1286
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,620
I forget. Let me.

1287
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,300
Oh, yeah, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, a couple hours.

1288
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,620
That game takes me like a couple minutes to beat.

1289
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,540
That doesn't make sense.

1290
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,420
What are you saying?

1291
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,300
That's ridiculous.

1292
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,260
Yeah. Code is effortless, Ben.

1293
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,580
I know, I know, but, you know, I struggle.

1294
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,100
I struggle with even the meagerest of tasks.

1295
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,580
So, so, so, yeah, I want to make that.

1296
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,780
And I'm going to so.

1297
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,260
And I don't know what I'm going to work on past Vapors 3

1298
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,780
and Champion Chapter 2 and the game, but while I'm doing all that,

1299
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,020
I'm probably going to do more kick starters.

1300
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,060
Like I'm going to I'm going to kick start Vapors 2

1301
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,140
after at some point, maybe I'll wait a little bit and then do that.

1302
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,820
I guess if Vapors 3 is done by then,

1303
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,780
maybe I'll kick start Vapors 3.

1304
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,700
Oh, and I know we joked about it a while ago,

1305
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,620
but I'm like, I'm actually unironically

1306
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,900
considering making DVDs of the Nuzlocs.

1307
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,980
Like I got some DVD software and I'm like,

1308
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,220
I've been putting together menus just because I think it's neat.

1309
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,860
And because I just I would just want to own one,

1310
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,020
even if nobody bought one, I think it's cool.

1311
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,020
So, yeah, maybe I want one.

1312
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,980
Nobody, none of us have like set anything.

1313
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,260
I know the the Pleeve and the Weave plans on being set to disk,

1314
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,460
but no one's actually pulled the trigger on that yet.

1315
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,900
Yeah, I would like to see that happen.

1316
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,700
The thing about that is that looking into it, I am like,

1317
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,380
it was really difficult to find like how to like make

1318
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,660
like a professionally set up DVD.

1319
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,900
And I kind of wonder if anyone else even gave it any thought.

1320
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,500
I don't know.

1321
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
With regards to Pleeve and the Weave.

1322
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,620
Like, we all know the level of planning

1323
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,220
that went into the Pleeve and the Weave, of course.

1324
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,060
So, you know, I'm sure they've got to figure it out.

1325
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,740
Like my like my DVDs, they're going to be an experience.

1326
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,820
They're going to have menus.

1327
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,220
They're they're going to it's going to be like

1328
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,900
have like a chapter selection.

1329
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,820
It's going to be it's going to be the full work.

1330
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,460
You're going to have like a full DVD like experience.

1331
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,860
Ben, is it like a like a like a special like Adobe

1332
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,060
something or other Adobe fucking show time

1333
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,900
when that helps you build DVD menus and things?

1334
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,300
I don't know.

1335
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,860
I found a DVD architect that I got a free trial of.

1336
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,020
Yeah, because because for for my like for my animation stuff,

1337
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,660
since it's like, you know, you can submit it online

1338
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,060
and most people do or on USB, but they want you as part of the course

1339
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,660
to figure out how to make a professional looking DVD

1340
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,420
of your animation to hand in.

1341
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,500
And if you don't have that, you don't get full marks.

1342
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,180
And it's not that difficult.

1343
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,660
I don't think I didn't do like special menus.

1344
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,460
Help me.

1345
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,100
I guess talk details after the show.

1346
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,460
No, tell me right now.

1347
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,540
Well, it's it's really I mean, I didn't do like a very elaborate menu or anything.

1348
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,380
But it's basically you just that there's a software that there are softwares out

1349
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,020
and you just you have to render your video files in like a DVD format.

1350
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,060
Like HD stuff doesn't work.

1351
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,420
It has to be like a deep because like DVDs have a certain amount,

1352
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,140
like eight gigabytes of space.

1353
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,180
You have to make it the right sort of format so that it could all fit on.

1354
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,700
Well, well, you and you and Davoo both said the thing.

1355
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,300
You both said there's software out there.

1356
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,860
I've been looking for software.

1357
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,260
I'm trying to remember that there's an Adobe thing.

1358
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,140
There's an it's like it's a blue Adobe.

1359
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,620
It's a blue Adobe thing called something something.

1360
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,620
Adobe Blu-ray.

1361
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,700
Let me let me crack on my keyboard and find it.

1362
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,220
All right, Ben, do you know what a light scribe DVD is?

1363
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,140
No, you should get a light scribe DVD.

1364
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,220
OK, because this is how you make them super cool.

1365
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,580
So you get a light scribe DVD burner and what that is, it burns a DVD is normal.

1366
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,740
But then the the top of the disc is like, I don't know how it works.

1367
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,860
It's like heat sensitive so that you can burn directly a black and white image

1368
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,740
to the top of the disc.

1369
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,740
You don't put a sticker on there.

1370
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,460
It's like burned on top of the discs so you can make them look super professional.

1371
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,780
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1372
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,180
So I can just burn the image right onto it.

1373
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,300
Yeah, you just take you take an image

1374
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,540
and it burns a black and white version of the picture right onto the disc.

1375
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,500
It doesn't like peel off or anything.

1376
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,100
That is the greatest.

1377
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,060
So that's what you need.

1378
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,580
That is exactly right there.

1379
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,900
Yes, yes, yes.

1380
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,140
It's it's called Adobe Encore.

1381
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,380
Adobe Encore. OK.

1382
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,180
Yeah, I don't think they have it on the CC like a creative cloud thing.

1383
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,460
But I think that the last one was CS6.

1384
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,340
But you know, you can you can acquire that program.

1385
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,700
Yeah, I have the means.

1386
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,900
I can seize the means of how ominous.

1387
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,420
How ominous, yes.

1388
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,980
By use license on eBay.

1389
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,940
What are you guys talking about?

1390
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,380
Yeah, so have we all gone through our plans now?

1391
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,380
I feel like we pretty much wound through them.

1392
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,540
I was about now.

1393
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,500
Yeah, I mean, I sort of yeah.

1394
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,700
Yeah, I sort of like skimmed over like specifics

1395
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,940
and how I'm going to make videos.

1396
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,820
But it's really just it's not much for me to say

1397
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,460
other than I'm going to try to do them faster and still be good.

1398
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,020
And that's, you know.

1399
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,260
Yeah, sure.

1400
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,500
I just I mean, since this is the PCP,

1401
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,620
I mean, I was I wanted to say that this I think is definitely going to be the year.

1402
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,580
Assuming things go as they've been going, where I personally am emancipated at last.

1403
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,700
I thought it was going to be the last couple of years.

1404
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,020
But now now there is a clear, trackable path of progress

1405
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,100
where things are really going well and I could really see how

1406
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,620
within the first half of this year, things get to a place where it's,

1407
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,180
you know, it'll make sense.

1408
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,740
Like I'll be able to finally break out and then consider doing YouTube full time,

1409
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,940
which will free me up to explore YouTube possibilities with the PCP.

1410
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,020
And then and then we'll just see where that goes.

1411
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,660
Well, speaking of that.

1412
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:54,100
Do we have anything to say on the idea of PCP HQ as a plan for 2018?

1413
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,580
That's that's what I'm talking about.

1414
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,900
Really, when we didn't really talk about PCP goals,

1415
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,620
do we have anything we plan on doing with the PCP this year?

1416
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,340
Yeah, about the show itself.

1417
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,060
I don't know about you guys.

1418
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,300
I would like to bring in more guests where possible.

1419
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,860
I've got a couple of people kicking around.

1420
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,940
We talked about a couple of before the show.

1421
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,060
Sure, be nice.

1422
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,460
Oh, no.

1423
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,260
Oh, yes.

1424
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,420
Oh, yes.

1425
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,340
No.

1426
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,540
Let's just say we're going to take a trip to the dark side.

1427
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,140
Everybody.

1428
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:26,900
You know, you don't understand how bad you don't understand how great

1429
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,100
an idea I think that is.

1430
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,500
It's it's a yeah.

1431
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,660
Yeah, I know.

1432
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,180
Like why would we not want that?

1433
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,620
Well, OK, but we're just I mean, that is one thing I've been thinking about.

1434
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,260
And also, like the the PCP episode that came out before this was like a

1435
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,580
totally different format, the interviews and stuff.

1436
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,220
I want to keep mixing up content like that.

1437
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,180
I enjoyed that thought that was fun.

1438
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:49,780
I don't know.

1439
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,100
I want to mix things up this year.

1440
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,420
And we did it.

1441
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,020
We did pretty much the exact same thing the entire year last year.

1442
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,940
And there's been some new stuff.

1443
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,420
The PCP animated that's like pretty much started this year more or less.

1444
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,660
Those are great.

1445
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,180
I want to keep doing this in mind.

1446
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,980
People keep making them.

1447
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:09,940
You know, that's I think I want to to finally get off my my A.S.

1448
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:16,180
and and and get some PCP races organized and happening.

1449
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,060
I did I did write up like a like a guide for how it should be done

1450
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,380
so I can refer to it and show people what they have to do.

1451
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,900
But the the the PCP races are going to be a little different

1452
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,660
if the the the next one we do at least.

1453
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,780
Yeah, yeah, where it's it's more about from the beginning.

1454
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,420
But like we I'll run through the the basic idea.

1455
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:42,660
People gather to record and then we spin a wheel of what game

1456
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,900
they have to get and play and it will be like a free game they can find

1457
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,220
or you know something hopefully that they all have or can easily acquire.

1458
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:57,020
And then they from that point have to go and play and speed run the game

1459
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,180
on get to whatever point it is and then get the footage back to me

1460
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,700
after like a set amount of time from the very beginning of the recording.

1461
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,180
And the it's going to be more of like a frantic like oh my God.

1462
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,380
I'm downloading the game.

1463
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,460
It's taken too long.

1464
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,980
And then you got a speed runner and it's going to be very funny.

1465
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,940
And yeah, I like it.

1466
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,620
And yeah, and then we're going to go when I watch the footage

1467
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,380
and it's going to be it's going to be more of a structure that encourages

1468
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,060
people to to, you know, try to go really fast

1469
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,860
and to be really frantic and unprepared.

1470
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,060
And it also means that people don't have any sort of idea of,

1471
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,900
you know, getting their time perfect by spent like you, Nate,

1472
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,020
playing the thing a hundred times every night to get it.

1473
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,460
It's bad. Yeah.

1474
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,420
But that's the fun of it.

1475
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,660
Well, they just won't get done if they take so much time.

1476
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:56,060
Like the reason the races have never been like it's just hard to get people

1477
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,900
to say, OK, I have time to practice this for 20 hours a day.

1478
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,020
Like nobody has that time, but they want to have that time.

1479
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,820
And it's just never going to happen unless it's more of a speed thing.

1480
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,740
We can always choose to do certain races like that if we so choose in the future.

1481
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,420
But yeah, if we want to pump them out regularly, something like this,

1482
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,780
well, I don't know about regularly, maybe one or two months or something.

1483
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,820
But like, yeah, whatever.

1484
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,900
Yeah, more than I want that to be a thing that happens.

1485
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,180
Because those races were great.

1486
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,980
Like the first Dark Souls race was one of the best.

1487
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,820
Oh, it's legendary. It's legendary.

1488
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,580
Everyone, if you haven't watched it, go watch the PCP Dark Souls race.

1489
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,940
It's incredible. I'd say the Pokemon race is equally legendary.

1490
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,180
I don't know about that.

1491
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:45,260
So there were some some highlights of that for sure.

1492
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,180
Yeah, certainly my favorite.

1493
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,900
The draw cast have been going strong.

1494
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,780
I've been happy to see that.

1495
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,700
Great. And I feel like they're underappreciated.

1496
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,980
I feel like they're some of the best content that comes out on this channel.

1497
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,460
And I feel like they're underviewed.

1498
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,300
No, no, no.

1499
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,260
But they're they're way fun.

1500
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,260
And they get people and they get people like, you know, drawn along with us

1501
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,860
and, you know, people tweet us, you know, like, oh, here's how I did a challenge.

1502
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,340
And I love that shit.

1503
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,620
You know what we could do?

1504
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,700
We could we could combine the idea of having guests and having draw casts.

1505
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,340
We could we could maybe get like an art guest to be on a draw cast.

1506
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,260
That would be an interesting new thing. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

1507
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,220
And you must be, for example.

1508
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,380
No, he's banned from the PCP.

1509
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,420
There will be no mention of his name, his cursed name.

1510
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,580
Picasso, give him an art tab.

1511
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,020
We need we need to get Chris Chan in on a draw cast.

1512
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,260
Oh, oh, yeah. Imagine.

1513
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,700
It's time. Yeah. Yeah.

1514
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:49,020
But the possibilities are end full, but there's a lot of them.

1515
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,460
Yeah, man. Yeah.

1516
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,100
I don't know. Mix and stuff up.

1517
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,940
Try new things.

1518
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,780
I'm excited to do more of that in the coming year.

1519
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,100
And if you guys have any suggestions, you know, feel free to leave them in the comments.

1520
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,020
You know, I'll take them out. I'll check them out.

1521
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,820
Yeah, there you go. I don't know.

1522
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,300
All right. I feel like we're good.

1523
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,700
I feel like we've exhausted everything.

1524
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,420
We're fucking done.

1525
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,780
Agreed? OK.

1526
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,900
I guess. I mean, the only thing left that we didn't really talk about is

1527
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,580
PCP HQ and or a new Radcon, but we don't know anything about it.

1528
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,740
Yeah, we just want it to happen.

1529
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:27,620
We all still want it still waiting.

1530
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,780
I don't know. Like I remember I had said a while ago that we should just set

1531
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,500
a date and figure it out, guys.

1532
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,500
Just make yourself available for that day tomorrow at one p.m.

1533
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,820
I can take off a week from work and like be at a Radcon sometime.

1534
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,820
And I just need to know while in advance and I can do it.

1535
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,620
Same. I need to know quite a while in advance for plain ticket reasons.

1536
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,300
Sure. Sure.

1537
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,300
But we got a week that that's on us.

1538
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,380
We got to figure that out.

1539
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,980
We got to commit to that and make it happen.

1540
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,580
Though also the location was always an issue, but.

1541
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,460
Right.

1542
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,660
Yeah, I don't know.

1543
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,500
I mean, you did like a like a mini

1544
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,820
Radcon with within the Boston thing.

1545
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,220
I don't know whether that's like public knowledge, like secret classified documents.

1546
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,740
No, not at all. Yeah, yeah.

1547
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,660
Yeah, and Ben and Digi and Munchie and stuff.

1548
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,420
You guys were there in person in real life.

1549
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,540
It wasn't really a Radcon.

1550
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,540
We were just hanging out in the same place.

1551
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,060
Well, that's what a Radcon should be.

1552
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,060
I just want to hang out for a bit.

1553
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,220
I don't. I have no interest in that.

1554
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,940
Well, I mean, I do, but I will not go if there's like just hanging out going on.

1555
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,700
Just letting you know. Just letting you know.

1556
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,580
Well, I know, but like, I understand.

1557
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,780
Well, we have to put in some work to like make it happen to arrange where

1558
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,500
and how it's going to be. So that's really on us.

1559
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,900
I think the biggest, the biggest problem with it so far has just been

1560
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
that we don't have a place to do it anymore.

1561
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,740
That really is.

1562
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,140
That was that. Digi's gigantic house was great.

1563
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,020
And Victor, as the cameraman, was incredible.

1564
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,220
And I'm so sad that we won't have him unless we can convince him there.

1565
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:06,020
Like if we do do a Kickstarter, I'm happy to try to give him some money.

1566
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,820
You know, yeah, if we could.

1567
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,020
I mean, just just ideas, just ideas.

1568
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,140
So now, hey, here's an update, folks.

1569
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,660
Now that so much of the plebe and the weave has come out,

1570
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,300
would you have any problem with a PCP Kickstarter for, you know,

1571
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,580
Radcon Awakening or perhaps we'd probably give it a new name.

1572
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,860
So it's no longer at Radcon anymore.

1573
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,460
I don't know.

1574
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,060
Feel free to leave comments.

1575
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,060
I'll read them. I'll check them out.

1576
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,100
I'm going to bet.

1577
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,660
I mean, I'm imagining that the people who are interested in making that happen

1578
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,420
would have been fine with it all along.

1579
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,100
Generally speaking.

1580
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,260
Probably right.

1581
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:43,780
Well, that's that, Aaron, our dirty laundry in a way.

1582
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,620
2018's over.

1583
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,980
Go over 2018.

1584
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,420
Let's let's indeed let's let's go to those questions, guys.

1585
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,780
By the way, before we read a question, I want to read a comment.

1586
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:01,020
So as you know, everybody, hashtag ask PCP on the Twitter is the tag.

1587
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,020
We every Saturday we record, we put out a little thing.

1588
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:08,700
Yeah, OK, we got we got a friend here to address our right.

1589
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,300
So, you know, I always tweet or we somebody tweets Saturday, you know,

1590
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,940
to remind everybody to send in questions.

1591
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,860
And so as you've seen, we've taken less questions from there

1592
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,580
and more from the patron discord, which, I mean, is just where we want to

1593
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,220
incentivize people to be patrons seems reasonable to me.

1594
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,140
But a friend of ours here, the one true Henry had a comment about this

1595
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,820
that let's just take a moment to address.

1596
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,860
Here's here's a response to us asking for questions on Twitter.

1597
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,740
Why do you even ask Twitter when you only take one question?

1598
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,820
If you just restrict it to Patreon, that will encourage more people to sign up.

1599
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,420
You are just giving people a false sense of hope

1600
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,980
that their question will be read on the pod case.

1601
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,700
Henry, my dude, what the great Henry Yoshi.

1602
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,820
Yeah, dog, he's back.

1603
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,900
He's back. Listen, dumbass.

1604
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,860
You are a silly, silly boy.

1605
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,740
Look, look, you just you're just not what is this that we like owe people

1606
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,300
to be on the like if we tweet that we will only take, like, you know,

1607
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,740
if you watch the show that we take like a pity question.

1608
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,380
It's a joke. We address this at the time.

1609
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,500
We take like one or two and you're like, oh, you're giving people a false

1610
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,140
sense of hope their question will be read.

1611
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,940
Well, maybe make it a good question and it'll be the one that we read.

1612
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,060
So what exactly is your fucking grievance here?

1613
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,980
I don't like this point might be that

1614
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,140
people who would want to ask a question instead of just giving us a dollar

1615
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,260
or whatever and getting in on it, they're instead just rolling the dice

1616
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,020
every week and hoping I think he's just mad that his question has never been asked.

1617
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,740
Except for this one, except for this one.

1618
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,100
That could be a possibility, which just encourages people to be annoying

1619
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,100
and title ourselves because that now we are reading his question.

1620
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:01,780
I am so sorry that we read one question from the Twitter as opposed to zero.

1621
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,540
Like you suggest that we do.

1622
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,500
I am so sorry that we continue to take questions without putting it behind

1623
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,780
any kind of paywall. What a mistake.

1624
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,820
What a fuck up on our end. Really got to fix that shit.

1625
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,500
I don't know, Nate, you don't seem sorry.

1626
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,380
What? How dare you question my integrity?

1627
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,300
Henry, I humbly disagree with your point there.

1628
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,940
That's all I'm saying.

1629
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,700
All right. Real question.

1630
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,700
Yes, real questions.

1631
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,420
There's this one here.

1632
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,540
From the Patreon Discord.

1633
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,820
Yeah, yeah, from the Patreon Discord.

1634
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,100
Real question time. Yeah, we're away from that bullshit now.

1635
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,060
Please, yes, go.

1636
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,580
From Great, because we talked about this earlier,

1637
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:47,380
Grace Yu says, how can a plebe, how does can a plebe stay motivated

1638
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,020
to go to the gym regularly?

1639
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,900
I'm attempting it and want wise words to keep me inspired.

1640
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,860
So I'm assuming he had a new use resolution.

1641
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,860
Now he's going to the gym.

1642
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,420
But how do you do it, Nate?

1643
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,500
The problem there is a fundamental question of motivation.

1644
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,500
There's a lot of things people do wrong when they're trying to keep themselves

1645
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
motivated to work out and stuff.

1646
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,940
But like it sounds like your core, like your impetus to go

1647
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,780
is your fact that you made a resolution.

1648
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,500
Well, he didn't say that. I'm just assuming I'm inferring.

1649
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,660
I'm inferring here. So I admit, I don't I can't read your mind.

1650
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:20,780
I can't tell everything.

1651
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,820
But you're you're you're going because you made a resolution.

1652
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,260
And like you definitely want it on some level,

1653
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,780
but you don't want it that bad, do you?

1654
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:34,300
You're not willing to sacrifice, you know, the the effort that it takes to go.

1655
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,180
Are you? It's really this resolution that's the binding contract,

1656
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:40,980
keeping you going and like just no insult, but that's no basis

1657
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:44,700
to like keep you going long term and stay, you know, exercising and stuff.

1658
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,900
You have to the only way to make this work is you have to, I would say,

1659
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,380
a, like actually enjoy the process itself of working out.

1660
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:57,740
Like when I work out, it hurts, you know, it's tiring, it's exhausting.

1661
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,300
But afterward, just think about that glow you get afterward, how great you feel.

1662
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,900
I feel that every time.

1663
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,020
That's that that is the specific motivating factor that keeps me going.

1664
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,060
And then, of course, in my mind, I have the like long term thoughts

1665
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:13,300
and I guess this will guide me on the physical path, you know,

1666
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,980
that I want to get to long term.

1667
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,340
So you got to have a short term.

1668
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,340
Humans are dumb and we think with our stupid, stupid brains about like the here

1669
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,660
and now, and we prioritize that so often over the long term,

1670
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:30,340
you have to know that about yourself and trick your own brain into doing what

1671
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:35,900
you intellectually wanted to do by making yourself focus on the short term benefits

1672
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,820
like that, like that pleasurable feeling right after you've worked out

1673
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,300
and how good you'll feel knowing you worked out as opposed to how shitty you'll feel

1674
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,420
knowing that you were supposed to work out today and you flaked or shit like that.

1675
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,060
That's I think that's the long term, more sustainable way.

1676
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,620
Also set yourself like reasonable, actionable goals.

1677
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,140
But that's that's a whole other story.

1678
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,740
Yeah, that's my thoughts.

1679
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,260
My thoughts is don't go to the gym.

1680
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,820
Just run around, just run around and pick up rocks.

1681
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,220
It's the same thing. Yeah, pretty much the same thing.

1682
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,420
A good question, everybody.

1683
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,780
This is actually from the Twitter from at Lobo.

1684
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,380
Oh, no, no, no, no, that guy has deleted the Twitter.

1685
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,220
You know what, you're right.

1686
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1687
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,100
Henry has said that we're not allowed to take questions from the Twitter.

1688
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,620
So, you know, I don't want to give anybody a false hope.

1689
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,460
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1690
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,780
But Henry has forbidden it.

1691
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,620
All right, please go on, get what else you got.

1692
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,620
You're such a wrathful God.

1693
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,220
I know, I know.

1694
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,020
I'll go look at some of these.

1695
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,580
Here's one.

1696
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:41,540
Tom Sieg asks, which PCP member has the best fan base?

1697
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,980
And I got to say, Monkey Jones, obviously.

1698
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,780
Yeah, for sure.

1699
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,420
For sure. No argument here.

1700
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,700
But aside from him, best fan base.

1701
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,700
I mean, I would literally argue that it is mine.

1702
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,500
I would argue that it is mine.

1703
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,500
Because just because they suck your dick.

1704
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,300
No, but they it's well, OK, they really do suck my dick.

1705
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,260
And I don't actually like necessarily respect them for that.

1706
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,100
Because, you know, like they will suck anyone's dick who they like,

1707
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,580
you know, like the Jake Paul people suck, you know, whatever.

1708
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:18,100
But it's they seem quite open to the kind of intellectual discussion

1709
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,100
that I'm usually talking about.

1710
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,300
And I find them to be very reasonable.

1711
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:25,060
And I don't know, maybe this is a projection of my own reasonableness.

1712
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,860
Like when people come at me with bullshit on like my Twitter,

1713
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,820
I respond just like, I'm like, hey, dude, what's the problem?

1714
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,580
I like how you're just saying like, I like how they're they approach me

1715
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,900
and they're reasonable and all this shit right after I just shit on a random

1716
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,060
Twitter guy for daring to question our decisions.

1717
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:44,700
Well, that's like a PCP guy as opposed to a best guy, I guess.

1718
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,740
I don't know. I don't know.

1719
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:47,220
But I mean, he deserves it because he was talking.

1720
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,980
Well, you were just saying that like, I like how they kind of like embody

1721
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,700
my ideals of like being reasonable and open to discussion.

1722
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,900
Don't mind me as I just shit on Henry.

1723
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,340
Well, if you'll notice, if you'll notice at the end of my shitting on him,

1724
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:03,300
I ended it with a with my actual point of like, I humbly disagree,

1725
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,100
which is honestly how I really feel about it.

1726
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,700
So I'm meming, I'm meming a dream and the people understand that, I hope.

1727
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,940
I don't know.

1728
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,580
Me, I have like an I think because like it's it's it's weird to say

1729
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,220
that it's not my own fan base.

1730
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:22,260
I think it's the best fan base, but I obviously do love my fans.

1731
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,460
They're cute and they're great and cute and I love them.

1732
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,500
I want to give them a big old hug.

1733
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,940
But I think Munchies fans, like the people who understand and appreciate

1734
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,660
Munchie are probably my favorite people like those people a lot.

1735
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,780
Yeah, because they get they get it.

1736
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,980
You know, they they're cool. You're right.

1737
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,860
I mean, I'm a pretty big fan of my people.

1738
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,020
They're all just a bunch of real nice boys.

1739
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,580
I've taken notice of the the Ben and Jackie wholesome fan base.

1740
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,940
There's just a bunch of just a bunch of swell guys that hang out in our

1741
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,660
discord and just are like great, fast friends with each other.

1742
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,860
And like, sometimes I get emotional about it.

1743
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,940
Lol, I think it's too it's too wholesome for me.

1744
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:10,100
It it it's it's it's making my brain turn it to to to get there's a certain

1745
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,860
number of of what is it NPM.

1746
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,900
You have to reach a certain ratio of NPM for give to be happy in a community,

1747
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,820
which is nine elevens per minute.

1748
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,660
There has to be a certain ratio in order for him to feel not even that untrue

1749
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,740
because I like I like my edgy boys.

1750
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:33,180
I like people being a raucous and edgy and then also being like real and nice.

1751
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,420
All I'm all I'm saying is just yesterday, Alex S.

1752
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:43,660
And paradigm and Phil draw Phil draw just put just they just made a song.

1753
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,940
He's made a song about how much they love the discord and how much they

1754
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,780
love our streams and I got a little a little choked up.

1755
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,900
That's nice.

1756
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,260
Yeah, I have a discord as well.

1757
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,980
My patron discord and I've had some great talks in there,

1758
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,300
specifically with this one guy Denali about like fitness.

1759
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,660
He's like he's like he was like a competitive weightlifter or something.

1760
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,420
And he was just such a sweetheart who gave me some real great advice

1761
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,860
and gave me the info to start the routine that I'm on right now.

1762
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,380
So shout out to that guy and just everybody and there's a real nice guy,

1763
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:20,380
especially shout out to me, me, Tian or Midian Mishin in the like a ten dollar

1764
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,820
patron in the ten dollar chat where we just talk about one piece all the time.

1765
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,740
This person read all of one piece on my suggestion and is now caught up.

1766
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,380
And now we're talking about it and it's extremely wholesome and I love it.

1767
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:32,980
Hot shit.

1768
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,420
Yeah, I'm a buzzer.

1769
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,780
People have like read all of one piece now because yeah, of course,

1770
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:40,140
he's watched every episode of the podcast.

1771
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,620
Except crazy, right?

1772
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:44,500
Crazy. It's good stuff.

1773
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,540
Oh, yeah, podcast.

1774
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,900
Got a patron out of fucking.

1775
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,740
I don't want to plug too many extra things.

1776
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:54,300
The podcast pirates, I think that the description is like like bloated

1777
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,420
with so many links, nobody's going to click on any of them.

1778
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,380
Yeah, it's true.

1779
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,820
Except for my Kickstarter.

1780
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,940
Give me that Oculus Rift.

1781
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,060
It's the last day guys.

1782
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,180
It's the last fucking day.

1783
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:05,940
Ten p.m. EST tonight is when it all comes crashing down.

1784
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:06,540
Wow.

1785
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:10,740
That'll be about nine hours from when you hear this or is it ten?

1786
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,300
Whatever, something like eight hours.

1787
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,460
If you get it right when it comes out, if you're really on top of your shit.

1788
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,180
Oh, I was I was including that hour difference if they listen to it

1789
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,860
right when it comes out, because it's been an hour.

1790
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,220
Oh, oh, oh, oh, right.

1791
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,300
Yes, because we're an hour.

1792
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,060
That's that's thinking ahead.

1793
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,220
That's the best guy ever for you.

1794
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,860
He's always 10 steps ahead.

1795
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,180
All right, I got one.

1796
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,460
We've got one more question here.

1797
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,180
Nice, nice light question to end the show.

1798
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:40,380
Hey, he asks, what would you do if your son turned out with heavy autism?

1799
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,420
Oh, no, I get my gun.

1800
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:50,380
No. Oh, God, I think this question haunts me literally every day.

1801
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:55,140
I like, am I going to say that I'm going to be like thrilled with the situation?

1802
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,940
Well, no one will be not.

1803
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:58,940
Oh, that would.

1804
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,300
But it's like also the kind of the most evil thing you can do.

1805
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,060
Say like that you don't hear you're not happy with your kid.

1806
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,940
Oh, it's fucked up.

1807
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,420
Well, I think it's not.

1808
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:12,180
I don't think it's like a bad showing of like a bad person

1809
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,820
that you don't like having to deal with a child that is going to be like,

1810
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,860
you know, for sure, will be a whole life.

1811
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,580
Their whole life. Yeah.

1812
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,500
I mean, you know, it's not like autistic people can't work.

1813
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,620
They do get jobs and stuff.

1814
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,260
But like it's it's more difficult.

1815
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,540
It is more difficult as a parent to do that.

1816
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:36,100
I think we just go go grab his son in his arms,

1817
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,140
look him straight in the eyes, take him up to the cliff of Sparta

1818
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:43,620
and just cast him off and be like, we're utilitarianism compels me.

1819
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,100
I'm trying again with another one.

1820
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,100
Oh, it's fucked up.

1821
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,940
Yeah, I don't ever worry about this because I'm never going to have a son

1822
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,060
or a daughter because it's ridiculous.

1823
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,820
Yeah. OK. All right.

1824
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:57,940
Fair understood, understood.

1825
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,460
But here's what I would really do is I would really try to analyze

1826
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,180
what my kid like check for diseases.

1827
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,940
You know, I don't know how much you can predict autism like in the womb.

1828
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,820
But seriously, I would if I have a kid that's that's that's brewing in a belly,

1829
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:14,060
I will try to find out every disease so that I can abort it

1830
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,300
if things are going wrong and just try again,

1831
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,580
because I don't consider it a human being worthy of moral consideration,

1832
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:22,580
not even a little bit until it's like one year old.

1833
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,140
So, yeah, that's what I would do.

1834
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,500
I mean, I'm not against abortion, but that the idea that you would like,

1835
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,500
you know, you would think about that a lot before.

1836
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,020
I mean, yeah, of course, what's wrong with that?

1837
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,700
I guess. I don't think that's because like you're you're making

1838
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,380
a commitment of time and effort when having a child and to be thrown

1839
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:46,940
a curveball like that and expect that like your initial time and investment

1840
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:50,300
and like your commitment that you made is still valid when they're throwing

1841
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,340
that huge thing in there. I don't think that's necessarily true.

1842
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:57,860
And I'm taking the steps so that I don't have so that I just like it.

1843
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,140
So there is no problem.

1844
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,020
I'm addressing it before it becomes a moral question

1845
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,340
because an embryo is not a human being.

1846
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,620
So there's nothing I don't really see the problem.

1847
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,620
Well, it's like, I mean, all right, all right.

1848
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,940
Here's my thoughts on the matter.

1849
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:12,900
Like, OK, of course, this is a this is a there's a spectrum here.

1850
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,060
The autism spectrum specifically.

1851
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,060
Of course, this is a shade of gray.

1852
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:20,180
But like you get you get far enough down on the spectrum.

1853
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:23,140
Like you get to the point where they're like don't even really

1854
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,420
like like interact on like a human level anymore.

1855
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,780
And like I kind of feel like the closer you get to that spectrum.

1856
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,820
But yeah, like like they they they're they become less and less like

1857
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,100
worthy of consideration on like a human level.

1858
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:41,620
It's it's just I think that the thing that none of us know for sure

1859
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:46,380
is whether you can tell in the womb quite how autistic a child is going to be.

1860
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,740
That's fair. That is fair.

1861
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,660
I don't think I don't know if there's any way to test.

1862
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,540
Yeah, I don't think you can. Yeah, it's like magically know we could do something.

1863
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,420
But I think practically speaking, you're probably I think I think this is why

1864
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,420
we need genetic engineering. All right, we can fix.

1865
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,700
I agree. I literally have the genome.

1866
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,740
We fix all that. Just fix all that in post, you know, just fucking.

1867
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:07,180
Exactly. Yeah.

1868
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,420
We need IRL editing tools for human beings.

1869
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:14,420
So that we need we need to invent a robot to do it.

1870
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,300
Dude, imagine how sick that's going to be when you just fucking

1871
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,900
you do the deed and then you go to the hospital and you just do get the

1872
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,340
creator wrestler UI and you can just map it out exactly how you want.

1873
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,780
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

1874
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:31,220
I want him to have shoulders that are 10 feet tall.

1875
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,700
Just like my World of Warcraft characters. Yeah.

1876
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,420
Hey, OK, I've got one last question here that is the most important.

1877
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,220
And then we can wrap up.

1878
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:45,900
It's chirps case moving castle asks, how does the rest of the PCP work with

1879
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:49,260
the best guy ever without being super jealous for not being the best?

1880
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,940
I still have that one question.

1881
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,780
That's a very good reason because the best is subjective.

1882
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:58,460
The best is a subjective term and there's nothing that Nate.

1883
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:03,060
There's no work Nate does that I actually want to do to give a serious answer.

1884
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,020
Well, hey, that's probably why you don't do it.

1885
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,780
You know, we're all free agents out here in the world.

1886
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,580
You're doing our own thing.

1887
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,820
I'm going to say I'm going to say how does the rest of the PCP work with the best

1888
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,380
guy ever? The truth is we don't we don't work.

1889
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:21,700
Oh, which is actually which is actually a compliment to you, Mr.

1890
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,460
Nate, best man that you keep the ship running very nicely.

1891
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,860
And I'm glad you do.

1892
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:31,300
How nice of you to say you get all you get all the all the stuff in order

1893
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,060
so that I don't have to think about anything.

1894
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,140
That's exactly. Yeah, I think a lot about how I want to make

1895
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:39,340
everything easy for all you guys and for like my patrons.

1896
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,780
So I always want to do things that I can do so that people will continue

1897
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:45,020
to want to work with me at their own volition.

1898
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,980
See, that's that's that's that actually kind of answers the other question

1899
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:51,820
to because, Nate, you found a way to weaponize your autism to make all this

1900
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,060
stuff work. And so you can pass that on to your son.

1901
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,420
Yeah, you're not wrong.

1902
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:02,100
Vincent will inherit the world that I give him and Charlottes will get the scraps.

1903
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:08,020
The way my way, God intended, indeed.

1904
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,940
All right. Well, I guess we're done.

1905
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,620
Yeah, thanks for the questions, everybody.

1906
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,100
Thanks for all those wonderful questions using hashtag ask PCP on the Twitter.

1907
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,140
Oh, that was a good time.

1908
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,460
Thanks for pledging, everybody in the patron discord.

1909
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,380
We read most of those were from there.

1910
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,580
If you just pledge one dollar, you get access to the patron lounge

1911
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,060
and you get all that stuff, pledge five dollars to the patron

1912
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:31,220
and you get all 10 of our bonus episodes that are out right now.

1913
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,940
All 10. Unbelievable.

1914
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,220
Absolutely decadent.

1915
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,820
And that's that.

1916
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:37,500
We got some merch.

1917
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,580
You want to buy some PCB merch, red bubble links down below.

Last day, Oculus Rift.

1923
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,220
Let's go guys.

1924
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,820
Maybe maybe the even higher pledge could or a goal could be to get

1925
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:59,860
Munchie, a Oculus Rift for the.

1926
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:00,980
You know what? Yeah.

1927
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,580
OK, if we if we if we make if I make a.

1928
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:07,740
Yeah, if we make it pass that the next one will be to get Munchie and Oculus Rift.

1929
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:10,180
So if if we're past six thousand by then,

1930
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,100
then that's what then that's what we're going for.

1931
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,860
Corruption loves company, as you can see.

1932
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:16,540
All right.

1933
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,580
Thanks for listening, everybody.

1934
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:20,740
And we'll see you next week with another dank old meme.

1935

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Oh, I'm supposed to be working right now.

1938
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:39,340
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1939
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,140
I'm not working.

1940
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,700
I'm doing nothing.

1941
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,100
Why did come?
