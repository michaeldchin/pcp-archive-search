1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Yoncast.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What is snort? This episode is gonna be...

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, you may change your tune when I tell you about my new character.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Jesus.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's my new character. Do you want to meet them?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sure, yeah. Lay it on me.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's the Australian alien.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Scary.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Scary.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's just sounds like...

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's the Australian alien.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's just sounds like a regular Australian.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, well, they're all aliens to me.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is he like an alien because he's emigrated to, you know, the West?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He emigrated from space to Australia, and he learned G'day, and he talks like...

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, wait, so it put prawns on the Barbie?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think they say shrimp. I mean, they're two distinct animals.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I heard someone say, we don't say shrimp, we say prawns.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And I thought to myself, but they're two different animals.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So really, I just learned that Australians are stupid, and they don't know the difference between those two things.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As far as I think, the prawns are the bigger ones.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The shrimps are the tiny, tiny ones you can have in like a shrimp fried rice or whatever.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And prawns at a restaurant are like the bigger ones that you rip the head off of and eat

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
with your hands like an animal.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Time for some animal facts.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, in the UK...

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Australia and New Zealand and Ireland.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just do it.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Type hashtag giveaway in the comments.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Figure out how to spell it.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's got to use some like diacritic marks that normally you only see in like Taiwanese Mandarin or some shit.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Some like reverse accent marks or something.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, prawn is the general term used to describe both true prawns and shrimp.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, well, okay.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So they just don't understand the differences between things.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They just boil it down.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, you boil it down in the other way.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Simplify.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They utilize the blunt, the banal, the simplistic.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They're fascists is what they are.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're basically like lobsters, like lobster nephews.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, oh, oh, little fly.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I've missed it.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
With your chopsticks?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have big meaty chopsticks that sounds like hands clapping when I click click them.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Damn, fruit fly.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Never eat fruit.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then you won't get flies.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Somebody forgot to take my garbage out in my kitchen.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So there's a bunch of fruit flies in my kitchen.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They have mostly not come into my room, but once in a while, I see one and it pisses me off.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The garbage, garbage collection only comes, garbage collection only comes once a week.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I think to all the other cowards that live in my apartment, the thinking goes, oh, well, well, guess the garbage just has to sit here now.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know that we could literally just use the neighbor's garbage can.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We could just take it out and put it in the neighbor's garbage can.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think everyone else just doesn't know that.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But nobody else cares because I'm the only, I live adjacent to the kitchen and everyone else lives a floor up and they probably just aren't that worried about it.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So it's really mostly a me problem.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I guess, I guess I'm the one that has to deal with it.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You got to be the bigger man and do all the work for them.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Got to be a bigger man and make your life worse.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have been like the only one who has been like had dishes.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I have not seen like hardly any.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Everyone else will use like a plate.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Everyone else will, there will see like a burner, like a pot on the stove.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I won't see anyone else's plates anywhere.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I guess I'm the only one who's like needs to be doing the dishes and stuff lately, which is strange.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know what everyone else is doing.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have no idea what's going on with those people.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've heard people like to just forever use and buy paper plates instead of ever doing dishes, which is insane.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I do that.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like I tried to do that.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I bought paper plates so that I would do that.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But you know what I mean?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It takes like two seconds under a tap for a dish to be like scrubbed unless you leave it for a week.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's like so much more extra work and money.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can't understand using paper plates unless it's like, oh, it's a party and we need a bunch of plates for people.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's like two dollars for like a hundred plates.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So it's really not that much more.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, but like that's two hundred plates worth of mass that will need to be moved around or put on something or thrown away.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And it's just like a hassle.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Water goes straight down the drain.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You say that.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You say that, but it's in practice, it's not.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're killing the rain forest, Ben.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're killing the Amazon rain forest.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't think that's true.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Paper plate is equal to one tree being thrown into the ocean for no reason.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's very inefficient.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's a very inefficient logging system we've got.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wow.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Someone should do something about that so I can just keep burning through these paper plates.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You know, Kylie Jenner.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Kylie Jenner might be taken, you know, three minute long flights on her private jet.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Have you looked inward lately, Ben, and asked yourself, yeah, but I'm using like almost one whole paper plate a day.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's fucked.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who am I to judge?

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Anyway, I found a, I have found a new, one of the places I was apartment hunting.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I spoke to the landlord and gotten confirmation that, yeah, I'm good to move in in September.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So that's pretty good.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I haven't signed the lease yet, but it's like semi-officially like, yeah, we're just waiting for someone else to be ready.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But then, yeah, you're good to go.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I'm excited about that.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't have to, I don't have to spend the last month frantically looking like I did last time.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's great.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, it's pretty good.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a little, the place I found is a little further away from like the center of town, but not that much further.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And it's a little more expensive, but it's not like, it's like, it's like $25 more a month.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So like whatever, maybe $50.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's fine.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's fine.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll be moving out of this shithole dump, but I can't believe I spent a fucking year here.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What a disaster.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What a nightmare.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It flew by and I feel like I got, I did get the things mostly done that I meant to get done,

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but I kind of expected that was kind of like the minimum that I hoped to accomplish and that was all that I got done.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, you know, that's fine.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Fucking, I've been, I've been talking to, I've been doing the thing where I talk to someone who works at a company through Alibaba,

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
trying to get the book printed.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And it's really annoying because this person is on China time and I'm on America time.

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And so we're like 12 hours different.

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So like, I'll ask one simple question and then I'll have to wait an entire day to get the answer.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And she doesn't answer on weekends, so I can basically ask five small questions per week.

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then...

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So is it much like money wise?

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is that like a much preferable way to do it than before?

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I did find one company that seems like a lot cheaper.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, so it seems worth it.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, other...

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, I have notes right here.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Other companies.

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Western companies and some Chinese ones too.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think they were going to...

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They were going to end up costing for like a hundred copies.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It was going to end up costing like...

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
$18 to $20 per copy.

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think maybe the lowest would have been like $15.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And that's not including shipping.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And that's not including shipping.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Or profit.

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, that's just the cost of production.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This one...

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let me see if I can...

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Fucking Alibaba is a little bit...

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It like boots me out and makes me sign in over and over again.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This one's going to be...

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, it's going to be maybe like $11.

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Probably less than $13.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Maybe $13 to copy before shipping.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's better.

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, I might be able to get that down a little bit more depending on like paper choice.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So this seems like the best option, yeah.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I think shipping might be like $2 a copy.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's at $100, so...

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It'll be $142 to ship $100 pieces.

161
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So yeah, I think this is the most economical.

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're going to get a sample first?

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, I just need to order samples.

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Did I mention that I...

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, I was fucking around with the color filter to try and get the greens looking as good as they could look in CMYK print format.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And this is really annoying.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I made a few that I liked and I printed out like big pages.

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They were like oversized pages.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They had to tape pieces of paper together to fit it all on there, but they showed like six different color styles.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And I printed them out so I could actually look at them like on paper to see, you know, an idea of what they'd look like.

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I was going to bring those to RFC KCON, which happened this week.

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I was going to show people them and ask them their opinions, like which of these colors do you think looks the best on the page.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And I forgot to bring them, so I didn't get to do that.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I mean, I guess it's fine.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I mean, I guess I can just pick myself and I...

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In the end, I have to pick myself anyway.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But Darn, I meant to do that. Oh well.

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So yeah, but I have them printed out.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
How was RFC KCON?

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
RFC KCON was really fun.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I guess it lasted three days.

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I was there for the evening of the last day, I think.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And there were a bunch of people there that I had met at the previous RFC KCON, the one that had happened right before RADCON 4.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And there were a lot of new faces of people, some of which were newer players and some of which were longtime players who I had not met before.

185
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And that was very fun and everyone was very cool and we had a great time.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I brought the slime bottles and everyone loved them.

187
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And we made slime and tonics, the classic RFC K beverage.

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, you actually had the slime with tonic water?

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, I brought tonic water and I put the slime in it.

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And it looked great, by the way, because I made the slime to glow under a black light.

191
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And as it turns out, tonic also glows under a black light because quinine is fluorescent.

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So it looks awesome.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So did you have a black light to shine on them?

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I did, I did. I brought one, yeah, to show it off a little bit.

195
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, it's great. Quinine glows like a teal blue color and the slime glows kind of yellow-green, obviously.

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's funny, you know, you pour the glass, you pour the tonic and it glows blue.

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And then you pour the slime in and the slime sort of, in the water, it kind of gets all noodley before it starts to blend in.

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And then you mix it together and it becomes kind of a turquoise, blue-green, glowy mixture.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Very funny, very cool looking.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It just worked out that way. It just worked out pretty good.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sounds epic.

202
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It was epic.

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Kip made dumplings. There were so many dumplings at Homemade Dumplings at RFC K-Con.

204
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I guess this was RFC K-Con. I think it was number eight.

205
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There was some confusion about which number it was.

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I had not been to all, a lot of them had been, like, in other places.

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So I had not been to them, but I think I've been to, like, two or three before.

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Anyway, there were so many dumplings. They were fantastic.

209
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, I met people and saw people again and it ruled, it ruled.

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Shoutouts to Slimehouse.

211
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Shoutouts to Slimehouse yet again.

212
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Another successful, another successful gathering.

213
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Nice.

215
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I gave some people some pins and stuff.

216
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I brought party favors.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Handed them out, like Santa Claus or, sorry, like Phoebus.

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Or no, Phoebus is like anti-Santa Claus.

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Phoebus is the, yeah, Saint Phoebus is the Slimernalia patron deity who steals people's stuff on Slimernalia, as everyone knows.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, okay.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah.

223
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So that's how that was.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, cool.

225
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't really follow.

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The only thing I've heard about RFCK recently is that Alleyoop is a character and, like, somebody's playing Alleyoop.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Or, you know, Alleyoop is in Endless War, role-playing, doing things, exclamation points, smoke.

228
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What's the thing? What's the mouth thing?

229
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Smoking?

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, yeah.

231
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Vape.

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And, yeah, that seems fun.

233
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I like that.

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, that is pretty funny.

235
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't, yeah, I don't really keep up with, like, the game, but there was game talk at the con, and there were some ideas thrown around for gameplay features that I won't say what they are.

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But there are plans to make the game more fun.

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's just say that.

238
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The game's gonna get, the game's gonna get really fun.

239
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's all I'm gonna say.

240
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What does that mean?

241
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't know.

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Nobody knows.

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If you slime in the game, you slime for real?

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, that's ridiculous.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But slime now exists as a real physical thing.

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Slime always existed as a real physical thing you could have.

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You just had to know where to look for it.

248
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, I must not say anymore.

249
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I must not break my silence.

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Are they gonna add the slime Titanic?

251
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What?

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The slime Titanic.

253
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How would they do that?

254
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They get on a boat, and then the slime bergs sink it.

255
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And it's just a slime version of the Titanic.

256
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's, it's, it would be like, it would be like 9-11.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Like, it's just a disaster that everyone really likes a lot, and they replicate it.

258
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, it's a disaster that everyone really likes a lot, and it happens every, every like month or so.

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's like, oh, we built a new, we built a new slime Titanic.

260
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Time to go sail deliberately into a slime berg.

261
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's a slime berg just floating right off the coast, and we just send a new Titanic into it,

262
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
a new slime Titanic into it every, every so often, yeah, every in-game month or whatever.

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
At the bottom of the Grand Canyon, there's like a growing pile of Titanic's.

264
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Slime Titanic's.

265
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And then it becomes an island of slime Titanic's.

266
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then people, the drive more slime Titanic's into that island.

267
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay, this is, no, it wasn't, that was not the idea, but, you know, we should add,

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that should, that should go on the list.

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Very on brand.

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Uh, Lamal.

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Good, good stuff.

273
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
All right, I hope, um, I hope the devs are taking notes.

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Uh, what else, what else did I do this week?

275
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Um, yeah.

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Has it been hot over there?

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes, it has been hot.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It was, although I have just been, I've just been staying inside with my AC room.

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Haven't, just haven't been dealing with it.

280
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, I got a window, I got a window AC.

281
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We had the big heat wave over here in the UK.

282
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, is that, uh, still going on?

283
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It was only like two days that we'll forecast to be above 40 degrees.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah.

285
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Um, which is like 106, 107, I think Fahrenheit.

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And, uh, that's past, but it's still pretty hot.

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's like normal summer right now.

288
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's like, oh, this is comfortable.

289
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I can stand outside for like a second.

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There are, there are, there exist cool parts of shade.

291
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When the, when the, um, heat wave was coming through, it was like, I just had to,

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
had to lie there and take it because there was no way to cool down.

293
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Everything was the same temperature outside and inside.

294
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean, outside was a bit more hot, but like usually in this house,

295
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
there's one room that doesn't, the sun doesn't hit from the outside,

296
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
unless it's like a sunset.

297
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That blows.

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So it's usually like the cold room.

299
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And it's like, oh, if you need to cool down, you go in there,

300
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
but that was like swaltering.

301
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That blows.

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So it was just a, it was just a big old like, whoa.

303
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I saw on the news, there were people like frantically, like stupidly frantically

304
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
getting in their cars and driving to the beach so that they could be in the water,

305
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
only to end up stuck in traffic because everybody else had that idea.

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And they were just in a heat wave in a car stuck in traffic.

307
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's the stupidest thing you could have done.

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I'm pretty sure people died.

309
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because, wait, they died because they were in their car?

310
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I mean, I don't actually know if people died because they're in their car.

311
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
There were some amount of deaths relating to heat exhaustion and,

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
because, you know, AC is not coming in the UK.

313
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I heard there were going to be deaths.

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So there was a, I don't think I saw like a death counter anywhere.

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I guess people, the news didn't really want to say anything like that.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But I heard about like an occasional this and that.

317
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's like, oh, shit, that's tragic.

318
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This country is not prepared for the climate crisis.

319
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Well, it sucks, it sucks to be you.

320
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I say drinking deep, deep from my chalice of homegrown American motor oil.

321
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
From my refrigerant liquid.

322
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Not really much to say about the heat wave.

324
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It was just like, wow, we got a new record, guys.

325
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
41 or 41.5.

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's a degree centigrade.

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You should be proud.

328
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We did it.

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We did it, Reddit.

330
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Shattering the glass ceiling.

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The greenhouse ceiling.

332
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Thank you.

333
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you, JK.

334
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's blessing.

335
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The gods were angry at all the tariffs.

336
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's why it happened.

337
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
True.

338
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know why God's on our side now, but he is.

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He's on your side, but he won't do anything about it.

340
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Like the Democrats.

341
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Much like the damn labor party.

342
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Damn labor.

343
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Damn labor.

344
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm waiting for them to say, I don't know.

345
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, I guess I don't know.

346
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm not really paying too much attention to what they're saying,

347
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
but nothing catches my attention.

348
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Keir Starmer has like such a boring aura around him.

349
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He is such a politician from the perspective of a four-year-old

350
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
who just wants to watch fucking Nadi or whatever.

351
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Wait, wait, you just want to watch what?

352
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Nadi.

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's a children's TV show.

354
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's like a little character with a jingly bell on the end of his long hat.

355
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And he nods his head.

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Another character I'm sure you're making up just to troll me

357
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and make me look like a fool.

358
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah, all right.

359
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Rolly Polioli, remember that one?

360
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This is like the British equivalent of like drop bears.

361
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You tell foreigners they're real and they just believe you.

362
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's true.

363
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I used to be a big naughty head.

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
When it comes to like...

365
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Nadi heads rise up.

366
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Nadi heads rise up.

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Nadi heads in chat.

368
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I was like, that was my favorite show.

369
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Some people like Postman Pat.

370
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I did like Postman Pat and Feynman Sam and fucking, you know,

371
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Thomas the Tank Engine, the greats, Teletubbies.

372
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm a student of the classics.

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, there's Teletubbies and stuff.

374
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But Nadi was like my favorite.

375
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I was a naughty head.

376
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I couldn't say right.

377
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah.

378
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There was Big Ears, the big guy.

379
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He's like a, like Garden Um...

380
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, like an elf.

381
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I really can't remember.

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like an elf.

383
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

384
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It looks like, it looks like a, kind of looks like he should be

385
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
in one of those Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer movies.

386
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Kind of.

387
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I actually have not, it's one of those like, such early memories

388
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that I kind of remember what it was about or what anything was.

389
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

390
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I probably don't know the theme song.

391
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I could maybe remember it, but like...

392
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The fastest trousers, Nadi in Toyland.

393
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's an episode title that I see here.

394
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It was like, the pipeline was Nadi, Pingu.

395
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And then the hoops, no.

396
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The hoops, the hoops were good because they had like the little...

397
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What are you talking about?

398
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The hoops had like the little, the three little metal guys who were like,

399
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
they've got like clangy heads that look like hi-hats.

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Hi-hat head robot people.

401
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And they go like, and then there's the hoops.

402
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's the hoops.

403
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I see the hoops.

404
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The hoops are like muppets.

405
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The hoops are muppets, but there's like these robots.

406
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I can't remember what they were called.

407
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, I see these creatures.

408
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, apparently this is made by the Jim Henson company.

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's interesting.

410
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I think we had a toy of one of the clanger head face guys.

411
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Is that really what they're called, clanger heads?

412
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't know.

413
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I can't remember.

414
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't think we knew what the names were.

415
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They were just sort of like talk incomprehensibly,

416
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and then they would show like a skit with a human child interacting with a muppet.

417
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And it'd be like, oh, we're learning about the woods.

418
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
What can you find in the woods, squirrels?

419
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh my fucking god.

420
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
What can you find in the woods?

421
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, dead body.

422
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, we can't show that on children's television.

423
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let's go.

424
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Have you watched?

425
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, the tweenies?

426
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The tweenies.

427
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
No.

428
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That's another British one.

429
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
There can't be.

430
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There can't be this many.

431
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There's so many.

432
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The 100% of...

433
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And there's Jet Set Willy and the ZX Spectrum.

434
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Nobody does like video essays on the fucking hooves on British...

435
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Not obscure, but just British children's entertainment.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
If somebody made...

437
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
This is not facetious at all.

438
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If somebody made a video or something, just cataloging all of the...

439
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't know, the children's properties that exist only in the UK and nowhere else,

440
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I would watch it.

441
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's the kind of thing that I would watch a video about.

442
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I think a lot of it doesn't go to America, but it does go to Europe and other places.

443
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So there's not a lot of exclusive UK.

444
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's just easy to like...

445
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, we can put that in France and Germany and all over Europe.

446
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

447
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, yeah.

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I guess it would just be stuff that doesn't come across the pond then.

449
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Occasionally there'd be like a super mega hit like Peppa Pig and that goes worldwide.

450
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's like, well, they did it.

451
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I mean, it's the same.

452
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I know there's...

453
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Was it a YMS video about all the Canadian...

454
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Like puppet shows?

455
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What was the name of the one?

456
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Like Nanaland with the stoned out green muppet.

457
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, which I would never have heard of otherwise.

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I guess it's just...

459
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
When stuff is big in America, I think it's just more likely to be worldwide.

460
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
American entertainment industry is just a little more dominant.

461
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I think a bigger percentage of American-made stuff is also familiar to everybody else.

462
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, that's always been for a long time.

463
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think more recently, because of the internet as well, shows that are good from the UK end up being heard about at least.

464
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And then maybe getting like a thing like...

465
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, Doctor Who was big in America.

466
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Doctor Who was a worldwide hit, for sure.

467
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

468
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But I don't know that it was a worldwide hit before the resurrection of the series in like 2005 or whatever it was.

469
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No, my mom told me that she used to watch Doctor Who as a kid or something like she knew about it.

470
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I mean, you know, an older incarnation of it, obviously.

471
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah.

472
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think it was dormant for a while, and then when it had the sort of resurrection that I think it came back in America, too.

473
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah.

474
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But probably not as much, because it seems like it's more of a British institution.

475
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I haven't thought of the Who's in a long time.

476
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I've never thought of them before in any capacity.

477
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Very funny.

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
What was the thing I said?

479
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Why did Jim Henson need to make a different Muppet show for the UK?

480
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
They were already making shows.

481
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Let me see.

482
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Hoops.

483
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Hoops 4 out now.

484
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What is that?

485
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh, man.

486
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is something else.

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
This is a thing that just happens to be called Hoops.

488
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I've got something for you.

489
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You're going to like this.

490
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
What?

491
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Here.

492
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I bet this is great.

493
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Can you imagine the chunky polygons on that?

494
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Well, I've got to find this.

495
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Long play, the Hoops PS1.

496
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

497
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You know?

498
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Long play.

499
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Look at it.

500
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Show me.

501
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I want to see the polygons.

502
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I bet it looks exactly like Petscop.

503
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, my God.

504
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Those PNG backgrounds.

505
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
30?

506
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Oh, it's all digitized 2D.

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What's the word?

508
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Rotoscoped?

509
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, yeah.

510
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like Donkey Kong Country a little bit.

511
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah.

512
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, actually, there is a 3D.

513
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Earlier in the video, there is a 3D walk around bit.

514
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It doesn't look very good, though.

515
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
There's a green character with green grass.

516
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I can't even see him.

517
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh, God, yeah.

518
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
They should, you know, Spyro.

519
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Spyro was made purple so that he would stand out from the green grass he would be running around on.

520
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So these guys were not on the cutting edge of game design.

521
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They were not on the ball.

522
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh, yeah.

523
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This part where they're all standing in the lobby and they're behind a desk.

524
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
They have 3D models of all three of them.

525
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Great.

526
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Well, it looks like shit.

527
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah.

528
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I mean, it doesn't look amazing.

529
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's for babies.

530
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So you walk to a place and then you do a shitty puzzle minigame.

531
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I mean, isn't that just video games, though?

532
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, shut up.

533
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Gotcha.

534
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I like to press the X button to jump at the same time this guy doesn't jump.

535
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Not to change the subject, or I mean, we can come back to this if you want.

536
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But on the subject of PlayStation 1 games and videos about those games.

537
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So I played some more Mega Man this week.

538
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I played...fucking...I played Mega Man.

539
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I played, sorry, Rockman and Forte, Mirai no Chosensha.

540
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Which is, I think that's the title.

541
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It was an unreleased game in America.

542
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It was only on the Wonder Swan in Japan.

543
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It means Challenger from the Future.

544
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I mean, I'm not going to get into detail.

545
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But it has a truly baffling place in the extended Mega Man lore.

546
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Let's just say that.

547
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It is truly strange that someone decided to make a game about what that game is about.

548
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But anyway, I played Mega Man Legends.

549
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You know that one, right?

550
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We talked about that one last week, the one that was called Dash.

551
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, I had played Legends a bit.

552
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It was called Mega Man 64 on the Nintendo 64.

553
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It was called Mega Man Legends on the PlayStation.

554
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It was called Rockman Dash in Japan.

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I played it as a kid, and I had kind of...

556
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I had rented it one time and sort of bounced off it.

557
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And I didn't rent it again, so I never got that far in it.

558
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I played it again this week, and I loved it.

559
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It was so good.

560
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I kind of didn't think I would like it, but I was wrong.

561
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It was one of the comfiest games I've ever played.

562
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
A lot of people describe stuff as comfy a lot, and sometimes it makes me roll my eyes,

563
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and I think it's like a stupid way.

564
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's like, oh, people will describe anything as comfy if it's like, oh, it's nostalgic or whatever.

565
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But like I said, I didn't really play this as a kid, but it was really comfy.

566
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It was fun. It felt great.

567
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't know, something about the bird sounds of running around in the fields that you start in.

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah, I've not played it either, but that sounds nice.

569
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It always just looked really nice to me.

570
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's just sort of the controls were always like, oh, that's non-traditional.

571
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The controls are pretty rough. It almost has like Resident Evil sort of like tank controls.

572
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It takes a little bit of getting used to, but it's good.

573
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There is like, yeah, the graphics look great.

574
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
They are like the perfect sort of like cartoony character designs that complement like the chunky polygon builds of the characters.

575
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It looks perfect.

576
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yeah, it's just like the perfect example of that look.

577
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I thought I was going to, I was kind of like dreading it.

578
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I thought it was going to be boring. I thought it was going to be an annoying slog.

579
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And then I played it and it probably took me maybe like nine or ten hours to beat, all told.

580
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And then I was like, then I just kept going.

581
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I went for 100%. I played it for another like six hours to like do all the side quests,

582
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
collect all the hidden like buster upgrades and weapons and stuff.

583
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It wasn't even going to use them. I just wanted to see them.

584
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Just wanted to talk to all the side characters and do all the bonus content.

585
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That's a mark of a good game where you just feel like you want to do it.

586
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I just wanted to. I didn't have to.

587
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I could have, yeah, but it was just really, really liked it.

588
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And, you know, funny coincidence. This is crazy. I couldn't believe this.

589
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I was looking up how to grind Zeni, you know, the money in the game.

590
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And so I was like, what's I wonder what the best spot to grind money is because I needed a lot of money to.

591
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This is as I was preparing for the final boss because the final boss was kind of kicking my ass.

592
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And so I wanted to get the final like armor upgrade that reduces the damage you take, but it costs a lot.

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So I was like, what's the fastest way to grind money?

594
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So I googled it and there were results.

595
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The first result that you get when you Google like grinding like grinding Zeni Mega Man Legends.

596
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Do you know who it's a video from? You'll never get.

597
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No.

598
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's Oolulilia, the guy who wrote.

599
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What?

600
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, it's got like 9000 views.

601
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:08,000
There's an Oolulilia video where he shows you the best spot to you can grind almost 10,000 Zeni a minute

602
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
going in between these three rooms, which respawns these enemies that drop a lot.

603
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And you have to use the vacuum buster side weapon attachment to like suck up the Zeni really fast.

604
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And then you run to the other room and then you come back and you do it over again.

605
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah.

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Just just happened to be the most the most viewed video on this particular subject.

607
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So there you go.

608
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah.

609
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You know what? I'll link I'll link the video.

610
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Click, click, clack.

611
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah. Mega Man Legends fastest Zeni 9500 a minute.

612
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
First result when you search Mega Man Legends grinding Zeni.

613
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And he starts talking in his mumbly Midwestern drawl.

614
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You know.

615
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Twice.

616
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You know, I should uh, since I'm friends with him on Facebook, I haven't been on Facebook in a while,

617
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
but I should log in and message him and tell him like, Hey, man, you know,

618
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I came across your Mega Man Legends how to grind Zeni video on because I was looking for and it really it helped me out.

619
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It helped me grind for the Kevlar jacket or whatever it's called.

620
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So that was funny.

621
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Uh, that's it.

622
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That was my week.

623
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
My week.

624
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
My week was

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the heat wave.

626
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You know, it's it's I could understand if that took up a lot of it.

627
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It took up while the days that it was hot and then the day after it was sort of recovering.

628
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I have not I've tried.

629
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
All right. Here's one thing.

630
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Like I tried so hard to do work.

631
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I felt like I was really, really grappling.

632
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I was like, I wanted to check Twitter.

633
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I wanted to go away so much.

634
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And I'm like forcing myself to sit down, like finish this one commission.

635
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I did finish one of the commissions earlier, but this is like, I've got it.

636
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I've got like four left.

637
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I got to do them.

638
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I try drawing.

639
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I start screaming.

640
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't like actually scream, but it's just like,

641
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh, no.

642
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And I'm just like curling into curling into a bowl and like I'm putting the lines on the thing.

643
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I ended up making this is for the this is for the last few few commissions you have.

644
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yes, the last few commissions.

645
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I just want I'm done and what I'm out of my life.

646
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Did you did you take a minute to contemplate that that Twitter post I posted last week about

647
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
not I need to be in a better mood to do this drawing, but I will be in a better mood if I do this drawing.

648
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Did you contemplate that?

649
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I mean, no, not the time.

650
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You should.

651
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't really know how you would do that.

652
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I posted it for contemplative purposes.

653
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So, you know, contemplated at your own discretion, but it's there if you need to contemplate it.

654
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I alright, I appreciate the contemplativeness.

655
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I just don't understand how to put that into practice necessarily.

656
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Like, I know that if I do this, it will no longer be a thing I need to do and that would feel great.

657
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Right.

658
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But it was truly a difficult experience trying to draw.

659
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I was like, I'm not.

660
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm not doing a good enough.

661
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I see you have started, but you was not coming out the way you wanted.

662
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, I had drawn like a face.

663
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I needed to get the pose right.

664
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I was looking at some references and I'm like, oh, I got to Google.

665
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I thought I thought you meant you were you were like struggling to to actually make yourself do it.

666
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I mean, I was.

667
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Well, yeah, yeah, I see.

668
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I understand.

669
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So I'm like, I'm sitting there with my iPad trying to get this stuff drawn.

670
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And it was just it was uncanny.

671
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It was it's unbelievable.

672
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Like never before have I tried so hard and got some tried so hard in a in a position where I really just wanted to do anything else.

673
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like usually I would just give in and be like, oh, whatever.

674
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I got a little bit done.

675
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I did a sketch layer.

676
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I see it.

677
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I looked at it and I was like, this sucks.

678
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I probably need to redo it.

679
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But I had no I had no moral fiber left after that.

680
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And so I gave up.

681
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And that was my week is that one day I tried really hard and I failed.

682
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, it's better than a complete like give up.

683
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But like, I felt very silly.

684
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It felt very silly to like sit there like quietly screaming and scrunching up my body trying to get some lines drawn.

685
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And getting so little actually accomplished.

686
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

687
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But what is it?

688
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't know.

689
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't know.

690
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh, did I get it?

691
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes, I got the fly.

692
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
See, see, give, see, give.

693
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I had to try three times three times.

694
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I said, oh, the fly.

695
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Damn, I missed.

696
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, the fly.

697
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Damn, I missed.

698
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And on the third time, I killed it.

699
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So you're describing destruction.

700
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm describing creation.

701
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's different.

702
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They're just two sides of the same coin.

703
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Entropy always increases.

704
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's not always balanced.

705
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Every fly I kill creates a new drawing for someone in the world.

706
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That's true.

707
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That's true.

708
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's easier to make a drawing than to kill a fly, I think, in my opinion.

709
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
What were we talking about?

710
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I don't know.

711
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I was just like, I've got like next week, by the way.

712
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Just pour yourself a nice, just, hey, just make yourself a bottle of slime.

713
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I posted the recipe.

714
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I posted the recipe in RFCK.

715
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So everyone, everyone, so it's freely available.

716
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So just make yourself a nice slime and tonic and just relax after a hard day of trying,

717
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
trying and failing.

718
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You know, it's just capitalism.

719
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Just lean into it.

720
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I mean, I feel, I've been feeling pretty good today, even though it's Sunday and I'm not

721
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
really thinking of work on a weekend.

722
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's the Sabbath.

723
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's the Sabbath.

724
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So you better, yeah, you better not be.

725
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But on Monday, I'm next week, I'm going to a gunnery, the yearly camp.

726
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, that's, yeah, that's right.

727
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So I'll be gone for a week and a bit.

728
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I might be back the Sunday after next.

729
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But I won't be here for next week's PCP.

730
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I see.

731
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Did that get canceled last year for COVID reasons?

732
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It did.

733
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
There was a Zoom version of it, which was obviously very minimal.

734
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, sure.

735
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Actually, I think, I think last year, 2020 was a Zoom year.

736
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And it was like, oh, for the first time in like 70 years, we haven't had a gunnery.

737
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But we technically sort of had a one on Zoom.

738
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And then 2021, there was a very small gunnery at a more local campsite with less people,

739
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
but it still happened, I think.

740
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I see.

741
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
With masks and very careful with all that.

742
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
This time, it's back to how it usually is.

743
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm a little bigger school and like larger tents, mountain people.

744
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We're all getting banged, get the gangs back together.

745
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm a little...

746
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
On that subject, I'm a little nervous about having attended a gathering for RFC KCON.

747
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm waiting for like five days to go by before I'm like...

748
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, yeah.

749
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You know...

750
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Uh-oh.

751
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Monkeypox.

752
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I mean, yeah, there's that too now.

753
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I mean, I guess I know it's a bit...

754
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I know it's a bit of a right-wing talking point to say that it's mostly among gay men

755
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
who are having monkeypox.

756
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I also know that it can spread in other ways.

757
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So it's not like the fact that I didn't do that means that I'm necessarily safe.

758
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Are you worried because you had a gay orgy at the RFC KCON?

759
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I...

760
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Listen, what happens at RFC KCON stays...

761
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I mean, everyone there...

762
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Everyone there is gay or trans or whatever.

763
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That's not true.

764
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I mean, there's some...

765
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But I don't know.

766
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No, it seems pretty unlike...

767
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I mean, I don't know.

768
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I guess I even could have monkeypox.

769
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
No, I'm a little more worried about COVID.

770
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,000
But, you know, they say BA5 or whatever gets through your immune system.

771
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So I don't know.

772
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
What was that?

773
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Was that on Thursday?

774
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So it's been three days and I feel fine.

775
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So if I make it another three and I test and I'm fine, then I will be out of the woods.

776
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
But I'm still a little nervous about it.

777
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But yeah, me going away next week means that I have a week coming up where, you know,

778
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I've had all this time to do these things.

779
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I really should at least get the Lord of Ghost things sent to the people who are still waiting for me to send them.

780
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
There's like three or four people for various reasons.

781
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I haven't sent those yet.

782
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And I'm going to do it.

783
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm going to...

784
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
On Monday, I'm going to do that.

785
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I'm also going to record a Money Spinner's podcast to make up for the ones that I missed.

786
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's going to be my Monday and I'm going to do that.

787
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And that's what I'm going to do and I'm going to do that.

788
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh, I should do another Patreon Q&A.

789
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I've been ignoring my Patreon while I've been working on getting the book finished and doing prep for the video.

790
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
When are you leaving for the goonery?

791
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I think Saturday or Friday.

792
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I think Saturday.

793
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Okay, okay, okay.

794
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And you'll be gone for a week.

795
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So you're thinking like you feel like you should use that as like a deadline that you want to get it done?

796
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know that I can get all of the commissions done just because...

797
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But Lord of Ghost things is a lot more simple.

798
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I have the information in the spreadsheets.

799
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I just need to look at it, print the label, put the thing in the envelope and send it

800
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and put it in a postbox thing and it'll be fine.

801
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Is it copies of the book that you need to ship?

802
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah, the book with the red man.

803
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I think... I don't know if anyone needs to pin.

804
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
All the plushies have been sent.

805
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Is it more from the Kickstarter?

806
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah.

807
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh, you didn't send them already?

808
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Well, there was some complications with some of them and then they took a while to get back to me

809
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and now they weren't in the previous batch that I did before I came over for Boston Con, whatever we call that,

810
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:31,000
when I came over to America to get COVID, to see the sites and to taste the COVID.

811
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The local flavor, yeah.

812
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So I meant to do everything else when I get back, when I assumed I got back, but then I didn't.

813
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I understand.

814
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And it's just a big... I try not to put myself down too much, so I'm not going to.

815
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But I will get around to it on a Monday.

816
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I also... Yeah, I've mentioned... I have a couple of unsent, Road to Radcon and Plebenweed Blu-rays here.

817
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I think a few, maybe a week ago or so, I finished...

818
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I decided, okay, I have made every attempt that I feel that I can to try to find these people

819
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
and double check that these are their current addresses.

820
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I don't think I can do any more on my own for that, so I'm just going to send them to the addresses that I have

821
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
and hope that they are correct.

822
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So I have a pile of maybe seven of those over here, and I was going to send them this week.

823
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But then, RFCKcon, I made the slime bottles, and a couple people told me they wanted to buy slime bottles.

824
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I was like, okay, well, I'll need to get more bottles, and I'll need to make some more slime and bottle it

825
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and etch the glass and all that, which is fine.

826
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
But so now I'm like, okay, well, I'm going to... I'll send them all together, so I won't send these just yet.

827
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'll send them all and I'll need to get boxes for that.

828
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So I've found another excuse to put off mailing these packages, all for the sake of saving myself

829
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
an hour and a half of going to the post office one time.

830
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Very stupid.

831
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't know if you know, but the five-pound note changed to a new updated five-pound note.

832
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Like they changed the design?

833
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
They've changed the design. They don't use paper like they used to. It's like a plastic sort of thing.

834
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh, okay.

835
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And it's all new, and they said the five-pound notes are no longer legal tender, but you can deposit them.

836
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You can trade them in. I have had like 15 five-pound notes in my wallet since then.

837
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I just have never gotten around to going to a bank and saying, can I put this money in my account?

838
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
What's that? It's probably like $100 or something, right?

839
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
15 five-pound notes.

840
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That'd be 75 pounds, which is gonna be more than $100.

841
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's around. It's a nice amount of money, and it's just in my wallet because I don't use my wallet at all.

842
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I mean, I have it. I look at it. I bring it to places. I just was like, oh, I gotta go to the bank.

843
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That's like a bus ride. Nah.

844
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean.

845
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I have since, gosh, it must be a year and a half or maybe two years almost.

846
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I've had a box with my old broken Cintiq.

847
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah, I had to replace my Cintiq a while ago, and you can sell a broken one on eBay,

848
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and people will buy it for the parts or for restoration.

849
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I think I could probably get like $100 for it.

850
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Maybe a little more. I don't know.

851
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I can get something.

852
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's a big, heavy box. It's been sitting in my room, and I keep telling myself,

853
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
oh, I gotta list it on. It's been on my to-do list for ages.

854
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I gotta list it on eBay. I gotta send it through eBay.

855
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But then it's like, okay, but before I do that, I have to determine how much shipping is gonna be.

856
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And then I'll have to sign into my eBay account again,

857
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and then I'll have to remind myself how to do a listing, which I haven't done that in forever.

858
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So it's like, yeah, I've been putting off the steps to actually do that.

859
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So that's about $100 in cash that I could liquidate.

860
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's just hard. It's too hard.

861
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I can't do it. It's too hard, and I can't do it.

862
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Surely there exists like AI functionality to be like a virtual assistant

863
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
that will remind you of all the things you need to do.

864
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's called a to-do list, and I have one, and it's on a whiteboard on my door,

865
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and that has, and CellSyntique has been on it for at least a year.

866
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But that doesn't work because it becomes something that you become accustomed to looking at

867
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and not reading because you know what's on it, and then it doesn't actually remind you to do it.

868
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You're just being like, oh yeah, at some point I should look at that list.

869
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's the thing to do is to look at the list, but you don't do it

870
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
because you need another to-do list that reminds you to look at the to-do list.

871
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And one of the items on that to-do list is check to-do list.

872
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yeah, so if there was an AI like, I don't know, Alexa or whatever it is,

873
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:00,000
that could be like, hey, you could do this and that if you go to the bank,

874
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and this and that, and you should, I don't know how it would work.

875
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't know how, but when you have a huge list of things to do,

876
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
it's overwhelming and having a secretary

877
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
is like how people deal with so many things that they need to do

878
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
if they're a big shot office-having motherfucker.

879
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
There was a call and you need to return the call and here's an email

880
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and someone's waiting for you, it's an assassin because this is a black and white film.

881
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yeah, that would do it.

882
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
The only thing is, what would stop me from just not using the secretary app?

883
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
They would need to be like, have too much access to my computer

884
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and they would pop up in the bottom right corner, like clippy and annoy me

885
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and I would want to turn them off.

886
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So really, there's no way to make a good thing happen.

887
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Now you just sound like the damn labor party.

888
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You're not like Kier Starmer, there's no way, you can't do it.

889
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You become the thing.

890
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
There's one problem, I give up.

891
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
He doesn't really sound like that, he's just sort of lame.

892
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yeah, I just assume that they're the same as the Democrats in every way,

893
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
that's how I would describe them as well.

894
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's odd, I don't really know anything about labor because they have so little presence.

895
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,000
The only thing I hear about Kier Starmer is him saying that Boris Johnson is bad

896
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and that's been the news forever.

897
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
They say that the conservators are not doing very well, they're doing things bad.

898
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm like, yeah, I agree.

899
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Are you progressive labor party? Are you transpositive?

900
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I have no idea where you lie on so many things.

901
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Do you have a manifesto? I can't be bothered to look for a fuck you.

902
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I'll just wait until there's an election and then they'll probably be saying more stuff.

903
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Then I can look at it and listen into it and be like, okay, well, that sounds okay.

904
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'll put my vote.

905
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I just saw on Twitter, this is funny, Justin Wang just liked a reply to my reply to a meme that I didn't like.

906
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So I don't know what that says.

907
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
That means you're famous.

908
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Oh yeah?

909
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah, now you're with the big league.

910
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Well, here, look at this.

911
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Let's get into it briefly.

912
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Here's the meme.

913
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Garlic bread.

914
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And I think it sucks. I don't really like it or get it.

915
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Well, there's bread, there's a girl, there's garlic bread, there's a different girl.

916
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
She's got white hair, we're in a white blouse or whatever.

917
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And she's got bigger tits.

918
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
That's it.

919
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I don't know, I guess it's just saying tits good and sure, what's the joke?

920
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
This person assumedly likes garlic bread and big boobies.

921
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So do I, but I think this is irritating. I think this is obnoxious.

922
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I don't know.

923
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It isn't saying anything in particular.

924
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's just not saying anything.

925
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I think it is the sort of meme for a horny teenage person who just is enjoying the fact that they are looking at boobs.

926
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And then they would like the meme for that reason.

927
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I get it, but do we need the pretext of a meme to do that?

928
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I don't know, it's just not funny. I just think it's banal.

929
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I think it's banal and I don't like it.

930
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Yes, absolutely.

931
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So I posted, what's the joke?

932
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And someone replied, I fucked the bread.

933
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And Justin Wang liked the reply that said I fucked the bread.

934
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
So I mean, okay, that's cool, I guess.

935
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It's fine, it's fine.

936
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I'll invent a joke.

937
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's not a joke.

938
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Justin should like my tweet, my killjoy tweet being like, hey, it's not funny though.

939
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
He should like that one. He should think that that's better.

940
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You should have tweeted that garlic makes your boobs bigger.

941
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It does. That's a fact.

942
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That's a fact though.

943
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Because that's the...

944
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
What is a guy in this hypothetical world where a girl is bread?

945
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Butter?

946
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I don't know.

947
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I think you have garlic bread without butter involved.

948
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's just a more complicated way to say boobs are good.

949
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But it's not like a funny way to say it.

950
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's just a more complicated but not funny way to say...

951
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's kind of an anti-joke in that way.

952
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I don't know, I think that's given it too much credit.

953
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I think it's given it too much credit to call it an anti-joke.

954
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I would call it simply a failed joke.

955
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But 300, no, 500 people liked the tweet and thought it was funny.

956
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And I hate those 580 people.

957
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And I hate you, Justin Wang.

958
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You do look like Steve Aoki.

959
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I don't actually know what Steve Aoki looks like.

960
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
What does Justin Wang do? Is he a Tuber?

961
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
He is a YouTuber.

962
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
He's a very big Twitter account.

963
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
He makes YouTube videos.

964
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I see him occasionally.

965
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,000
He makes YouTube videos that are sort of explaining some stupid internet fact.

966
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
He'll explain what the come box is or something like that.

967
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
He's funny.

968
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Anyway, I just noticed that right now.

969
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And that really is the last thing that happened to me this week.

970
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That really is my whole week because that literally happened like 10 minutes ago.

971
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I feel like this is the sort of like, you know, I attempt to make a meme.

972
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But like something that funnier people will take and then add to to make it funny.

973
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And then the fact that they altered it further would be funny.

974
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The original doesn't mean much.

975
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like bread, garlic bread, third thing that has nothing to do with bread or boobs.

976
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Yeah, like wait a minute.

977
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I made it like wait a minute.

978
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Check this out and it's just pictures of actual bread.

979
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
What do you think?

980
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
What do you think?

981
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Did I did I do it right?

982
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You get two pictures of bread and the caption is tits larger tits.

983
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And it's a bread roll.

984
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And one of the rolls is crusty and looks nicer.

985
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Not even garlic.

986
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And it's just a nice bread roll.

987
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It sucks.

988
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Delicious.

989
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It's making me hungry.

990
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I ate pasta.

991
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I ate free pasta from some roommate or other.

992
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Just put like some leftover pasta that had I assume people are moving out and just left like leftover pasta.

993
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So I ate that yesterday.

994
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That was my food.

995
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So I didn't have to pay for it.

996
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It was great.

997
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
There's nothing like free roommate pasta.

998
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Do you know what I mean?

999
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Just left out open.

1000
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Well, it was I mean the package was had been opened, but it was like put in a in like a box.

1001
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So it had not been like attacked by rodents or anything.

1002
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah, the rodents hadn't got into it and taken a dime dump on it.

1003
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Somebody did leave a package of pasta out on the counter and mice did get into it.

1004
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And there was mouse poop all around it and that was gross.

1005
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah, that was disgusting.

1006
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah, it was horrible.

1007
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
That was a while ago.

1008
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I got rid of it.

1009
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
My kitchen is looking pretty.

1010
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah, my kid.

1011
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, the fucking garbage that people forgot to take out fruit flies.

1012
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
My kitchen is looking even grosser than what then usual at the moment.

1013
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So but I'm moving out soon and I don't care.

1014
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And my I have not heard from my landlord in a while and I hope to continue to not hear from her until I am gone.

1015
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And that would just be and that would just be great.

1016
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Not not looking forward to probably the inevitable interaction where she says like hey you still haven't paid for the last month's rent.

1017
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I tend not to know what she's talking about.

1018
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And I say, I don't know.

1019
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Oh, but I already paid.

1020
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I paid last month's rent when I moved in and then pretend that I don't realize that it's two different months that she's talking about.

1021
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Or when she says that and I say, oh, no, but it's an I put it in the mail.

1022
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh, it's in the mail.

1023
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You should have got it or whatever.

1024
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Just make it annoying for her on purpose.

1025
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Careful, Ben.

1026
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
She may watch the procrastinator.

1027
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
She's watching the podcast.

1028
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
She knows.

1029
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
She knows she's going to use this against me in court.

1030
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It is incriminating, but that's OK.

1031
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
That's all.

1032
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I'll go to jail.

1033
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I am going to jail for this.

1034
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Hey, you know, that's it.

1035
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
That's all I got.

1036
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Recently, I've gotten real big into old school runes.

1037
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Recently, I've gotten real big.

1038
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Well, I mean, that is another topic I've been gaining weight.

1039
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Because in a deliberate sort of way.

1040
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah, I have been tracking my weight.

1041
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And let me see where I am right now.

1042
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I've been weighing myself and doing all the calorie counting.

1043
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I started on the June 22nd at 62.7 kilograms.

1044
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I think I can change that to pounds.

1045
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
There we go.

1046
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
138 pounds.

1047
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That was your starting point?

1048
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah.

1049
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And it's gone up and down a bit.

1050
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But right now, I'm at 142.4 pounds.

1051
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
So that's why that's 12, 14.

1052
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
What am I looking at?

1053
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Am I stupid?

1054
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
14 pounds.

1055
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Yeah.

1056
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And it's gone straight to my thighs.

1057
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Hell yeah.

1058
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Very nice.

1059
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Very nice.

1060
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I think I've been losing weight.

1061
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I haven't weighed myself in a while.

1062
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
People at RFC KCON seem to say that I looked skinny,

1063
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
which is good.

1064
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
So that's cool.

1065
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Did you ask them about what you should do with your hair?

1066
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
No.

1067
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
No.

1068
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't think that's cool.

1069
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Party discussion.

1070
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Hey guys, should I shave my head?

1071
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I might...

1072
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I don't know.

1073
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I might see...

1074
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm going to look into it a little more.

1075
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I might try and see how hard it is to get finasteride

1076
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and maybe just try it for a little bit and just see what happens.

1077
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I don't know.

1078
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh, finasteride.

1079
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I'm not even doing it.

1080
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I don't know.

1081
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I don't know.

1082
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm thinking about it.

1083
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I tried finasteride for a little while.

1084
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And I think the only thing it really did was make me really upset.

1085
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Like depressed, which is one of the symptoms.

1086
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
The possible side effects.

1087
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Hell yeah.

1088
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Down turn in mood.

1089
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And I was like, this is so bad.

1090
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Wow.

1091
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And I stopped taking it.

1092
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I was like, all right.

1093
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Well, I'll take estrogen instead.

1094
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
That's probably more fun.

1095
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Okay.

1096
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I mean, that's good to know.

1097
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah.

1098
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I mean, the two hair loss products that exist are propitia, which is a topical solution

1099
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
that you put on your head.

1100
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And I don't understand this at all.

1101
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But apparently it only works if you're thinning on the top of your head,

1102
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
like the crown of your head.

1103
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
It doesn't work on your forehead like receding hairline.

1104
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It's just different, I guess.

1105
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I don't know.

1106
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And the other one is finasteride, which is, I guess, is a pill.

1107
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And that one, maybe, that is the one you take to prevent hair loss because it, like,

1108
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
does something to your testosterone or whatever.

1109
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think, I believe the way hair loss works with testosterone is that most men have a gene

1110
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:53,000
that makes the hair follicles in your head sensitive to testosterone.

1111
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And it's a gene that is so ubiquitous that it seemingly happens to basically everybody.

1112
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Some people don't have that gene, and so their hair just stays in.

1113
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And testosterone doesn't affect it.

1114
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
But otherwise, your hair will fall out.

1115
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And the finasteride and other things, they sort of sit in the parking space where testosterone

1116
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
would try to get in, and they stop testosterone from getting in.

1117
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It's like some sort of a T-blocker, which is similar to other testosterone blockers

1118
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
that I have taken for transitioning.

1119
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
But maybe finasteride is more specific for the head.

1120
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Or the hair. I'm not really sure how that works, but it's similar.

1121
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I would want to look into it a little more deeply before I decided to go and do anything with that.

1122
01:10:52,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So I don't know. I'll do some more research and see what it actually does and decide if it's too scary or not.

1123
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Anyway, how did I get on that subject?

1124
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I said I got real big.

1125
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
So the other thing I was going to say is I got really big into old-school runescape.

1126
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I don't know if you've ever played that.

1127
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I have not played it, but I was logged into the PCP account and you recommended that guy settled, I think.

1128
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
He popped up in my feed.

1129
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I wondered if maybe you had watched some on the account or something.

1130
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Or maybe YouTube heard me through my microphone.

1131
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Or it wouldn't have heard me because I didn't talk about it.

1132
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It heard you through my... whatever. It knew.

1133
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It listens to the podcast.

1134
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Maybe honestly, what if it's because you talked about it on the podcast

1135
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
and somehow Google recognized that the podcast you post on YouTube through this account

1136
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
talked about this other YouTube account.

1137
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Here I will recommend you that YouTube.

1138
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's insane, but not even impossible because there's auto captions.

1139
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I wouldn't count it entirely.

1140
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah, auto captions. Yeah, it might.

1141
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Oh, my God. It's going to know that I'm being a shitty tenant on purpose.

1142
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It's going to send me to jail.

1143
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It's going to blow the whistle.

1144
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
No.

1145
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:47,000
It's going to send you targeted ads for going to jail.

1146
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
How to call the police on yourself.

1147
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It's not so bad.

1148
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:59,000
How do you report rent fraud on your own person?

1149
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So, RuneScape.

1150
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
RuneScape. Back when old school RuneScape was made as like a...

1151
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
As a joke.

1152
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
As a joke.

1153
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It was made as a joke upon humanity.

1154
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And it was so funny that it's really popular.

1155
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And it's like 2007 RuneScape.

1156
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And it's like, oh, I remember that I would come home from school and play that game.

1157
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:33,000
RuneScape 3 or just RuneScape had been updated to such as a degree that it just didn't feel like the same game.

1158
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It felt...

1159
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
There was like, every time you logged in there were pop-ups about like, oh, all of these new things you could do in news forums.

1160
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And like, I just want to click on trees and get the logs.

1161
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I don't want to do any of this extra stupid stuff.

1162
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And the graphics have been updated a lot.

1163
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And I'm like, this isn't what I liked.

1164
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So, I made an account called Frisco Cirques because of course I did.

1165
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And I didn't play it for a while.

1166
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And I've just recently just felt because of the YouTube stuff I've been watching to get back into it.

1167
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And I've been grinding.

1168
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I have this secret plan.

1169
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's not a secret.

1170
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:28,000
My plan is to gather the resources necessary to level one of the member's only skills from 0 to 99 without being a member.

1171
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I'm going to gather all of the things I need to level Fletching, which is like, you need logs to turn into arrowheads.

1172
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
You need metal bars to smith into arrow shafts.

1173
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And then you need metal bars to smith into arrowheads.

1174
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You need to collect feathers from killing chickens and various other things.

1175
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So, members are like people that like pay for a subscription, right?

1176
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Yeah, monthly or whatever.

1177
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And so, what explain members only skills?

1178
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Well, free to play skills are like the very basics.

1179
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You've got the combat skills.

1180
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:15,000
You've got ranging, you've got magic, wood cutting, smithing, mining, and fishing and cooking and stuff.

1181
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Members skills are like things created after the member system was made, I think.

1182
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So, you've got like more utility-based skills like Herbalore, which you get herbs and you can turn them into potions.

1183
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
There are various spots where you can plant seeds.

1184
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It's like Farmville, but in RuneScape physical locations, you can plant things and go get the weeds off and watch them grow and then you get stuff.

1185
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
There's Thievery, where you can pickpocket NPCs and monsters to get stuff.

1186
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:05,000
There's Agility, which is the funniest one, where you have to do parkour in various areas to gain agility so that you can get through little shortcuts built all over the game.

1187
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Because RuneScape is big and your character moves really slowly unless you're running.

1188
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And having shortcuts through a wall of a castle to the outside is super useful.

1189
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So, you would train your agility up by doing parkour obstacle courses in the gnome-stronghold or whatever.

1190
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And then you could crawl under a little hole and you could save so much time when you go from this bank to this mining area.

1191
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And it's like, yeah, fun. Agility.

1192
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And Fletching. Fletching is obviously making arrows and stuff, throwable javelins and throwing knives.

1193
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:51,000
There's Slayer, which is like killing specific monsters.

1194
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I don't know really what that's about, but you have to kill special types of monsters that only members can access to level up your Slayer.

1195
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And if you're a Slayer, you're like a hunter of beasts.

1196
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
You're a vampire Slayer. You're this Slayer.

1197
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I don't know anything about it. I never really played members that much.

1198
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And then there's Hunting, which is like setting down little traps to catch rabbits and stuff like that.

1199
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:28,000
What makes it members only? How do you level up a member's only skill?

1200
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Oh, well, there's two different types of worlds in RuneScape.

1201
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Free to play players can log on to free to play worlds where you just can't do anything for those skills. You're just not allowed to.

1202
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You can't go into 90% of the game.

1203
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I mean, there's a huge amount of free to play stuff, but there's so much more outside.

1204
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
There's a gate to Mauritania or like Fremnic or whatever.

1205
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You just can't go through the gate unless you're on a member's world.

1206
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And if you're on a member's world, you have to be a member and you can do everything. That's basically it.

1207
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:29,000
What my plan is, right, is you can, for Fletching, is one of the only members only skills that requires resources that I can gather as a free to play player.

1208
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So logs I can get, metal I can get to turn into arrowheads, feathers I can collect.

1209
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:46,000
So I've made a little plan, I looked at all of the things I would need to make and exactly how much of each resource I would need.

1210
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And I'm just going on like a gathering expedition.

1211
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I'm getting all the stuff and it will take hundreds of hours, but it's fun because I like it.

1212
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I like planning the challenge.

1213
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Because obviously if I was in a member's world, there's so many more places and different ways to gather resources and level up your skills.

1214
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:28,000
There's lots of quests that give special experience boosts, but I have to do it all without member's stuff and that's the hard part.

1215
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's mostly just tedious, but I kind of like it.

1216
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I kind of like the having like an arbitrary goal and then just slowly working my way through.

1217
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I mean, I guess I can see how it would be fun in the broadest sense of the word.

1218
01:19:50,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I mean, a lot of the fun for me was like theory crafting, the route I would take or like I needed a certain...

1219
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:15,000
There's nothing stopping me necessarily from just getting a bunch of money and buying the materials because there's like a grand exchange like player used like a trading thing.

1220
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I don't know how to explain it, but like if you put an item on the grand exchange, that item exists on the exchange and if somebody's looking for that item, they buy it, they get your item.

1221
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So if nobody's using the grand exchange, you can't buy anything from it, but it's constantly been extremely popular because it's more profitable because numbers go up and down.

1222
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:44,000
There's like a real time chart of like what's trending, what items are people buying and selling and all that.

1223
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It's like it's the stock exchange.

1224
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So like it's technically possible for me to buy everything I would need, but that's boring.

1225
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So I want to see if I can like gather it myself, which would require me to get a very, very high level on some of these skills and getting a very high level requires so much of experience gathering,

1226
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
which requires me to get so much more.

1227
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So like I need like over 100,000 coal and it takes a while to get like a full inventory of coal and then put it in the bank.

1228
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So it's like that's a lot of work.

1229
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:36,000
That's a lot of time investment, but it was fun to like figure out what was the most efficient way to get to the end point of 99 Fletching by gathering resources and then using them.

1230
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
So you have not actually started doing it though?

1231
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I started gathering resources.

1232
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I've not done like, I'm not a member yet.

1233
01:21:47,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'm going to like get all of the stuff, make sure I have everything and then go members, go to my bank and just use the stuff to instantly become level 99 by clicking on stuff.

1234
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And it will be like, aha, I did it.

1235
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Challenge complete.

1236
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Wait, that's all you have to do?

1237
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I mean, it takes a lot of stuff, a lot of resources to get to 99 in anything.

1238
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
But yeah, I mean, it's possible.

1239
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh, you haven't, okay, you've started gathering.

1240
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You don't have, you don't have it all yet.

1241
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
No, no, no, no.

1242
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:38,000
A couple thousand Mithril or a couple thousand Adamantine or and Ruinite or like 10,000 willow logs or something and you logs and oak logs.

1243
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I think I got the oak logs.

1244
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Different types of, you know, to make different types of bows and crossbows.

1245
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Naturally, naturally.

1246
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I need like 400,000 feathers, which I can get from killing chickens, but I probably will not kill chickens to get them because it takes so long.

1247
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That would be an ecological disaster.

1248
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Yeah.

1249
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I mean, the chickens in the, there's like a farm just outside Lundbridge up the road to Varric where there's a coop with like, like 12 chickens and they respawn almost instantly.

1250
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So I can just kill them and kill them and kill them and get a bunch of feathers, but.

1251
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
How long would it take to kill 400,000 of them?

1252
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Yeah, it's like, that's an astronomically tedious thing.

1253
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I will probably get as many as I can.

1254
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:36,000
A lot of the, the strategizing is like, how can I gain more than one of these things at the same time?

1255
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I wonder if Ululili has made videos about how to grind for them most effectively.

1256
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
He would.

1257
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
That's the kind of thing he would make a video about.

1258
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Because there's a thing in RuneScape.

1259
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
A lot of mining areas, a lot of areas where you do anything really, have enemies nearby that can harass you if you're too low a level.

1260
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
They'll be aggressive and they'll interrupt you doing something.

1261
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And you have to turn around and kill them or like hide.

1262
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And in a place where there's the fallow door mine, where there's like a bunch of coal and iron.

1263
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
That's a really good place to get that.

1264
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
You don't want to be harassed by these giant scorpions that are roaming around.

1265
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
No, no, no, indeed.

1266
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I do not would not like that at all.

1267
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah.

1268
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So the highest level scorpion in there is like level 32.

1269
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And in order to not get harassed by an enemy monster, you need to be one more than double their level.

1270
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So my combat level needed to be 65 to not get harassed by the scorpion.

1271
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So one of my goals was to get to 65 combat.

1272
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And I thought, well, combat level is determined by your attack, defense and strength things.

1273
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Your prayer level and slightly your magic and your range level.

1274
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
But if I kill chickens, I can get experience in those things.

1275
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,000
So if I kill chickens, I'm getting towards my combat level that I need and I'm getting feathers.

1276
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And the bones they drop, you can bury to get more prayer experience, which also contributes to my combat level.

1277
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So it's like, that's at least three little things I can get if I kill like a thousand chickens.

1278
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I think I ended up killing two thousand of them before I got so bored, I had to do something else.

1279
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I have been watching videos from a Pokémon guy called FlygonHG.

1280
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:40,000
He basically does Nuzlocke challenge runs and then he makes videos where he basically summarizes the runs.

1281
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:50,000
He explains his strategy, he explains how he theory crafted a battle and how it played out and stuff.

1282
01:25:50,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Which is very like, you gotta plan for this battle that's coming up I'm gonna want to have.

1283
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,000
He does it off screen, or maybe he'll do it on his streams instead of in his YouTube videos.

1284
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But like he does the thing where he'll use like a calculator to calculate like, okay, this Pokémon can outspeed that Pokémon.

1285
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Because it has this nature and these IVs, I'll need to grind this many EVs and have it at this level before it can outspeed that.

1286
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Which will let it one shot that to make that not a threat and that's how I'll deal with that.

1287
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Plan that way way way in advance.

1288
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Theory crafting, strategy, trying to be efficient, I get it.

1289
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It's really fun. I think I made a video about Runescape in this exact reason why it's good.

1290
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Because it's extremely slow to do a lot of things in Runescape.

1291
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,000
But the game is so open and you're like free to go anywhere and do anything really.

1292
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:11,000
That a lot of the game involves theory crafting as a natural response to how slow everything is.

1293
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:25,000
You sort of have to either follow a guide or like figure out for yourself how best to do what you want to do without spending an extra thousand hours that you don't need to spend.

1294
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And so a lot of early Runescape memories were me theory crafting, not just experience gain but profitability.

1295
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:47,000
If you go to the Grand Exchange and you buy the materials necessary to make a mithril bar, like one mithril ore and then four coal makes a mithril bar if you smelt it.

1296
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
That's more expensive than selling the mithril bar.

1297
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:05,000
So I realized that if I got some of the coal or just the mithril, I could make the bars obviously slower than if I bought everything but more money efficient.

1298
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And so I could make a profit and it's like, yes, yes, thinking.

1299
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I had like notepad documents of this stuff. It was very fun.

1300
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I want to go back to Mega Man Legends. I said it was comfy and I said it was like the atmosphere.

1301
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I think it's more specific than that. I think what's enjoyable about the experience of playing that game is that it has a really strong sense of place.

1302
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:50,000
It's set on this place called Catalox Island and it's just this nice little island that you're on.

1303
01:28:50,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It's just a nice place to be. There's like nice woods, nice fields, there's a nice little town, nice little shopping arcade.

1304
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You go around and there's just stuff to do in it. It's sunny, it's beautiful, the aesthetics are perfect.

1305
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It's like a continuous little world because everything takes place on this island.

1306
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
There are ruins underneath the city and there's like a threat.

1307
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Oh no, pirates are attacking. Well, that's not good. There's an ancient legend that disaster will happen if this happens.

1308
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Oh, you better prevent that. But it's just a nice place that it puts you in and lets you just hang out there and gives you tasks to do.

1309
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So I had to go back and do all the extra tasks because I wanted to hang out on Catalox Island some more.

1310
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Gotta go and complete all the minigames for the local news stations game show or whatever.

1311
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Gotta help the fucking punk kids build their little clubhouse out in the woods and trade them beetles in exchange for spare parts to upgrade your gun with.

1312
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:28,000
What a game. There's a sequel. I've heard people say that the second one, I've heard people say they like the first one better for atmosphere reasons, which is a bit of a shame.

1313
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:40,000
But I'm hoping to enjoy that as well. I really thought it would be boring but I loved it. I was very happy.

1314
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I might have to play it then. I recommend it. I'm a real big fan of virtual spaces that I would like to be in for real actually.

1315
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I feel like the nice sunny and the grass and the way you're describing it at least.

1316
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I think you would like it a lot. That's not a feeling that I think I'm particularly attuned to but even my small heart grew three sizes on Catalox Island.

1317
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I think the second one takes place in like a forbidden land inside of like a storm. I think maybe it's going to be less comfy so I gotta prepare myself.

1318
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Did you ever play Wii Fit?

1319
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Wii Fit? The exercise game? Maybe I messed around with it a little bit when the Wii was new.

1320
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:09,000
There's this running mini game and that takes you to an island that I think appears in like some other Nintendo something or other game with planes.

1321
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I don't know what it's called. It's like Nintendo Mi Island or something and you run by like putting the Wii remote in your pocket and jumping up and down like jogging on the spot.

1322
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:33,000
But I really love that environment. The track that you go on because it's the sound design of the location. It's a sunny day and it's a nice island.

1323
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You run with your Mi and there's Mi's coming the other way and running past you and stuff or Mi's you can overtake and it's just sort of like the sound design is minimal. There's no music.

1324
01:32:49,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It feels like the footsteps echo when you're like under a rocky sort of bit near the mountain and there's like oh you're in the shade and it's sort of like a path was cut into the mountain.

1325
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,000
You go around a bit and you come down and there's like a rope bridge and it's windy and it's like creaking a bit.

1326
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And you're running over that and it's like oh this is so cool. I love this place. If only I could go off the track but you're not like choosing the direction you're just making the inputs to run and your character runs by itself.

1327
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:34,000
But the path it takes is just it's so scenic. It's so like nice and atmospheric is like that's that's I would like to be on an island right now. I want to be in a nice sunny island.

1328
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Jogging and I want to come back and have like a little nice drink of water with a cherry or something.

1329
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I can see a little I found a little video of a We Fit aerobics free run. Yeah. Running along a nice little. A nice little path.

1330
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It made me exercise. Imagine that. Imagine video games doing that.

1331
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Not not since Pokemon Go has a video game done such a thing for me.

1332
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Good good good video game reminds me of you know that guy on Twitter. I think his name is Arthur Vieiter making that game called.

1333
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think it's called Zeta Gal. Yes that one that looks clearly clearly clearly is visually inspired by legends. Good good good stuff.

1334
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I don't know. I don't know why I bounced off it as a kid and then I came back to it and I'm like wow actually actually this game looks and feels great and it rules in every way.

1335
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:53,000
What the fuck except except the weird tank controls are just bad but like whatever you get used to it.

1336
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Well you may be like against it being 3D now.

1337
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I think it was just like I think because my usual games that I played were like side scrolling action kind of like shooter or like yeah platformers.

1338
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And I think the pace of combat in legends is just a little more positioning it's kind of like moving around and it's not so much of like an action knee experience and I think I maybe found it a little dull.

1339
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
In the in the combat.

1340
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Because it's kind of it's kind of about you know.

1341
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Ocarina of time you know lock on to your opponent and shoot into them only you can't like circle strafe to dodge them.

1342
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Because you can't like move while you're locked on so it's quite stiff.

1343
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Yeah I think that's probably why I found the combat a little stiff and dull.

1344
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Which it is which it is but you can get you sure do feel powerful when you get the right buster upgrades and you boost your damage really high.

1345
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And now you're and now you're fucking shit up that that is pretty satisfying.

1346
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Boosting your stats.

1347
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Oh yeah buying buying buying buster buster upgrade Omega at the junk shop baby.

1348
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1349
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Okay yeah.

1350
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I love accruing power.

1351
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I do love accruing power both in video games and in real life.

1352
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And I love exercising that power against my enemies and the against those weaker than myself.

1353
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Do you want to fuck the way fuck the week.

1354
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Fuck the week fuck the week.

1355
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Do you want do you want to start voicemails.

1356
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Do I have anything else to say.

1357
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I get no.

1358
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Australian alien.

1359
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Good day.

1360
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Good day.

1361
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
We can start voicemails.

1362
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Okay let's do it.

1363
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:11,000
All right I am I think the first one is called based saint three two one go.

1364
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And then it's all like as a registered Democrat.

1365
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I want us to be as open and generous with pedophiles possible because I stand all of them.

1366
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
They are all my gods.

1367
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
They are my kings and queens and I won't.

1368
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I went too far.

1369
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But anyone smirks them.

1370
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I went sees these Democrats have gone too far this time.

1371
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
You didn't go far enough.

1372
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I know blue Ben you're not blue enough.

1373
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I've only got to be blue in the face.

1374
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I only valorize groomers.

1375
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I have not taken the plunge into becoming one as my ideology dictates I eventually must.

1376
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Alas.

1377
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Okay next one is called when I have downtime at work.

1378
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And it's an image.

1379
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It's an image or album.

1380
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Oh it is more from Vinnie I think.

1381
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Let me see the big Vinnie Vidi Vici.

1382
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Yeah it is doodles of me vaping.

1383
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Vaping the phantom or a smoke vape cloud.

1384
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Oh is that what that is?

1385
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
The phantom.

1386
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Oh yeah.

1387
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This one of the skull cloud looks pretty cool.

1388
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Wait this is your gear second and gear third.

1389
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
What is the gear fourth?

1390
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
You're holding a vape?

1391
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Oh it's my mod.

1392
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
My gear fourth with my mod I see.

1393
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I mean it looks pretty cool.

1394
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Oh yeah the skull behind.

1395
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It's funny this is like it's more in line with like a bankai than it is a gear fourth three thing.

1396
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
But nobody watches Bleach anymore or Bleach is dead.

1397
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm putting a gummy worm into my vape rig.

1398
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I gotta do it.

1399
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Vapable gummies.

1400
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Tiny cereal with a big spoon.

1401
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I vaguely remember saying that.

1402
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Why do you look like you're blushing about this?

1403
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I kinda do yeah.

1404
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I think it's maybe supposed to be shadow but yeah it looks a little bit like tiny cereal with big spoon.

1405
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Big cereal with little spoon.

1406
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Oh yeah the donut sized Cheerios.

1407
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Oh no and then I peed my pants.

1408
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Oh it's so...

1409
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
That's visceral.

1410
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I need to hydrate.

1411
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I need to hydrate more if that's what my pee looks like.

1412
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
That's very dark.

1413
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Gotta watch out for kidney stones.

1414
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Give and take this is probably your first time seeing these.

1415
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I usually send these to Ben's Discord but I fear none of them have been shared with you Gib.

1416
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So here they are you can get them first if you add me on Discord.

1417
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Vinny does DM me these on Discord and to be honest I kind of I don't look at them because I expect to see them on the podcast.

1418
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Yeah send them on the podcast that's fine.

1419
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I like these...

1420
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
This one of...

1421
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I think this one's my favorite.

1422
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
This one with the little skull floating up above me there.

1423
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
That is a nice one.

1424
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I like that one a lot yeah.

1425
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
These are very cool.

1426
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Very nice.

1427
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Lovely.

1428
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Where was I?

1429
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
The next one is called Son of a Glitch.

1430
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's another vocal room.

1431
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Okay three two one go.

1432
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
My favorite show on the internet Son of a Glitch.

1433
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Get money.

1434
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Acquire monetary value.

1435
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Acquire monetary value.

1436
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Acquire monetary value.

1437
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Acquire monetary value.

1438
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Acquire monetary value.

1439
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Acquire monetary value.

1440
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Acquire monetary value.

1441
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Acquire monetary value.

1442
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Acquire monetary value.

1443
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Yeah that's true.

1444
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I hope they acquire monetary value.

1445
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Whose other voice was that?

1446
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
It could be made.

1447
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Madey.

1448
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Who?

1449
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
The guy is an animator.

1450
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I remember living saying on a Minecraft server they recorded a bunch of these.

1451
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It could be 4 eyes.

1452
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah you know what.

1453
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
It's probably 4 eyes actually.

1454
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Oh right.

1455
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
For some reason I thought it was a PCP clip but no you're right.

1456
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Yeah that's probably it.

1457
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Monetary.

1458
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I hope they don't acquire monetary value.

1459
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Personally I would rather have that for myself than them have it.

1460
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
That's just my opinion.

1461
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
The next one is called The True Nature of PCP 321 Go.

1462
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,000
This is the show where you must always be correct.

1463
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And if you don't we'll fucking skin you alive.

1464
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I feel like that's another fly and I missed it again but I'll get it.

1465
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
That should be every show.

1466
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Every show you should be correct or you get skinned alive.

1467
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
That should just be how it works.

1468
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Can't they just kill me first?

1469
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I don't want to be alive for that.

1470
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I'd rather be dead than correct.

1471
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I need to grab another sparkling water.

1472
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
What if I was skint alive?

1473
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Like I had no money.

1474
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Skint?

1475
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah.

1476
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Is that a word?

1477
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
No money.

1478
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
You're broke.

1479
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Well if you're broke then you will eventually die.

1480
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
You must have some monetary.

1481
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Well maybe not.

1482
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
You probably can live on no money for a while.

1483
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I lap up rain water puddles for water and I eat rocks.

1484
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
An untapped potential of the earth.

1485
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,000
The power of the earth and stones beneath our feet.

1486
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I will absorb it for myself and I will become like the thing from the Fantastic Four.

1487
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
And I will be unstoppable.

1488
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Yes.

1489
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I stretch myself too thin.

1490
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Always doing all these things.

1491
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
That's why I became a stretchable man.

1492
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
And you, Johnny, you have a fiery personality.

1493
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So you're on fire and you, Ben, you were always eating rocks.

1494
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So now you're made of them.

1495
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
It's ironic, you see.

1496
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
When is radioactivity supposed to be ironic?

1497
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That doesn't make sense.

1498
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
It's just radioactivity.

1499
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
No, it's a fable.

1500
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It's a fable about men.

1501
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
No, they're real.

1502
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
They're really real and they're so understandable.

1503
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And in terms of, you can quantify their powers.

1504
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Incorrect.

1505
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
You can put them on like who's stronger than who.

1506
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Some things are beyond mankind's ability to understand or test or quantify or verify.

1507
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:57,000
It's like that episode of My Little Pony where Twilight Sparkle tells Pinkie Pie,

1508
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:07,000
you're right Pinkie, science is fake and only through faith can we achieve world peace.

1509
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Can we achieve solidarity among ponies and dominate the outside peoples?

1510
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:28,000
The next one is called, is PR HTML port still planned?

1511
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Is Phantom's Revenge HTML port still planned?

1512
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Maybe Kickstarter goal to pay someone for it.

1513
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Shit, I think I did.

1514
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Wait, fuck.

1515
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I think I might have gotten someone on Fiverr to do that and then I might have just forgot about it.

1516
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I should check Fiverr and see if that happened.

1517
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Yeah, I would like to do that.

1518
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I would like to make an HTML version.

1519
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I would like to put it on Steam at some point.

1520
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I would do that after the book is getting printed already.

1521
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So yeah, that's still planned although I haven't been thinking about it for a while.

1522
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I'm mostly just worried about getting the Kickstarter going.

1523
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Next one is, what do you think of Trixie's new content?

1524
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I don't think about it.

1525
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I haven't seen anything so I don't know.

1526
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Yeah.

1527
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Next one is another Vocalru link.

1528
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1529
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Was this open voice message thing ever a problem?

1530
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Because somebody could just say the end word.

1531
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Send one of these.

1532
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Otherwise, do you just cut it from the video?

1533
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I mean, he's right.

1534
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
He is correct.

1535
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I honestly don't get that much of people just saying the end word.

1536
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
So he will not be skinned alive?

1537
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
No, I haven't really had that in a while.

1538
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Voice mail is be slacking.

1539
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Voice mail trolls be slacking.

1540
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Yeah, most voice mails are fine even if they suck.

1541
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
They're not, like, cuttable.

1542
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Yeah.

1543
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Speaking of cuttable, the next three are...

1544
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Well, the next two are YouTube links,

1545
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
and then the third one says no part three because rape joke,

1546
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
and I don't want to shock y'all.

1547
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
This guy is assuming we're clicking on these YouTube videos.

1548
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I'll be honest, I did, beforehand, I did look,

1549
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
it's like robot chicken clips, and I'm not...

1550
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
It's not...

1551
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I'm not going to indulge this nuts.

1552
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Oh, my God, that's so epic lulls.

1553
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
It was epic.

1554
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It's true. Oh, my God, comedy? I love comedy.

1555
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I'm just like punchy sonichu.

1556
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
You know, I love comedy because it's so funny.

1557
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
That's my...

1558
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I get just like punchy.

1559
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I get mad all the time, but I control my rage

1560
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
by watching TV comedies because they're funny

1561
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
and they make me laugh.

1562
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
That's my character.

1563
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Okay.

1564
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
All right, anyway.

1565
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
A bunch of YouTube links that I will not be checking.

1566
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And then the next one...

1567
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Oh, this is your weekly reminder to play Deltarune Chapter 2.

1568
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Oh, yes, I don't want to miss that.

1569
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Okay, noted. Thank you, voicemailer.

1570
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Next one is called Big Farmer.

1571
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Three, two, one, go.

1572
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Greetings.

1573
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
It is I, the medical establishment,

1574
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
the death furnace known as Endless Drugs.

1575
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Big Farmer from Balan, Wonderworld.

1576
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
And I'm here to tell you today, Ben,

1577
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
that your hair loss problem

1578
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
can potentially be reversed

1579
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
with finasteride and topical monoxidil.

1580
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Now, I know you've seen

1581
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
those games on the box adverts

1582
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
telling you, oh, you...

1583
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
It's all the same stuff that's in there.

1584
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Just the generic versions of the drugs.

1585
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Much cheaper, mind you.

1586
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Now, if you just have a look

1587
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
on Google images, type in

1588
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
finasteride before and after,

1589
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
you'll see that some people do see

1590
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
regrowth. It is a possibility.

1591
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
And I know you think, oh, no,

1592
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I'm too far gone and blah, blah, blah.

1593
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
No, just have a look

1594
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
and give it a go. Remember Tengen,

1595
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Popping Guru and Lagann. Remember Simon.

1596
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
How hard he had to try against the antispirals.

1597
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I do when Simon started

1598
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
balding.

1599
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Well, let this be your drill,

1600
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Ben. Let finasteride

1601
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
be the drill that you need to make

1602
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
your last stand against the antispirals

1603
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
that is your receding hairline.

1604
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I'm so lame.

1605
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I promise you it won't make you a girl.

1606
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Didn't happen for me, but I do have a lovely head of hair.

1607
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
So,

1608
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I would recommend it. Give it a go.

1609
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
All the best and you don't have to tell anyone

1610
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
if it doesn't work. Just stop using it and give up then.

1611
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
But you don't have to give up now.

1612
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
All right. Take care. Bye.

1613
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I did.

1614
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
That HBomer guy?

1615
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I did. I did, in fact, Google.

1616
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Actually, it's funny. Yeah, like this morning

1617
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
or last night I did, in fact,

1618
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Google finasteride before and after.

1619
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's just a little

1620
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
weird because some of them

1621
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
some of those results seem like they might also

1622
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
be like surgical as well.

1623
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
It's a little hard to tease out

1624
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
which ones are like just finasteride,

1625
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
which ones are not surgical.

1626
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
They don't...

1627
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
It's not always entirely clear.

1628
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
This is such a lame problem.

1629
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
I don't know. I feel really lame even caring about it.

1630
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I genuinely think that, like,

1631
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
the cool thing to do is to not

1632
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
give a fuck if you lose your hair.

1633
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I think that's cooler.

1634
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And I think if I was a better person,

1635
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
that would be how I feel about it.

1636
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
But I'm not. I'm not good enough.

1637
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And that's

1638
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
so there.

1639
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I mean, there's

1640
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
another second pathology that I have

1641
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
about the whole issue.

1642
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Think about it like this.

1643
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
You came out the womb with no hair.

1644
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
You can go back in the womb

1645
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
with no hair.

1646
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Yeah, that's the goal.

1647
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I thought you were going to say you go to the grave

1648
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
with no hair, but no.

1649
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Okay.

1650
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Well, that's food for thought.

1651
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Okay.

1652
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Next one is called

1653
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
also

1654
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
when do y'all record an episode

1655
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
but there is a voicemail

1656
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
attached. So let's give it a listen.

1657
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Three, two, one, go.

1658
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Bro, I'm making

1659
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
the best fan art ever.

1660
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
It's going to be so fucking funny.

1661
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
But also

1662
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
is

1663
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
a draw cast now

1664
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
different

1665
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
a separate thing you could

1666
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
y'all could make a draw cast

1667
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
anytime

1668
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
and you

1669
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
would be just another episode.

1670
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I mean, right?

1671
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I mean, I guess we could.

1672
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
We could, yeah. I guess as we could do that.

1673
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I just think

1674
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
it's

1675
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
it was more fun when it was a larger group.

1676
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Yeah, it would just be you and me.

1677
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Like, I mean, okay.

1678
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I would draw something and you would look and be like, wow, cool.

1679
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Yeah. And you would draw something

1680
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
and you would be like, oh, wow, cool.

1681
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Yeah.

1682
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Oblivion Fall

1683
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
and Sea Toll and those

1684
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
guys

1685
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
they sort of have their own

1686
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
little draw cast. I don't know if they've done one in a while.

1687
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
But

1688
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
they're sort of doing the same thing because they

1689
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
you know, because they have like a little

1690
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
a little gaggle of people over in that server

1691
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
who want to be on those episodes.

1692
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
So I mean, they're kind of doing

1693
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
we don't have the manpower

1694
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
to make them quite like we used to

1695
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
anymore.

1696
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So I mean, I think that's what they're trying

1697
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
to recapture over there a bit.

1698
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I think.

1699
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Yeah.

1700
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I wouldn't say no to like a stream

1701
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
of drawing

1702
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
together.

1703
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
No, we usually play Minecraft

1704
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
or some other thing for heckles or shekels.

1705
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
But like, we could do a draw

1706
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
thing.

1707
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
It'd be nice and chill. I haven't

1708
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I haven't drawn in a while. The only thing I've

1709
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
drawn recently was your birthday gift.

1710
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But I need to draw.

1711
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I need to draw a cover for

1712
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Slime and Punishment and I have not even started

1713
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
that.

1714
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I've been putting that off and putting that off.

1715
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
You got to do that at some point.

1716
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Yeah.

1717
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Yeah.

1718
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I was considering like, did I mention this?

1719
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I was considering like maybe I should pay someone

1720
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
famous to do it.

1721
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Oh, like

1722
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Mark Zuckerberg.

1723
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I don't even know. I don't even know who it

1724
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
would be.

1725
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
But like.

1726
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
What's the guy who made Garfield?

1727
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
He's not Brian Epstein. Jim Davis.

1728
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Jim Davis.

1729
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I should pay Scott Adams.

1730
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
He's on Twitter posting about how he murdered

1731
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
his son and shit.

1732
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
He'll do anything.

1733
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Get the odd ones out to draw.

1734
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I don't know. I was considering maybe

1735
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
if I should instead of drawing it myself

1736
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I should pay someone famous to do it.

1737
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
But like who would I even get to do it? I don't know.

1738
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
The only person who like

1739
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I don't know.

1740
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I probably couldn't get Harry Partridge

1741
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
to do it. He seems like too big of a

1742
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
reach.

1743
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I don't know if he does.

1744
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Yeah, I don't even know if he takes art

1745
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
commissions or does anything like that.

1746
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
No, he's usually working on

1747
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
big animation projects.

1748
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Yeah.

1749
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
So that's probably not a

1750
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
but that was the only like name that

1751
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
popped into my head of like

1752
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
someone who

1753
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I was thinking like you know

1754
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
internet creators who like

1755
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
one, don't suck

1756
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
and two like

1757
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
are sort of in on like the Chris

1758
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Chan joke.

1759
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I mean most.

1760
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Yeah.

1761
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
And I was that was the only

1762
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
the only one that popped up in my

1763
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
mind and it's like

1764
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
so I probably

1765
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
just dropped myself.

1766
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I did everything else myself.

1767
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I'll do it. I'll do it again.

1768
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Oh

1769
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
anyway, you ask when did we record an episode

1770
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
we usually record

1771
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
at 10 a.m. on

1772
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Sundays. That's Eastern Standard Time.

1773
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
That's the answer.

1774
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Next one is what's the origin

1775
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
of Ben with big tits?

1776
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I don't know.

1777
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I don't really think there is one other than that

1778
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
like it was more of like a gib

1779
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
with huge tits thing and then new drew

1780
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
those comics and just gave us both huge

1781
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
tits.

1782
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
It could be a combination of things.

1783
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
We did do that one bonus episode where we talked

1784
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
about tits.

1785
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
There was

1786
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
no because I got

1787
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I think it was

1788
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
the

1789
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
the the pro and on

1790
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
cast did

1791
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
some of them did like art of me with

1792
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
big tits at one point a while

1793
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
ago and I don't remember

1794
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
why that I don't remember what sparked

1795
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
that but there was something

1796
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
there was another time that it happened and

1797
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
it was probably like

1798
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
oh so many PCP members

1799
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
of trans now bends next

1800
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
let's draw like female Ben St

1801
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
and that was maybe

1802
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
maybe yeah that might that might have been it yeah

1803
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
fem saint as they say

1804
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
fem saint that is

1805
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
what they call her

1806
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
what about fem snakes

1807
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
what a

1808
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I don't I don't know

1809
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I don't know

1810
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
next one is called happy birthday

1811
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Ben and there's actually a voicemail

1812
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
so three two one go

1813
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I

1814
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
think it's just going to be blank

1815
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
that was worth that was worth it

1816
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
oh golem noise

1817
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
next one is called I'll ask again

1818
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
where is Tom Oliver I

1819
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I just don't know what to tell you

1820
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I don't know what else

1821
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
we answer this question

1822
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
what do you want me to say

1823
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
what do you want

1824
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
how much more

1825
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
can I tell you

1826
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
they said where

1827
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
as in W E A R

1828
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
yeah so they just want to know what he's

1829
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
wearing oh god

1830
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
well I mean probably

1831
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
a beanie

1832
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
and a button down over a t-shirt

1833
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I don't know

1834
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
if he's wearing like a like a full

1835
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
size like a onesie jeans

1836
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
but a beanie onesie

1837
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
there's there's a beanie body

1838
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
there's simply no

1839
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
he's wearing a Godzilla suit

1840
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
24 7

1841
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
oh yeah

1842
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
or a common writer suit

1843
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
oh those are the two things he likes

1844
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
you know what

1845
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
kaiju showed me

1846
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
he got a bit more done of the dojin

1847
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
which is nice

1848
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I think he drew another half of a page

1849
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
maybe he finished that first page

1850
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I'm not sure

1851
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
he's got like 13 to do

1852
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
so I mean I don't know

1853
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
if that kept up that would be

1854
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
it would only be like

1855
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
several more months

1856
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I mean it's something

1857
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
rather than radio silence

1858
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I mean definitely yeah so

1859
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
so that's he messaged me

1860
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
late last night and I saw the message

1861
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
this morning I haven't responded yet

1862
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
but it's good

1863
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
and then the last one is also

1864
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
how are you today Ben

1865
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I guess I'm alright

1866
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
I'm a bit

1867
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
tired because I stayed up really late last

1868
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
night and I only slept maybe like

1869
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
four or five hours

1870
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
so I'm a little tired

1871
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
went a bit off my sleep schedule

1872
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
but other than that I'm doing

1873
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
doing good

1874
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
people always say how are you today Ben

1875
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
they never say where are you today Ben

1876
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I'm coming over

1877
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I'm in your walls yeah

1878
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
no one ever asks

1879
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
how

1880
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
are you today Ben

1881
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
as in how do you exist

1882
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
how can this be

1883
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
that's it

1884
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
that's the last voicemail

1885
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
nice

1886
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I just want to

1887
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
play video games

1888
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I was gonna say I just want to reiterate

1889
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
play Mega Man Legends

1890
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
or 64

1891
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
so good

1892
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
so good I thought I really

1893
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I really did not expect

1894
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
really didn't expect to like it thought it would be a slugs

1895
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
thought it would be a chore

1896
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I will probably play

1897
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I will play Mega Man Legends too I'm

1898
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
considering

1899
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
whether I will play

1900
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
the misadventures

1901
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
of Tron Bon

1902
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
oh god there's a fly

1903
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I miss it again

1904
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
another fucking fruit fly

1905
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I think the misadventures of Tron Bon is on like

1906
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
the 3DS or something

1907
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
it's

1908
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
probably play it

1909
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
probably play it just for completeness

1910
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I like Tron Bon

1911
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I think she's cool

1912
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I like this that's a game

1913
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
that is the one

1914
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
she's the girl with the

1915
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
serve bots the little yellow robot

1916
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
servants

1917
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
oh is that the little

1918
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I think you would like her actually

1919
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
she seems kind of like

1920
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
kind of like a gib core

1921
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
oh I've seen her

1922
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
she's um

1923
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
with the brown hair and the pink

1924
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
dress

1925
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
the half crescent hair

1926
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
yes

1927
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
and the weird

1928
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
okay I think this is official art

1929
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
this one weirdly

1930
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
emphasizes her

1931
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
cod piece

1932
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I think this is for

1933
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I think this is for

1934
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
like one of the later

1935
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
sort of like games they made

1936
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
sort of like a big tribute to like

1937
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
oh I got him

1938
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
got him that time a third time's the charm

1939
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
yet again

1940
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
uh

1941
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
uh

1942
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
this is for like fucking

1943
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Mega Man X dive or some shit

1944
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I don't know

1945
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
anyway I like her

1946
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
she's a villain

1947
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
and in her game

1948
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
in the misadventures of Tron Bon

1949
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
you basically just go around

1950
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
committing terrorism

1951
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
yeah you go around

1952
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
like demolishing houses

1953
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
like robbing people

1954
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
like uh

1955
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
uh you uh you break into banks

1956
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
and so I think you do also go on

1957
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
just fucking boring like oh

1958
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
go into the ruins and excavate stuff

1959
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
snore

1960
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
um

1961
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
yeah but uh I'll probably play that

1962
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
just because I like it

1963
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
what I really like about this image you posted

1964
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
is that her the front of her skirt has a

1965
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
as a triangle cut out but that is not

1966
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
reflected in the shadow that is cast

1967
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
ooh

1968
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
it doesn't

1969
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
well

1970
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
game destroyed

1971
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
can we excuse that as like

1972
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
the light is coming

1973
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
from the side

1974
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
and so maybe it's sort of not

1975
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
passing through that

1976
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I mean where but it's like

1977
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
falling on her leg in that same way

1978
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
but what if she's illuminated from

1979
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
kind of the upper to her upper

1980
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
left and so like the place on the

1981
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
shadow that would have that would

1982
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
reflect the triangle actually falls

1983
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
further to her

1984
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
right of her leg and so we don't

1985
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
actually see it can we

1986
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
do you buy it do you buy it

1987
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
um like it's like it would be

1988
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
off her body on the floor

1989
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
yes yes

1990
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I think yeah you know that could

1991
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
maybe that could work

1992
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
it's plausible enough that I'm

1993
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
that I'm willing to why is she got like

1994
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
rivets on her

1995
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
on her crutch it's

1996
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
it

1997
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
it is it is like her character

1998
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
she does look like this in the game this

1999
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
it image uncomfortably

2000
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
like makes the cod piece her

2001
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
focal point

2002
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
you know um

2003
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
actually I heard

2004
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
there is

2005
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
a theory I there's a theory from

2006
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
the only the only Reployed

2007
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
YouTuber Reployed Revo

2008
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I heard a theory about this

2009
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
that it's because the bond

2010
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
family there's there's

2011
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
hints in the game that the bond family

2012
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
like used to be like a very

2013
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
famous and like powerful like noble family

2014
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
so it might be

2015
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
that she's like an heiress and

2016
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
there's some weird fucking

2017
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
this is probably putting too much thought into it

2018
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
but maybe it's like she's an heiress

2019
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
she's a princess sort of so she's

2020
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
we got a fucking chest to build her ass

2021
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
or something

2022
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
is she not a robot?

2023
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I don't know

2024
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
is she a robot?

2025
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
the thing about

2026
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
the thing about that

2027
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
is that okay

2028
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
you sort of wouldn't even know it from

2029
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
the games but actually all the

2030
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
people in

2031
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
legends are these things called

2032
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
carbons who are just people

2033
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
but they can

2034
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
just fucking take their body parts off

2035
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
and replace them with robot parts if they feel like it

2036
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
okay so maybe that's like a service

2037
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
hatch she could have a robot

2038
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
she could be totally normal

2039
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
but just have a robot vagina

2040
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
it's possible

2041
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
like you unscrew that and it's like

2042
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
the off switch yeah she

2043
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
took her flesh pussy off

2044
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
and put this on instead and she just left

2045
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
that in like the refrigerator for later

2046
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
or something

2047
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
that's the new version of a chest

2048
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
about is to remove the vagina

2049
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
just remove the vagina just replace

2050
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
it with like an armor piece and probably

2051
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
I don't know it's probably got like

2052
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
an air conditioning system in there or something

2053
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
just like why waste the space

2054
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
like a glove box

2055
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
yeah

2056
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I think that's it

2057
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I think we've

2058
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
I think we've cracked it

2059
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
yeah I mean

2060
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I think these are the in-game models and I mean

2061
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
she does have it

2062
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
although I never really

2063
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
noticed it

2064
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
that's funny

2065
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
they've only got so many

2066
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I don't know if these are the

2067
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
actual models

2068
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
these might be fan made

2069
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
models actually

2070
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I'm gonna go on a hunt

2071
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I'm gonna go on a hunt for the

2072
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
for the real shit

2073
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
well it looks like this could be like

2074
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
the real one versus a fan

2075
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
edited version

2076
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I mean this is

2077
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
no I mean this is

2078
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
that is in the official character design

2079
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
just it's

2080
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I never I never I never noticed

2081
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
it during the game like at all

2082
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
because I'm not a pervert

2083
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
and she's like

2084
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
I think she's supposed to be like 14

2085
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
but I mean

2086
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I don't know

2087
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
it's one of those characters that

2088
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I think she could be any age

2089
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
she doesn't act

2090
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
she doesn't act like a kid

2091
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
although she does have a crush on

2092
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Mega Man

2093
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
but Mega Man is also 14

2094
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
but he you know

2095
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
he's just a guy

2096
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
you know whatever

2097
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
yeah I mean I think

2098
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
with games like this they usually have

2099
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
the ages reflect the people

2100
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
who are going to be playing it

2101
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
so they feel like oh I could be Mega Man

2102
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
this is the little boy

2103
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
you know I'm 14

2104
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
and I go

2105
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
another tidbit that I learned

2106
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
well I didn't really learn this

2107
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
but he Reployed Revo

2108
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
in another video mentioned this

2109
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
and it's true it's really annoying

2110
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
in the English he's just called Mega Man

2111
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
like in the game everyone calls him Mega Man

2112
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
like that's his actual name

2113
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
and you know of course

2114
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
it's supposed to be rock

2115
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
and it literally like spoils

2116
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
the plot because like

2117
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
sort of the twist at the end

2118
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
of

2119
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Mega Man

2120
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Legends is that

2121
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
you find this like a fucking

2122
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
this ancient like fucking computer system

2123
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
and this guy who like

2124
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
is a part of that

2125
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
recognizes you

2126
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
and he says oh you've had your memory wiped

2127
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
you don't remember oh

2128
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
your name is Mega Man Trigger

2129
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I'm Mega Man Juno and we are Mega Man

2130
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
and we're part of this thing and you go like what

2131
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
huh what are you talking about

2132
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I'm just rock

2133
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
and it's like kind of the whole fucking point of the game

2134
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
and they spoiled it because they thought

2135
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
American kids wouldn't

2136
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
want to play the game if his name was not Mega Man

2137
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
very irritating

2138
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
yeah

2139
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I mean I guess it's

2140
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
slightly different because it's Mega Man Trigger

2141
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
like if there's like lore like Mega Man

2142
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
is like a mythical figure

2143
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
but yeah I mean the thing is

2144
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
you meet this guy called Mega Man Juno

2145
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
and that's

2146
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
supposed to be the first time you've heard of a

2147
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Mega Man and it's like I don't know

2148
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
what that is but I guess you're saying

2149
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
that I am whatever you are

2150
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
like the fact that they've

2151
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
been calling you Mega Man

2152
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
the whole time is like well why would

2153
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
they do that I think

2154
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I'm not sure if it's in the game

2155
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
like the manual or something

2156
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
but somewhere there's a reference to

2157
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
the idea that

2158
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
role named Mega Man Mega Man

2159
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
they found him as an orphan

2160
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
and she named him that because

2161
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
she liked Mega Man the video game

2162
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
and she named him after the video game character

2163
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
which is so stupid

2164
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
but I don't know it's just

2165
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
yeah the name is

2166
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
supposed to be like a twist reveal

2167
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
at the very end and they just were like

2168
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
nah kids will be

2169
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
confused if his name is Rock

2170
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
we can't do that

2171
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
it would even have been better to go

2172
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
with like the later thing

2173
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
that they did where they sort of ret

2174
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
in the remakes they retcon it

2175
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
because you know in the English he's Rock

2176
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
but when he's in his battle form he's Rock Man

2177
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
so there's a couple games

2178
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
where they have role call him Mega

2179
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
when he's not in battle

2180
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
mode and then Mega Man

2181
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
when he's in battle mode and like that sucks

2182
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
but that would have

2183
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
sort of preserved

2184
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
that would have sort of preserved the

2185
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
twist

2186
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
hey man

2187
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
you're not just any man

2188
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
you're part of a long line of Mega Man

2189
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
we found you as an orphan

2190
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
and I named you Man after

2191
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
after your genitalia

2192
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
after the people

2193
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
after the species that you belong to

2194
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
the thing about

2195
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
the thing about the people

2196
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
okay

2197
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
they do call the people

2198
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
carbons but they don't really explain what that means

2199
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I think it's only in like

2200
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
director commentary and like people asking

2201
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
the game devs like on twitter

2202
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
like what's up with the carbons

2203
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I think that's the only place

2204
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
that they really explain that like

2205
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
oh yeah carbons can just fucking pull

2206
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
their body parts off and replace their entire bodies

2207
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
with robot parts if they feel like it

2208
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
lol and it's like oh okay

2209
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
and then once you know that

2210
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
you can kind of look back and see like oh yeah

2211
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
some of them do seem to have like

2212
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
robot bodies for no reason

2213
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
and I guess that explains it

2214
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
uh

2215
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
but it's like I don't think they ever

2216
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
maybe in two they make it more explicit

2217
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
but in one there's like literally no hint

2218
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
at all that that's the case

2219
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
it seems it's very strange

2220
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
uh yeah

2221
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
like

2222
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
carbony games

2223
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
huh

2224
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
what

2225
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
should we end the episode

2226
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
uh

2227
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
that was the last

2228
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
his voicemail is done

2229
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
yep

2230
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
oh yeah that's basically you were just saying

2231
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I just started to ramble about

2232
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Mega Man again

2233
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
um I will

2234
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
just say

2235
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
that if you're still waiting on a lord of ghosts

2236
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
or commission I'm very sorry

2237
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I will keep working at it

2238
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
no

2239
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
and hopefully it will be done soon

2240
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
enough and then I can get on to

2241
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
making cool shit in like September

2242
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
if you are still

2243
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000

problems for a shame yes

2254
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000

2255
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
no no please give me money

2256
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
in the future I promise I won't feel

2257
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
bad afterwards

2258
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
oh you know what I have one other thing

2259
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I bought um I bought several

2260
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
different kinds of green rock

2261
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
for um

2262
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
for for the you know

2263
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I had that idea that maybe

2264
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I could give give podrans

2265
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
as a part of the kickstarter

2266
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
you know what really quickly let me

2267
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I got a bunch that look like shit

2268
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
uh and then I got three

2269
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
that look kinda good

2270
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
so here let me

2271
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
really quickly just show you

2272
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
the good ones

2273
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
let me ask your opinion

2274
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
about these

2275
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
oh these actually

2276
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
kind of look a little more green in my

2277
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
camera than they do in

2278
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
in real life but

2279
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
we'll just have to deal with that

2280
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
when I was a kid I really liked

2281
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
rocks and minerals and stuff

2282
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
and you know what

2283
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
they're still kinda neat

2284
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
yeah actually

2285
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I mean it's like

2286
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
the earth but like

2287
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
the best parts of the earth

2288
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
oh you I just I looked

2289
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
at my camera roll

2290
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
and I just saw a bunch of

2291
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
of funny pictures

2292
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
that I took of myself in the mirror

2293
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
wherein I moved wherein I

2294
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
combed my hair in the least flattering

2295
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
way possible

2296
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I made it look as bad as I could make it

2297
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
and I took pictures of it like because it was funny

2298
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
and it kind of is funny but

2299
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I just saw it again and I'm like oh no

2300
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
that's

2301
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
that's the reality

2302
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I can't see the light of day

2303
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
I would never I'm not gonna

2304
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
honestly I mean honestly I made it look

2305
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
that it's almost like this is like a comedy

2306
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
character if I could do

2307
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
I could do this is like a bit this could this

2308
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
would be my like

2309
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
my worst guy ever would have his hair

2310
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
like this and let's look ridiculous

2311
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
does it look like Neil Hamburger

2312
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
let me

2313
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
see what he looks like

2314
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Neil

2315
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
it's like a

2316
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Greg Tarkington

2317
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
comedy character

2318
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I mean not quite but

2319
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I mean that's sort of

2320
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
that sort of thing yeah

2321
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
like bizarre comb over the forehead

2322
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
wow

2323
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
yeah

2324
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
these

2325
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
these podrans look

2326
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
like powdered like they look like

2327
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Turkish delight I feel like I could bite into them

2328
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
yeah and they'd be jelly

2329
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I also have the

2330
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
urge to do that

2331
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
you know what I could do

2332
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
this would this would be really stupid but you know

2333
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
what I could do is I could make what if I made

2334
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
like an epoxy mold

2335
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
of these like rocks and then I made

2336
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
like gummies in the shape

2337
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
of these rocks

2338
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I mean they would just sort of be

2339
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
like a weird

2340
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
polygon

2341
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
you wouldn't really know that they were made

2342
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
from real rocks

2343
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
but maybe I mean they might have

2344
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
the they might have some of the texture on them

2345
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
yeah

2346
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I don't know but but anyway

2347
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
yeah these are the one on the left is

2348
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
fluorite the one on the right

2349
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
is

2350
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I think it might

2351
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
also be fluorite I think

2352
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
it's quartz

2353
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
the one on the top is calcite

2354
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I want to eat that

2355
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
fluorite so bad

2356
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I'm not sure which one I like

2357
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
the best like the fluorite is kind of

2358
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
bluish and the

2359
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
calcite is kind of pale yellowish

2360
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
green and then the quartz

2361
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
is kind of just kind of medium

2362
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I guess

2363
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
wait what is what kind

2364
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
of quartz what kind of quartz is

2365
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
this

2366
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
don't you got any emeralds

2367
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I don't know it's just called

2368
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
green quartz I guess

2369
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
emeralds are expensive

2370
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
you know you can buy peridots

2371
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
you can buy like rough raw peridots

2372
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
but they're really you can only get them really small

2373
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
like the size of a pea

2374
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
like that's not good enough

2375
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
so

2376
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
no that's just that's just not

2377
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
that's just not going to do it

2378
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
these all

2379
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
these all cost

2380
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
the calcite is a little more expensive

2381
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
for like ten dollars I got like

2382
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
five of these little pieces

2383
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
of calcite for the same price

2384
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I got about like twice as many

2385
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
of the other two

2386
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
but I mean it's still not just not that expensive

2387
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
so like whatever

2388
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I don't know

2389
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
viewers tell me which rock you think

2390
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
looks the best

2391
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
which would you most like to receive

2392
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
in a

2393
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
package I guess

2394
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
based on this image I want

2395
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
the floor I think it's like very good floor

2396
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
you like the floor

2397
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
hmm because it's more

2398
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
turquoisey it's got the turquoisey

2399
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
it's got the white streaks like the pony

2400
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
hmm yeah that's true

2401
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
yeah it's just kind of got like

2402
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
it's just kind of a rough

2403
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
a rough surface that sort of

2404
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
has like more like

2405
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
kind of cleavage

2406
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
so to speak

2407
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
in it and that sort of gives it like a white

2408
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
kind of

2409
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
more reflected surface

2410
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
because like makes it a little more

2411
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
like opaque like instead of letting the light

2412
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
go through it

2413
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
all the way to just let the green shine through

2414
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
yeah

2415
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
anyway these foam almost

2416
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
yeah anyway these are my rocks

2417
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
these are my rocks

2418
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I hope you enjoyed

2419
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
there are many like it but these ones are mine

2420
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
true true

2421
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
I almost want to just buy more

2422
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
just like

2423
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I already have all the like

2424
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
kinds of rock samples that I wanted but I'm tempted

2425
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
just like what if I just went back to Amazon

2426
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
and just ordered the same things

2427
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
again but just from different companies

2428
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
just to have more

2429
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
and to just see like maybe these

2430
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
maybe these ones have nicer fluorite

2431
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
maybe these ones give me bigger quartz

2432
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
hmm

2433
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
and I like them

2434
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
uh

2435
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
maybe I'll do that

2436
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I mean I'll need more than this

2437
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
if I do the Kickstarter

2438
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
and I am doing the Kickstarter that's not in question

2439
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
so I mean I'll have to buy it anyway

2440
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
yeah hell yeah I'm doing it

2441
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I'm splurging

2442
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
oh my god more rocks please

2443
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
careful not to eat them

2444
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
you'll become the thing

2445
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I do they are tempting

2446
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I do get tempted to put them in my mouth

2447
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
and bite them and then I'm like

2448
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
that would hurt my teeth

2449
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
you could do you could do

2450
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
you could break a tooth through in that even as a joke

2451
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
so I shouldn't even consider it

2452
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
uh

2453
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
anyway that's all

2454
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
that's all I got

2455
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
all right

2456
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
that's the show

2457
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
probably that's the end

2458
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
wait a minute wait a minute

2459
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
let's go in front of the three hours

2460
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I had an idea I did have an idea

2461
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I think it wouldn't work

2462
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I had the idea that what if

2463
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
okay the same like fluorescent powder

2464
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
that I put in the slime to make it glow under UV light

2465
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
I was thinking like

2466
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
is there some way I could apply it to these

2467
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
and I thought what if I like sort of

2468
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
made a solution of that fluoride

2469
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
fluorescent powder and like dipped these rocks in it

2470
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
and then

2471
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
would that like make them glow

2472
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
and I think the answer is no

2473
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I think all that would happen is

2474
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
maybe they might have a faint glow

2475
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
but it would only be on the surface

2476
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
it wouldn't have the sort of like deep

2477
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
inner glow that the slime

2478
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
has because it is suffused with the material

2479
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
these would only have a little bit

2480
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
of glowiness on their surface

2481
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
and also I think because the stuff

2482
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
would only be in a suspension in water

2483
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
it would not like truly soluble

2484
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I think it would just sort of dry out

2485
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
and become sort of a little bit of powder

2486
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
that would get on the surface

2487
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
and it would just come off on your hands

2488
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
and just be shit

2489
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
so that probably wouldn't work

2490
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I don't know how helpful this will be

2491
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
or whether it would be even

2492
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
slightly viable for you

2493
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
but I remember this video from Nile Red

2494
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
who figured out how to make

2495
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
his own glow in the dark

2496
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
plastic these

2497
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
well glow in

2498
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
oh I mean actually

2499
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
if it's a rock

2500
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
it doesn't have to be edible

2501
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
because the slime needed an edible fluorescent ingredient

2502
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
and you can get fluorescent stuff that's edible

2503
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
but there's not really glow in the dark

2504
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
stuff that's edible

2505
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
so maybe

2506
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
there's some

2507
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
topical thing I could apply

2508
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
that could make these rocks genuinely glow

2509
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
in the dark that would be pretty neat

2510
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I will watch this video later

2511
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
it's a chunky video

2512
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
but he goes through

2513
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
every step of the chemistry

2514
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
actually might be a little too over the top

2515
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
for what you're doing

2516
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
but it certainly is interesting

2517
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
well he's making

2518
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
it seems like he's making

2519
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
a substrate

2520
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
he's making the plastic itself

2521
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I'm wondering if I can

2522
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
apply a glowing surface

2523
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
to something

2524
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
which might be a little different

2525
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
but I mean this is still interesting

2526
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I'll probably watch this anyway

2527
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
sweet

2528
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
yeah

2529
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
that's probably the actual end of the video

2530
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
goodbye everybody

2531
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
that's the end of the episode become a patron

2532
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
become a patron

2533
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000

2534
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
and

2535
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
get the bonus episodes

2536

access

2539
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
we will play minecraft again as soon as my internet

2540
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
is

2541
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
in working order

2542
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
yeah

2543
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
