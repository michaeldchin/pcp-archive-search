1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm going to bless that guy. That son of a bi-

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That son of a-

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That son of a-

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That son of a-

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That son of a bi-

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I gotta say, my new microphone does make me feel a little bit cool.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It wasn't really even that expensive.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Should have upgraded a long time ago.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But better late than never.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Microboy.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's what my sexual partners call me.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Anyway, welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's as good a place to start as any LA's are keep it all in.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The program podcast.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's Ben St. who's giving to you.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, here's my bit for the day.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, ready?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you ready for my bit?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Row, row, row v-way, gently down the drain.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Life is pain.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, yeah.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Pretty good.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's pretty good.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think I've improved the mood.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I did it.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I...

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Damn it.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I had forgotten about...

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I had woken up this morning and I hadn't thought about that.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I had forgotten about it until you just reminded me.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It is one of those things where it's like everyone was so upset, understandably,

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and there was the only thing I could see on Twitter.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I was everybody talking about it.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think everybody wanted to not have that be the timeline anymore,

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so they decided, okay, I'm just going to talk about other things now

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and then Twitter is completely different the day after.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I was like, wait, I don't want to forget about this.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I would like to not worry about it,

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but I don't want this to fall into the background.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It did not fall into the background for me at all.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know, I had a realization about who I follow on Twitter.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm pretty sure that like a lot of the people that I follow

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
are people who have podcasts that I don't listen to,

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but they were like friends with the chapeau guys.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I feel like a large percentage of people that I follow

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
are people who are on Twitter who have podcasts,

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
like who were on chapeau, who are friends with chapeau,

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and that's how I know them, even though I don't listen to their podcasts.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because I don't know where a lot of these people come from.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just like their takes.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So anyway, all that is to say,

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
no, I never stopped seeing it on Twitter.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In fact, you know what I did?

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I did something unprecedented yesterday.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I downloaded an app and I blocked Twitter for myself.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, good.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That is a good thing to do.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Not specifically because of Roe v. Wade, although that doesn't help.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I just don't think I use it in a healthy way.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't use it in a productive way.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Even though I feel like I see other people use it the way that I use it

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and nothing bad happens to them.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, I mean, you don't know that.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I guess I don't know that.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I guess that's true.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I was looking into the Supreme Court

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and I didn't learn too much.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I didn't do a big research.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I see all these pictures of guillotines

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and I'm like, cool, nice.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We're all on the same page that this isn't good.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Change the Supreme Court would be the thing.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And I'm like, okay, well, how would we do that?

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And they are on there for life, apparently.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They retire, but there's no thing to force them to retire.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They can retire, yeah.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So they would have to decide to do it and...

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, the other thing would be to pack the court,

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is to expand the court and make new positions

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and then appoint new people.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Right, I heard about that.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Joe Biden didn't even give a shit to try that.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He was just sitting there.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't know what he does.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, they don't want to rock the boat.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, we don't want to upset the fascist.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We don't want to upset anyone.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So it's like, I don't know.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why don't we just lock them in a hole in the ground?

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Called a grave.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe you've heard...

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't remember who I saw say this,

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but this is a sentiment I've seen expressed by a lot of people,

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but the most succinct way, the most punchiest way I've seen it,

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
was people hear that the Supreme Court Justice appointment is for life,

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and most people hear that and think that it's a long appointment,

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but I hear that and I think, hmm, but it could be a short appointment.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought that's pretty good.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What was the old lady who died recently?

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, how old was she?

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I remember hearing things like she was like...

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't remember exactly...

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Almost 90, I think.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And she had cancer.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
People were saying she was so old she had to retire,

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
but she stayed on for some reason or another.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, she had cancer a few times.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
She was very old and she had a history of cancer.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't know exactly what killed her, but...

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Was it COVID?

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because I know she went and she was at that wedding.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
One of the last things she ever did was she officiated some people's wedding,

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and then she died.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Just like Andrew Hussie.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did that happen?

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He died?

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, not that part.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, he didn't attend a wedding, but he did die.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I need to know more about the Supreme Court.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I haven't really wanted to...

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The vague things I've seen are like,

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
wow, this sucks.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Either you stack the court in order to make it more...

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so that you can push your agenda, whoever's in power.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And it's like, well, surely that means the other side could do it again,

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which is obviously what Trump was able to do by stacking the court.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's not what he did.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like, primarily Republican Christian idiot people.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He didn't expand the court.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It simply worked out that he had to make three appointments.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, okay, there's actually a little more to it,

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
because it's not like Trump had to make those appointments fairly,

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
because Obama had appointments that he could have made,

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and the Republicans in the Senate,

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
they didn't refuse his picks.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They simply refused to convene to decide whether to appoint his appointments.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
See, like, this is stupid.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So it's not like it was fair, yeah.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Obama should have made one of those appointments.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
From the ground up, the idea that this, hypothetically,

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the Supreme Court is a bunch of people who are very, very smart,

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and they make the unbiased opinions when partisan people in the Congress

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
make a bad idea, and the Supreme Court, who are so above all that,

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
who are not partisan at all, will sort it out and make it good.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But they don't, because they're humans, and that's a stupid idea,

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and I don't know why the system even exists to this day.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It seems very archaic, and obviously will be a real problem for democracy forever.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's some sort of fantasy to believe that these people,

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
oh, they will simply look to constitutional precedent.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They'll simply look at the Constitution itself,

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and in interpreting what one document or precedent document has said before,

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
they will thereby arrive at the most, I don't know, the most constitutional thing to be done.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The Constitution...

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's stupid, it's outdated, it's just paper making new country.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Sure, but even if we accepted that the Constitution is good,

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it's not like there's any objective truth to be arrived at about what it meant.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Maybe sometimes there is, but it's not like you can actually go

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and just read into it exactly what was meant in every situation,

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and dig all you need are the seven of the most unbiased people in the world,

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and you will get the most constitutional government.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It doesn't make any sense.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's vague, and it doesn't know the future, so certain future things have to be interpreted

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
based on text from the past, so it's impossible to know the rules going forward for everything,

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and it's just a bad idea, which is why it's still there,

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
because it can be easily manipulated to do whatever you want,

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and that's great, they love that.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Fuck in, did you read Clarence Thomas saying,

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
yeah, well, we got this, we got rid of abortion.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We should literally look at interracial marriage,

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
we should look at interracial marriage next, and gay marriage, and contraception.

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We should reconsider whether those should be protected.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There's no secret about it, they're just saying,

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
alright, so civil rights, we never liked those,

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and now that it's been proven that we can just get rid of them,

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we should think about getting rid of all of them,

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and there's nothing that anybody can do about it except, I don't know, nothing.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There was that one senator saying, we should look at Brown v. Board of Education,

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
we should consider segregating our schools again.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They're just doing it, man, they're just going for it.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And the Democrats are all saying, vote, vote, on what, how?

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What are we supposed to vote for? You're already the president.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They said this was on the ballot, and then, well, we elected Joe Biden,

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and I think we expanded, I think we expanded, we got more seats in,

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
we got more seats in Congress, Democrats got more seats in Congress,

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and they didn't, you know, they did not codify Roe,

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
so, well, you didn't do it, and now they got rid of it.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So how is it on the ballot? How is this on the ballot anymore?

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, I don't even know, like, from their perspective,

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
like, all I can assume is that they like abortion being gone,

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
some of them, maybe Joe, I know Joe has been like anti-abortion in the past,

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
but like, you know, like, what do they feel like a game plan is going forward with this knowledge?

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Like, all I see is them saying, remember to vote for us because we wouldn't do that,

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
even though you let it happen, and you're not doing anything against it,

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
so it's almost like, I don't know, there's an evil villain,

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and there's like, I'm evil, I'm doing evil things, and then a little, like, frog is there,

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and he's saying, I'll stop him, but it's a frog, and the evil villain has like giant boots and a gun,

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and like, he can squash the frog, and the frog's not going to do anything anyway,

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
he's going to rib it in the pond, and that's it.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Like, why would I vote for this? Why would I give money to this?

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're not going to do anything.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's true, it is true, so that, I don't know, vanilla opinions on Twitter said,

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and they're right, like, on the one hand, it is true that like, had a, what was it,

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
like, if we had more Democrats in Congress, or if Bernie Sanders had won the nomination in 2016,

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
or if Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump in the general election, then it's true

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that Roe v. Wade would still be on the books.

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Like, any of those things would have done it.

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sure.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So, it's not like voting doesn't do anything, but on the other hand,

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What is voting going to do right now?

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What is voting going to do right now?

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think more than anything, like, very, very, like, notable protests are the bare minimum,

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because if people in power, if the Supreme Court don't feel like this decision has impacted

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
America in a negative way, or at least their own, like, situation in a negative way,

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
if they don't feel scared about it, nothing will go right.

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They need to know, somebody needs to know, somebody needs to know that this is not good,

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and the American people don't like it.

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So, protest is like the bare minimum.

229
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, I'm sure they do know that.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm sure they do, but like, you know, you can't rely on the morals of the people in power,

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
but you can rely on their fear of, like, people running into their house

232
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and burning it down and killing them.

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah.

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That doesn't seem to be happening, though.

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's what I've been waiting for, is knowledge and stuff like that coming on the news.

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hasn't happened.

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Sad.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, what are you going to do about it?

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know.

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm just going to...

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
These extreme...

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I've seen some people calling it, like, backwards, like, oh, these justices are so backwards,

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
like, oh, this is such a backwards decision.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's not...

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't agree with that description.

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's extremist is what it is.

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So, these extremist judges are just going to keep...

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, they've got a 6-3 majority, so they're going to do more stuff just like this.

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And then they're going to...

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And then Congress is going to vote to give them more police protection,

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
as they continue to take rights away,

255
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and then people are angry and they want to do something about it in Minecraft.

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And then Congress is going to give them more protection to prevent that,

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and the cycle will just continue.

258
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I don't know what's there to be done about it.

259
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah.

260
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Our lawyers have said we cannot continue the podcasts from this point.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We must move topic.

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, that's right.

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's true.

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There's nothing else to it that you can infer the rest.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Moving on.

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
God, it's so fucked.

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's really fucked.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's really fucked.

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's hard to even talk about.

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm glad I'm over here that he's in there.

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Over here in the UK where...

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Everything's good.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Everything's good and there's no, like, idiot in charge.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean, the only thing I'm hearing about Boris Johnson lately is that

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
he had that party during COVID that has been, like, the monster beach.

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He had a party during lockdown.

278
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like a Super Spreader event?

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Like, no, no.

280
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It was like during COVID lockdown, like you said, everyone stay inside.

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, like a big masked ball inside of a castle while the commoners were outside?

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, essentially.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He had, like, a party with alcohol and no masks and no vaccine didn't exist at the time.

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And he was just like, haha, people have to do what I say, but I don't.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't have to follow the rules.

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And he was like, that has come to light and it's, like, been proven.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And it's like, aha, we got you.

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's all.

289
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Is that what they were doing?

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The vote of no confidence in Boris over?

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I thought it was a big, like, referendum on Boris.

292
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There's been a vote of, I don't know if there's a vote of no confidence specifically,

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but like a bunch of people in the conservative party have left in embarrassment

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
or to save their own careers to not be associated with Boris.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Boris is just sitting there and saying, I'm not going to apologize.

296
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm just going to stay here.

297
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And that's that.

298
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Cool.

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And there's been by-elections in the areas where members of parliament have left.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The conservatives have left being in charge.

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And so there was a little election and there was a Labour win and a Lib Dem win.

302
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And so there are less conservative MPs than there were before.

303
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And Boris is just sitting there saying, I don't, I'm not going to change.

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm just, this is how I am and I'm going to the future.

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Ukraine, we've got to give money to Ukraine.

306
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Good for him sticking to his guns.

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Good for him sticking to his guns.

308
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, I love him.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know what?

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll kiss him on the mouth, but I hate him.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
When the woke mob comes to cancel you for no reason like that,

312
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
you just got to stand your ground.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't apologize to these people because it's never enough.

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So that's never, never, never enough.

315
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's all I'm hearing about at the moment with regards to the leading of the UK.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's just, if Spar is going to resign, no, Bob, but, but, but please resign.

317
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, I won't.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Come on.

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Come on.

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Come on.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No, be reasonable, please.

322
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's just, it's just so like whatever.

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Nobody, he doesn't care.

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And he doesn't need to leave.

325
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You could do so much better.

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So he's not going to.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I think we should get together now.

328
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And that's what everyone's talking about.

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

330
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like the prime minister.

331
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Sorry.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No more.

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No more.

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So like Boris is like shit and he's Trump adjacent and he's a, he's a money grubbing,

337
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
power hungry idiot who doesn't know anything.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Huh?

339
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Is this his second term?

340
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He, we don't have terms in the same way.

341
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Right.

342
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So they're not like, it's not a set amount of years.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But I guess, yeah, it's his first like being in office.

344
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I think he did.

345
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There was a, some sort of a referendum at some point.

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And he got more members of parliament, like conservative, one more.

347
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Cause Theresa May was embarrassing.

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But because of the, this, the, the smear campaign against Jeremy Corbyn,

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Boris Johnson gained more power.

350
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And it was dreadful.

351
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It was awful.

352
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So like the UK sucks politically, but at least, at least we're not getting rid of.

353
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
At least abortion is legal there, right?

354
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

355
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

356
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We're not getting rid of like.

357
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's dire.

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's so fucking dire.

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Civil liberties have been enshrined and like everyone in, in most of the world agrees

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
are a good thing unless they're like a fundamentalist, extremist, religious, zealot idiot.

361
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah.

364
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What did, what did, um, I just keep, I just keep thinking about Contra points tweet about

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that, that woman that screamed when, when Trump got elected.

366
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
She was right.

367
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
She was exactly right.

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
She was 100% right.

369
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And we all look stupid for making fun of her.

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She had a completely proportionate reaction to what would, to what would come of that.

371
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
She knew much better than we did.

372
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's incredible.

373
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

374
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Um, anyway.

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, I'm going to go move to Saudi Arabia.

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
See, uh, they got better, they got a better healthcare over there.

378
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
A civilized country.

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I just have to pretend I'm not trans.

380
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Uh, Saudi Arabia.

381
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'll be safe.

382
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Wait, that's the really bad one, right?

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's the extremely bad one.

384
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes.

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's the really, that's the one that Trump's like friends with.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's weird.

387
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This is going to sound stupid.

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's, it's weird to me that Trump seems like he's like, like he's like taking credit for

389
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
this win.

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I remember, you know, he, like during the campaign drill, he was saying like, uh,

391
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
will, will, he said he would do exactly this.

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll put judges, conservative judges on the bench and they'll rescind Roe v. Wade.

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And that's what he did.

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,300
And it's kind of weird to me that like he cares about that because he doesn't seem, he's

395
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,000
not a religious guy.

396
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He doesn't seem like a guy who would really give it.

397
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know.

398
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Just like that's what his base wants.

399
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So that's what he's going to promise.

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I would imagine it's what his base wants.

401
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

402
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
More so than like, cause he's a power.

403
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Cause he's a pro vaccine.

404
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He's like, like he's like in favor of the vaccines.

405
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And he's like, he views the vaccines as like being like a big thing that he got done under

406
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
his presidency and he's proud of it.

407
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And like a lot of his base really, that makes them really mad.

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah.

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Trump is not extreme enough for them.

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
As it turns out.

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He's the QAnon king.

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah.

414
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He's more of a human being than they want.

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And they are looking for more like free.

416
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What's the, what's her face?

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Marjorie Taylor Greene.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah.

419
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Like she, she's the, the sort of person QAnon and, and that type of, of, of conservative

420
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
once in a Republican once in a, in the old power.

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah.

422
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah.

423
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Well.

424
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Uh, that's, yeah.

425
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He, he's got, yeah.

426
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Trump has his, has his regrettable human foibles, like, uh, thinking vaccines work and so forth.

427
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Uh, you know, forgive, forgivable eccentricities.

428
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I mean, he did deny them for a time.

429
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Cause, you know.

430
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, yeah.

431
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then, and then I don't know when, I do remember he said, but you really should get

432
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the vaccines and then his whole crowd booed him.

433
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, he didn't, he didn't say, he didn't say like vaccines bad.

434
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He bunk, he did bungle the COVID response, but he didn't say like,

435
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can't remember exactly what he did.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't get back.

437
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm sure it was a Trumpism.

438
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm sure it was really stupid.

439
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
He just, he basically just said like, uh, you know what, don't worry about the virus.

440
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Uh, we're going to try to like, we're just going to ignore it and hopefully, and not

441
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
let it hurt the economy.

442
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And, uh, and that's, and that's our strategy.

443
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, that's probably it.

444
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Get back to work.

445
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm going to wear masks.

446
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He, they, they, they, they like didn't do anything about it.

447
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Like when, when it was becoming clear that it was going to be like a serious deal, he

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
like really downplayed it and was like, we're going to, uh, what do they call it?

449
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There was this particular, was it like the no fear strategy or like the no panic strategy

450
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
or something like that, which is basically just pretend it's not a problem, uh, for

451
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
as long as possible.

452
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And it was great.

453
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You know, uh, she, man, she, it's, it's pretty, it's, I don't know.

454
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's all, it's all pretty disheartening this week.

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah.

456
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It was a rough week.

457
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's, it's been a rough week.

458
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And it was, for me, I was dealing with a bit of depression.

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, you too.

460
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Before the news.

461
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Me too.

462
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Great.

463
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's not just me.

464
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
All right.

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Cool.

466
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No.

467
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah.

468
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I, I got a therapist or like a, on better help.

469
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't know if that's good.

470
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I was just sort of like, I don't fucking give a shit to like research anything.

471
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm just going to type in a therapist on Google and get something because I just, I just

472
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
need something.

473
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Um, and I got this lady and I'm talking to her a few sessions now and I was talking

474
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
about her, I was talking about being depressed and she said to fight depression.

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't know how smart this is or not.

476
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Uh, but to fight depression, you need to get out of your own head.

477
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Sitting there stewing in your own brain is the worst thing you can do.

478
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It can lead to suicide.

479
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
When you're depressed, you need to distract yourself.

480
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You need to get into someone else's head.

481
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So like talk to someone.

482
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Failing that, uh, distracting yourself with video games and TV is, is adequate.

483
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And I'm like, Oh, well, you know, when I'm depressed, I feel more depressed and guilty

484
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
when I go binge like a show or just play a games over and over again and feel like,

485
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh God, this sucks.

486
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But I do realize that in the moment when I'm watching something really good, like, uh,

487
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah.

489
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I do not feel depressed during those times.

490
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And so if that's, that's, if that's adequate to like distract myself, I've always felt

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
like distracting yourself from your problems is a negative thing and you shouldn't do that.

492
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Damn.

493
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
If that's adequate, then call me the king of adequacy.

494
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

495
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Cause it's just, I don't know.

496
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You get these, these impressions of how you're supposed to do things based on life

497
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
experience.

498
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And then a therapist tells you, no, it's okay if you want to binge watch stuff.

499
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

500
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just try not to like focus on your negative thoughts because you're going to go in a

501
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
spiral.

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I do.

503
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So, uh, everybody distract yourself.

504
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Uh, do, do anything.

505
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Do anything but think about the current state of the world.

506
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

507
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Uh, I've been, um, I've been playing, I've been playing Mega Man.

508
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sometimes I do it on stream.

509
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I've been, I've streamed again on my Twitch for like the first time in forever.

510
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Uh, yeah, which is kind of neat.

511
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Uh, feels, feels, makes me feel a little bit bad because well, yeah, distract, you know,

512
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
playing video games doesn't accomplish anything and it makes me feel a little bit bad.

513
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I feel a little guilty that I'm like, what am I, what am I accomplishing here?

514
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Um, I feel when I, when I stream on Twitch, it's like, it's good, but also I feel bad

515
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
because I let, I let that language for two years.

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I've been in the stream for two years and I feel like I lost all the momentum that I

517
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
had with streaming that I once had.

518
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And that really bums me out.

519
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Um, I mean, I guess that's, that's it.

520
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The, the, the guilt of, of things, I mean, I, this is not something the therapist told

521
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
me, but it's like, um, something I picked up is like, uh, when you're worried about

522
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
doing a lot of work, being productive and then you're depressed and you don't feel

523
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
like you can do the work.

524
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Um, and you say, or you're told you need a break, you need to give yourself a break.

525
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And then during that break, quote unquote, you keep thinking about how all the time

526
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
that you could be spending doing the work, uh, you're physically not working, but you

527
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
are not on a break while you're thinking about it.

528
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You're still mentally taxing yourself with the, the, the stuff that you should be doing.

529
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
An actual break is like to not think about it, to, to completely indulge in anything

530
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
else, to get your mind off it for real and not for a little bit, you know, for an actual

531
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
break length, which is why I've noticed when I, when I take a break, um, in a stupid way

532
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and I'm like playing a game or doing a thing and I'm like, okay, this is just one day of

533
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
this.

534
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then I can back, back to work, back to work as fast as soon as possible because,

535
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
oh shit, all this time, uh, I hope, I sure hope this break doesn't take too long.

536
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Like that sort of, that sort of mindset is like stressing yourself out and you haven't

537
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
actually started the break.

538
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Your break time is zero.

539
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And then you get back to work and it's like, oh, what the fuck?

540
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I thought I had a break.

541
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Why am I breaking, what am I breaking down immediately again?

542
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's just, it's all so fucking difficult.

543
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You just got to actually fuck off.

544
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Uh, I, on the, on the upside, on the upside, I am, um, I am nearly done with those fucking

545
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
book footnotes that I've been kind of working on here and there and like putting off and

546
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
putting, I've been putting them off a lot.

547
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't know why I've been putting them off so much.

548
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I should have gotten them done a long time ago.

549
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I was like halfway done with them like three weeks ago.

550
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And now I'm, I might, I'm genuinely, genuinely going to try and finish them like today after

551
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
this podcast because it's, I only have a little bit more to go.

552
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They're like 20, it's like 21 pages.

553
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It'll probably be like 22 by the time it's done, which is, I mean, that's kind of a

554
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
lot, but it's not that much.

555
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The average is out to, I wrote like less than a page a day, which is not.

556
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No, there you are doing like the spectacular.

557
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You're thinking about all the productivity stuff.

558
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

559
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It makes it harder to like get back into the swing of things if you're always like

560
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
shitting on yourself of things that have already happened.

561
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah, I know.

562
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, I guess so.

563
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It just feels like, it just feels like I haven't learned anything.

564
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It feels like I should be, it feels like I should have figured out how to, how to get

565
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
my shit taken care of sooner than this.

566
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I mean, when you're depressed, it's just not easy to do anything.

567
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

568
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's not like you can logic your way out of depression because it's not a logical state

569
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
of mind.

570
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Like the, it's like a, what is the worst thing that I could possibly be thinking about myself

571
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
right now?

572
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh, that, please think that over and over again.

573
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's not, it's not logical.

574
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's silly.

575
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's chemical imbalance.

576
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's dumb.

577
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Maya.

578
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Are you dumb then, Saint?

579
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You know, that's a great, that's a great, let's explore that question for a while.

580
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I think, I don't know, I've been, I feel like I'm pretty stupid lately.

581
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

582
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I feel pretty, pretty dumb.

583
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I think I have, you know, that secret project.

584
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I think I've definitely fallen into a spiral of like infinitely preparing for it.

585
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Like, like I was, I was ready to do it a couple of weeks ago and then it got delayed and I'm

586
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
like, okay, well this means that I can be even more prepared for it.

587
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
This means that I, and I think I have, I think I have fallen into a cycle of, you know.

588
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
A cycle of playing Mega Man and not even doing that.

589
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

590
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
A little bit partially, yeah.

591
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I, you know, this is, this is not really related to that exactly.

592
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I mean, that's, that's just, that's one thing that I'm like, I should, I should have done

593
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that by now.

594
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
There's many things that I feel like I should have just done some things.

595
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Why didn't I just do them?

596
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I feel.

597
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Because you weren't, you weren't mentally all there.

598
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What's the term that isn't rude?

599
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You weren't mentally like, I don't know, geared up to do that work, which is why you didn't

600
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
do it.

601
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I guess so.

602
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I mean, that's just, that's just how depression be.

603
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't, I don't know.

604
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I just, I think.

605
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Like hypothetically, if, if, if we didn't have these, these problems, obviously we'd do more

606
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
work, because we wouldn't, we wouldn't be stopping to second guess every decision we make all

607
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
the time.

608
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But that's not like, that's not reality.

609
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Sometimes it is just, it's a blockage.

610
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think, I don't know.

611
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I think I don't know enough to like give advice on that.

612
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But I feel like, like the mindset of, oh, I should have done and why haven't I done is

613
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:54,000
like, it's, it's doesn't like, it doesn't like constructively get you closer to being able

614
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
to do what you think you can, or have done in the past.

615
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Like, like I drew, what, like the whole of Lord of ghosts and almost the whole act one,

616
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
two Lord of ghosts and Clarissa in one year, within like a, in a few months stretch each.

617
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm like, surely if I can do it that quickly, I should have finished all of those two years

618
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
later and have like a whole other thing going.

619
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But I'm still like not doing that.

620
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm still like fucking around.

621
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But if I think about that too much, it just becomes more difficult to actually get back

622
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to that level of, of productivity that I was.

623
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So it's not helpful, I guess, to think that way.

624
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I feel, I feel like, I don't know.

625
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's not, what worries me is like, it's not just that I'm not productive.

626
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Like I've gone through like productive and unproductive spells and like, you know, whatever.

627
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The fact that I didn't get the footnotes written until now and it's like too long,

628
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
like that's not great, but, but whatever.

629
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's gonna, it's gonna get done.

630
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It bugs me out that like, I feel like I don't know, I feel like I don't have like anything to,

631
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I feel like I don't like want anything.

632
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Like I don't feel a strong drive to like, oh, when that's done, like I can't, I can finally get,

633
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
get to work on, on something else.

634
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know, I don't know, I don't even know like what I want to do after that's done anymore.

635
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I had other things that I, that I wanted to work on.

636
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And now I'm, I'm just like, I don't know.

637
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I was gonna get back to like old projects, but like none of them ever took off and are they even worth doing anymore?

638
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And if not them, then like, what else even is there to do?

639
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't know, I'm kind of feeling like I've wasted my life lately.

640
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Kind of, kind of feel like maybe I should have done something else.

641
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I mean, what do you want to do?

642
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't know, nothing, nothing, no, I can't.

643
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't know, I don't know, I hate everything.

644
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I hate everything.

645
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I have no, I have no passion for anything.

646
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I hate, I hate drawing.

647
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I hate art.

648
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I hate, I hate the, I kind of feel like I wish that I like had like written more.

649
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Like maybe I like actually like wrote stuff like wrote essays.

650
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I feel like maybe I used to be kind of okay at that, but I haven't done it in so long.

651
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And like, I feel like I kind of deliberately avoided doing that.

652
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Like I deliberately avoided like doing any sort of activity that would like carefully structure my thoughts on things.

653
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And now I have like, and now my mind is completely disordered.

654
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And like, all I have are like vague feelings, like things that make me angry.

655
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But no like clear thoughts about anything.

656
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And no desires or passions.

657
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Do you feel compelled to like finish projects for no other reason than just a vague compulsion?

658
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because you do that and that's what people expect of you?

659
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Sort of a little bit.

660
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I mean, I feel like all the things that I started in the past,

661
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean, there were reasons I wanted to finish them.

662
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's not like it's completely irrational.

663
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But I mean, I do feel like I want to do that.

664
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I do feel a sense of obligation to go back and finish old things.

665
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
A lot of them have built up and some of them I probably might never get to.

666
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But some of them I feel like if I were more effective, I would finish them.

667
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Some things I don't know even what I would do.

668
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I feel like I don't even know what the champion would be if I went back to it and started working on it again.

669
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't know what I would do with it anymore.

670
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You have obligation based on past precedent, but you don't have motivation to do any of it.

671
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Something like that.

672
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You feel like if you were a better worker, if you were someone else, then it would be good that they get done.

673
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah.

674
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Hypothetical question.

675
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You're a Benz saint and you don't do any of those things.

676
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
How do you feel?

677
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You decide not to do them ever and that actually is the case.

678
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You don't ever go back to any of these things and you just live your life and that's the end.

679
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
How do you feel about that?

680
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Like I decide, okay, I'll never do any more of the champion.

681
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'll never finish Biscopades.

682
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll never finish my Winnie the Pooh retrospective.

683
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll never make another Nuzlocke and I never kickstart the Slime and Punishment book.

684
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
All that.

685
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
All things you don't have motivation to do, which is everything.

686
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, I guess I would feel like I wasted years and years of my life.

687
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, would it be wasted if you didn't finish them?

688
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What about the things you did do?

689
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah, sure.

690
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, I guess I would just feel like there was lost potential there.

691
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think that I had started things and not finished them when they would be better if they had been completed

692
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
or seen through to a more logical conclusion.

693
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Would you feel good if they were better?

694
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Like if they were done?

695
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

696
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah, if that list of things that I just rattled off, if it was shorter, yeah, I think I would feel better.

697
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Because if maybe there were just one or two things on the list, I would feel like, oh, I can just get to that.

698
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I can just do it.

699
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So if all of those things either abandoned or finished, what would Ben Saint be doing?

700
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh, that's a great question.

701
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know.

702
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I feel like, well, I guess I could maybe start a new comic project, but I don't know what it would be.

703
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I have no ideas.

704
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I could maybe start, I could try doing more writing essays, but I don't know what I would write them about.

705
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't care enough about anything to write about it or think about anything.

706
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So you're thinking of stuff you've already done doing more of that?

707
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I could just quit doing the internet stuff and go get a job, but I don't know what I would want to do.

708
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I've thought about that and even that.

709
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm like, yeah, but what would be the point?

710
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What about that would even give me joy?

711
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What would you do with money?

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't know.

713
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't know what I would do with money.

714
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I already can afford to live and what else do I need?

715
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I don't know.

716
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That's it.

717
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah.

718
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm just struggling.

719
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I don't know.

720
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Well, surely there's things you do like, like the gummy creation that you seem passionate about.

721
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I like that, but I feel bad.

722
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It makes me feel bad that it's not more of a fruitful endeavor.

723
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't really get anything out of it.

724
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I guess I wasn't happy to.

725
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You mean like money?

726
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yeah.

727
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's not like accomplishing anything.

728
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's just like a thing that I sort of do as a hobby.

729
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I guess it's my hobby, you could say, but like, you know, I figured out a recipe that I'm happy with.

730
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I made some gifts out of it, gave them to some people.

731
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That was good.

732
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That was gratifying, but like, well, I did it.

733
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I feel like I would be more satisfied with that if I had an idea like, oh, okay.

734
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Well, I finished the recipe now to the next step of my plan, but there isn't one.

735
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Do you feel like there's no point doing anything if you don't have a larger plan to work towards?

736
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

737
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Have you ever heard of Jesus twice?

738
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
No.

739
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Maybe you could tell me about it.

740
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I don't follow his plan.

741
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Have you ever heard of this guy QAnon?

742
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
No.

743
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
He's posting again.

744
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, I love posting.

745
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You had me at posting.

746
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You had me at posting.

747
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So, yeah, I just feel very unmotivated and very adrift and I don't know what I even want to do with my life anymore.

748
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I have thought about this a lot, this sort of thing.

749
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:40,000
A friend of mine talked to me about how I'm beating myself up over things like, what's the point if I can't make it a career?

750
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Or if I can't increase in skill enough to do well for it to be worthwhile for me or other people.

751
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It's usually a down to money.

752
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's also down to satisfying myself.

753
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And they were like, do you accept yourself existing?

754
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Aside from accomplishments, past and present, future, do you accept that you are allowed to exist?

755
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I realized, talking about it, I feel like I don't.

756
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I don't think of myself as worthy unless I have accomplishments under my belt or that I can work towards getting money, notoriety, skill, self-satisfaction, fame through art that I make.

757
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I don't feel like I could live with myself if I didn't do any of those things.

758
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And they said that was an unhealthy mindset that you should be able to hypothetically accept yourself and that's it.

759
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
There's no prerequisite.

760
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There's no bar you need to reach.

761
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You don't need to do anything and you should be able to be okay with that.

762
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And that's tough.

763
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I still don't know really how to do that, but it's helped to think about it a couple times where it's like, if I stopped doing everything that I'm doing, would I be okay with it?

764
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
How do I accept who I am?

765
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Because when there's no motivation to do anything, there's no reason to do it.

766
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You feel like there's like, what's the point of everything you could possibly do?

767
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Everything left is like nothing and then are you okay with that? Are you okay with nothing?

768
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, not really, no.

769
00:46:46,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I feel like I could be doing something that means something or matters or contributes to the world in some way and I don't feel like I'm doing enough.

770
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And I feel like it's a waste.

771
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Like I said, I feel like I've wasted my life.

772
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
If you know what I mean.

773
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah.

774
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I think it's something to mull over at least.

775
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh, I will.

776
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Don't worry.

777
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Because being, I don't know, like requiring yourself to reach certain standards of worthiness for you to feel okay causes you to never do anything because you're so upset with yourself.

778
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And it's not so much that you should accept yourself as a hypothetical do nothing person for the purposes of being productive later.

779
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But that does tend to happen when somebody is like, it's like the whole like, oh, nothing matters.

780
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But they got sunglasses on.

781
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
They're like, yeah, nothing matters.

782
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
When you reach that point.

783
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's like a funny thing looking at it but to actually reach that point you need to genuinely like feel like if nothing happens and you don't you don't do anything then that's cool too.

784
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And then it's easier to just do something for no reason.

785
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I think the past couple years, you know, I think a lot of what gave me, you know, what gave me a sense of motivation to do anything was like, I don't know, a couple of my videos or whatever got pretty popular people knew me, people like knew about that stuff.

786
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And I had like some recognition for those things and people wanted to talk to me about those things.

787
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And like, it's not that I was like super, it's not that I was like super invested in the things that like, I don't know, Chris Chan or a unicorn jelly or whatever or tails gets trolled.

788
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's not that I like love those things passionately and want to talk about them but just like the fact that people knew me for something and wanted to talk to me about something.

789
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I was passionate about that.

790
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That gave me motivation.

791
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And in the absence of that, like the things themselves don't mean anything.

792
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And I guess I could try to like do that again.

793
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Think of something random that is not actually important, but like try and do something with it that gets people to be like, oh, hey, Ben, you did that thing about the thing I like.

794
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Well, let's, I have an opinion about that.

795
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Let's have a dialogue and I'll be like, okay.

796
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You get a little envelope.

797
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I like dialogues.

798
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You get a little envelope.

799
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You open it up saying, hey, Ben Saint, I saw your video.

800
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Now you can live.

801
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Now you feel like you're worth something.

802
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Sure.

803
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah.

804
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That's like my hog, my version of the Hogwarts letter.

805
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah.

806
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah.

807
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

808
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Only it's better because it's not from JK.

809
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah.

810
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So it's, it's, yeah, I felt like that as well.

811
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah.

812
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But it does lead to, to feeling that if it's unlikely that people will care to not do anything, which I guess is a lot of what you're feeling with like, oh, I haven't streamed in a while and my momentum is down.

813
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So there's going to be less people who are going to be affected by my streaming if I continue, if I started up again.

814
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It's like, well, if people aren't going to say Ben Saint, I love your streams, what's the point of starting it up again?

815
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I've lost everything.

816
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Exactly.

817
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You're exactly, that's a great point you just made.

818
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I couldn't agree more with it.

819
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Well said.

820
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
No.

821
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's a bad thing to think that.

822
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Well, I mean, bad and good is whatever.

823
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I just think it might be.

824
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
There's actually no difference between good and bad things.

825
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You idiot.

826
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah.

827
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah.

828
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I just, I felt like it's, it's been something I have to try and get away from hoping like to get validation from exclusively outside is, it sucks when it doesn't work, when you're not getting constant love and attention.

829
00:51:46,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And as soon as you're left on your own and your momentum is gone, you feel like there's no reason for anything because you don't know how to like feel accepting of yourself as a person who isn't making big fat stacks and loads of views and clicks.

830
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
As Zero would say, what is it?

831
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
What is the line?

832
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Zero subs.

833
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh, no, it's like, uh, well, it's like this, this can't be happening.

834
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
There's no reason to go on.

835
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
What am I fighting for?

836
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah, you know, what are you fighting for zero Ben?

837
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And nothing, nothing, just, just to live and feel cool about myself.

838
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That's the only two things I want.

839
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You just want to stay alive and I want to feel like I'm cool.

840
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And I'm only managing the first one.

841
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's not enough.

842
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You got to feel cool by being alive.

843
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You got to, you got to find the, the, the self acceptance.

844
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Ben Saint, the zero subscriber boy.

845
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
What do you think?

846
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh, pathetic, pathetic.

847
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
No.

848
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
He's valid.

849
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What's even, what's the point?

850
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
What's the point?

851
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yeah, sure.

852
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
He's alive.

853
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But what's, what has he, what has he ever contributed?

854
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
What has he ever done for anyone?

855
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
He doesn't need to.

856
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Does he not?

857
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
No.

858
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I don't, I don't care about anyone I've never heard of.

859
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So if no one's ever heard of me, then nobody cares.

860
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And what's the point?

861
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Well, that's the whole thing.

862
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
If you're living in a vacuum and you don't care about you, there's no one else to do it.

863
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You just got to do it.

864
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You got to love yourself, Ben.

865
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You dumb motherfucker.

866
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Um, yeah, I mean, I guess you're right.

867
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, but yeah.

868
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's difficult to do it, but like knowing that that's something to work on is important.

869
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I, I just, um, I guess, I guess I just, you know what, I guess I just wish.

870
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I think even if, you know, it's not, it's not so much a clout thing.

871
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's not like, oh, I don't have enough clout.

872
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's not even that.

873
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I wish that I had something, I wish I knew what I felt passionate about.

874
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Something that I like, I wake up, something that makes me wake up and I'm like, I can't

875
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
wait to do that thing that I do today.

876
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Like I got something I'm working on and I'm like, I gotta get back to it.

877
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I, I haven't felt that way about anything in a while.

878
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And when you have something like that, it doesn't matter if you're, if you're fucking,

879
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
if your video got a lot of views or whatever.

880
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's just, it's just like, it's, there's a reason to go on.

881
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
What am I fighting for?

882
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I don't know if this is like a common thought.

883
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Probably is, but I feel like a way to do that, a way to find purpose in something is to think

884
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:26,000
selflessly about someone else to like, I don't know, to help someone else with their problem

885
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and forget about your own for a bit.

886
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And it's, it's easier to like find passion to get that done than it is to, to love yourself.

887
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And it's sort of, I don't know, it helps kickstart things.

888
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
If it, you know, if it's difficult to like create a gratitude from nothing, if you're

889
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
just sitting there doing nothing and I'm like, well, I'm not making anyone's life better.

890
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And I don't like myself just sitting here.

891
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So it's, what am I supposed to do?

892
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You can just like, service someone else, be, be there for someone else.

893
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Oh, okay.

894
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh, yeah.

895
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I mean, you could suck a dick or two.

896
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I mean, I don't care.

897
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Sure.

898
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You do, you do what you like.

899
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
If that's what gets you out of bed in the morning.

900
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah.

901
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Like, I mean, did T-Bab, you, I mean, T-Bab was like a joint venture.

902
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And so you had the, the, the sense of doing it because you were doing it, but also Nate

903
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
was doing it.

904
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And so you were helping Nate and he was helping you to make the show.

905
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That's so it was, it was easier to stay motivated and get motivated because you were, you were

906
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
helping someone while you were doing it.

907
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That's true.

908
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
That is true.

909
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean, even for the PCP, like it's easier to come on the show when there's someone else

910
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
to talk to you because I'm not just doing a podcast for myself.

911
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'm, I'm there to be part of the show.

912
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Man, I don't know what I would do if like it was just me.

913
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't know if I would have the fortitude to carry on with it.

914
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah.

915
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Sorry, I wasn't there last time.

916
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
No, it's okay.

917
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It was a Father's Day thing, but I also sort of forgot.

918
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It's understood.

919
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I mean, yeah, it's fine.

920
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I'm not, I'm not saying like, am I saying every Ben cast is a, is a, is a tragedy that

921
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
like devastates my self-esteem.

922
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Well, I'm not going to say it out loud, but no, I don't care.

923
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
No, it's fine.

924
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But my point was just like, you know, I mean, I don't know.

925
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I don't know if, if I could be like, well, I'm the only, I'm the only procrastinator

926
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
left that I'm just going to keep showing up every week and rambling into a microphone.

927
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't know if I, if I could do that.

928
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah.

929
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But like you said, like you said with TBAP, it was like, it wasn't just to get the project

930
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
done.

931
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It was we are, we both are working on this thing and I must do it not just for myself,

932
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
but for my, my partner as well in this, in this business venture.

933
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And that was helpful.

934
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It was.

935
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And, you know, okay, what you're saying about like, think about how you can help someone

936
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
else.

937
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Like I, I agree.

938
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I feel like I don't know what value I have to offer someone because all I can do, this

939
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
is why I say, this is why I feel like I've wasted my life because what, because what

940
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
can I do?

941
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I can, I can draw kind of.

942
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And that's it.

943
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I used to be, I used to be good.

944
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I don't think I am funny.

945
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't feel like I'm funny.

946
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I feel like sometimes I'm funny by accident, but I'm not, I would not, I'm not like a comedian.

947
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm not like a, I don't like make jokes.

948
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Well, I don't mean like it.

949
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I mean, like just talking to someone.

950
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Like it's, you're fun to talk to.

951
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I do, I do feel, well, I don't know.

952
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Sometimes, sometimes I feel like I'm pretty good at talking to people and like I can be,

953
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and like I can be, I don't know, charming.

954
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm sorry.

955
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I don't mean to tube my own horn.

956
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I feel like I can be, I don't feel like it's a, it's a huge boast to say.

957
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I feel like I can be charming and that's fine.

958
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That's, that's good.

959
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I guess that's, that's a quality.

960
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I don't know what to do with that.

961
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I don't feel like that's value that I could give somebody.

962
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:44,000
A value would be if I could, if I could, like if, I don't know, if I could write something

963
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
that was really like insightful and people could get something out of it and be like,

964
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
ah, this, Ben has had an idea here that has taught me something or clarified my own thinking.

965
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Or I mean, it doesn't have to be writing.

966
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
If I could do that through art somehow, I guess that would be fine too.

967
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I don't know how to do that.

968
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That's why I say I have no ideas because I don't know what would be like a valuable activity

969
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I could be participating in that other people would get something out of.

970
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I guess the most straightforward thing to do would be if I like got a job

971
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and then I would be giving value to my employer in the form of wage labor in exchange for, for a wage.

972
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But I don't want to do that because I hate capitalism.

973
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And I would see that as an evil.

974
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I would, I would, unless there were some side benefit to it, unless I were achieving some other thing,

975
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
by that I would see that as like a net evil that I was inflicting on the world

976
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
by moving capital into the hands of a, of a bourgeois fucker.

977
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You know what I mean?

978
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I do know what you mean.

979
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I've seen these videos on YouTube of like people powerwashing random people's driveways for free

980
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and then making videos about it and getting paid via the videos.

981
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So they have their powerwashing equipment and they go by, they drive by,

982
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:29,000
they see somebody's like got a really dark and dirty like overgrown sort of driveway front porch area

983
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
and they just go knock on the door and say, hey, I'll do this for free and they do it for free.

984
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And then they leave and it's, it's, it's a nice feeling thing.

985
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's also very satisfying just ASMR just powerwashing something, seeing everything become cleaner.

986
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And so it's like, it's revenue for them so they can exist in capitalism,

987
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,000
but they're not like taking anything from anybody in the community.

988
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
It's, it's, it's nice.

989
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I always thought like that would be a nice job, kind of.

990
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I don't have anything like that.

991
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I gotta say, that sounds completely ridiculous.

992
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I don't think that sounds stupid.

993
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I'm not suggesting you get a powerwashing equipment.

994
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm being perfectly honest.

995
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
No, it's great.

996
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Look how clean that, that concrete is.

997
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay.

998
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's not, people aren't going to slip on it anymore.

999
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That's true, I guess.

1000
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It's not just dirty.

1001
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's like overgrown with like, like, like a, like a walkways like covered with years of mud falling onto it.

1002
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And when they clear it, it's just better for people to walk on.

1003
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know.

1004
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
All right.

1005
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Okay.

1006
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
So it's a civic, this is like basically like a civic sort of volunteer.

1007
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah, it's volunteer work.

1008
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But via YouTube, they can, they can fund it.

1009
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.

1010
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It's just sort of a nice thing about YouTube, I guess.

1011
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Who would watch that?

1012
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Me and thousands of millions of people, honestly.

1013
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Commentary, is someone like commentating the cleanup job that they did?

1014
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I think it's just sort of an inherently satisfying thing, watching something be cleaned.

1015
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Is it like a time lapse?

1016
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like you watch, like you watch the area become cleaner?

1017
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yeah.

1018
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Like they set up the camera and they do it in first speed and they just sort of spread,

1019
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
splash all the water and they get all the grain gone.

1020
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And sometimes they commentate over bits, but most of the videos I've seen people just like

1021
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
watching it slowly be cleared.

1022
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's like, ah, yeah.

1023
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Cleanliness.

1024
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Oh, I'm parking.

1025
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I mean, I can understand the appeal of watching something, watching a transition from disorder

1026
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
to order.

1027
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's an inherently satisfying thing to witness.

1028
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But like, I don't know, I was, in terms of like, oh shit, what was I talking about?

1029
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I think I was saying something about like jobs.

1030
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I don't know.

1031
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah, you don't want to be a capitalism wage slave.

1032
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I don't.

1033
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't.

1034
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
That's the first thing you can think of to help.

1035
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
That's the most straightforward way of like, oh, Ben, how could you feel like you were actually

1036
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
accomplishing something?

1037
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
How could you feel like you weren't wasting your life?

1038
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's like, well, if I, if I just got a job, then I would be doing something.

1039
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But also, I don't, I think, I don't think like a lot, you know, a lot of people say like,

1040
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
oh, just get a job.

1041
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And like, then you'll be contributing something.

1042
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And I don't agree with that because most jobs, well, a lot of jobs are worthless.

1043
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:04,000
A lot of jobs exist like solely to just like solve a problem that like the company that is hiring you created for themselves.

1044
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Right.

1045
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Sure.

1046
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Bullshit jobs as the late Graeber wrote.

1047
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But I mean, that's why I mentioned the thing because it's like these, it's not just power washing.

1048
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It's like there's this guy who clearly very autistic, but loves clearing drains that have flooded and they've got like Schmaltz started like blocking the drain.

1049
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And he's just going around the side of the road, usually in the rain.

1050
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And he's got like his like scraping tool.

1051
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And he's like, oh, we got to go to clear this drain here.

1052
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And then you watch his like a whirlpool form and the water goes down and he just does that in the local community.

1053
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And the people around like know him and he makes his videos and people just love seeing like the it's it's selfless.

1054
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's like it's hard labor, but it's serving the local community.

1055
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And it's just sort of, you know, it's it's making places safer.

1056
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's solving problems where bureaucracy might get in the way and like a guy would never come around to fix these things.

1057
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
If he didn't.

1058
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah.

1059
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And it's just sort of like that's the sort of work that is gratifying is is helping people locally in ways that like capital bureaucracy doesn't help.

1060
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Just like, I don't know, like clearing somebody's driveway of snow, if they are too old to do it themselves like some some small thing like that makes you feel good.

1061
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
If it's not like commercially viable.

1062
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1063
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I don't know if that's sounds that appealing.

1064
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Look, I'm gonna.

1065
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying you should do any of these things, but like, right, sure.

1066
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Jobs aren't all bullshit.

1067
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There are there are things you can find.

1068
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm sure it's just volunteer work that you do like part time, you know.

1069
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yeah, I just if I feel like if I had something, if I feel like if I knew what I wanted to be doing and I were doing it or I were doing anything that I felt strongly about, then what would naturally I feel like what would naturally

1070
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
happen then is that I would feel is that I would have things happen.

1071
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Things would happen in my life that I would have feelings about and that I could talk about and that I could, I don't know.

1072
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And maybe and maybe then I would feel strongly enough about something to like write an essay about it and make a video about it or something like that.

1073
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So, or or.

1074
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah.

1075
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
But in but instead I'm like, well, I don't I'm not doing much.

1076
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I'm kind of just wrapping up old stuff that I did before.

1077
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm not doing anything new and I'm not like engaged in any like exciting new projects or I'm not working towards anything really at the moment and and therefore I have nothing to say.

1078
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And it's like, and it is a self reinforcing problem and then the fact that I have nothing to say about anything.

1079
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It's like, well, I won't.

1080
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'll just, I guess I'll just won't say anything and then there's no.

1081
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I don't know.

1082
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:57,000
There's no push and pull of forces that would compel me to act in any particular way and I'm just like, well, I guess I just going to just going to keep existing then.

1083
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
You're an art.

1084
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah, which is like, I guess I should be.

1085
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I guess I should be happy to theoretically accept the existence of a Ben that doesn't do anything, but I'm not.

1086
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
But I feel like maybe I'm talking in circles now.

1087
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I understand, like the whole like, I don't get how I could accept myself if I don't do anything.

1088
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I think part of the thought process you're supposed to go down is like realizing that doing nothing is bad.

1089
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And so you want to be doing something that's productive or good for who and that's why it's like help someone.

1090
01:09:47,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And even if it's like you don't use your skills in the most efficient way, something as simple as just being there for somebody that you know, or like talking with someone.

1091
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Small things that are like selfless and just provide whatever you got to someone else will like kickstart a feeling of, I don't know, feeling like you can, you can help you can do things.

1092
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And it's sort of ideally spirals into feeling better about yourself in general because you can you have value to other people.

1093
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And it's like, I don't I'm not like explaining it the best.

1094
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I mean, it's not like you can just like get it like figure it out after one conversation on a podcast, but it's a it's better than being sad all the time.

1095
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Okay, I don't know.

1096
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't know what I don't know what it is that I want to hear.

1097
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
No, neither do I.

1098
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yeah, like I don't know what I want to hear either.

1099
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I feel like maybe I'm helping.

1100
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
This is a therapy session.

1101
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I'm the therapist now.

1102
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I have been the therapist.

1103
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I am.

1104
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I know that they say that like, I guess they say that like, when you have a problem sometimes it's best to like, how would if someone else came to you and told you that they have the exact problem that you have.

1105
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Like what would you tell them?

1106
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Like what what would your advice to someone else in the exact same position as you're in be.

1107
01:11:52,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And I guess I guess what I would tell myself is like, oh God, I don't I have to I'd have to get I don't know, man.

1108
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I have to give myself some platitudes like, well, you just got to find you just got to find what what you're passionate about.

1109
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You just got to find something that excites you.

1110
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, you just got to like, yeah.

1111
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
What else?

1112
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
What else could I say?

1113
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I know.

1114
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But like, um, that's that's the sort of thing that's not what you want to hear from someone else.

1115
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
No, no, no.

1116
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So how what would you say to yourself the thing you want to hear?

1117
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:50,000
What I what I'd like, what I'd like to hear is like, what I'd like to hear is like, hey, hey, Ben, you know what, I've looked over your resume.

1118
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I've looked over your skill set.

1119
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I've looked over everything you've you've done in your life.

1120
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And I've just and I have I have a I have the perfect job for you that is going to that is going that is perfectly suits all of your skills, all of your abilities, and also includes a kick my microphone and also because full dental insurance.

1121
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,000
You start on Monday.

1122
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Ben, that's a capitalist job.

1123
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I'm a how can you live with it?

1124
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I would I it's like I said, I would I would a job would be fine.

1125
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
It's not that I think jobs are bad.

1126
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's just that I think bad jobs are bad.

1127
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I would like a job that was good and that had me doing work that I cared about.

1128
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So what's your skill set?

1129
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I don't know.

1130
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I mean drawing.

1131
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I feel like I can I feel like I'm okay at like I feel like I'm like drawing and writing dialogue.

1132
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I feel like I'm pretty decent at naturalistic dialogue.

1133
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I feel like I could like storyboard for a show or something.

1134
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I feel like I could do something like that or it could be like a presenter.

1135
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I don't know.

1136
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I feel like I'm pretty good at just talking off the cuff.

1137
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I could present.

1138
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I could I could lecture.

1139
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I feel like I could give like lectures in like a classroom maybe.

1140
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I hate although I mean I when I was it when I worked as a teacher before like I didn't I didn't like it.

1141
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I like talking.

1142
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I didn't like like lesson plans.

1143
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I didn't like answering questions.

1144
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I didn't like explaining things.

1145
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I didn't actually like the teaching part of it.

1146
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I found it really frustrating.

1147
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I mean it seems like like video essayist as like maybe like the YouTube cringe as it is seems like you would enjoy doing.

1148
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yeah.

1149
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I wish I could do it.

1150
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But like I would like I can't you.

1151
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Oh well I would have to write something and I don't know.

1152
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I don't care about anything.

1153
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I feel like I would have to care about something in order to have something to say about it.

1154
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And then I could write it and then I could make a video about it.

1155
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And that's what I'm that's what I'm missing.

1156
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Well.

1157
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah.

1158
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I don't know.

1159
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

1160
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
No I mean it's not like I expected us to figure that out.

1161
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Like.

1162
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yeah.

1163
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I feel like with me my problems late my problems all boiled down to just like a lack of motivation to do anything.

1164
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:35,000
If I could if only I could solve that if only that one that one Lego brick could snap into place.

1165
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The everything else could become could be erected around it if you know what I'm saying.

1166
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Well I mean I think we're going in circles now we are going in circles.

1167
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:58,000
The motivation if you have nothing if you have nothing you care about then caring about someone else's problem and trying to help them.

1168
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Right.

1169
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Sure.

1170
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Right.

1171
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's like it's a way to start.

1172
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Yeah.

1173
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
If you don't know what you're doing someone else is doing something.

1174
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah.

1175
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Well that's great.

1176
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I don't know.

1177
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I don't even I don't even know what that would look like.

1178
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I mean when I think about like.

1179
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
It could be as simple as just.

1180
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I really.

1181
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You know asking people how they're doing.

1182
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah.

1183
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Sure.

1184
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I mean whatever.

1185
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That's not something to do with your life.

1186
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:51,000
It can become I think I think the motivation like passion for things usually comes from experiences that you have.

1187
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Not thoughts that you come up with like in a vacuum just like no no love for anything sitting in a blank room and then suddenly you decide to care about something that like like it's doesn't work like that.

1188
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Out in the real world things happen and eventually you like have strong opinions.

1189
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah.

1190
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Like OK I've got to do this and then suddenly you're motivated to do one thing.

1191
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yeah I know I agree.

1192
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Well I agree but I don't know what else to say about it.

1193
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1194
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Do you want to hear about my fucking house hunting that I've been.

1195
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Oh yeah.

1196
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Tell me.

1197
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Yeah I've been I've been shooting off emails to people on Craigslist and it's been going OK.

1198
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I've seen I've seen two houses so far and they're one of them was one of them seemed like it was about as shit as my current place so I wasn't that excited about it.

1199
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:21,000
One of them seemed better but a little bit more expensive and a little bit less a little bit less convenient like location wise but not that much less convenient and like maybe OK I don't know.

1200
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Part of me wants to just like jump on that and just be like I don't even want to look at any more places like second places saw like and it's adequate like I'll take it.

1201
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I got it.

1202
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:42,000
How does it compare to the things you've seen to your current situation.

1203
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Well it's better than my better than my current situation.

1204
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I would say.

1205
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I got it actually.

1206
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So I think some guy has been impersonating the landlord from that place.

1207
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Here's here's a weird thing that happened.

1208
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So I went to see that place.

1209
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
A guy who lived there showed me around.

1210
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
He was like OK.

1211
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:24,000
You should OK if you if you're interested in the place contact contact Ross Ross is the name of like not not the owner but the property manager like the guy that manages for the owner.

1212
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm like OK.

1213
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So and then I get another email or maybe it was a text message.

1214
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I don't even remember from someone being like hey my email is like Ross something at something.

1215
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
You know message me back and I assumed it was the same Ross.

1216
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
So I message him back.

1217
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
He's like he's like send it to me on my send me an email at my personal email this other email.

1218
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I'm like OK so I contact him and he's like and he starts asking me like Ben sign up for this website like sign up for this website like pay a subscription fee.

1219
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Like sign up for this website and get like and show me a screenshot of like the information it gives you and that's what you got to do to sign up for the property and I ask him like are like are you.

1220
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And he's he asked me if I want to see that I'm like I already I already saw the property like what are you talking about are you.

1221
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I think he was a scammer or something and I and I and I told him like I think you're a scammer and he said like and he the way that I know that he's a scammer is that when I told him.

1222
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
You're a scammer.

1223
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:38,000
He continued to ask me like OK but if you want the property like you got to you got to sign up for this website like you got to you got to send me that.

1224
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I like that's not something that like a real a real person would would take would be called a scammer and be like well I guess our business is concluded then.

1225
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You're like a mouse sniffing a mousetrap.

1226
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
You say this is a mousetrap.

1227
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And it's like yeah OK but if you want the cheese you really have no no I'm not.

1228
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Yes yes yes.

1229
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I don't know why this guy wants me to does this guy work on commission to get people to sign up for this fucking website.

1230
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It's I don't know very very sus but I asked the guy that showed me the place and I asked him like I asked him is this the guy.

1231
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And he said he said yeah it should be him but then he gave me his phone number so I texted the guy's phone number and I don't think it's him like I really hope it's not him.

1232
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
That would be really creepy.

1233
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
The guy the guy seems the place seemed fine I would I don't know.

1234
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:47,000
There's no way that like a legit landlord would ask you like hey go sign up for a paid subscription website that will tell you like if you're a good renter and then send me a screenshot of your home page.

1235
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's insane.

1236
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
There's no way there's no way that's a real thing I refuse to believe it.

1237
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Legit landlord I don't know if those exist.

1238
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Right right well sorry.

1239
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Anyway there was another place I was.

1240
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:16,000
They wanted me to come see it this morning but I told them like I can't do it on Sunday mornings and so they said like okay well I'll contact you and tell you another time you can come see it if it's still available and like fine.

1241
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So I don't know.

1242
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Might just jump on that might just jump on that that's second place.

1243
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Because whatever.

1244
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Well I hope the move is.

1245
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
My bullshit free.

1246
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
My current landlord will certainly give me some bullshit there is certainly going to be some nonsense where.

1247
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:55,000
She wants me she wants me to give her more money than than I actually need she's going to want me she's going to want me to pay the last month's rent even though I already paid the last month's rent when I moved in.

1248
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:09,000
She's going to expect that she should be able to keep my security deposit on top of you know the 12 months rent that I should rightfully pay even though I didn't do anything fucked up to the to the room or whatever.

1249
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
There's going to be some bullshit.

1250
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But I'll just fucking have to deal with it.

1251
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Came home from a thing the other day and the landlady and her husband who I had never seen before were in my kitchen.

1252
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
They were they had gone into my room.

1253
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:42,000
They had opened my door and looked in my room which upset me a lot and I complained to them I was like you can't do this like you like you need to give me notice I didn't get any notice.

1254
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And the guy was like oh sorry sorry.

1255
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And I was mad and they knew I was mad but they didn't know what to say.

1256
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And then the guy came back and he knocked on my door and he showed me an email and he had he had in fact sent like a group email to everyone that lives in my house.

1257
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So there had been an email notification I just hadn't seen it because it was like one day before.

1258
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And I just like shit.

1259
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
This doesn't make me happy.

1260
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
This like this doesn't make me feel better.

1261
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I guess it means you're technically right.

1262
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But I still don't like it.

1263
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,000
So I don't know they're going to they're going to there's they're going to try and get away with everything get away with.

1264
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And that's just I've accepted that.

1265
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I ended up I ended up regretting not just picking a place that I found like right away not just jumping on be like I'll take it it's good enough I'll take it.

1266
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I'm debating what I don't know like is this is the place I found already is it good enough that I need to do that.

1267
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I'll I'll be honest.

1268
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I don't know.

1269
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I last last year when I was looking for places I thought like I don't know I kind of thought like it would matter.

1270
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I kind of thought it would matter like if my place was nice or anything.

1271
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I don't know.

1272
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I don't know.

1273
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I don't know if I even care if my place is nice.

1274
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
What's the point.

1275
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
What's the point of a nice place.

1276
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You know if my come you live there and if it sucks then you hate it.

1277
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I don't know.

1278
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I feel like I feel like even if it's even if it sucks or it's nice or whatever I'm still going to do the same shit.

1279
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I was just going to do the same shit.

1280
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It's just going to sit around and accomplish nothing either way.

1281
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
That's how that's how I'm thinking.

1282
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
That's how my thinking is right now.

1283
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And it's probably not.

1284
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
But yeah but hypothetically suddenly Ben St.

1285
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
You got like motivation back.

1286
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
All right.

1287
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But you're in an ugly place that sucks.

1288
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
It's harder to do stuff.

1289
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I guess that's true.

1290
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I may as well be nicer.

1291
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I would be setting myself up for success.

1292
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Yeah.

1293
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
To have a slightly nicer.

1294
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Rent for the life you want.

1295
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That's true.

1296
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That's true.

1297
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Maybe.

1298
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I guess I'll send off maybe a few more.

1299
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,000
If I send off a few more emails go check out a few more places and maybe then if none of them measure up to this place then I'll jump in it.

1300
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But that's what I said last time.

1301
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And all it took was a few days before the place was not available anymore.

1302
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And it's like I want to wait and see.

1303
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I want to wait and see.

1304
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
But I can't.

1305
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Place could be gone already.

1306
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Place could be gone already.

1307
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I just don't know.

1308
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Yeah.

1309
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Things are.

1310
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
From what I've heard.

1311
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
From you and like from other people.

1312
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Renting.

1313
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Is.

1314
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It's it's almost like.

1315
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Built to force you to make snap judgments and buy the place because.

1316
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It moves so quickly.

1317
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Yeah.

1318
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I mean.

1319
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Landlords just they just want to get the room filled.

1320
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
They're just like.

1321
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
We just want to make absolutely sure there's no like downtime where nobody is.

1322
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Is renting it so.

1323
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Yeah.

1324
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
That means that like as a renter you're like well.

1325
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
You better be you better be the first acceptable.

1326
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Person to ask to rent the place because they'll give it they'll.

1327
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
They want you.

1328
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Yeah.

1329
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
The like.

1330
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It's so quick.

1331
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
If they're like oh there's a land mine in the bathroom but you didn't have a chance to see that.

1332
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
When you looked around the house the first time.

1333
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And then you're like sure it's fine you get it.

1334
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And then go into the bathroom explode and die and the whole building crumbles.

1335
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
The guy showing me around the house told me we went to the basement.

1336
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And he told me like.

1337
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
He told me like yeah you know years and years ago.

1338
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
There used to be like there used to be like house shows down here in the basement like they used to do you know like bands.

1339
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Like they used to have parties with like hundreds of people down here.

1340
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I can't imagine how it was wasn't that big a basement I can't imagine how hundreds of people fit but I could.

1341
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I you know I'm sure you could fit a lot of people if you really wanted to.

1342
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So we said that.

1343
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And I was like okay it sounds pretty cool.

1344
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And he was like yeah you know things are things are quieted down a lot you know since the pandemic and all.

1345
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And I was like that's that's great.

1346
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And it just and it just made me feel like I'm living in the post apocalypse.

1347
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And what reason is there to go on what am I fighting for.

1348
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
That's the title of the episode.

1349
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yeah I think what are we fighting for.

1350
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

1351
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Did I say what that's a reference to do you know did I explain that.

1352
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,000
You said is Mega Man zero something something in Mega Man X five in zeros campaign.

1353
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:26,000
There's a part where zero has to fight his girlfriend I guess and she dies and he holds her body up and he yells this can't be happening.

1354
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
There's no reason to go on.

1355
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
What am I fighting for.

1356
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Amazing dub on that game the best.

1357
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh like voice acted.

1358
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah they they it's if you ever see clips from X five in particular they really what console is on that's on PlayStation.

1359
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:55,000
They it was yeah it was in the era where like they had just the PlayStation was new.

1360
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
They were like wow we can actually fit some like video on like these discs.

1361
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So they made some like anime cut scenes for the game that look pretty good.

1362
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And the Japanese voice acting is all right but the English the English dub is like remarkable remarkably like awkward.

1363
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Frickin I can't I can't do it just just look it up I guess just look up clips if you want to see some some good but that one of zero yelling while he's holding Iris is the.

1364
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It's basically the I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light.

1365
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
You know that one.

1366
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Oh yeah.

1367
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It's basically that it's just as good.

1368
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I'm watching a clip.

1369
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Is he going to say it.

1370
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You watch zero.

1371
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Can we play the clip.

1372
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Eleazar play the clip.

1373
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
No this isn't happening.

1374
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
There's no reason for me to go on.

1375
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
What am I fighting for.

1376
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
The second way is the way he kind of gets like all nasally at the end of his yell.

1377
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Yeah.

1378
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yeah.

1379
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
That's great.

1380
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:26,000
There's a there's a there's two characters Iris and the Colonel they both have like I think they have New Zealand accents for some reason which like that's fine on its own but like the way that they talk like they sound so like calm.

1381
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I don't know.

1382
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:35,000
There's a part where like the general is giving a big speech to all the troops and fricking Colonel comes up but he's like yes.

1383
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I concur.

1384
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I concur with the general sentiments.

1385
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
We are the we will create an independent nation for all reploids.

1386
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
We are the greatest military in the world.

1387
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
We are the repliforce and everyone goes.

1388
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Yeah.

1389
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It's pretty it's pretty good.

1390
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It's pretty good.

1391
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
All those people don't know what they're fighting for.

1392
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Man to be to be a to be a to be a member of a insurrectionist robot army trying to create a robot ethno state in space you know at least at least I would have at least I'd be passionate about something.

1393
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Anyway what was I was I talking about how do I get on the subject.

1394
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Zero zero yell.

1395
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I don't know whatever.

1396
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
What are you fighting for nothing.

1397
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Nothing.

1398
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm fighting for.

1399
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Big old tits that's what I'm fighting for.

1400
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That's my that's the thing I like that's just that's just crass.

1401
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
That's just despicable.

1402
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I'd rather be crass than grass.

1403
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
What are you dead.

1404
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Oh yeah.

1405
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
When we die our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass.

1406
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Yeah.

1407
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Hey you know someone you remember how the stream didn't work.

1408
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Yes.

1409
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Well I got a Wi-Fi extender.

1410
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I haven't set it up yet.

1411
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I don't know if it will improve things for like you know the like remaining like month or two that I'm here.

1412
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But it might so I'm going to set that up and see if that improves my my connection situation.

1413
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:39,000
In the discord F Fka Ren suggested something called a power line adapter that I've never heard of before do you know what that is.

1414
01:33:40,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Parallel I don't know the things like what they're for for making Wi-Fi stronger but I think the one I have is like you plug a thing into you plug the the router into this thing and that plugs into the power of the house and then you

1415
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:16,000
you plug you you plug a receiver into another wall thing and that is like it takes the signal from the thing from the power from the power outlet somehow.

1416
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
That sounds that sounds insane.

1417
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
It's that yeah I don't really know how it works it's different from a Wi-Fi extender I believe.

1418
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yeah.

1419
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:34,000
But it I plug I plug my my like LAN cable into that like power outlet thingy and I get really good internet.

1420
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh you have one.

1421
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Yeah.

1422
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Huh.

1423
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Because because my my room is far from the the router I can't get a good signal through the wall.

1424
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Well I don't I don't know if that would work because I don't know if that would work for me because yeah my router is up on the second floor in a guy's room.

1425
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And my like power is on a different switch like I I might have mentioned that I lost power like three times last month.

1426
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Oh shit I didn't know it was more than once.

1427
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Oh yeah it happened it happened two more times after that like I guess it's been like two weeks now but it happened like once a week for a while there.

1428
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah I lost it multiple times it was really annoying.

1429
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But it hasn't happened in a little while so the problem might be fixed.

1430
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But anyway when I lost power I would only lose power in my room and in the adjacent room the kitchen didn't lose power and the upstairs didn't lose power.

1431
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So we're on different circuits so I feel like it would not work to plug the yeah probably yeah maybe maybe in the next house I could do that something like that.

1432
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Yeah I would look into it more that it's really confusing that there are different multiple different ways to extend a Wi-Fi signal that are very similarly named.

1433
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Yeah well this Wi-Fi this Wi-Fi adapter might do something I was only like 25 bucks so I was like I'll try it I'll see if I'll see if it has any positive impact.

1434
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Like I said I used to have a Wi-Fi adapter down here but the guy left and he took it and it hasn't been haven't had a problem without it but maybe the fact that it is missing now has been negatively affecting things and we'll see if I can fix them.

1435
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Damn I went to a birthday party yesterday.

1436
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Oh you know what I kind of want I wanted to mention I don't know we were saying things that I'm good at and I said I can sometimes be charming.

1437
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Well I didn't I didn't feel charming at this birthday party yesterday because I didn't know anybody.

1438
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I was there I have a friend he invited me to his thing I had met him and I'd met his wife before and I didn't know anyone else.

1439
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:04,000
And I I don't know I didn't feel good I didn't feel good about it.

1440
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I some of the time I just kind of stood around I did talk to people here and there and mostly I just was I don't know it was mostly just neutral.

1441
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
There's a lot of neutral shooting the shit feeling like feeling like why am I even why am I even bothering.

1442
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Why am I why am I talking.

1443
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I don't like I do these people even want to talk to me they don't know me.

1444
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Should I just shut up.

1445
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Was it like that image of the soy jacket the party and he's like they don't even know that I'm Ben Singh.

1446
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
No God no I you know I really tried.

1447
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I actually really tried not to bring up like Internet stuff or or like it did it did end up coming up once or twice and I tried not to dwell on it.

1448
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But I did at one or two points explain a little bit talk a little bit about like doing a podcast or whatever and I felt terrible I felt shame.

1449
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I like tried to move past the subject as fast as I could.

1450
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Is it like what do you do sort of conversation.

1451
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Some someone was talking about I forget how someone was talking about a podcast that they listened to and they talked about like drama that had involved in it and like how it like the members had broken up or something.

1452
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And I and I and I felt like I could not not mention that like oh something kind of like that happened to me a little bit.

1453
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I sort of had a similar thing.

1454
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I wouldn't you would not.

1455
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I don't think I would know.

1456
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
No.

1457
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I feel like the I because people know what drama is you could just talk about drama.

1458
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I wouldn't I wouldn't want to say oh yeah I had a bit of that I had a podcast and by the way I'm on the Internet and you can find me here.

1459
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I didn't do that.

1460
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I didn't I didn't do that.

1461
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:26,000
There was that and there was another someone someone else was talking about something they had posted that had gone somewhat viral and someone else mentioned that I like do comics or something and this person asked me like oh where can I follow you what's your what's your.

1462
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I was like yeah this is my Twitter like yeah.

1463
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And then the and then they actually that person specifically asked me.

1464
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
That person specifically asked me like can you tell me more about like.

1465
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:55,000
You know your like your podcast or whatever about that thing you were saying about like how like you people you split up with the other like whatever they asked about it and I had to be like I'd rather actually not get into the details about it.

1466
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Like I kind of don't want to talk about it in its length here and now.

1467
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And so I didn't.

1468
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And I when I wish I wished I had not mentioned anything about it.

1469
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
That sucks.

1470
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yeah.

1471
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I mean at the end of the day this was not this was not like this was just one thing that got mentioned among many many things we mostly talked about birds.

1472
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
And that was fine.

1473
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I don't know I just felt like.

1474
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Oh here I am out in the real world among real people.

1475
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yeah I am a sap.

1476
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Yeah I have frittered away in my life on worthless worthless things.

1477
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
But that's okay.

1478
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You know what.

1479
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Well it is.

1480
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Yeah.

1481
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Like like all right.

1482
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I don't I don't know if it is.

1483
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Well I mean I don't know if I think it's actually okay.

1484
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
But like what would a non-wasted life look like.

1485
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I don't know something that something that left me in a position now where I feel like this is what I can contribute to the world.

1486
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:09,000
This is this is how I can give value to other people and do something that matters and so that people appreciate.

1487
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I don't know what that would be just something instead.

1488
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Oh maybe I could maybe I oh if something is bad if there's a problem.

1489
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Oh well maybe I could podcast about it.

1490
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Maybe that would maybe that would help.

1491
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Oh maybe I could maybe I could draw a comic about it.

1492
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Well no because like I don't know what I would actually say with with with drawings about anything because I can't I can't think anymore.

1493
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,000
But almost that's all that's almost a skill.

1494
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I think it's like if you if you didn't have a clear idea it's sort of unhelpful to just say I've wasted my life.

1495
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:03,000
If you didn't like because like I don't know how's that going to help right now.

1496
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Well you know they say the first step of getting better is to admit you have a problem and continue admitting it over and over again.

1497
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Sure.

1498
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Well I mean it's easy to admit you have a like you're unhappy.

1499
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Right.

1500
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:32,000
But I don't think wondering about like if only some nondescript thing had happened in my life I wouldn't be right here.

1501
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That would be great.

1502
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Like you get a time machine is like OK Ben you can solve your problems what are you going to do.

1503
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I don't know.

1504
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I'm going to go back to that time I missed the sports ball and I'm going to I'm going to I don't know coach my young self to do it right and then I'm going to become a sports guy.

1505
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I don't know if I if I if I'd stayed in if I'd stayed in school gotten my masters become a scientist or whatever I probably would be feeling like damn I work in a lab.

1506
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I work for some fucking stupid military contractor or something.

1507
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I do I do I make I make some some garbage for industrial equipment.

1508
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I've wasted my life.

1509
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
This is all meaningless.

1510
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I wish I wish I'd done something.

1511
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I wish I'd done something creative.

1512
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I wish I'd been an indie comics artist instead.

1513
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Now that would be now that would be the life.

1514
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Yeah.

1515
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:43,000
And then I could express myself or whatever is grim grim.

1516
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I don't know what else to say.

1517
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
You can't keep being grim.

1518
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Can't keep getting away with it.

1519
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:58,000
You can't keep shitting where you think because then you have a poofy brain.

1520
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I you're not wrong.

1521
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I'm out of topics.

1522
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I'm out of topics that I put on my stupid list of things I wanted to talk about today.

1523
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Yeah.

1524
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I didn't really have any topics aside from just mentioning Roe v. Wade.

1525
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Oh yeah.

1526
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
We already talked about it.

1527
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Who cares about that when I feel bad?

1528
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
What about I feel bad?

1529
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
What about I feel bad?

1530
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:31,000
I guess I'll say here the the commissions that I was doing.

1531
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I'm going to close those.

1532
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah.

1533
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
So they're already closed by the time you're listening to this.

1534
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Just because I've had trouble getting the rest of them finished.

1535
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And that sort of it's always with this with commissions where I'm like, oh shit, they've paid money.

1536
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Now I've got to deliver.

1537
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
And I deliver it like pretty good.

1538
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Honestly, like some pretty good art.

1539
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And then I got stuck on one of them and the the the the the slowing momentum caused all the problems in the world to happen.

1540
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
And so I made me depressed.

1541
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
And so I'm trying to work on feeling better.

1542
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Yeah.

1543
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So I've got to do those.

1544
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And I don't know what I'm going to do after that.

1545
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:25,000
But I'm singularly focused on just trying to actually feel better first.

1546
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So I've been watching Breaking Bad.

1547
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And I'm like, ah, remember when he said we got to cook?

1548
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I like that.

1549
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I like the characters.

1550
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I like the writing.

1551
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Good show.

1552
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Oh, good show, everybody.

1553
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Clap clap.

1554
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yeah.

1555
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:55,000
And then I've been fucking playing oblivion and slashing people with a sword and playing Team Fortress 2 and being like, what if what if I was in the past and this I was playing sniper and I shot him.

1556
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
That would be good.

1557
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:04,000
That's what I've really been occupying myself with is just trying not to be depressed, trying to do things that make me happier.

1558
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
And then we're doing a podcast now.

1559
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I don't know what I'm going to do afterwards.

1560
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Oh, wait, wait.

1561
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I'm going to finish my footnotes for Slime and Punishment because they really are like very close.

1562
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
They really are really close to being done.

1563
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And that is a bright spot in my dark life.

1564
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I do have a topic or a thing that I've been doing that's new.

1565
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:36,000
When I got back from the whole being in America thing.

1566
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
This whole America business, yep.

1567
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I got a calorie counting app and I'm like, okay, I'm actually going to do that for once because the last time I got a calorie counting app, it was for Americans and they had like American products in it and I'm like, I don't know what I'm looking at.

1568
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
So I found a UK based one which had things I recognized and I'm like, okay, I can actually use this.

1569
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
So I've been tracking my calories and it's been very helpful.

1570
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And I've always been very thin.

1571
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So I've actually been trying to gain a bit of weight.

1572
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And I've been being like, wow, I have a normal day where I eat what I expect is fine.

1573
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And I'm like, oh, you need to eat 700 calories at 11 p.m.

1574
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
You're saying that you underate?

1575
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I underate.

1576
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:33,000
If I left my own devices, I just normally don't eat enough for the goal weight that I want to achieve.

1577
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I'm like, shit, gotta binge right at the end.

1578
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
That's always really weird.

1579
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I can't even believe this is a real problem that some people have.

1580
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Well, I get it.

1581
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Shut up.

1582
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
In theory, I guess.

1583
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
It's not a difficult problem.

1584
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I'm not trying to tell you that it's not a real thing.

1585
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
But also, it's so bizarre to me.

1586
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
It's not anorexia.

1587
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It's not a serious issue.

1588
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Some people are just, I don't know, peckish.

1589
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Peckish?

1590
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I feel hungry.

1591
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I'm not used to going out of my way to get something when I'm hungry.

1592
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And so I will be like, oh, it's only one hour till dinner.

1593
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,000
And I forgot to have lunch, so I'll just have dinner instead.

1594
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And that's like, oh, I have a calorie deficit.

1595
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I have a fat deficit.

1596
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
This is not good.

1597
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:41,000
That's something that has helped me not overeat is just not having things that I can snack on.

1598
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Because if I can snack on stuff, then I will just continuously snack on stuff.

1599
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
And I'll eat an infinite amount.

1600
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So now I don't have that.

1601
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
The only option I have to eat is that I have to actually make something,

1602
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
even if it's something simple like a wrap or a sandwich or something.

1603
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:04,000
And just that little energy barrier that I have to cross to eat,

1604
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,000
it keeps me on track.

1605
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
But yeah, aside from a couple nights where I'm like, shit,

1606
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I got to chug some milk or something to get that fat content up,

1607
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
which has been amusing.

1608
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Are you going to go mad?

1609
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I've looked at, somebody said that, and I'm like,

1610
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Do you know what that is?

1611
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
A gallon of milk a day.

1612
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Not a gallon.

1613
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Not any closer gallon.

1614
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I used to do that.

1615
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I used to do that.

1616
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:43,000
A gallon of milk is like an unbelievable amount of excess for me.

1617
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
It's not a small amount.

1618
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
If you're a bodybuilder and you're doing like strenuous exercise,

1619
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
there's people who say it's like decent enough

1620
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:02,000
because it's very easy to ingest a version of the amount of nutrients you need.

1621
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
It is a good way to gain weight.

1622
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Yeah.

1623
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
But I mean, a glass of milk a day.

1624
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I'm doing go mad.

1625
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
It's different.

1626
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Like a little lowercase g.

1627
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Yeah.

1628
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Go mad.

1629
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Glass of milk a day.

1630
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Cute.

1631
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
So that's sort of working.

1632
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
And yeah, that's something in my life now where I'm eating something

1633
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
and being like, okay, what was that made of?

1634
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
That's one of these, one of those.

1635
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Okay.

1636
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
That and I just, I'm logging it.

1637
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I'm logging my weight.

1638
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And now I just got to do exercises as well because I did one day of exercise.

1639
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I was like, okay, that's, I did, I did it.

1640
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Now I just got to keep consistent with it.

1641
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And I didn't do it the second time and I forgot every time after that

1642
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
because it was like, ah, but I fucked it up.

1643
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Ah, whatever.

1644
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I have, I have also, I have not been lifting the last couple of weeks.

1645
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Maybe two, maybe two, two or two and a half weeks, two or three weeks.

1646
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
It's been, I was into it for a while and then I fell off and I should start again.

1647
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Do you mind, I mean, do you want to share your like fitness goals?

1648
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I'd be curious.

1649
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Like, do you have a goal weight in mind or like, is there some form of exercise

1650
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
you'd like to like be able to do or something like that?

1651
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
The goal weight is at the moment.

1652
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I just pulled a number.

1653
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I didn't really think too much, but I was at like 64.7 kilograms.

1654
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Oh God.

1655
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Oh, right.

1656
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Kilograms.

1657
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
No.

1658
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Yeah.

1659
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Okay.

1660
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Okay.

1661
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
No, I was 62.7 kilograms.

1662
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I wanted to get to 65 because that's more healthy for my height.

1663
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,000
So I've been doing that exercise wise.

1664
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Mostly I've been looking into like butt shaping ones because that's that's epic squats

1665
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
and leg lifts and lunges and things like that.

1666
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I guess I could do push-ups as well.

1667
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I don't really know.

1668
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I'm kind of an idiot and researching these things.

1669
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I look at all the numbers and the words and the journals and the articles and I get

1670
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
overwhelmed and then I just ask people, what do you do?

1671
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And then they say, well, it will depend on what you want.

1672
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
And I'm like, I don't know what I want.

1673
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
So I'm just sort of guessing mostly.

1674
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I'm like, oh, what's a rep?

1675
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
What's a set?

1676
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
How many of them do you do and why do you do them?

1677
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Well, here's the thing.

1678
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I follow a very orthodox philosophy.

1679
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I believe that everybody should do a basic strength building routine.

1680
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Squat deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows.

1681
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
And I think anyone that says no, no, no, that's two.

1682
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I think that's like the baseline.

1683
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I feel like that's the baseline that everybody should be working off of.

1684
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
You do that and then when you can't improve that anymore, you branch off into some other things.

1685
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And some people try to say, oh, no, I have some fancy alternative.

1686
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
But no, you can't beat the basic.

1687
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
That's just the most basic.

1688
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I'm doing star jumps exclusively.

1689
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Works all the muscle groups.

1690
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So that's my if not to work all the muscle groups.

1691
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
You just tense all your muscles at once.

1692
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
You just sit there.

1693
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Your whole body.

1694
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
All intention.

1695
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Well, one way, first you contract every muscle in your body as hard as you can.

1696
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
And then you extend every muscle in your body as hard.

1697
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
That's our early joint.

1698
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Implode, explode.

1699
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That's the system I'm going for.

1700
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Yeah.

1701
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:24,000
But anyway, I'm not qualified to give any advice because I haven't lifted in a few weeks and I'm a hypocrite.

1702
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
So, you know, disqualified.

1703
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:35,000
But if I were qualified to give advice, I would say to do starting strength, Mark Ripto.

1704
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Ripto, like from Spyro?

1705
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
That's the guy's name.

1706
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Yeah, Mark Ripto.

1707
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
R-I-P-P-T-O-E?

1708
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
He wrote the book.

1709
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
He wrote the starting strength book.

1710
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Maybe we'll look into that, but I probably will forget.

1711
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I think a basic strength building routine with the basic movements, squat, deadlift, bench, et cetera, et cetera.

1712
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
That's how you get all the muscles in your body.

1713
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That's how you get them strong in the least work.

1714
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
That's the most efficient way to just get all your muscles strong.

1715
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And then from that, you might branch off and do, okay, well, in addition to that, I also want to increase hypertrophy in certain parts of my body.

1716
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And then you might add onto that baseline.

1717
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Okay, and then I'll also do, I don't know, three sets of 12 bicep curls, three sets of 12 triceps extension to get big arms or whatever.

1718
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Yeah.

1719
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Yeah.

1720
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,000
That's the slash fit way.

1721
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I don't really have the space to do a big bar deadlift.

1722
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
But I do have smaller weights of some of them are quite big.

1723
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Does it work doing bench press but with two hand weights?

1724
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:20,000
It's not the same, but it probably could work similarly.

1725
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I mean, yeah, you can do a dumbbell press.

1726
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
You can do dumbbell press, dumbbell squats, dumbbell press.

1727
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I guess you could do a dumbbell deadlift.

1728
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I've never heard of anyone doing that, but you could do something similar.

1729
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
They would have to be pretty hefty.

1730
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I guess you could just get a stick and glue them together.

1731
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:58,000
The important thing is that it's some free weights, that you're doing it with free weights and that you're using your body's natural leverage.

1732
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I couldn't advise you how to do those ones because I'm sure the form would be completely different if you were holding.

1733
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I've never done it like that.

1734
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Honestly, the last time I moved, finding a place with a basement was a big priority because I wanted to set up my weight rack.

1735
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And now Anna is putting it in Munchie's house in his basement.

1736
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Fortunately, he had a basement with room for it.

1737
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
When I was over there, I tried it.

1738
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Yeah, you mentioned.

1739
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I don't know whether I mentioned on the podcast, but I tried to do a curl with the weights.

1740
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Just the bar itself was like 45 pounds.

1741
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I couldn't even do one curl.

1742
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty big.

1743
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
That bar is pretty big.

1744
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yeah, that's my case.

1745
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
It's not made for curling.

1746
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I could do a few, I think.

1747
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:15,000
There's a specific bar called a curl bar that has a bend in it that gives you a more comfortable grip than the flat straight bar.

1748
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Yeah, it's been a couple weeks.

1749
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I'm sure I've lost some of my gains.

1750
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
It hasn't been like months.

1751
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Like the last time I stopped lifting, I didn't lift for months after I got COVID.

1752
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I should get back over there.

1753
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I should get back into it.

1754
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I just have been telling myself, oh God, it's proving everything you said right.

1755
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I've been telling myself, I should be working.

1756
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I should be finishing something.

1757
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:57,000
So no time to do something that might make me happier, like working out or whatever.

1758
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
No time to think about that.

1759
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Your mind's locked in.

1760
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
It's not relaxed.

1761
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,000
It's not relaxing on thinking about anything else.

1762
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And now it's been long enough that I'm thinking like, oh, well, I can't tell Munchie that I want to work out again.

1763
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
It's been long enough that if he wanted to do that, he would have asked me already.

1764
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
So he must not want me to.

1765
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
He must just want me to leave alone.

1766
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
No, no way.

1767
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Yeah, there's no way.

1768
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Nobody wants to hear from me.

1769
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Just message an idiot.

1770
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
No, no, no.

1771
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
He would have talked to me if he still liked me.

1772
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Everyone hates me.

1773
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Everyone's secretly plotting behind my back.

1774
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I mean, that is true.

1775
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I know.

1776
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I know.

1777
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I was trying to assassinate you.

1778
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
That's why I came over, but I couldn't find the right moment.

1779
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
No, no.

1780
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
You were going to do it.

1781
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I wanted to be the PCP's only host, only person.

1782
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
You wanted to be the procrastinator.

1783
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I did.

1784
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
There could be only one.

1785
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I got to get Nate.

1786
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I got to get Nate to finish.

1787
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I transferred over most of the account.

1788
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
The last thing that needs to be transferred

1789
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
to me is the AdSense account.

1790
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
It needs to be switched

1791
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
from his Google

1792
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
to my Google.

1793
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I don't exactly know how to do that,

1794
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
but apparently there is a way to do it.

1795
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
That's the last thing

1796
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
that needs to be moved.

1797
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Everything else, the Patreon

1798
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
has been switched so that it pays out to me now

1799
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
and everything like that.

1800
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I'm mostly set up to be

1801
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
handling payments going forward.

1802
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I think Nate owes us

1803
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
several months.

1804
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
When was the last time we got paid?

1805
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It's been a while, honestly.

1806
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It has been a while, yeah.

1807
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
We missed the money from April.

1808
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Lamal.

1809
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Other than that.

1810
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I'm not even stressed about it.

1811
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
This is what I mean when it's like,

1812
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I don't

1813
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I don't need money.

1814
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I do need money,

1815
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
but I'm also at a

1816
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
position where I don't feel

1817
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
pressured to earn money

1818
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
in a way that's like, oh, I gotta find a job

1819
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
that makes more money. It's like, no,

1820
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I don't really need to do that.

1821
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
So I can think about

1822
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
hmm, well, if I had

1823
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
you know,

1824
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
this is gonna sound like such a

1825
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I hate this phrase,

1826
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
but such a first-world problem.

1827
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
That's like,

1828
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
they ask like, if you had all the money

1829
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
in the world, you know, what would you do?

1830
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
If you didn't need to make money, what would you do?

1831
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I kind of feel, even though I don't

1832
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I don't make that much, but I make

1833
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
enough to live on and now I'm like, well,

1834
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
it kind of feels like I do have all the money in the world.

1835
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I feel like I have everything I ever need

1836
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
and now, like,

1837
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
and now what?

1838
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I've reached the top of the mountain.

1839
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I say this as someone who like

1840
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
barely exceeds like

1841
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
the poverty line

1842
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
and yet, and yet what more?

1843
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
What more is there?

1844
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I mean, I guess I could like buy a house or something,

1845
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
but that feels like so far away

1846
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
that it doesn't even feel like it's worth

1847
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
thinking about.

1848
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
You know?

1849
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
That's like a whole other level

1850
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
that I'm like,

1851
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
why even bother?

1852
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
My

1853
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
anyway.

1854
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Anyway, that's so

1855
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
darn.

1856
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
If only

1857
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
wish I was poor. I wish I was poorer

1858
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
so that I have more problems so that I'd feel more

1859
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
motivated to like do something about it.

1860
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I wish, Dan, that would really compel me to get

1861
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
on the hustle and grind set, you know?

1862
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And then I'd be making moves.

1863
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Until you started to have any

1864
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
success at all and then you would stop.

1865
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
That's right.

1866
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
But I'd be so relieved to be like,

1867
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
now I can have an existential

1868
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
crisis again.

1869
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I've been waiting for this.

1870
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Ugh.

1871
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
See, the transition from feeling

1872
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
motivated into feeling depressed is

1873
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
that's the goldmine there.

1874
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I love that moment in my life.

1875
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Every time it happens, it's just so great.

1876
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
You know how there are people

1877
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
I think there are some people

1878
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
who are like

1879
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
they're addicted to like

1880
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
the start

1881
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
of a relationship.

1882
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Like they really like to like get into

1883
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
relationships because it's like

1884
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
exciting and it feels good.

1885
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
But like they're not

1886
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
but they just do it for the

1887
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
initial rush.

1888
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Yeah, there is an initial rush, like

1889
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
chemically in the brain.

1890
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
The whole like love

1891
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
honeymoon phase, whatever.

1892
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Right. Well, for me

1893
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
for me it's

1894
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
that feeling of

1895
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
ugh.

1896
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
There's nothing left

1897
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
to work for.

1898
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I've peaked. It's all over.

1899
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It's all downhill for me.

1900
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I love to hit that peak

1901
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
and get that rush of it's all downhill.

1902
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
I'm addicted to it.

1903
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I would say

1904
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
message Munchie

1905
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
and say, want to work out

1906
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
or I want to work out, please let me work out.

1907
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Yeah.

1908
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
And do some of that exercise.

1909
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
That's clearly something you like doing

1910
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
and it makes you feel good.

1911
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
It does make me feel

1912
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
a lot better.

1913
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
When I'm lifting, I feel better about myself

1914
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
regardless of my other

1915
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
circumstances.

1916
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
But do I deserve to feel better about myself?

1917
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Maybe I should

1918
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
deliberately withhold that

1919
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
to punish myself.

1920
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
And maybe that'll really get me back

1921
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
on track. The feeling of

1922
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
like, oh, well, I'm not allowed to feel good

1923
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
until I accomplish something

1924
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
that fixes all my problems.

1925
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Think about it.

1926
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I know that your therapist says something different

1927
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
but have you considered that I might know better?

1928
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
That I might have a better idea?

1929
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
No, I've never thought of that.

1930
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Because it's so stupid.

1931
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Why do we have to listen to the expert?

1932
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
America is sick and tired of experts.

1933
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
We're tired of scientists.

1934
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Let's talk to a scientist.

1935
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Y'all motherfuckers lying and getting me pissed.

1936
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
All right?

1937
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Aren't you a scientist, Ben?

1938
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
No!

1939
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I should have been.

1940
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I should have been miserable as a scientist.

1941
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I should have been the kind of guy I would listen to.

1942
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Instead of miserable as an artist.

1943
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Yeah.

1944
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I don't know.

1945
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I guess if I'd become

1946
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
like a

1947
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
material scientist or like

1948
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
some kind of researcher.

1949
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Maybe I'd have a specialization.

1950
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Maybe I'd have a specialty. Maybe I'd have some expertise.

1951
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I saw someone

1952
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
on Twitter

1953
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
say like,

1954
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I don't know.

1955
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
They were just talking about like

1956
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
a big platform or whatever.

1957
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Cloud is not important.

1958
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
It's better to have expertise.

1959
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Better to be an expert in something

1960
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
so that you have a stable income

1961
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
and then you can just shitpost

1962
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
online.

1963
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
And like,

1964
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I get that.

1965
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And it's not so much that like, oh my god.

1966
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
They're right. I want to shitpost.

1967
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
They just made me reflect on, oh my god.

1968
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I have no expertise.

1969
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I,

1970
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
what am I, what's the point?

1971
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
What can I, what do I have?

1972
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I guess I just

1973
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
wish, I just want to

1974
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
feel like what do I have that I can

1975
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
what can I do?

1976
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
What can I do

1977
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
for other people? Right?

1978
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Cause that's, that's what's important.

1979
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
You're right. It is, it is like doing something

1980
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
for other people is like a good way

1981
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
to feel

1982
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
passionate about it.

1983
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
And you know, when I think about

1984
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
people that I really admire,

1985
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
like I really admire,

1986
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I really admire Dan Olson

1987
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
like the, the NFT video.

1988
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
It's not just that it was a good video.

1989
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
It's, that's not what makes it good.

1990
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
It's that it like,

1991
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
it gave people something.

1992
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
It gave people the tools to understand

1993
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
something that they didn't understand

1994
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
before. It, he gave

1995
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
something to people with that video.

1996
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
It's like, I want to give something

1997
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
to people

1998
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
so that they'll like me.

1999
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
What if you give them

2000
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
the knowledge that

2001
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Ben St. is ripped?

2002
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Maybe, maybe that's

2003
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
the thing to strive for.

2004
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I can't guess there are worse things.

2005
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Man, oh man.

2006
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I mean, I don't feel like

2007
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
expertise is something I have.

2008
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I, I like pick up

2009
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
bits here and there and I'm like,

2010
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
yeah, but I'm not a master of my craft.

2011
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Any of, any of the crafts I know

2012
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
of, I don't really like

2013
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
excel at them.

2014
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
That sometimes annoys me

2015
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
that I, I, I, I don't

2016
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
have a personality that is

2017
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
better at focusing on

2018
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
a single thing and going

2019
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
just for that. Every time I

2020
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
see something cool, I'm like, oh, I want to do

2021
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
that. And then I

2022
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
stop whatever I'm doing and try

2023
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
to learn a new skill and then get distracted

2024
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
again. I just have all these

2025
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
like half skills

2026
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
and it's a

2027
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
yeah.

2028
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
It's, it's a little, a little

2029
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
upsetting, but I don't.

2030
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I feel like I'm a dabbler. I've dabbled

2031
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
in many things.

2032
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I'm not, I'm not really a master

2033
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
of anything. I guess I'm

2034
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I guess I'm okay at drawing.

2035
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I guess, I guess

2036
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
if I had to pick one skill that I'm the

2037
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
best at, it might be drawing,

2038
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
but like I don't feel like I'm,

2039
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I don't, I wouldn't call myself

2040
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
a great artist or anything.

2041
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I wouldn't call myself an expert draftsman.

2042
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Yeah.

2043
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
But I think that what I've

2044
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
tried, struggled with

2045
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
and tried to get better at is just accepting

2046
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
that I don't need to be

2047
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
like the master of

2048
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
anything. I can just be

2049
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
a dabbler

2050
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
and that's fine.

2051
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
It's, it's fine.

2052
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
It's

2053
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
there's always a preferable thing

2054
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
that you could be. It's, it's fine.

2055
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
You don't need to beat yourself up

2056
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
about not being that like

2057
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
hypothetical perfect person.

2058
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
It's fine to dabble. I just

2059
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
wish that there was some, I wish, wish

2060
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
that I could find some

2061
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
thing that would

2062
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
be a task

2063
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
that would like

2064
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
require like a good assortment

2065
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
of the, you know, I've

2066
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
heard people say the

2067
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
skill stack, right? Like your, like your skill

2068
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
stack.

2069
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
As in like the things

2070
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
that you can do are

2071
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
is your skill stack. Your Pokemon types.

2072
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
The stamp damage.

2073
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
And it's like, and it's like, I don't know,

2074
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
like it would be really great to

2075
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
find something to apply myself to

2076
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
that combined,

2077
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
you know, the things that I have dabbled

2078
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
in

2079
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
in some, in some meaning that

2080
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
combines them meaningfully.

2081
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And

2082
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I don't know.

2083
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Drawing.

2084
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Presenting.

2085
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Programming.

2086
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Yeah.

2087
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah, somewhat.

2088
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
You have a voice?

2089
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I, I guess.

2090
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Did I, you know,

2091
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
You have more voice than me for sure.

2092
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I did do that voice acting audition.

2093
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I'd like to, I'd like

2094
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
the voice act. That would be fun.

2095
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I don't know, I don't know what

2096
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
the name for this is.

2097
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Is there a name for

2098
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
the thing of like

2099
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
stuff, stuff like

2100
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
getting the road to Radcon book,

2101
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
The Pleeve and the Weave Blu-ray, stuff like,

2102
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
or getting my, or getting my Kickstarter books

2103
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
like made and shipped, like

2104
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
fulfillment?

2105
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Is that a skill?

2106
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
That's, it's management, it's organization,

2107
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
it's a

2108
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I feel like I've done that sort of thing

2109
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
enough. Like, like, get a thing,

2110
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
get a thing made and ship it to people.

2111
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Yeah.

2112
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I feel like that's a skill that I have.

2113
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Because I've done it many times now.

2114
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Yeah. I mean, that is overwhelming

2115
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
for some people, like me.

2116
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I get, I get a little fucked up

2117
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
looking at, like,

2118
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I mean, I, don't, don't,

2119
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
don't get me wrong. I also,

2120
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
it fucked me up a little bit too.

2121
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
But I've, but I've pushed,

2122
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I've pushed through it a few times now.

2123
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Yeah.

2124
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It's although, organization and,

2125
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
and managing

2126
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
multiple different things, managing

2127
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
people.

2128
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
It's all, it's all,

2129
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
it's hard to say what the skill is,

2130
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
but yeah.

2131
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Yeah. Those are important things. I don't know

2132
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
what the name for it would be.

2133
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I guess,

2134
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I guess I could just say,

2135
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I don't know, I'm thinking about, like, if I put it

2136
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
on a resume, I guess I could just say, like,

2137
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
yeah, I've, I've

2138
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
delivered on,

2139
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
like, four different kickstarters

2140
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
or something. I've done, like,

2141
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I, yeah, I don't know.

2142
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I got here.

2143
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
So I don't, but anyway, I don't know what,

2144
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
what a, what a,

2145
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
what it looks like to take something

2146
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
like that and turn that

2147
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
into a, here's what I'm going to do with

2148
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
my life.

2149
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
You know?

2150
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It feels like an ancillary skill,

2151
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
like, that's not something to do, that's

2152
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
just something you can do in the course

2153
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
of doing something

2154
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
else. That's a skill that might help you

2155
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
accomplish something else.

2156
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I feel like it's

2157
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
far more likely you would

2158
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
come across situations that

2159
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
would require, like, two

2160
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
combined skills, rather

2161
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
than everything you know.

2162
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Yeah. Like two skills

2163
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
are needed for this, three

2164
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
skills are needed for that project.

2165
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Yeah. I don't know

2166
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
if you'd find something that, like,

2167
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
validates everything you've

2168
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
dabbled in.

2169
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
No. Maybe during

2170
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
parts of the process that, like,

2171
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I don't know, you're

2172
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
doing something

2173
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
that isn't explicitly about

2174
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
programming, but having programming knowledge

2175
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
helps you think about something in some

2176
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
way that, you know,

2177
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
hard to get into specifics when you're just talking

2178
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
hypothetical, but, like,

2179
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
everything you do

2180
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
has some minor

2181
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
impact, I would think.

2182
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Yeah. I agree.

2183
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Nothing is, like, nothing

2184
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
is wasted. Nothing's completely wasted,

2185
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
like, oh, you'll never use that

2186
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
in any capacity ever again.

2187
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So, like, I feel like I'm not

2188
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
equipped to

2189
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
make

2190
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Berserk 2

2191
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
with the level of art and

2192
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
writing ability that I have, but...

2193
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
And don't you just feel terrible

2194
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
about that.

2195
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Yeah. But, like, I

2196
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
have

2197
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
different skills

2198
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
and they combine in different ways

2199
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
and I can make Bell Jeep too.

2200
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I can do different

2201
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
things. I don't know.

2202
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I know what it feels like

2203
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
to see the best thing in the world

2204
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
see one piece and think, well,

2205
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
if I can't make a manga as good

2206
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
and as long and as successful as one piece

2207
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
then why am I doing any drawing?

2208
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
It's easy to say that,

2209
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
but, like,

2210
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
don't worry about it.

2211
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Right. You don't need to.

2212
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
But I like that, though.

2213
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
You can't make one piece, but you can make

2214
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Bell Jeep. You can make.

2215
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
And you're the only one that could do that.

2216
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Yeah.

2217
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
That's what I told myself.

2218
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
That's what I told myself about slime and punishment.

2219
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I said I have to do it.

2220
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Because nobody's...

2221
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
This is not quite like anything

2222
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
anyone has ever done and nobody

2223
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
else could make exactly this.

2224
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
This could never happen again.

2225
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
It has to be me.

2226
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
So I have to do it.

2227
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Uh...

2228
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
And I guess it's true.

2229
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I guess it's true.

2230
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
But also, who cares?

2231
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And what's the point?

2232
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
No!

2233
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
You'll get it.

2234
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I think you'll get it at some point.

2235
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
You'll feel better about, like, motivating things.

2236
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Perhaps.

2237
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I think I will feel...

2238
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I will be glad.

2239
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I will be glad when the notes are done

2240
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
and when I can finally be like,

2241
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
okay, put the book together.

2242
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
It's printing.

2243
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Set up the Kickstarter.

2244
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Just get it done.

2245
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I hope...

2246
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
I hope that when it all is said and done,

2247
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I will feel good about

2248
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
the whole slime and punishment project.

2249
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Uh...

2250
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And everything.

2251
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
It's too early for me to

2252
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
say, like,

2253
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
well, Ben, you just wasted two years of your life.

2254
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And this is all you have to show for it.

2255
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Um...

2256
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
As long as the Kickstarter is

2257
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
even somewhat successful,

2258
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I'll be like, well, you know...

2259
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Well, you know...

2260
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
At any point, I could go and say,

2261
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
oh, there was a time in my life

2262
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
where I wasn't drawing comics

2263
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
and I could have been drawing it

2264
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
from a much earlier age and I would be better at it.

2265
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
So, you know, you should feel bad all the time, Gib.

2266
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
You should feel really bad about that fact.

2267
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Yeah.

2268
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Like, I just don't... It doesn't matter.

2269
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Yeah, you're right.

2270
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
It's...

2271
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Hey, you're right. Hey, it doesn't matter.

2272
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Hey, nothing matters.

2273
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Yeah.

2274
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Ah...

2275
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Ugh.

2276
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
All right.

2277
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I don't know. Do you want to...

2278
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
What about voicemails?

2279
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Yeah, let's voice.

2280
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Okay, then let's voice.

2281
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Let me pull it up here.

2282
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Oh, I'm seeing a lot of

2283
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
stupid-looking voicemails.

2284
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
I'm seeing a lot of skips.

2285
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I'm seeing a lot of skips on this...

2286
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Yeah, where did we start?

2287
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Oh, wait.

2288
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I didn't see the ones from last time.

2289
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Yeah.

2290
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Yeah, it's on the second page.

2291
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I think the first one

2292
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
this week is called

2293
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Question.

2294
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2295
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Did you guys watch

2296
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Monkey's Sex Take when it came out?

2297
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
No.

2298
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I didn't watch it, no.

2299
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Although I did see some screenshots.

2300
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I think...

2301
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I didn't go to look for it,

2302
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
but I did see in Discord

2303
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
either a gif of like five...

2304
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Not five seconds, like one second

2305
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
of something, and I'm like, oh, god.

2306
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
And then a screenshot of his face.

2307
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I'm like, oh, why is this happening?

2308
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Oh, god.

2309
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2310
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Good times.

2311
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
No, I didn't watch it.

2312
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I...

2313
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Why would I want to do that?

2314
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Um...

2315
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Okay, next one is...

2316
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Next one is where is Tom,

2317
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
but not where, like,

2318
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
location. Where is in, like,

2319
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
a werewolf?

2320
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Yeah, okay, three, two, one, go.

2321
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Okay, there's no audio.

2322
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I feel like... Didn't we explain this already?

2323
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Didn't I already say...

2324
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Tom said he doesn't want to...

2325
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
be around for the show, because...

2326
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
He's busy with other things,

2327
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
so he's not going to be around.

2328
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
That's it?

2329
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I'm making a...

2330
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I'm making a hand gesture.

2331
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I'm making a... Oh, I can see it.

2332
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I'm making a repetitive hand gesture,

2333
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
which is nature I won't specify,

2334
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
but I'll let you...

2335
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I'll let you all...

2336
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
He's blown kisses.

2337
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I won't say one way or the other.

2338
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Next one is called

2339
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
My Secret Message Part 1.

2340
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Three, two, one, go.

2341
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
He's breathing into it.

2342
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Breathing softly into the microphone.

2343
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
There's no message.

2344
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I can't tell if maybe

2345
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
he is just breathing

2346
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
and there is no message.

2347
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
He is saying something, but it's just not...

2348
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
It's really quiet and not picking up

2349
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
and it's completely unintelligible.

2350
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
It's unintelligible if there is anything there.

2351
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Alright, next...

2352
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Don't do that.

2353
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Next one is Part 2.

2354
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Three, two, one, go.

2355
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
God! Alright.

2356
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Thanks for the message.

2357
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Thanks for the message, buddy.

2358
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Good try.

2359
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Next one is called

2360
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Punished Air

2361
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Sensored Mad

2362
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Three, two, one, go.

2363
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Did I mention

2364
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
that I legitimately

2365
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
saw YouTube

2366
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
delete

2367
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
a comment from

2368
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
the PCP account

2369
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
on a PCP video?

2370
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Huh?

2371
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Like we've commented?

2372
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Yeah, like I replied

2373
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
to a comment

2374
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
on a PCP video

2375
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
and I was like,

2376
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
what?

2377
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I replied to a comment

2378
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
on this account

2379
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
and YouTube like deleted it

2380
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
or like hit it.

2381
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
What was the... Do you remember what you said?

2382
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Yeah.

2383
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I think I like called someone an idiot or something.

2384
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Like, it was

2385
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
something like that.

2386
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Hang on, I'm going to

2387
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
comments

2388
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
to see like

2389
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
held for review.

2390
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
There's no comment from air

2391
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
that's held for review.

2392
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
So...

2393
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
They disappeared it.

2394
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I'm looking...

2395
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
YouTube be disappearing comments

2396
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
that say idiot and fuck.

2397
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Ahhhh!

2398
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
No, we've got to do, we've got to bring back

2399
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
the YouTube replies.

2400
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Remember those?

2401
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Video responses, but like

2402
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
baked into the system.

2403
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I never really

2404
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
engaged with them or even really like

2405
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
back when they were a thing.

2406
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
But I hear people talk about them

2407
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
being gone now

2408
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
and how it made a difference.

2409
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I think the reason they left is because

2410
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
girls with big boobies

2411
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
would have their boobies in a thumbnail

2412
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
or even not people.

2413
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
They would just reply girls

2414
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
and reply bait to get views

2415
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
easily and it's like

2416
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
if you could put boobs into a comment

2417
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
you would get more likes

2418
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I guess is the parallel.

2419
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
If only...

2420
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Yeah, I don't...

2421
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
It's not in our mentions, I can't

2422
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
approve it so like it's out of our hands

2423
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
like it seems like YouTube is just

2424
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
decides sometimes that a comment will simply be

2425
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
gone into the ether and even

2426
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
we don't have any ability to restore it

2427
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
and I don't know

2428
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
what the fuck is wrong with them.

2429
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Well at least

2430
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
you can always send a voicemail

2431
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
with your sentiments.

2432
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
They can't censor you as far as I know

2433
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
on Speakpipe.

2434
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
The next one is

2435
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Happy Birthday Ben You Asshole

2436
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
3, 2, 1, go.

2437
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I think that's a kiss

2438
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
is that like a kiss sound?

2439
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Yeah, I guess so.

2440
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
It's like a smooch

2441
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
based?

2442
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Based? Happy Birthday?

2443
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
So

2444
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
next one is

2445
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
YouTube links and I just, I'm not gonna

2446
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I'm not gonna engage with this

2447
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
and then Happy Birthday

2448
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
There's four Happy Birthdays in a row.

2449
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Happy Birthday Ben

2450
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Happy Birthday Ben

2451
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Happy Birthday Ben

2452
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
and then there is another

2453
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
YouTube link which I will not

2454
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
which I will not be

2455
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
not be

2456
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
engaging with

2457
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
in any way, shape, or form.

2458
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Thank you very much. Then there's simply

2459
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
a link to youtube.com

2460
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
and then there's just the word

2461
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
please.

2462
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
No.

2463
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
No. You say please

2464
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
I say no.

2465
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
The next one is Happy Father's Day

2466
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Ben

2467
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Thanks

2468
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
and then there's one from

2469
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
MillerPrince930 and this one seems

2470
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
to be real.

2471
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So three, two, one, go.

2472
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Please

2473
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
please say that something

2474
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
is

2475
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
something or someone is a popcorn nihilist

2476
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
is probably my favorite

2477
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
meme.

2478
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Favorite Olden

2479
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
semi-current meme.

2480
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I remember the popcorn nihilist but I can't

2481
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
remember what it was about.

2482
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Did Munchy make that

2483
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
up or did he get it from somewhere?

2484
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I mean, I don't know.

2485
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
I feel like it's simple

2486
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
enough to come up with. Somebody

2487
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
who's a nihilist and they get the popcorn

2488
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
and they watch things happen.

2489
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Yeah, I feel

2490
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
like I get it and yet

2491
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
ah, man

2492
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
maybe I don't

2493
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
remember if it came from somewhere. I feel like

2494
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
if you google it

2495
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
there is a, I found a

2496
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
like on Urban Dictionary there's a quote

2497
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
that's like Charlie Brown as a popcorn nihilist.

2498
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Is that from a PCP bonus episode

2499
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
though?

2500
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I feel like that might have come

2501
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
from us. Maybe.

2502
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
That's funny. It's not

2503
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
like a popular phrase. And then, I don't know

2504
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
this guy probably remembers, but you remember

2505
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
that I called, I called

2506
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Mr. Medicare a popcorn nihilist

2507
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
and he

2508
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
didn't understand the expression

2509
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
and he thought it was funny so he put it in his

2510
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
twitter bio for a bit there.

2511
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
But he called it like

2512
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
he didn't understand

2513
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
that I was calling him a popcorn nihilist

2514
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
he just thought I was calling him like

2515
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
popcorn, like an adjective

2516
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
so he said, he put something

2517
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
in his bio that was like the popcorn party

2518
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
pavilion

2519
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
and like I get, he didn't

2520
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
he sort of misunderstood the intent

2521
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
but

2522
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
for a while my insult

2523
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
was in Medicare's twitter bio and then I think

2524
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
he deleted all his accounts and I think he's

2525
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
like dying of cancer or something

2526
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
rip

2527
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
next

2528
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
next

2529
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
do you have anything else to say about that?

2530
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
No, I was just thinking about

2531
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
sewer priest and if that was

2532
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
an original, like a munchy original

2533
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
wait

2534
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
munchy original?

2535
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I thought that was a Jesse thing

2536
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I thought it was like a thing that munchy

2537
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
said that Jesse really liked

2538
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
maybe Jesse came up with sewer priest

2539
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I guess it would fit

2540
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
with like the

2541
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
the

2542
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
sewage video

2543
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Man Sheld Marsh

2544
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Well now I don't know

2545
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
I feel like

2546
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
there were a lot of time

2547
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I remember sewer priest and like Christ Consciousness

2548
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
like

2549
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Christ Consciousness is a munchy isn't

2550
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
but he got it from

2551
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
that video

2552
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
but like I feel like sewer priest

2553
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
would not have come from there

2554
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
No, I mean

2555
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
it just seems like a funny thing

2556
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
to be

2557
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I know there were a lot of times

2558
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
that like Jesse said something

2559
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
that I thought was really funny

2560
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
and then only like a long time

2561
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
later would I discover that like he was quoting

2562
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
something that I had not realized he was quoting

2563
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
at the time

2564
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
so I don't know

2565
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I don't remember

2566
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
munchy ever saying it but maybe he did

2567
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I am more associate

2568
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
that phrase with Jesse but I could be

2569
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
misremembering

2570
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Okay, next one is called

2571
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Le Peeps Units Will Never Be

2572
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Defeats

2573
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
3, 2, 1, go

2574
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
So I was at the protest in Austin

2575
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
about the Supreme Court stuff

2576
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
and at some point during that time

2577
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
we started doing the People United

2578
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Will Never Be Defeated chant that Ben

2579
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
brought up

2580
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Why not make it rhyme?

2581
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
The difference here is that some people

2582
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
actually did sing divided

2583
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
and there was like first time

2584
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
they were kind of confused and then we kind of went back

2585
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and forth between which one

2586
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
was like dominant

2587
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
which all of us

2588
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
to say I got to rhyme

2589
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I got to sing it in rhymes

2590
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
when you did it in Ben saint, how does it feel?

2591
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
They weren't united in what they were saying

2592
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
When I

2593
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
heard that chant I think there were some people

2594
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
around who were saying divided and they

2595
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
seemed a little confused that the

2596
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
bulk of the chanting

2597
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
was defeated

2598
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
The People United

2599
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Will Never Be Confused

2600
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
But we were though

2601
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Oh no, well

2602
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
we're not united, that's how it works

2603
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Next one is Ben's Weekly

2604
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Reminder Play Delta Rune Chapter 2

2605
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I'm playing Mega Man right now

2606
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
leave me alone but also

2607
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I had a good old

2608
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
good old go back

2609
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
and listen to Toby Fox Music

2610
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
for a few hours the other day

2611
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
it's like ah you know what

2612
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
music sure is great

2613
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
mood improved

2614
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
It's okay I guess

2615
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I want to learn

2616
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Rude Buster on the piano, I feel like that

2617
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
would be a good thing

2618
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Which is Rude Buster the

2619
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Delta Rune battle theme?

2620
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Yeah

2621
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
It's kind of like

2622
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
kind of jazzy

2623
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
That one? Yeah

2624
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
I think I remember

2625
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I mean he makes

2626
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
a good

2627
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
He makes a spicy soundtrack

2628
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
He makes a good chiptune

2629
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
No one denies

2630
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
that

2631
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
But then I was going back to

2632
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Undertale and the

2633
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I lost music and like

2634
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
My favorite

2635
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
It's so good

2636
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I might actually replay Undertale soon

2637
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
I've said that

2638
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
when the demo came out

2639
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
when Undertale was only a demo

2640
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I loved the Toriel fight

2641
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Heartbreak, right? It's called Heartbreak

2642
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Yeah

2643
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I love Heartbreak so much I listen to it on repeat

2644
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
for like days

2645
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
It's great

2646
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
He's pretty good

2647
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
at all that shit

2648
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000

2649
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000

2651
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Yeah where are they

2652
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
They're right here

2653
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
We're listening to them

2654
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Next one is called

2655
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000

3, 2, 1, go

2666
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
You know I didn't pick up on the irony

2667
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
of the fact that in the last voicemail I left

2668
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
where I said half the people were saying

2669
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
will never be defeated and the other half were saying

2670
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
will never be defeated means then

2671
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
that the people were literally divided

2672
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
over what they were singing so never mind

2673
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
I was just wrong

2674
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
and bad

2675
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Get picked up on it

2676
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Stupid

2677
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000

02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I can't

2693
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I can't improve

2694
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
on that by commenting on it

2695
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
So I'll just let it stand

2696
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Thank you for that

2697
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Oh boy

2698
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Adorable

2699
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Next one and this is the last one

2700
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
is called

2701
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Redneck Jimmy has a question

2702
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Question

2703
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
3, 2, 1, go

2704
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Howdy PCP

2705
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
This is Redneck Jimmy here

2706
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
I've been a long time listener of the PCP

2707
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
and I'm a big fan

2708
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
but I've always had a question that has somehow

2709
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
been addressed on the show before

2710
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
and I think it's a dagum good question too

2711
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I can't wait

2712
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
What is your favorite anime?

2713
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Now anime, that is some gay shit

2714
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
I mean, what is your favorite anime?

2715
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
That is to say

2716
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
What's your favorite animated bovine?

2717
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Yeehaw

2718
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Well

2719
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
That's all I had to ask

2720
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Love you guys

2721
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Muah

2722
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Muah

2723
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Make out Redneck Jimmy

2724
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Animated bovine

2725
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I'm trying to think of if there even is

2726
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
one

2727
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Well there's the DreamWorks

2728
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Home on the Range

2729
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Cats

2730
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Yeah I guess so

2731
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
So I guess it's them

2732
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I can't think of any others

2733
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
I'm trying to think of like

2734
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Oh, is there like a good

2735
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
animated film about the Minotaur?

2736
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Is there a good animated Minotaur?

2737
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I can't think of one

2738
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
There must be

2739
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Wait a bovine

2740
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
What is that not a

2741
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Well it is a cow but I think

2742
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
giraffes are bovines too

2743
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Kaku then

2744
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Yeah, I think it might

2745
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
have to be Kaku

2746
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
From one piece

2747
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
I mean he ate the Ushi Ushi

2748
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
He ate the cow cow fruit model giraffe

2749
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Oh yeah

2750
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
And he's a square giraffe

2751
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
It's the funniest giraffe

2752
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
ever put to animation

2753
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
I would have to say

2754
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I would have to think that's probably true

2755
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Okay let me see here

2756
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
There's the guy from

2757
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
the giraffe from Madagascar

2758
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
and then there's Kaku who would win

2759
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
You know it's anyone's game

2760
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Okay the four horned antelope

2761
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
The nil guy

2762
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Water buffalo

2763
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Anoas

2764
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Tamaras

2765
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Gars, Yaks

2766
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Coopries

2767
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Domestic cattle

2768
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Sayola

2769
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I don't even know what some of these are

2770
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
These are all

2771
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
That thing doesn't, the Sayola doesn't even look like a

2772
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
What the fuck

2773
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Hang on, look at this

2774
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Look at this creature

2775
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Are deer's bovine

2776
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That has the markings

2777
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
on that and the shadows make it look

2778
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
low poly somehow

2779
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Like it's neck

2780
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
It's like a vertex

2781
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
or a lion, whatever you call it

2782
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
You know

2783
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I'm not seeing giraffe on here

2784
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
So maybe it's not

2785
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
a bovine, but I kind of want to

2786
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
call it one anyway

2787
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Let me see the loot

2788
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
To find out

2789
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
what the classification of a giraffe

2790
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
is

2791
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
It's a hoofed mammal

2792
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
It's a pecorra

2793
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Pecorra giraffeaday

2794
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Okay no, it is not a bovine

2795
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
A bovine is a pecorra

2796
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And then under pecorra there's

2797
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Servaday and then whatever's

2798
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
not a servaday is either a bovine

2799
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
or a muscaday

2800
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I think that's like a deer

2801
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Okay, so bovines are like yaks

2802
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Yaks, antelopes, buffalo

2803
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Yeah, okay, things I normally

2804
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
associate with

2805
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I guess there's the

2806
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
yaks from My Little Pony

2807
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
There's the buffalo from My Little Pony

2808
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Oh wait a minute

2809
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
There's the cows from My Little Pony

2810
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Okay, I don't know any others

2811
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I'm going to say the answer is

2812
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
unicorns and my justification

2813
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
for that

2814
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
is that in the Bible

2815
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
in the Bible

2816
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
the King James version

2817
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
God

2818
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Flem

2819
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
The King James version of the Bible

2820
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
includes mention of unicorns

2821
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
in the original

2822
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Hebrew

2823
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
the word is reem

2824
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
and reem

2825
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
is probably not meant to

2826
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
refer to a unicorn as we

2827
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
perceive it

2828
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
it was probably meant to

2829
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
refer to

2830
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
something else like an oryx

2831
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
or a wild ox or a bull

2832
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
or a buffalo or a rhinoceros perhaps

2833
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
so

2834
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I'm going to go

2835
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
with the biblical unicorn on the assumption

2836
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
that it is either an ox

2837
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
or a buffalo or an antelope

2838
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
if it's a rhinoceros then that doesn't count

2839
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
so the reem, thank you

2840
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
good question

2841
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
yes

2842
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
and here, check this out

2843
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
check this out, it was animated

2844
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
because they made a fucking

2845
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
tile mosaic about it

2846
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
in ancient times

2847
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
that's not an animation

2848
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
you just have to run past it really fast

2849
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
and then it moves

2850
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
that's how they watched movies back then

2851
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
do you think

2852
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
did they ever do

2853
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
a cave painting

2854
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
or a hallway mural

2855
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
where it's a sequence of events

2856
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
and the goal is

2857
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
you're supposed to run down the hallway

2858
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
and it may be blinking

2859
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
really fast and it makes you think

2860
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
it's one image after another

2861
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I feel like that's something someone

2862
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
would have tried

2863
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
maybe would have tried

2864
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I feel like if you're in a cave

2865
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
with

2866
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
a fire in your hand

2867
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
you'd probably slip and hit yourself

2868
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
no, it probably wouldn't have been

2869
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
run into a wall

2870
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I'm thinking it would have been not in like a cave

2871
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
like caveman, I'm thinking it would have been

2872
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
in maybe like a palace

2873
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
of some

2874
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
some king or something

2875
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
like the kings or the emperors

2876
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
like running around like I love this

2877
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
I love this one

2878
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I don't know maybe

2879
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
running around in a circle watching it

2880
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
sort of a diversion or an amusement

2881
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
there's some built some hallway of

2882
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
hey if you run down this hallway

2883
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
and you blink really fast and you look at the wall

2884
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
you can see, I don't know

2885
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
fucking Amaterasu

2886
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
descending from the heavens or whatever

2887
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I feel like something like that would be

2888
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
something kids do

2889
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
more readily than adults

2890
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
which is why tapestries and stuff

2891
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
they show the sequence of events

2892
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
but like

2893
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
snapshots rather than

2894
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
actual animation

2895
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
right, like the goal is not

2896
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
to like, I'm just thinking like

2897
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
cause someone had to think

2898
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
you know that like wheel

2899
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
you look in one side of the wheel and you spin it

2900
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
and you look at the other side and you can see

2901
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
the horse running

2902
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
yeah

2903
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
like that

2904
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
like that's animation

2905
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
and like flip books have been a thing

2906
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
for a long time, flip books are a kind of animation

2907
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
but like before that

2908
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I don't know, maybe

2909
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
did they try other stuff that like just didn't work

2910
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
very well

2911
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
the reason I brought up cave paintings

2912
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I think my hallway idea would probably work

2913
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
I feel like someone somewhere

2914
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
probably tried it, cause what else are you gonna do

2915
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
when it's ancient times and there's no

2916
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
TV

2917
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
the reason I brought up

2918
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
like cave paintings and stuff though is

2919
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
there was a discovery

2920
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
that a cave painting that looked

2921
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
like they had drawn

2922
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
the same thing

2923
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
like over layered

2924
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
and they couldn't make sense of like why it looked like that

2925
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
but then under like

2926
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
firelight

2927
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
if you move the fire from around the wall

2928
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
the shadows cast on the

2929
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
like the indents that they made

2930
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
like carvings into the wall would change

2931
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
what you could see

2932
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
and what you couldn't so they would have

2933
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
like a very primitive like literally very primitive

2934
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
like flip book

2935
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
like left to right up down

2936
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
changing the scene

2937
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
in real time as you move

2938
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
the fire around

2939
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
that's like that they realized that's how

2940
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
they viewed these things

2941
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
instead of with a direct source of light

2942
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
like a flashlight

2943
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
and they got a sense of like

2944
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
ah this is a

2945
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
a little old caveman movie

2946
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
theater

2947
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
wow

2948
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
I've never heard of that

2949
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
what was it do you remember like what it was a scene of

2950
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I think it was like an elephant

2951
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
a mammoth hunt or something

2952
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
some sort of hunting thing where they would have

2953
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
the if you look at the image

2954
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
fully lit

2955
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
it doesn't really make sense

2956
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
what you're looking at

2957
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
but if you have like

2958
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
the candle

2959
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
or like a flame

2960
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
the flickering

2961
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
creates like an illusion

2962
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
of movement and it's pretty cool

2963
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
and it makes sense because they

2964
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
would not have been able to see

2965
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
inside the cave without fire

2966
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
because they didn't have any other alternatives

2967
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
would it have given sort of the same effect

2968
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
that like

2969
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
in a cartoon like

2970
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
you have it's like

2971
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
the character is standing still but you sort of draw

2972
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
you animate them with two

2973
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
frames so like you flicker back and forth

2974
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
between the two frames and it's sort of

2975
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
looks like at least three but yeah

2976
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
well yeah the wobbly lion stuff

2977
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
yeah

2978
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I don't know because I haven't seen video of it

2979
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
but I did read about it

2980
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
they invented wobbly lion

2981
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
pseudo animation

2982
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
I guess

2983
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
they got like Ed Ed and Eddie in the cave

2984
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
yes they invented Ed Ed and Eddie

2985
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
it's a timeless

2986
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
transcends era

2987
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
uh

2988
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
yeah well that's the last

2989
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
voicemail unless someone sent in a last

2990
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
minute one

2991
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
nope

2992
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
we're done baby

2993
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
well

2994
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
this was a fucking

2995
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
vent cast if ever there was one

2996
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
yeah

2997
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
mmmm

2998
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000

I mean think about think about

3030
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
what that could mean is the the

3031
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
potential of $20

3032
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000

3094
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000

3095
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000

3096
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
gonna play oblivion

3097
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
some more

3098
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
okay

3099
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
I have like how many

3100
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
how many things like five

3101
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
the uh commissions

3102
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
left to do I was only really stuck

3103
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
on one you know when you get like yeah

3104
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
but when you get stuck on yeah I know

3105
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
exactly when you lose your momentum

3106
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
when you lose your momentum and go to the next one it's like

3107
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
ah but that's still in my head that

3108
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
I should be doing that one but I think I've got

3109
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
it I think I've I have like

3110
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
what it takes to finish that one and then

3111
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
at least that's

3112
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
done

3113
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
yeah don't know when I'll do it

3114
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I'll try maybe tonight to do a little bit

3115
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
so I'll open up the the the program that's

3116
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
the bare minimum I think it's the hardest

3117
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
part is starting but if the the goal

3118
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
of starting is to open the program

3119
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
you end up starting easier I think

3120
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
opening up the program really

3121
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
is

3122
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
I do when it's like

3123
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
when I just do that I already it's already

3124
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
like okay I did I did the first

3125
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
step I did I've already

3126
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
made some progress yeah

3127
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
it seems silly but it really is

3128
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
like it feels when you're thinking of I've

3129
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
got to finish that you don't want to

3130
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
open the program but if your goal is I

3131
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
got to open the program tonight

3132
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
and then you do it it's like well

3133
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
maybe we'll draw some lines

3134
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
yeah

3135
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
